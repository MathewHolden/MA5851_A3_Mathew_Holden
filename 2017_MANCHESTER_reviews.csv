MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 May 2017,7/10,"Being familiar with director Kenneth Lonergan's previous work, one knew what to expect from his chosen themes and his style. 'Manchester By the Sea' has Lonergan written all over it, and while it was not a ""love"" film it was an ""appreciate"" one.It is an uneven film and understandably polarising (people will love the acting, inspired use of music and the mix of humour and pathos but others will find it overlong, slow and rambling), with a first half that will alienate some. There are many things that impress, especially the acting which is what drives 'Manchester By the Sea'. This said, even if my reaction to 'Manchester By the Sea' was less (like it wasn't for me or intensely disliking it, I would have no problem with anybody saying they liked it, not the sort of person who condescends and shows a lack of maturity and respect to other people's opinions (one of my bugbears on IMDb).Getting on to my hopefully balanced review of 'Manchester By the Sea', pointing out its flaws and merits, as said it is easy to see why 'Manchester By the Sea' is not for everybody. It is perhaps longer than necessary, some of the first half did tend to ramble and could have done with a trimming. In fact, the first half generally wasn't as interesting as the rest of the film, and likely to put people off watching any further. It did tend to be dull and meandering, the mix from flashback to present day not always clear and didn't always go anywhere. It was when the tragedy came in and the relationship between Lee and Patrick when 'Manchester By the Sea' becomes more worthwhile if stuck with.After this point, 'Manchester By the Sea's' only faults are a few contrived moments (like the freezer scene and the at times excessive and out of place F bombs) and an ending that falls on the abrupt side.However, 'Manchester By the Sea' has suitably picturesque scenery and is shot with a lot of atmosphere. Lonergan directs with a lot of thoughtfulness and restraint and much of the script has a good balance of humour (with some genuine belly laughs with Lee and Patrick) and pathos (the fire and funeral scenes will have one reaching for the tissues). The show-down between Lee and Randi is beautifully played and electric.'Manchester By the Sea's' best asset is by far the acting. Lucas Hedges makes a compellingly real character out of one that could easily have been annoying, and while Michelle Williams is underused she also gives a remarkably moving performance. Kyle Chandler also impresses. 'Manchester By the Sea' is Casey Affleck's film though, Affleck is on blistering form and has rarely been better in his tough-talking and also introverted role.Also want to mention the music, giving much intensity and poignancy to the drama with inspired use of pre-existing music. Albinoni has never been more affectingly utilised on film, his ""Adagio"" can be one of those over-exposed pieces of music but here added so much to the drama's emotion that it was truly beautiful and haunting. Another effective use of music was ""He Shall Feed His Flock...Come Onto Him"", the alto and soprano duet from Handel's 'Messiah'.In summary, slow start but sticking with it 'Manchester By the Sea' rewards. Didn't love it, but there was enough to make it appreciate it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 April 2017,8/10,"A whole lot of pretty New England seacoast scenery is lovingly and exquisitely photographed in Manchester By The Sea including the title town. You might even get inspired to take a vacation there after seeing Manchester By The Sea. But there's far more to this film than beautiful scenery.It's the story of the Chandler family uncle and nephew. Lee Chandler lives and works in Boston quite humbly as a janitor when he received the word that his brother Joe just keeled over and died. The family knew this brother had a weak heart and that this could happen. All but one member of the family. The exception being Lucas Hedges his teen son. He's a jock kid, a hockey player with a bit of attitude. But he's quite vulnerable and the father who was played by an actor named Kyle Chandler provided in his will that his brother Lee played by Casey Affleck be the guardian of his kid. The mother who is Gretchen Mol has been separated for years from the father and she's an alcoholic. Another brother has moved to Minnesota.The problem is Affleck left Manchester By The Sea after a mind numbing tragedy of his own that may have been the result of his own carelessness. Casey was and is quite the party animal which was part of what caused the tragedy. In any event he wants nothing to do with Manchester whatsoever.Putting it simply Affleck just never quite got around to growing up. And Hedges is in some critical years and in need of a father, the last thing Affleck wants to be.Writer/Director Kenneth Lonergan took his time and drew some deep and rich characters for his Oscar winning original screenplay. You really think this is a real family struggling with some serious family issues, no actors involved here. Almost like what reality TV should be.The other Oscar that Manchester By The Sea won was for Best Actor for Casey Affleck. Director Lonergan got a great performance that struck all the right notes, where Affleck has to be contained he is, where he explodes with emotion it's the right amount. Credit has to go for his instincts as well.Lucas Hedges was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and I'm sure we'll see a lot from him as well. See the travails of the Chandler family as real as cinema gets."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,,"Manchester by the Sea (2016)**** (out of 4)After the sudden death of his brother, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) must return to the town that he has been running from in order to take care of his 16-year-old nephew (Lucas Hedges). It doesn't take long for the haunting past to catch up with Lee who might just not be able to face it.MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is an extremely quiet movie but it's also a very powerful one. I'm not going to say anything else about the plot as I don't want to give anything away but it's certainly a very deep and emotional gem that has an extremely good story as well as some magnificent and emotionally charged performances. This certainly isn't a movie that's going to have a wide appeal because it's just too depressing for that but those willing to sit through it will find it to be quite rewarding.Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan does a magnificent job with the screenplay and I especially liked the structure that the film goes for. We're given a few flashbacks throughout the early part of the film to give us enough information to explain why the Lee character is the way he is. When we first meet him he's somewhat of a jerk and you can just feel that there's some hidden pain in him. I really thought the film used the flashbacks perfectly to show us what caused Lee to get this way and the film plays out perfectly well as all of the past comes back. We've seen several films deal with a character battling the past but I must say that this here is one of the best examples of a man being haunted and finally having to face his demons.As great as the screenplay is, you've also got some terrific performances to help pull out all of the emotion. Hedges is extremely good in the role of the nephew and Kyle Chandler is terrific in his few scenes as the brother. The always dependable Michelle Williams' turns in another remarkable performance as the ex-wife who has her own set of pain. The film, however, clearly belongs to Affleck who turns in the greatest performance of his career. He talks in a very quiet manor and sometimes he doesn't say anything at all but you can just look in Affleck's eyes and see the pain. In the way he walks you can see the weight of the world holding him down. This is a very emotional performance and a deep and haunting one yet the actor pulls it off without a problem.The film also benefits from a terrific score, some beautiful cinematography and there's no question that the setting is perfect for the story. As I said, this is a mighty depressing film so I can see why some might want to tap out early on but those willing to sit through it will certainly be rewarded with a powerful film with some of the best acting of the year."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 March 2017,8/10,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), his wife Randi (Michelle Williams), and their children lived happily in Quincy, Massachusetts. His brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) and wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) have son Patrick. Lee suffers a devastating loss which destroys his life. Joe has terminal heart problems. Unbeknownst to Lee, Joe left Patrick to Lee as his guardian. Lee struggles to come to grips with the responsibility.This movie does careen from comedy to sadness to anger to quiet contemplation going from one time to another. I do wish that filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan was able to use a sharper knife in the editing process. With more than two hours, the running time could be squeezed down by at least fifteen minutes. The film is allowed to wallow in its sadness. A tighter film would be more emotionally impactful. There are surprisingly broad comedic scenes mostly with the girlfriend and one epic scene from Michelle Williams. The performances are terrific and this has real heart."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,10/10,"Sometimes we have a work of art that doesn't have as its purpose to make us feel good. The criticism from the nay-sayers of this film talk about how depressing it is; that there is nothing happy about it. What this is is one of the most insightful portrayals of a man consumed with guilt that you will ever see. I know little about Casey Affleck, other than the obvious, but his portrayal of a man who feels the burden of inadvertently killing three of his children, is astonishing. Some say the characters are unlikable, including the son of his deceased brother. Well he is what he is. Yes he's a teenaged womanizer full of testosterone and self, but are we to change it for people that don't like him. That makes the issues that Affleck's character has to reconcile after his brother names him guardian of his son. This is a slice of realism, from his having to deal with his brother's death and all that entails (responsibility for the funeral and the legal issues). He is such damaged goods that someone needs to look after him. This is not a feel-good film. It presents us with a dysfunctional figure who is back in the town where everyone considers him a murderer. Could win the Oscar this year. If not, Affleck probably will."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 September 2018,,"A simple story. Almost like a confession. About a man , his nephew and a challenge. Balance between past and present. And Casey Afflek in one of his most inspired roles. Yes, it could be boring and strange and using cliches and proposing a drama who is too familiar and not giving revelations and being more a theater play than a real drama. Significant are the truths from dialogues and looks. The deep solitude and the many refuges, the clash between personal life and duties. It is a not comfortable film. It seems more than it is. Maybe, because the story is too simple and the proposed plot is a reflection in mirror. But, against doubts, it has a clear virtue - the performances. Minimalistic. But convincing. From Michelle Williams to the revelation of the impecable job of the young Lucas Hedges And that is more a good point. But the lead trait of the film becoming, scene by scene, an interrogation to its public."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2017,6/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is an American movie from 2016 and one of the big players this awards season with 4 SAG nominations, 6 BAFTA nominations, 5 Golden Globe nominations (including one win) and 6 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. The movie is really long, almost 2 hours and 20 minutes, and it was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, a two-time Oscar nominee before this movie already (one of these for Scorsese's Gangs of New York). Lonergan has been a more prolific writer than director during his long career, but as for his newest movie here, he was the man in charge for both positions. The title references the city of Manchester and as the addition in the title says, this is not the one in England, but the lesser known in New Hampshire. This is the place where the title character Lee, played by Casey Affleck, returns to after his brother dies. Affleck has been the front runner for a long time this season and until the SAG Award win by Denzel Washington, he also seemed a lock for Best Actor glory. Now the race is pretty much open between these two again. Affleck still certainly has a shot at glory unlike Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. Supporting actress is probably decided in favor of Oscar beggar Viola Davis and Hedges' nomination was actually a bit surprising that he took the spot as his traction seemed to have died down a little bit. But this support for Hedges may also tell us that the Academy likes the movie, which increases Affleck's chances. I personally am not too sure about the nominations for Hedges and Williams. Both were decent, but among the best of the year I don't know. Their nominations may be referred to as coat-tail. Anyway, the performances of these two could hardly be any more different. Williams only has three scenes basically in the entire movie, but these are among the most memorable because of how loud and in the face they are and because of the crucial things that happen. Hedges on the other hand has a great deal of screen time here, but he really only has one moment that is certified Oscar bait (his breakdown).Anyway, looking at the film as a whole, Williams' character is the protagonist's connection to the past due to a terrible accident that happened back then, while Hedges may be his connection to the future. One thing I found very interesting in connection to Hedges was the use of ice. He plays hockey of course, but one of his most memorable moments is when it comes to him being confronted with a freezer after he has the image of his dad lying in there at the morgue as well and he is really uncomfortable with this thought. Then, after the funeral, his relationship with ice is back to normal as he asks his uncle for some money to buy himself some ice cream. Sure it is a very small (maybe even random) reference, but somehow I found it memorable and mentionable. Now about Affleck, I think he is obviously the heart and soul of the movie and looking at how generally I would not say I am a huge fan of him, he definitely managed a good performance that won me slightly over, at least for this movie. Still, I feel that to me he always comes off as a bit lackluster, but by now I have understood that this is just his style and somehow it fits very nicely with Lee here, so I would say that him being memorable in this film does not necessarily have to do with Affleck giving a great performance. I think it is rather that he was a great casting decision and also that Lonergan's screenplay works wonders and definitely elevates his performance. But I am okay with Affleck's Oscar nomination, a win would be too much though.I already mentioned earlier that this is a pretty long movie. It is certainly not for everybody as there is honestly very little happening and it is all about the characters' relationships and interactions, most of all uncle and nephew growing closer together. It starts relatively early from Hedges' character's side as he sees him almost instantly as some sort of father figure, but Lee does not see him as a son. Actually he does not throughout the entire film. One example would be the conversation about a girl staying overnight early on, which is another great piece of writing. Not that Affleck is bad with his delivery, but it's all Lonergan to me here. There is occasionally a tad of comedy too like the scene with the boy and his two girls, maybe to keep it from becoming too depressing at times I guess. This is never a comedy though and the drama is always the most important component. The film uses flashbacks on several occasions. I generally am not the biggest fan of flashbacks, but here it was working nicely because it was easy to see when these were because Chandler's character was in all of these. I personally think this was a good watch. It's nowhere near the best of the year for me personally (unlike for the Academy), but it is a decent character study and probably among the 15 best written films from 2016. That's why I give it a thumbs-up overall and recommend checking it out."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,6/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a moody, slow burn film about a man living with grief. Lee (Casey Affleck) is a maintenance man for various buildings. He goes about his job with little interaction with the tenants he does work for. He lives a sparse life and seems to avoid female company. He goes to bars for a few drinks where he can be prone to violent out bursts. Lee seems like a troubled man and it only through flashbacks we find out what that is.When his older brother Joe dies of a heart attack in Manchester by the Sea, Lee finds out that his brother wanted him to be the guardian for his teenage nephew, Patrick but this means living in Manchester. Lee has an affection with Patrick which we see in the flashbacks, so it is not a case of establishing a relationship with him, more of overcoming Lee's demons. Maybe Joe hoped that looking after Patrick will help him overcome it.We find out through flashbacks that both brothers were married, but Joe was stricken with a heart defect and his wife left him leaving him to look after young Patrick. Later Lee's marriage collapsed after his children died in an accidental fire which Lee might had caused. It is this grief that has turned him into a shell of a man and why he cannot live in Manchester. Even when his former wife tries to connect with him and apologises for all the horrible things she said to him, he remains distant from her and to the world.Director and writer Kenneth Lonergan imbues this melancholic film with some bouts of humour such as his nephew trying to get it on with his girlfriend only to be interrupted by her mother every few minutes. Lonergan also uses pieces of classical music to give the film emotion but at times it becomes jarring.The film succeeds in its uniformly good acting from Affleck, Michelle Williams, Jason Hedges, Gretchen Moll, Kyle Chandler and Matthew Broderick.However the film is gloomy and chilly as the wintry conditions in this film where the ground is so hard that Joe's funeral cannot take place."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,8/10,"In Quincy, the quiet and ruthless janitor and handyman Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is summoned by George (C.J. Wilson), who is a family friend, to go to Manchester since his older brother Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler) has had a heart attack and is in a hospital. When Lee arrives, Joe has just died and Lee makes arrangements for the funeral with George. Then he seeks out his sixteen year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) at the hockey training to tell the news. They go to the morgue and then they head to Joe's lawyer to learn his will. Lee is surprised that Joe has assigned him to be Patrick's guardian. He is reluctant and neither wants to stay in Manchester nor deliver his nephew to his alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) and decides to bring Patrick with him to Quincy. However the teenager does not want to leave his life in the town. While planning Joe's burial and funeral, Lee is haunted by his past in Manchester, where he happily lived with his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and three children until the day a tragedy happened with his family. What will be his final decision?""Manchester by the Sea"" is a realistic film with a tragic and depressing story and no redemption for the lead character. The plot is well resolved for his beloved nephew Patrick but never to Lee, who does not forgive himself for what happened to his family due to his negligence. The direction, screenplay using flashback to explain Lee's behavior and performances are top-notch. Many viewers would expect a more optimistic and happier conclusion but the author chose only a better improvement in the lead character's attitude toward life and this might be the reason of great number of bad reviews. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Manchester À Beira-Mar"" (""Manchester by the Sea"")"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 August 2017,6/10,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a handyman in Quincy. When his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) passes, Lee returns to Manchester and discovers he is listed as the guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). At 30 minutes into the film we discover he is ""THE"" Lee Chandler and at about an hour we find out why. It is a story about operating outside of your comfort zone and moving on, or not.This is you basic Lifetime type of film. Lucas Hedges (Oscar Nominee) and Michelle Williams were not convincing in their roles, especially during their ""crying"" scenes which bordered on so bad it was funny. After 2 hours and 17 minutes, the film ends and you feel like you are left hanging. Lee is a quiet man who can't open up. He likes to drink and fight. I neither hated nor liked him nor any of the characters. Boring with predictable scenes, such as when the hand went through the window. I saw that coming a mile away.The film has been over hyped in an Oscar year that doesn't measure up to previous years' nominations.Guide: F-word. No sex. No nudity"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2021,8/10,"Lee Chandler is made to take on his nephew after his brother dies an untimely death, Lee is incredibly depressed and affected by his past.As the film develops, so does the relationship between Lee and Patrick, we learn why Lee is the way he is, and the events that helped to shape him, and make him such a complex figure.I haven't seen a film like this for some time, it's purely melodrama, but to it's credit, it's very good. Take a tip from Me, if you're in a mood, or feeling down, do not watch this, it will compound your low spirits. If you're up for an engaging, moving two hours on intense character play, you'll find this very good.I had absolutely no idea just how good an actor Casey Affleck is, and that's my own fault, he is absolutely tremendous throughout, he makes Lee a truly interesting guy.The music is a real hindrance here, it detracts from the film, it isn't bad, it's just wrong for the film. Adagio in G Minor, it's a glorious piece of music, but it is so out of place, it jars uncomfortably at a key point.It takes a little time to warm up, and for you to engage, when it does, it's an excellent film, 8/10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 June 2017,9/10,"Of course there is a different saying, some of you may no the not so family friendly saying. And that is what the movie is about. It's a drama and it is really as close to life as a movie can get. It deals with human relationships, guilt, loss and love. There is so much in this, especially with all the things that are not being said out loud, but are shown to the viewer through different means.There is also some discovery to be had, by the time-line play of the movie. We do go backwards and back to the present and therefor things get revealed slowly. And slow is the theme of the movie. While life changing things are happening, it's not like this movie gears up and speeds up. It may feel dreadful to most, if they watch it through and that is what the movie is aiming for. It still has some light moments of course, but overall it is heavy. If that sounds intriguing to you, you know what to do"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 December 2016,7/10,"My theater crowd sat in stunned disbelief when this was over, stunned that it went absolutely nowhere. There were actually audible gasps here and there. The assortment of Kleenex I brought in anticipation of the warnings posted by other reviewers was never in serious jeopardy of leaving my pocket. And this wasn't just my reaction. I attended the film with three women (I'm a guy), and none of them had a positive response to the picture.I'm guessing the tear jerker moments consisted of two emotional scenes that in another picture might have gotten to me, but here were tempered by other considerations. The first was the flashback of Casey Affleck's character recalling the tragedy that destroyed his family. The other was the intense confrontation between Lee Chandler's (Affleck) ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and Lee himself, in which she pours out her heart over her own grief and love for him. A well played scene but unmoving on the part of Chandler, so the pathos over what might have been didn't have a chance to resonate with this viewer.With all that however, I can't take exception with the Screen Actors Guild nomination for an Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. All the players did do a good job, it's just that none of their performances went anywhere, nor did the story. One thing that affected my viewing might have been the sound quality of the picture, as the others in my party also had some trouble with the dialog. So I'm not opposed to a second viewing when this eventually comes out on DVD with captioning available. Even so, the accolades for the picture by the critical intelligentsia escapes me. One plus - the cinematography that captures the environs of Manchester by the Sea is stunning. It kind of makes me want to visit."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,7/10,"An uncle (Casey Affleck) is asked to take care of his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges) after the boy's father (Kyle Chandler) dies.As I write this, we are only hours away from the Academy Awards. Of the nominations the film has received, the one people seem most confident about is Casey Affleck taking home Best Actor. Could it be? I have to say, I never thought of Casey Affleck as a strong leading man. But then again, I hardly think of his brother that way, either, and so far Ben has taken home at least two Oscars. And of the two, Casey is the stronger actor. His emotions range from dour to angry, to completely hopeless, the sort of things the Academy likes to see.The film as a whole is just constant emotion, with just a few moments of humor mixed in for effect. The humor is largely from awkward conversations, but I loved that."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 February 2017,10/10,"Family troubles are a common theme in cinema. Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea"" takes a particularly gritty look. Casey Affleck plays Lee, a volatile handyman. Summoned back to his hometown after his brother suffers a heart attack, he and the rest of the family are forced to confront bad things that happened years earlier.I would say that what makes this movie stand out is the characters. None of them are what one would call ""good"" people. In addition to the irresponsible, short-tempered main character, almost every one of his relatives has hostile side. Seeing what they've been through, it's understandable that they'd be like this. The point is that the bad things that happened in previous years are going to have to force everyone to go through some sort of change.The cast members all put in fine performances. I actually thought that the most interesting role was that of Elise, played by Gretchen Mol. This is the meatiest role that I've seen her play so far (a big difference from her underdeveloped roles in ""Rounders"" and ""The Thirteenth Floor""). But that doesn't subtract from the rest of the characters. It's an outstanding movie in every way. I hope that it receives at least one Academy Award."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,6/10,"I live in the United Kingdom, so I know Manchester, England, it is odd that America borrow our places names and use them for their own (Birmingham, Boston, New York and New Jersey to name a few), so the title interested me, then of course the award nominations rolled in. Basically Lee Chandler (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Casey Affleck) works as a janitor for a property management company in Quincy, Massachusetts, he is responsible for four residential apartment buildings, but he is angry and antisocial. Lee receives word that his fisherman brother Joe (Oscar nominated Kyle Chandler) has had a heart attack, Joe was diagnosed years ago with congestive heart failure, Lee returns to his hometown of Manchester-by-the-Sea, but Joe dies before he makes it to the hospital. Lee is emotionally distant from the entire situation, but must arrange a funeral and break the news to Joe's sixteen-year-old son Patrick (Oscar nominated Lucas Hedges), but Lee is shocked to learn that he has been named as Patrick's guardian. Lee is reluctant, but is opposed to giving Patrick to his alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol), he makes plans for the teenager to move with him to Boston, but Patrick is rooted in the community, Lee cannot comprehend moving back to Manchester. Lee is haunted by the memory of the house fire he accidentally caused that killed his three children, he has no criminal charges, but his wife Randi (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michelle Williams) blamed him for the fire, they divorced and Lee attempted suicide, but he failed and moved away. The funeral is suspended until spring, to allow digging through the ground, Joe's body is frozen in the meantime to stay preserved, Lee is forced to stay in Manchester, but overtime he and Patrick rekindle their relationship, despite Lee's emotional unavailability, he comes through when Patrick has an emotional breakdown. Conflict arises again when Patrick wants to get closer to his girlfriend Sandy (Anna Baryshnikov), but Lee cannot make small talk with Sandy's mother Jill (Heather Burns) to distract her while they attempt to have sex, Patrick thinks Lee is trying to distance himself and get away from Manchester sooner. Patrick's mother Elise has found religion and sobriety with her new fiancée Jeffrey (Matthew Broderick), she offers to allow allow Patrick to move in, but he is uncomfortable and unable to connect with her, and Jefferey being controlling is unsettling. Meanwhile Lee runs into a remarried Randi and her newborn baby, she expresses great remorse for how she treated him during the divorce and asks to reconnect, but Lee cannot find the words to express himself and leaves before getting emotional, she sobs as he walks away, and Lee starts a fight with a stranger in the bar. Lee arranges for his friend George (C.J. Wilson) and his wife to adopt Patrick and take over all the financial responsibilities, Patrick asks for an explanation, Lee admits that he cannot beat the torture of living in Manchester. Following the funeral for Joe, Lee and Patrick walk together and talk, Lee tells Patrick he is searching for a new place with an extra room so that he can visit whenever he wants, the end sees them fishing on Joe's boat, like they used to do years earlier. Also starring Hostages' Tate Donovan as Hockey Coach and Kara Hayward as Silvie McCann. Affleck (Ben's brother) gives a good performance as the emotionally detached man forced to face his past, Williams and Chandler with their time on screen do well supporting, and Hedges does well as the teenager. I will be completely honest, I questioned if there was really any point to this film, it was very slow and at times a little boring, however I can see why it would get critical acclaim and attention, especially at film festivals, and it does draw you in at the right moments with the tragic and amusing bits, overall it is a reasonable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Kenneth Lonergan, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Director and Kenneth Lonergan, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing and Best Director, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Good!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 March 2017,,"We watched this on DVD from a Redbox rental. Affleck recently won the Oscar for Best Actor for his role.The story is much more tragedy than comedy, although real life tragedies also can have their comedic elements. The focus is the character Lee who isn't easy to relate to, then a series of tragedies make it worse, he becomes depressed and can lash out at others with little provocation. Set in and filmed in Massachusetts, the focus is the town of Manchester and the community Manchester-By-The-Sea. Casey Affleck is Lee Chandler, he works a boat with his older brother, he has an easy relationship with his 10-yr-old nephew. The first tragedy is a fire, an accident on a cold winter night, that kills his small children. He and his wife cannot get over this and they divorce. When we meet him a few years later he works as a janitor and fix-it man for some apartments, making minimum wage and living in a one-room basement apartment.The second tragedy is the death of his brother when the son, Lee's nephew, is 16. To his surprise Lee is specified in the will to be the nephew's guardian. The boy's mother has not been a reliable parent and in fact no one was sure where she was.So Lee has to figure all this out, he wants to remain living near Boston, 1 1/2 hours away from Manchester, but the boy has school, sports, friends, and his band that he doesn't want to give up.My only complaint is how crude most of the characters are written, the movie has pervasive foul language and most times family and friends are hostile to each other. But get past that and it is a very rewarding story and Affleck indeed is superb."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 January 2017,10/10,"Seeing Manchester by the Sea twice is a good idea, for a couple of reasons. The first is that when you experience it for the first time, the emotional sweep of it all, how Kenneth Lonergan's script and by proxy his direction with this wonderful cast (some I'd think not all professional, but most of them are of course) goes between high drama and comic touches in the dialog, you get that part of it and it makes it such a rich film overall. But the second time I found I was paying even closer attention to the little details and moments, how Lonergan was fully building up these moments piece by piece, to show how a life is lived by people, whether it's Casey Affleck's Lee or Lucas Hedges' Patrick, or in those small moments with Michelle Williams and Gretchen Mol (Kyle Chandler might seem to get the short shrift, but hey, you got to have one fundamentally decent and straightforward man in this narrative).Manchester by the Sea is all about life's little moments, and if it wasn't 'about' its main scenario, which is that Uncle Lee has to return to possibly, maybe, could-be the new guardian to nephew Patrick after his father's (somewhat) sudden death, I think this world would still be enjoyable to watch in the way a Seinfeld episode would be to watch: we like being around these characters and how the relate to one another, whether it's Patrick and his teenage friends talking Star Trek, or Lee in his... well, sure, he is a dark and depressed man following the colossal tragic mistake from his past that cost him a lifetime. Maybe it's not the strongest example, but what I'm getting at is that Lonergan is more concerned with those little thing that people do and that we all have in common - we're so in our own heads that we forget where the car is, or, even, a paramedic can't quite get those leg-thingies up right away to put the person into the ambulance - those moments that are so small we barely ever talk about them.Because all of those moments of behavior and character between people like Lee or Patrick or Lee and Michelle Williams's Randi (she's not in the film too much but when she is she makes her presence felt like an earthquake) are believable, because we feel like we can be in this world with these characters, the drama is so profuse it sometimes feels like the film won't be able to contain it. It's a film with lots of quiet moments so that when things must become BIG, when we see tragedy strike and the outcome from that, or when two characters meet again on a street and both come to tears over past wounds that can never heal, they make an operatic impact. Lonergan did that with a profundity that was teetering on becoming too bombastic, too operatic, but it didn't get there. Here in Manchester I feel like he's perfected what he's been going for in his features.I may have neglected the actors. Did I? OK - everyone is terrific here, with Hedges sort of the break-out star, but naturally Affleck commands often by downplaying moments so that when he has to act Lee's almost surprised by what he does (i.e. when he bursts through a door to comfort, in his way, a crying Patrick), and of course Williams is top of her career here again. I can't recommend this enough for people looking for a soulful, powerful drama about people having to live their lives despite/because of/regarding tragedy, and whether they suffer through it or overcome it, they're always people we can connect with. Yes, even with the Massachussets accents on parade."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,,"This film tells the story of a man lost his children in the past. His brother died due to a heart condition. Without prior consultation, his brother tasked him with being the legal guardian of the 16 year old cousin.""Manchester by the Sea"" tells how two people struggle to come to terms with both the unfortunate past and the undesirable present. They are both unable to express the feelings, bottling everything up as if nothing has happened. They avoid connection with most of the people around them, even if others try. Their circumstances screams for sympathy. Initially the film is a little hard to understand because it jumps around between different time points. After clarifying the time points up, I find the story compelling, especially the two scenes (one with Casey Affleck and the other with Michelle Williams) that command tears to fall. It is a heavy story of two people trying to get by in spite of life's challenges."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 April 2017,9/10,"A truly bold face story dealing with the stain of humanity. Directed and written by Kenneth Lonergan, MANCHESTER by the SEA doesn't pull back punches and isn't shy about putting a face on depression. Stroking aggravation and laughing at ego; this movie should have won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture. Characters are built and tore down. Very believable script and well acted.A Boston handyman, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), suffers his own demons and battles his character flaws, when he gets word that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has died of a coronary. He returns to the old hometown and comes face to face with another major life challenge: he is named legal guardian of his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges).Affleck is short of tremendous in the lead of a very astute cast that also features: Michelle Williams, C.J. Wilson, Gretchen Mol, Anna Baryshnikov, Mary Mallen, Ruibo Qian and Matthew Broderick.An impressive soundtrack features: Ray Charles, Albert King, Shirley & Lee, Bob Dylan, the El Dorados, Ink Spots and the London Philharmonic Orchestra."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,6/10,As soon as this film hit the cinemas Casey Affleck was being touted as hot favourite to pick up best actor at the Oscars . One can see where the acclaim is coming from . Affleck plays a tortured man called Lee Chandler who is constantly hitting the self destruct button . It'd be easy to over do the showy elements of the performance but this is an independent type of film where everything is filmed in a naturalistic way This is the strength and the weakness of MANCHESTER BY THE SEA . Strength as in we're not going to be watching expected overwrought melodrama and weakness as in a slow burning drama that is painfully slow and often uninvolving . Director Kenneth Lonergan is on record as saying his favourite film is CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and that his favourite director is Kubrick . He does seem a fan of the long take where the camera doesn't do much and the mis en scene is in full view . It's a filming technique entirely different from you'd see at the multiplex on a Friday night but at the same time it makes for a long film feel even longer and add to this a lack of incident and you've got a film that ends up becoming frustrating more than anything
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2020,7/10,"Hardly the most enjoyable film I've ever seen - essentially it is about dealing with the pains not only of bereavement but of life afterwards. Casey Affleck (""Lee"") has to take care of his nephew and this adds greatly to his already quite depressive nature. In this role he excels, he captures all the angst and frustrations cleverly, and at times angrily, engendering a true feeling of sympathy. Lucas Hedges is also good as his bereft nephew, though his youth seems to give him far more resilience to deal with his loss (that and the fact that he has a girlfriend who seems quite keen on keeping him distracted... if you get my drift). As ever, for me though, Michelle Williams just doesn't cut it. I'm not sure if it just her style of acting, her demeanour or what; but I just don't like her on screen. In this she performs in an almost detached manner as Hedges' mother - perhaps it is meant to be intense? The film is totally devoid of joy, but not of hope - and that is perhaps why it still stands out today..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2016,2/10,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a janitor in Quincy living in a one-room place with no friends and a serious attitude problem. His brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) who lives in Manchester-by-the-Sea dies leaving behind a rebellious 16 year old (Lucas Hedges). In his will he appoints Lee as his guardian--but Lee can barely take care of himself. What to do? There are some good things about this film. It looks beautiful (it was shot on location), has great acting by the entire cast and has a pretty good script. Where this drops the ball is the ridiculously slow pace (there's no need for this film to run over two hours) and an overly familiar story. There are many scenes that go on for far too long and introduce characters and situations that add nothing to the story. This movie seems to think it's saying something deep and meaningful but it's not. This story has been done before and this movie adds nothing to it. The ultimate resolution was so utterly predictable I actually got insulted. There are a few affecting moments but they're lost in this dull mess. Also Michelle Williams is here but (despite being second billed) she's hardly in it. She does have an incredible scene with Affleck towards the end that has Oscar written all over it. It's frustrating because there's a really good movie here but the overlength works against it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 May 2017,8/10,"Lee Chandler is a janitor in Boston. He is in a permanently depressed state and nothing seems to matter to him any more. Then his brother Joe dies and Lee is given guardianship of his teenage son, Patrick. Patrick lives in Manchester, 90 minutes drive from Boston. This is an imposition to Lee and he decides to conform Patrick's life and living situation to his own.Wonderful, emotional journey. A gritty, realistic human drama about tragedy, how one reacts to it, recovering from it (or not) and second starts.Well written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan. Particularly impressive is the use of back-and-forth time jumps to feed in background information. The revelation of the reason for Lee's depression is incredibly powerful and is woven into the plot with a deft touch.This non-linearity helps the intrigue and the engagement level.On the negative side the conclusion feels a bit tame after all that came before. I was expecting something quite profound and more closure-oriented but, while there is a degree of closure, it doesn't quite end up as conclusive as I imagined. This said, life doesn't always work out so neatly, so the ending is fairly realistic. This movie is about the journey, not the destination.Superb performance by Casey Affleck in the lead role, for which he won the 2017 Best Actor Oscar. Good support from Lucas Hedges (as Patrick), Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler, CJ Wilson and Gretchen Mol. Hedges and Williams received Best Supporting Actor/Actress nominations for their performances. Matthew Broderick also appears in a minor role."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 November 2016,10/10,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA (2016) **** Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, Kyle Chandler, Michelle Williams, CJ Wilson, Gretchen Mol, Matthew Broderick, Tate Donovan, Josh Hamilton, Kara Hayward, Anna Baryshnikov, Heather Burns. Affleck gives an Oscar worthy performance in a career defining performance as a New Englander handyman, Lee Chandler, who prefers to keep others at arms' length in an everlasting downward spiral wrestling with personal demons that comes to a head when his beloved brother Joe (Chandler) suddenly dies leaving him as guardian in trust to his nephew Patrick (aspiring newcomer Hedges who gives good thrust and parry with Affleck in dynamite chemistry) who also is dealing with his teenage hood and growing pains. Filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan (who has a funny cameo as an insulting bypasser) truly gets at the heart of what it means to grieve in piercing, poignant aplomb while letting his actors get at their inner core of feeling. Gorgeously shot with picturesque cinematography by Jody Lee Lipes suggesting Norman Rockwell's America and an unlikely source for one's personal hellish homecoming. Remarkable in its relative low-key balance and appreciative peppering of much welcome humor to an otherwise glum storyline. Affleck is truly remarkable and his reunion with Williams is one for the film vaults; one of the year's very best films and a must see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 November 2016,9/10,"Some people find a way to pick themselves up from the rubble of a personal tragedy and rebuild a life for themselves. Others are permanently broken, and they die in spirit if not in body. ""Manchester by the Sea,"" Kenneth Lonergan's elegiac and deeply heartfelt new film, contains characters who are representative of both of the above responses. The tragedy befalls the characters portrayed by Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, and the film follows Affleck's character as he unexpectedly becomes guardian of his nephew while trying to exorcise his own personal demons. I've liked Casey Affleck in some things and very much disliked him in others, but here he gives a galvanic performance, one quiet but sustained howl of anguish, that's easily one of the best of the year. Williams gets a much smaller role, but she makes a huge impression, and one scene in particular between her and Affleck in the later half of the movie would justify Oscars for both actors all by itself.Lonergan's screenplay doesn't make a false move. This film is largely about inarticulate people trying to process extremely complicated emotions, and they remain inarticulate -- they don't suddenly express their feelings in nicely phrased speeches in order to bring the film to tidy resolutions. The movie's final point, that broken people sometimes just stay broken no matter how badly others want them to have a happy ending, is certainly not uplifting, but there's something refreshing about how bracingly honest it is.Grade: A"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 September 2020,8/10,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) ,a janitor/handyman, argues with a customer who threatens to call the police, gets chewed out by his boss for chronic misbehavior, and minutes later starts a fist fight with two guys in a bar he doesn't even know. Set in the current day and all happening in Manchester by the Sea. Location specificity is a good thing in stories like this.The scenery would not thrill a travel agent but it provides ambience here. Shoveling snow one minute and bad news the next, oh so cold. Chandler's brother dies and he learns that he has been named in the will as his 16-year-old nephew's guardian. Whoa, that wasn't discussed. Chandler doggedly fulfills obligations despite being enmeshed in a sea of troubles. Something has happened to him that everyone knows and no one talks about, the proverbial elephant not just in the room, but everywhere.Despite those rocky first impressions, Affleck reveals Chandler to be quite even tempered in the main, often quite reticent and circumspect almost to mesmerizing effect, I felt a certain Brando-esque appeal there (without the mumbling). Affleck gives Chandler a quiet nobility and courage that emanates from the sheer act of facing up. Affleck won Best Actor for this. Lucas Hedges as the nephew and Michelle Williams (as Chandler's ex) give good support."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 November 2016,9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Grief. When a loved one dies, we experience a sorrow that is impossible to define. It can take on many different looks through various stages. When Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) receives a phone call, he rushes back to his hometown, but arrives at the hospital too late to say goodbye to his big brother whose years-long battle with heart disease has ended abruptly. It's at this point that we begin to realize there is more to Lee's daily disquiet than we had realized in his early scenes as an apartment complex janitor.This is director Kenneth Lonergan's third directorial effort (You Can Count on Me, Margaret) and in each, death plays a crucial role. Mr. Lonergan is also a renowned playwright and screenwriter (Gangs of New York, Analyze This, Analyze That), and here he displays an incredible feel for humor and sarcasm amidst the ominous presence of gloom.If you aren't yet scared off, you will be rewarded with one of the most outstanding films of the year, and one of the best ever on-screen portrayals of grief. Casey Affleck embodies Lee as the broken man – a tortured soul who doesn't blame himself for the unspeakable tragedy that destroyed his life, yet neither can he forgive himself. As penance, he has basically dropped out of society and moved to Quincy, where he lives in a dumpy apartment simply trying to survive each day shoveling snow and fixing leaky faucets. It's his way of not facing the present while avoiding the memories that haunt him in his hometown.The death of big brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) forces Lee to return to Manchester and handle the endless details of arrangements. He then learns that Joe's will states that Lee is to take over guardianship of 16 year old Patrick (Lucas Hedges). As we learn from flashbacks, Lee and Patrick long ago bonded as Uncle/Nephew. Things are much different now – not just for Lee, but also for Patrick. He's a popular athlete, musician and high school lothario  seemingly unwilling to accept the change brought about by the death of his father, and the long ago abandonment by his unstable mom (Gretchen Mol).The flashbacks serve as the reference as to how this family and these relationships reached this point in time. We also see the devastating event that crushed Lee's soul and left him unrecognizable from the one time life of the party, and doting husband and father. It also explains his approach to his unwanted duties in finishing brother Bob's job raising Patrick, and why much of the town treats Lee as a pariah.In addition to the brilliant writing and wonderful cinematography (Jody Lee Lipes), it's the highest level of acting that elevates this film to the level of extraordinary. Ms. Mol and Mr. Chandler are joined in the supporting cast by Matthew Broderick as Ms. Mol's evangelical husband, CJ Wilson as Bob's former friend and partner, and Michelle Williams as Randi, Lee's ex-wife. It seems like we have watched Lucas Hedges grow up on screen through the years, and he really nails the surprisingly complex role of Patrick. As terrific as all of these actors are, it's Affleck who redefines grief and sorrow and pain. In fact, the single scene towards the end when Affleck and Williams meet by happenstance, is so powerfully acted that it alone should garner nominations for each. It's a gut-wrenching scene that tells us sometimes reconciliation is just not possible.This is a heavy drama set in a cold environment with hard people – at least on the outside. It's not the typical Boston blue collar drama, but rather more the psychology of being a man. There is enough humor to prevent the weight from being too much on viewers, and Lonergan pokes a bit of fun at the Massachusetts accent by tossing in arguments about Star Trek and sharks, and a scene about parking the car. The diverse music of Handel, Dylan, and Ella Fitzgerald somehow complements the mournful Lee  the Humpty Dumpty of Manchester – unable to be put back together again. It's certainly one of the gems of the year."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2017,7/10,The story covers different aspects of tragic loss both with Casey's character and his nephew. The unique ways of coping with loss are interesting to watch for anyone who has suffered a loss. I didn't like the way the flashbacks were handled. If the brother is alive it's a flashback - but it was confusing and should have been differentiated more clearly.Casey Affleck plays morose quite well. But I was looking hard to see if his performance was that good or it's just that the character he was playing was tragic and sympathies are with him from the beginning. In the end I think he didn't show that much range of emotion. His facial expressions are kind of limited. Michelle Williams has a small but pivotal role. She performs very well in one highly charged emotional scene with Casey.It's worth watching with a few very moving scenes.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,8/10,"Loss, intense guilt and shame pervade this complex story that explores anger, grief, fear, hate, longing, uncertainty and responsibility all in a manner of so many flashbacks and flash forwards that the story itself is less important than the emotions it stirs. Kenneth Lonergan wrote and directed this very long diatribe about the emotional life of one young man for whom life seems an insurmountable challenge of bad luck and inappropriate responses. It starts where it ends – aboard a boat in the sea embracing Manchester. Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a brooding, irritable loner who works as a handyman for a Boston apartment block. One damp winter day he gets a call summoning him to his hometown, north of the city. His brother Joe's (Kyle Chandler) heart has given out suddenly, and he's been named guardian to his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). In the lawyer's office, Lee learns the will dictates that he will be Patrick's guardian which is a responsibility he never discussed with his brother; because Joe probably knew he wouldn't have agreed to it. He is told the will stipulates that Lee will provided with expenses for Patrick's clothes and food and that the house and boat are owned outright. Lee explains that he cant commute from Boston every day until Patrick turns 18 but the lawyer points out its expected that Lee relocate to Manchester. He has been left up to $5,000 to help with the move. Lee asks if Patrick can move in with his uncle in Minnetonka but Joe had told the lawyer that he didn't feel Patrick had the same bond with him that he does with Lee. As if losing his only sibling and doubts about raising a teenager weren't enough, his return to the past re-opens an unspeakable tragedy – an ex-wife (Michelle Williams) with whom he has enormous guilt about their house fire, loss of a job tending tenants who loathed him, bar fights, and on and on. Many momentary parts are filled by quality actors such as Matthew Broderick, Josh Hamilton, CJ Wilson, Gretchen Mol et al. Much of the film becomes confusing with the excessive use of fast-forward and flashbacks that it at times become somnolent.The setting of Manchester is the beauty of the film – the content is profoundly depressing despite the fact that we want Lee to change and finally have a decent life. This is a film that provides too little hope to counteract all the tragedy that befalls the main character. It is a slice of life, true, but rather devastating to experience."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 November 2018,10/10,"Casey Affleck deserved an Academy Award for his performance as Lee, a Boston janitor, with a dark history under his belt. The cast is first rate with Lucas Hedges as his nephew; Gretchen Mol as his former-sister-in-law; Michelle Williams as his ex-wife and others in the cast. The beauty of the snow in Boston is quite striking to the view. The film is a series of flashbacks to help explain the story and the relationships. It's heartbreaking tear jerker. Kenneth Lonergan directed and wrote the film. Set in Northern Massachusetts by the sea, he delivered beautiful visions of wintertime in New England. It's really heartbreaking overall. The film will make you want to cry and you need to pay close attention to detail about it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 May 2018,6/10,"Manchester By The Sea is to me the perfect example of an overrated movie that in my eyes do not deserve to win any Oscars. Don't get me wrong, for a drama it's a good movie, or in my case at least good enough to watch once, but it's not award-winning material. Casey Affleck as the Oscar winner for best actor is just a farce. His acting isn't bad but for that year there are way better performances than his one. Also winning an Oscar for best screenplay is something I just don't see. It's a very slow movie, almost depressing but than again that's the story, but certainly not good enough to me to make me watch it again. And that's a thing I would expect from a movie with so much nominations. Sometimes the Oscars are spot on, but sometimes they are just wrong and for Manchester By The Sea they are wrong."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 August 2017,2/10,"That this movie would be nominated for six Academy Awards, and its lead would win the best actor Oscar for 2016, is a sad omen for Hollywood. Not that we haven't seen it coming, since the end of the 20th century. The honors given ""Manchester by the Sea"" only confirm Hollywood's transformation from its glory days to, well, gory days seems apropos. In defense of the writer and the actors in this film (especially Casey Affleck as Lee Chandler), I think they just haven't had good examples to go by for a number of years. With the Hollywood machine cranking out fast action fodder with mayhem and malice, writers no longer know how to write stories for films that have plots and well-developed characters. And the role models for actors now are animated electronic game ""heroes"" whose bodies know no harm or damage as they wield it everywhere. So, who can blame poor Affleck who has mastered the ""emotion"" of emotionlessness? Such frozen face, expressionless stuff in the past was a sure sign of no acting talent. Two words are crucial here – acting, and talent. And then, the occasional outburst of anger. Somehow, it isn't convincing. Nor is it macho. His character's inability to show some sign of life is only outdone by the exceptional dialog written for his role. Such wit, such cleverness, such machismo, such emotion, and such eloquent use of the English language. ""F this!"" ""F that!"" ""F it!"" What exuberance in film dialog. Or, was this supposed to be a foreign language film?Apparently there were no good movies made in 2016, or certainly none with any acting roles. So, the people who make up the Academy Awards went scratching among their output for the year. And this was one of the best of their worst. As for the audience and the significant number (not huge but significant) of people who saw a lot more in this film than the eye and ear can behold – for them, too, we can be defensive. It's very likely that for many, if not most of them, this movie was such an exception in their viewing habits, that it's all they had to compare to the rubber-stamped fast action and plot less mayhem that they have come to see as the standard from Hollywood. So, anything different must be good. This film is supposed to be about one man dealing with a tragedy in his family, and his possible cause of it. Some very great films have been made in the past, with outstanding performances by actors, of people who have had such tragedies in their lives. They show the trauma, emotional struggle, turmoil and difficulties as the characters deal with and get through the heartache. But we see none of that in ""Manchester by the Sea."" If there were honors in films for specific portrayals, this film would take first place for morose moping, depressing drivel, and brooding boredom. A large number of other reviewers (not majority, but large) seem to have the same regard for this film. So, may we still have an occasional good or great piece of film yet."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,,"A sign of a good film is that one wants to return to it over and over for repeated viewings. It is difficult to imagine many viewers who would wish to endure an encore performance of ""Manchester By the Sea.""Apparently, the goal of the filmmakers was to depict an American domestic tragedy. But all too often, the serious nature of the content is conflated with comedy. In the bonus segment of the DVD, it was made clear that writer-director Kenny Lonergan believes that all films should have a balance of tragedy and comedy. Unfortunately, he never found the right balance in ""Manchester By the Sea.""Take for instance the tasteless scene in the kitchen where the young nephew has a ""breakdown"" when he opens the freezer door and conflates the frozen chicken with the remains of his dead father, which are currently housed in a freezer. Or, what about the farcical scenes where the young man is attempting to have sex with his girlfriend and the girl's mother repeatedly knocks on the door? Or, what about the ridiculous barroom brawls where the specialty of Lee is the sucker punch for unsuspecting men. How is it that Lee is never prosecuted by the police? All too frequently, the serious drama is overwhelmed by scenes that are not credible. The result is that it is difficult to empathize with the characters.This problem is intensified by the ridiculous dialogue throughout the ""Manchester"" screenplay. The lines spoken by the actors have no connection with true-to-life dialogue. A cardiologist would never tell a patient, ""You have a bad disease."" Was this another Kenny Longeran attempt at comedy? In order to engage the audience, the film must draw on lifelike conversation. This never happened in the film. Somehow, the august members of the Academy honored ""Manchester by the Sea"" with the best original screenplay Oscar this year. The viewer can make up his or her mind as to whether the scripting was original or completely incompetent.Like so many indies, this film had pretensions of high art, as it contrasted idyllic scenes from New England with the sordid details of the lives of its inhabitants. The main character, Lee Chandler, who works as a handyman, is in conversation with a tenant, who casually recounts a story about one of his relatives, who went out to sea on a tuna boat and was never seen again. Michelle Williams, reprising her long-suffering character from ""Brokeback Mountain,"" apologizes to Lee for the horrible things she said to him. Supposedly, this is her ""big scene"" in the film. But we never hear what were those hurtful words, and we never learn what happened to the tuna boat. Once again, the scripting of this film is suspect.The question arises as to the nature of guilt on the part of Lee for the deaths of his children, following his negligence in not placing the screen in front of the fireplace. Once again, the movie clumsily mixes serious and comic styles, never providing a believable context for the viewer to become emotionally engaged. For example, Lee is given a free pass by the authorities for child endangerment, manslaughter, or possession of drugs on the night of the fire, just as he is never prosecuted for assault and battery on innocent bystanders whom he attacked in bars. He is even able to keep his job as a handyman after verbally assailing the apartment residents. Apparently, it is enough for the filmmakers to casually depict Lee's guilt in the superficial way that he tortures himself and those around him. As he confesses to his nephew, his only philosophical insight is ""I can't beat it."" That is not a terribly profound revelation, and ""Manchester By the Sea"" is not a terribly profound film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,10/10,"Written and Directed by Kenneth Lonergan 'Manchester by the Sea' is the Saddest Film you'll see in a long time. Its such a sad story, that at times, I felt the film subtly celebrates melancholy. But, believe me, 'Manchester by the Sea' is so much more than that. In this Astonishing Drama, Lonergan, with the help of a superlative Casey Affleck, creates a film about life & the tragedies people go through, despite their modest lives. Its a painful story, told with bittersweet humor & at the end, with warmth. I was overwhelmed. 'Manchester by the Sea' follows an uncle (Casey Affleck) who looks after his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges) after the boy's father dies.'Manchester by the Sea' is a triumph, due to its realistic treatment. You're transported into this bleak world of these unfortunate people, who are surrounded by loss & pain. Affleck's Lee Chandler, the protagonist, is a main driven by guilt & loss, who's trying to seek some redemption. His journey is wondrous. Just watching him deal with situations so undeniably difficult, is something to be watched. Lonergan keeps the narrative entirely engrossing & deserves additional brownie points for adding bittersweet humor in the goings-on, despite its shattered soul as a subject. Its a film about human beings & the consequences of life. Lonergan's Screenplay is heartbreakingly beautiful. Lonergan delivers a story about immense pain & yet leaves you warm, by the end of it. And that's no small achievement. Lonergan's Direction, too, is top-class. He has handled this dramatic story, with exuberance. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design are perfect. Lesley Barber's Score is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Casey Affleck delivers a superlative performance from start to end. As the grieving protagonist, Affleck portrays every possible emotion with such force, you'd be a fool to ignore him or not to be moved by him. Oscar calling? VERY LIKELY! Lucas Hedges is another topper. As Affleck's conflicted nephew, Hedges is first-rate & compliments Affleck at every point. The on-screen chemistry between Affleck & Hedges, appears eerily real. Michelle Williams is extraordinary as Affleck's traumatized wife. Despite limited screen-time, Williams is a scene-stealer! Kyle Chandler as Affleck's ill-fated brother, is in form as well. And even Matthew Broderick does a terrific job in a cameo. Others lend great support. On the whole, 'Manchester by the Sea' is Masterful! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 December 2016,,"""I can't beat it. I can't beat it."" Lee (Casey Affleck) The ""it"" of Ken Lonergan's drama, Manchester by the Sea, should be many things in that Quincy, Mass., custodian's life: the loss of two children, the loss of his brother, the loss of his temper, the accusatory glances at him on the street, to name a few of his challenges. Life goes on in little beats, like a serious Seinfeld where nothing happens because everything is happening.Lee inherits his 16 year old nephew, Patrick (Lucas hedges), upon the death of Lee's brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), and thus begins a phase of responsibility that will slowly show him to be a man of few words, much integrity, and a hair trigger temper. The small events like riding on a fishing boat or finding a way to buy a motor for the boat are small victories that bring light to an otherwise dim New England sky.The interchanges between surly teen Patrick and somber Uncle Lee are some of the best of the year, a kind of screwball chatter both meaningful and mundane. These two actors work off each other like lovers with the accompanying joys and sorrows. Likewise, when Lee and former wife, Randi (Michelle Williams), meet on the street, his Montgomery-Clift-like reticence and her Madonna-like passion are marvelous acting moments.Lee's alienation, not unlike James Dean's, finally transforms into an acceptance of his losses, which can be remedied if the stays in Manchester by the Sea and lets himself be loved. He has his start with a rocky but fruitful relationship with his nephew.Affleck is a sure bet for an Oscar nomination. And as for uncle and nephew, two characters who can speak at each other with machine-gun wit will find an immense reservoir of love in Manchester."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 December 2016,7/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of those movies that you watch and you leave feeling touched and see that life is full of pain yet, it's about choices and making decisions. That with love and family despite life being a tough struggle coming to terms with yourself and people is important and a must.The story is pretty simple Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler just your average guy who lives in the Northeast and his life is that of a plumber and fix him up type of a guy. Then one day Lee gets a call to go up north even more after he gets the bad news that his brother has died. During the stay Lee has flashback memories of his time and days in the old hometown of his that being ""Manchester"".To make things tougher Lee has been put in charge of taking care of his nephew who's a real head case he's stubborn and a hormone driven guy who has his eye on a girl. Thru it all aside from a lot of boat riding and sea fishing and memories of Lee's past romance the love and connection Lee makes with family sets him out on a new path of peace and joy. Overall this film is a picture to show what life is like it's tough and a struggle a challenge with change and new journey, yet with love and connection and memories one can get thru."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,8/10,"American dramatist Kenneth Lonergan's third feature, after his career has been punishingly stalled by the ill-fated MARGARET (2011), made in 2005 as a much-anticipated follow-up to his sterling debut YOU CAN COUNT ON ME (2000), then embroiled in the lawsuit purgatory with the film's producers and only would be permitted for a limited release 6 years after, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA impacts as a resounding comeback and it is as good as you can get while toiling away with thumping grief and inconsolable guilt. Lee Chandler (Affleck), a building janitor in Boston, he is the dour and withdrawn everyman type who distances himself from rest of the world and occasionally courts unwarranted bar brawl to unleash the smothering anger, so routinely the film will slowly mine into his profoundly buried tale- of-woe which would explain how he has fetched up to the current walking-dead state, and in this case, it is a helluva calamity, the most heart-rending accident could ever happen to a parent, and he has no one but himself to answer for. Receiving the news that his brother Joe (Chandler) died in a sudden heart attack, brings Lee back to his hometown, the titular Manchester-by-the-Sea where flashback adroitly interleaves into the narrative to refresh Lee's memory (edited with pellucid correlations with what he experiences now) where the concealed secret incubates, and would eventually unfolds in the murky, snow night accompanied by Tomaso Albinoni and Remo Giazotto's ADAGIO IN G MINOR, a sublime sequence transmits a synesthetic frisson which can knock dead its armchair viewers. In Joe's will, he names Lee to be the guardian of his son, the 16-year-old high-school jock Patrick (Hedges), which takes Lee aback, a resultant, seemingly life-affirming uncle-nephew bonding process takes its spin sensibly on veracity and wrestles with both Patrick's suppressed grievance toward his father's demise (Lee's heart condition has been long diagnosed, so that it is more like a time-bomb ticking situation), and Lee's attempt to re-settle in the town on the face of aghast memories and unrelieved penitence, in a pivotal scene, when Lee's ex-wife Randi (Williams) pleads him for forgiveness and reconciliation after she has been finally capable of moving on to form a new family and embrace a new life, but feels obliged to proffer some extrication for him too, but things are different for the culpable party, not everyone can make peace with the past, however rational it might sound, some pain can be alleviated through time but other stays, thus one must brave himself to live with it for the rest of his life, that is the affirming life-philosophy Lonergan tries to pass on to his audience through studiously delving into the realistic double-bind based on an über-dramatic back-bone, which appears to be an abiding mythos in all his three directorial works to date. Casey Affleck finds his footing in inhabiting Lee with a simmering intensity underneath his alternatively inscrutable/apathetic/distraught veneer, a performance is so aptly up his alley (a combo of hang-dog frustration and whimpering elocution) and to call it the performance of the year wouldn't be such a stretch. Michelle Williams, shoe-horned in a peripheral role, but manifests herself as a sniveling and imploring scene-stealer just in one scene, she dangles us with immense curiosity about how her character has gone through the catastrophe, but essentially this film is Lee's story. Lucas Hedges gets a windfall for being cast in a plum role and nominated for an Oscar, which could be a double-edged sword for the future of his budding career, but as credible and affecting as his portrayal is, the credit should mostly given for Lonergan's well-rounded script of a rather bratty teenager; also Kyle Chandler is virtually next-in-line for a renaissance on the big screen after starring a string of high-caliber Oscar-baits, from ARGO, ZERO DARK THIRTY (both in 2012), to THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), CAROL (2015) and now this, all in small roles but his presence looms larger each time. The cinematography is bracingly crisp and un-showy, a modest production design and an unobtrusive score borrows many classical pieces, MANCHESTER BY THE CITY is a contemplative drama in the aftermath of a latter-day Greek tragedy, which elevates Lonergan's status as one of the most outstanding cinematic story-teller currently from USA soil, and one can bet, Matt Damon must secretly rue the day that he couldn't commit himself to this project which would have earned him a coveted Oscar statuette as an actor, and in hindsight, his preference to star in Zhang Yimou's Chinese monster fantasy THE GREAT WALL (2016) now looks like a dumb decision."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 March 2017,4/10,"I'll grant that Casey Affleck was good in this role and was a worthy winner of the Oscar for best actor. It's easy to overlook his performance just because of the nature of the character he played. From the start of the movie he's a lost and wounded figure. We don't know exactly why - it does get revealed about halfway through the movie - but it comes across as obvious. Affleck's very low key, quiet, unemotional and almost monotone portrayal of Lee Chandler perhaps looks undemanding, but Affleck did nail it perfectly. And I don't mean that as a back-handed compliment. I thought he did well with the part. I was interested to know his backstory. What happened to make him this way? That's basically what kept me watching for the first hour. And I did feel a moment of sympathy for him when it was revealed - until I thought: why would he wander off at 2:00 in the morning leaving a fire burning unattended? I won't give any more away than that, but it did make me lose the sympathy I had started to feel for him. But Affleck was good in the role. But the rest of the movie was, I thought, over-rated.I'm glad it didn't win best picture, and I'm a little surprised at the nomination. It really wasn't that good. It's very slow paced. It seems to have content that should be able to bring an emotional reaction out of the viewer - but there was nothing. As the movie opens, Lee's brother dies, and Lee is unexpectedly named the guardian of his 16 year old nephew. He has to leave his life in Boston (not that it was much of a life - he was a minimum wage custodian living in a one room apartment) and move to Manchester to take up that responsibility. He doesn't want to. He has a past life there that he's desperately trying to escape and you get a definite sense that he feels a little bit trapped. But he does try. Give him credit for that. I can't say I felt much of a connection with nephew Patrick - although he really is the one person who shows some believable emotional response to his father's death. And I was a bit baffled by Michelle Williams' nomination for best supporting actress. Not that she was bad, but I didn't think she was central enough to the story to even warrant that.There wasn't enough to the basic story to really make a feature film with - which perhaps explains why it was so often being fleshed out with flashbacks - only one of which (the fire scene) was truly necessary. And the problem with the flashbacks wasn't just the volume, but the fact that it wasn't always clear when you were in a flashback and when you were in the present. But kudos to Casey Affleck. He did offer up a good performance."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,9/10,"'MANCHESTER BY THE SEA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another upcoming Oscar hopeful is this critical darling, from writer/director Kenneth Lonergan. The story deals with a depressed janitor; who's unexpectedly forced to take care of his teenage nephew, when his brother dies. The movie stars Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler and Gretchen Mol. Matt Damon, who starred in Lonergan's last film 'MARGARET', served as a producer on the movie (he's also good friends with Casey Affleck). The film is expected to garner many Academy Award nominations (and it could possibly earn Affleck his first Oscar); it was also named one of the ten best movies of the year, by the American Film Institute. I think it's definitely a film that has to be respected! Lee Chandler (Affleck) is a lonely janitor, with an extremely depressing past, who works (and lives) in Quincy, Massachusetts. His brother, Joe (Chandler), has been terminally ill for some time, when he suffers a heart attack and dies. Lee is shocked to learn that Joe requested he become the legal guardian of Joe's son, Patrick (Hedges). Lee is not ready for this kind of responsibility again, especially after his tragic past (which we learn about through many flashbacks). He reluctantly stays with Patrick, at Joe's house (in Manchester-by-the-Sea), while he attempts to figure out what he should do next. The film is about as depressing as they get; but it does have just a glimmer of hope, and inspiration. This is thanks largely to an outstanding cast, especially Affleck (Ben should be jealous), and awesome directing (and writing) from Lonergan. Damon also did an awesome job producing (that's a joke). It's a hard movie to sit through, and it's pretty light on laughs, but it does manage to find some light in all of it's darkness. Which is always an impressive thing for a film to do. It's also filled with rich character development; and it's another movie that actually feels like you're watching real people, doing real things (which is always an impressive thing for a film to accomplish as well). It deserves all of it's rave reviews.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,5/10,"Most people have escaped their lives by escaping to the cinema. Not every movie has to be pure fantasy, comic gold or over dramatic. This moviemight as well been a reality special, but for reals.Don't get me wrong. I liked it. I liked the feel and everything drew me into these people's lives. Plus, once you – stopping, no spoiler alert needed – find out the background of our lead, you understand the real tone of the movie. As unfortunate as the reasoning/motivation, it does add even more depth to this story.But, damn. This movie was so true; it was hard to watch at times. I didn't need Oscar moments. I required no melodramatic monologues. And that's all good as was the movie. It didn't need to change to my desires. But, it's hard to recommend because of what it unabashedly is.Lee is living in Boston. A sullen life. Sadly, but expectedly, his brother passes on and leaves Lee as his nephew's guardian. But, Lee has a bad connection to the title of the movie and along with everything else, it might be a hard time ahead for him. The movie literally feels like you're watching multiple families, friends and generations live in front of your eyes. That does show great acting, writing, filming and direction. No one here feels fake in the least and least of all, Casey Affleck who might be the shoo-in for the Best Actor Oscar.He did do great. Him, like the setting, characters and plot, felt genuine.But, it's rather long, doesn't take you to too many places but these lives, understandably (but still, overly) depressing and, unfortunately, adds little to my life to take from it. While it's very well made, it's a movie to never see again.And how can this movie, then, get the most glowing recommendation?***Final thoughts: Maybe they didn't show enough of Lee before he bailed on Manchester, but I am uncertain of his appeal. Apparently, he's the most sought-after bachelor in town, but has almost zero charisma. Yes, there's a (spoiler) secret and he's not unattractive, per se, but damn, these women need to join some dating sites. There are partners with less baggage and there are more fish in the sea."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,10/10,"Whenever I see someone being uncommunicative, acting unfriendly or being plain rude, my immediate reflex is to give this person a respectful benefit of the doubt. This presumption of inner goodness is essential because seriously, how many people we know in our lives have gotten such a bad break from life that they can't manage not even to fake happiness? A lot and we know it, life can be tough in the blindest and meanest ways, so no one can be offensive and happy. As a matter of fact, no one can hate people and love himself; unhappiness is deeply rooted in guilt and low self-esteem. This is the core of ""Manchester by the Sea"", Kenneth Lonergan's powerful family drama starring Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges and Kyle Chandler. Lonergan wrote and directed the film and it's simply one of the rawest and most authentic portrayal of the way family ties can be profoundly affected by tragedies, and the way relationships, mostly those where love is taken for granted, are undermined by the very lack of love directed to yourself. But I'm making the film sound too complicated while it's about a rather simple but harrowing journey. Lee Chandler (Affleck) learns about the death of his brother Joe (Chandler), he informs his nephew Patrick (Hedges) and learns that, according to his brother's will, he'll be his guardian until his eighteenth birthday.When this happens, the movie has already been on for one hour, and so far, what we discovered from Lee is that he's a reclusive and secretive janitor and handyman and whom likability isn't the strongest suit. Patrick on the other hand is a teenager who doesn't strike as a very troubled one, pleasantly far from the usual archetypes, he's articulate, sarcastic but rarely in a hurtful way, he's in good mental and physical shape: he's in the hockey and basket teams, he's in a band and he can also afford the luxury of two girlfriends. The reason why he keeps himself so busy becomes clearer as we get more insights about his childhood, raised by a positive father figure who divorced from his alcoholic wife. But Patrick never resented his mother and kept in touch with her.One of the merits of ""Manchester by the Sea"" is that it never really tackles its subject with the usual material, we do have death, alcoholism, loneliness and bar fights, but the characters make it look fresh and unusual in a realistic way. For all the demons that inhabit them, they also act like normal, ordinary family members, skipping some subjects, commenting on trivial stuff, many things are left unspoken but with such a rich subtext we never need to know more. This is a triumph of screen writing and I'm looking forward to seeing Loneegan win the Oscar for Original Screenplay. And it's also a great piece of storytelling, because a linear narrative would have made things clear from the beginning, but for such a tremendous loss in emotional impact.Indeed, we've got to follow Lee for one long and painful hour, ignoring a woman who's obviously trying to make out with him or punching one guy because he didn't like 'his look' but then after one hour, and a few flashbacks, we finally get his ""problem"" and we understand why he's acting this way, he earns our immediate empathy, it's not just an 'attitude'. Never underestimate the many moments of quietness the film offers, they might the silence before storm of devastatingly poignant resonances. And without relying too much on the good old ""you'll laugh! You'll cry"" tag-line trope, but this is also a screenplay that injects a good deal of comedy sometimes, in order to remind us that even in the most dramatic situations, there's room for a little smile.""Manchester by the Sea"" belongs to that so unfairly overlooked family drama genre that produced masterpieces like ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Ordinary People"". There are actually ordinary people in this film with their flaws, their lack of obviousness, so to speak, and on that level, while everyone deserves the praises and I'm glad that both Hedges and Williams were Oscar nominated but Casey Affleck gives one of the most authentic performances ever. It's simple, you never feel like he's playing, many times, he's like hesitating, neither happy, nor sad and I wondered why he picked that angle in his performance. Well, because Lee doesn't know, he's figuring out what to say. An actor who's learned his screenplay knows exactly what line he's going to say, but Affleck has this incredible ability to make a situation feel as awkward as embarrassing as if it was real. And the authenticity he pulls in his performance is so great, you don't feel like watching a film but eavesdropping.I hope to see this film win at least two Oscars, and one of them is for Affleck. But even without any awards, this is a powerful story that will resonate in the hearts of many people who had their tough deal in life. There's no message, no point except that one ""can't just die"", no matter the problems that poisoned your life, if you're alive enough to think about them, you better get busy doing something else and loving yourself a little, because otherwise, you're screwed. Both Patrick and Lee get busy living but their experience allow them to learn one thing or two about life, and so do we. And by closing the film with a shot similar to the first, less optimistic but with a bittersweet quality on its own, Lonergan tells us that there's always a gateway from social exclusion and a time to get rid of our demons and come full circle.And in this melancholy time where it's ""finito"" for IMDb message boards, I dedicate this review to their memory and the great time I spend there. It's been a privilege and it's been fun."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2021,7/10,"In Kenneth Longeran's film 'Machester By the Sea', a teenaged boy living in the eponymous town loses his father; and his care is entrused to his uncle, a man with demons of his own not obviously suited to guardianship. Cue a certain amount of male sparring, as present grief confronts past burdens. It quite sensitively done, although I doubt that any modern teenager makes out to 'Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts', great though that song is. But the uncle's inner melancholia is worn a little bit too obviously on his sleeve, and the plot is underwhelming, as the two men eventually, and predictably, learn to get along, without any major drama on the way. I quite liked the movie, and soundtrack aside, most scenes felt convincing and not overplayed. But it never goes anywhere you wouldn't expect it to."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 April 2017,7/10,"I was quite curious to see Manchester by the Sea which was considered one of the best movies of the year and received two Academy Awards. Overall I was quite disappointed (relative to the expectations and the fuzz) and I believe that the success of this film is due merely to the dry season that was 2016 for the American film industry, with a selection missing movies that were both ambitions and well made, and with criteria for promotion and selection as nominees dominated by non-cinematographic arguments.There are certainly many reasons for the film to be interesting. The script is well written (director Kenneth Lonergan has authored several smart scripts beyond the ones of his own movies) and builds carefully the characters while gradually dissipating the fog around their past and the reasons they behave as they do with a mix of the progressing story and flash-back scenes interleaved in a clever manner. The atmosphere of the small town by the sea not far from Boston is well described, the characters that populate it are credible, and the cinematography is so poignant that it makes us feel the cold, the wind, the proximity of the sea. All these cannot however hide the thin content of the story - a mix of a tutoring story of a teenage boy orphaned by his father and of guilt caused by the responsibility of a terrible tragedy in the past of the uncle assuming the parenting. One way or another all characters in the story are marked bu grief - how they cope with it and what are the consequences of the disappearance and absence of the dear ones differs. The problem is that the story is thinner than the materials it is built from, and the characters are less interesting from the moment we understand their stories. I happened to see this film three days after 20th Century Women which was also bringing to screen a piece of life including the story of coming of age of a teen boy. What a difference between the characters in the two movies, between the rich and interesting universe of Mike Mills' film and the dry and empty world of the world described by Kenneth Lonergan! What about acting? A lot was written and said about Casey Affleck's performance which earned him the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award. I appreciate his acting of a man who hardly survives the grief, but there is nothing unexpected or interesting in the character. He is under shock, he has accesses of violence, he tries to do best to help his nephew, but is and will be forever marked by the tragedy of his life. All these are obvious. Are these worth an Academy Award? I doubt. Young Lucas Hedges provides actually a good counterpoint with some unexpected but well placed humor for a teenager who sometimes acts as the adult in the difficult relationship with his uncle. The rest of the cast does well, with Michelle Williams being wasted talent in a film that is not bad, but is certainly overrated and in many moments simply boring."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2016,9/10,"If it wasn't already clear with films like Gone Baby Gone, Out of the Furnace, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, or The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Casey Affleck is a world class actor. I've always found his work to be incredibly compelling, considering he doesn't promote himself as much as other acclaimed actors. Perhaps no performance of his is as impressive as the one in Manchester by the Sea.I find it difficult sometimes to sit down for a movie that I know is depressing and tackles tough subject matter. But I usually come out of it thankful that I saw the film anyway. That was certainly the case with this one. Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler, who is forced to be the guardian of his nephew after his father passes away. Affleck, Michelle Williams, and maybe even Lucas Hedges deserve some recognition come awards season. There are a few similarities to this and a film from earlier this year, The Light Between Oceans. Both deal with tragedy and how/if a family can recover from that. But Manchester by the Sea chose the more effective route of storytelling by not shoving emotions down the audience's throat. Even coming from someone who likes The Light Between Oceans, the more effective directing style would be to let the emotions come out naturally. Kenneth Lonergan's directing in this film is nothing short of sensational. The film takes its time and lets character dynamics and roles play out so that when the time comes to push emotion to the forefront, it's warranted.Lonergan's unique style also showed in the calmer moments as well. In tragedy, we often don't think about all the little tasks you have to do after someone dies, to keep things afloat. Figuring out funeral arrangements, calling everyone, the food arrangements, or even the car rides to and from the hospital are all things Lonergan devoted time to. And it only added to the realness, which in turn made the film all the more heartbreaking. I don't cry easily in movies, but when actor's performances transcend the screen and bring you along with their emotional journey, it's hard to hold back. Affleck and Hedges hold a great comradery and bond, even through turmoil, but it was Williams and Affleck that destroyed me. Williams doesn't get a ton of screen time, but there's one particular scene with Affleck that was just devastating. Everything in the film was leading towards that moment and it cemented the film among the best of this year.Manchester by the Sea is not an easy watch, and Lonergan doesn't pull any punches in his directing. But if you love great acting and a well- thought out script, than this is the feature to keep any eye out this awards season. I'm glad Casey Affleck is finally getting his due, his performance of a man trying to close himself out of all the grief, is astounding. It may be the best performance of the year.+Affleck & Williams are heartbreaking+Lonergan's style uniquely suits this story+Doesn't force emotion, but when it hits, it hits.9.3/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 December 2016,,"This film broke me. I really didn't know what it was going to be about aside from the ""Casey Affleck takes on his brother's kid"" short plot summary. I did watch the trailer and I should have realized that it was very misleading. It's oh so, so very sad. There's humor, but all of it is clouded in somberness. And it's well deserved. There's a sequence somewhere in the last section of the first act that I did not see coming. I loved its use of flashbacks and the way it intercut them with the present. There's such a formulaic, unoriginal premise somewhere in the film, but the film manages to really stand apart on its own as a challenging, deeply felt piece of work. The actors deliver and then some. Do I think this was a particularly difficult role for Casey Affleck? Not really. Does that take away from the effect of his performance? Not at all. He's so amazing at playing these troubled, internal characters and he more than delivers. It's a very quiet role and I could see many actors not doing it justice. I do feel more confident in saying that he will not win the Oscar. It's just not the type of performance that will go all the way. I'm just grateful that he is looking sure for a nomination. It's the kind of performance that only really resonates and has the enormous power when you leave the film and are able to reflect on it. Definitely different than what I had expected, in all the right ways."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,,"A poignant, affecting & gut-wrenching drama about the voids that never fill & the scars that never heal, Manchester by the Sea is an honest depiction of loss, grief & trauma that's handled with care, told with patience & brought to life with sincerity and is further uplifted by evocative performances from its committed cast, especially Casey Affleck who is an absolute revelation in his given role.The story of Manchester by the Sea takes place in the titular town and follows a quiet, reserved & estranged man whose life takes a drastic turn after he receives the ill news of his brother's death. Obliged to return to the place that harbours a past trauma, things get even more complicated for him when he finds out that he's supposed to be his nephew's guardian and struggles with the new responsibility.Written & directed by Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is my first stint with his works and it is, by every means, one heavy stuff that's dense with emotions. His direction exhibits remarkable restraint as Lonergan allows the plot & characters to breathe & unfold at their own pace. The story is character-driven and relies on their emotions to articulate the context of the given scene but it is exquisitely portrayed.Another highlight is the care & attention given to its characters, for nearly everyone is embedded with meaty arcs & believable personas plus their course of action maintains a close proximity with real life behaviour. Lonergan understands that everyone grieves in their own ways and illustrates it with precision. And the slow reveal of the magnitude of the event that haunts our protagonist is bound to shatter its audience.The technical aspects are aptly executed & extremely grounded and never tries to overshadow or take the focus away from its characters. The slowburn narration is fitting, given its premise, but it will still frustrate a few viewers with its stillness & silent ruminations. Camera-work is mostly static, Editing is a mixed bag, for its plot could've been leaner & a bit better paced, while its background score has a muted presence.Coming to the acting department, Manchester by the Sea features a reliable cast in Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Lucas Hedges, Kyle Chandler & C.J. Wilson, with Affleck impressing the most in what's undeniably his career-best performance. Hedges plays his part brilliantly. Williams doesn't get enough screen time but there is one moment where she & Affleck single-handedly elevate the entire picture to a whole new level with their jaw-dropping act.On an overall scale, Manchester by the Sea is an emotionally scarring & profoundly upsetting film that is capable of tearing your soul apart with its authentic portrait of guilt, trauma & inner conflict. Powerfully moving at times, retaining the human aspect throughout, and culminating on a bittersweet note, this sad, tragic, painful, haunting & heartbreaking tale of a wrecked, tortured, wounded & devastated man's life isn't an easy sit but for those who can patiently connect with it, it may turn out to be a cinematic experience that's as rewarding as it is humbling."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 December 2018,6/10,"Manchester by the Sea hits you on practically every emotional front. It's a powerfully dramatic story that sometimes feels like it's trying its hardest to make you cry. This movie feels realistic, but it also drags on a bit too long and the ending isn't very satisfying. I can see why this film got so much critical acclaim, even if I didn't love it as much as others."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,8/10,"""I can't beat it. I can't beat it."" Lee Chandler (Affleck) is a single man who spends his days repairing items in apartment buildings. He is content being alone, but when he gets a phone call telling him that his brother has died his life is changed. He is then told that in his brother's will Lee is to become the guardian of his brother's son Patrick (Hedges). This brings back Lee's tortured past and he is stuck between wanting to escape his past, and following his brother's final wish. This is first and foremost a good movie, but at the same time this is a movie that won't likely be viewed more than once. The movie starts out depressing and melancholy, and gets more and more somber. The movie really focuses on the emotions of Lee and you both hate and feel sorry for him. Affleck's performance in this is incredible, but that said this is just not a movie I can fully recommend, based solely on the content and way it makes you feel. Overall, a very good movie but one that I would compare to Room. Great acting and a very well done movie but one that will stick with you and not in a way you want. I do give this a B+, but don't think I'd watch it again."

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016) is a powerfully acted and superbly written drama. It tells a very simple yet tragic story, and there is no redemption or whatsoever at the end. Acting was great by everyone, with exceptions of course of 3 leads - Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams - they were truly amazing. There are some powerful and tragic scenes at the mid of the movie and the whole tone of and the feeling of this movie is great. Music was also involving. Writing - superb.Overall, ""Manchester by the Sea"" tells a simple yet powerful story and does that in not a very linear way. Still you won't be confused, rather then absorbed into this movie. Its a really good one."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 May 2020,7/10,"For a picture who's titled is supposed to represent a relaxing location full of scenic beaches and vista points. 'Manchester by the Sea' is truly a grim watch. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, the film tells the story of Lee Chalder (Casey Affleck) a depressed man being asked to take care of his teenage nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) after the boy's father Joe (Kyle Chandler) falls ill. Without spoiling this movie too much, the series of inserted semi unannounced nonlinearly flashbacks can be a bit confusing and annoying. Especially when the sequence goes a little too long such as Lee talking to Joe's lawyer about the guardianship. It's very awkward to see Chalder's mind drift off while looking out of the window with the long pause of no interrupting dialogue. It seemed somewhat a clichés way to cut to a very long flashback about what happen to his own children long ago. The whole past exposition dump with the police really add to the length that I nearly forgot what was happening presently. Along those lines the beautiful music from composer Lesley Barber that goes with it is very angelic loud, to the point that it's ear piercing. It's felt very forceful preachy and gimmicky at times. Don't get wrong not all the flashbacks dramatic effects are bad. I kinda like the slow motion far distance wide cinematography shots with muted people talking in the background. It felt somewhat dream or nightmare like as if feeling disconnected and alone. An out of the body experience. As for current day; most of it was also well shot. I love how the location is framed with everything looking so cold and dead due to the winter months when Lee arrives back in Manchester. It reminds him so much of the fatherhood, soul mate and human connection that he lost over the years. Then how the city is framed during the spring month where everything is thawing. It represented the character slowly overcoming his grief in order to find his humanity again. The visuals are far clearer and stronger to understand than any of the dialogue being said. I mean that. Characters are constantly sounding inarticulate. It doesn't help that the thin Boston accent with the slangs is equally hard to understand at times. I get that they were going for realism in order to show Lee's sense of awkwardness and difficultly in reconnecting with others but gees it was somewhat irritating even with the humor. It takes forever for people to speak the simplest of little things. I know that a lot of people are giving Affleck a lot of praise, but the truth is; I found his acting not that special. Casey here is pretty much playing his standard role: the not much for words somewhat selfish jerk to some degree sympathetic recluse full of self-pity. I felt I was watching 2006 'Lonesome Jim' yet again. Regardless of my opinion, I didn't mind his Oscar win. While, I get that the decision to give Affleck the award has caused controversy due to the sexual harassment allegations brought against him in 2010, but let's note that the award is based on an actor's performance in a film, not if they were a good person in their personal life. As for the supporting cast. Michelle Williams as Randi, Lee's ex-wife was really good. That scene on the street where Lee & her character talk about the blame and the grief of their own personal loses was compelling as hell. You can really tell that Randi feels guilt for the way she treated him and desperately wants to apologize so Lee can regain some semblance of a life again. It's very powerful. It's kinda sucks that Williams is only in ten minutes of the film. I really thought she would be in more scenes; seeing that Michelle is on the movie's poster. Regardless most of the supporting cast screen time is spent with Hedges. He was fine as Patrick despite the character having subplots that felt like filler such as dealing with his awful multiple relationships. I really couldn't care less about those selfish actions. Nevertheless, I'm not going to freak out over frozen chicken as I found the subplot of the son trying to reunited with his mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) somewhat compelling even if Matthew Broderick's comedic appearance as the fiancé Jeffrey did took some viewers out of the film. It was very interesting. I also love the subplot of Lee & Patrick having to find money to fix Joe's boat. Despite the odd Deux Ex Machina with expensive collection of guns solution, I kinda dig the metaphor of them trying to fix their relationship and hold something that can remind them of good times with the family. After all that's what Joe's last act was about. It was an attempt to have Lee reengage with the world. That's what the movie should be about not about the kid can get laid. At least that was the ideas that producer Matt Damon & John Krasinski wanted. Thank goodness they kept that and cut the whole CGI whale scene idea. That would had been cheesy. Overall: This movie is certainly not a popcorn flick. It feels more like a character study and like that should be examine. In spite of the movie leaning toward a more cynical end. Many of the themes about seeking closure for past mistakes and dealing with loss are very relatable. It's worth checking out in Minnetonka, Minnesota and elsewhere."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 December 2017,9/10,"Kenneth Lonergan's film is completely without artifice, a calm and melancholic documentary almost. of a very common but very tragic life - the disaster in the middle of the film is a shocker that immediately makes the film monumentally interesting.Lee Chandler is a lonely man with difficulties, he can't keep jobs because he is too honest, he frequently gets into trouble in bars as he easily loses his temper, and he has the same worried and almost depressive look throughout the film - he only laughs in flashbacks.It's a sad story but not very remarkable, almost common, like a novelletta by Anton Tchekhov, aggrandized to a film almost too long, and like ""The Lady with a Toy Dog"" it has no actual end. It's like a chapter out of a vast book of just ordinary life.But it is beautifully photographed, and the music is expertly chosen and very variable. There is an exquisite choice of Gluck, Albinoni, Handel and others which raises the film on proper occasions. There are some dominating hospital and funeral scenes, but the finest scenes are the boat trips, which also raises the film to an upper level. The worst part of the film is the conversation - there is a ""fuck"" almost every minute, and the general diction is awful - like in most modern films you can't really hear half of what they are saying.On the whole, it's an interesting and very moody film, but you would not like to see it ever again."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,,"Some movies come with alerts that you should not be late. In most cases these are suspense thrillers where the opening scenes carry important clues. I would say the same for MBTS, but for a different reason. The opening scenes are important foundations for connecting with the emotions of the movie later on. The two establishing scenes show the protagonist Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) a decade ago, and now.The movie opens with fishing boat ""Claudia Marie"" which becomes a crucial motif through the entire movie. At the idyllic coastal waters of Manchester three happy people, Lee with his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) and nephew Patrick (Ben Obrien), are enjoying a fun day. As the father is controlling the boat at the bow, what we see is uncle and nephew at the stern fishing. This immediately reminds me of a fishing scene in Hemmingway's ""Islands in the stream"" (movie made in 1977 starring George C. Scott). While that scene is between father and son rather than uncle and nephew, the deep emotional bond is similar.The other, much longer, establishing scene shows Lee at present time, in Boston, a lowly janitor cum handyman. In unhurried scenes of Lee working at various households interacting with various customers (an everyday man, a slightly horny woman, a bitchy housewife, among others), he is shown to be a man with little emotions, but tending to be impatient and rude. Only late in the movie that we hear him confess, in deep anguish, that ""there's nothing there"", inside him, that is. The movie essentially shows us what happened to cause this devastating transformation, through the linear narrative of Lee going back to Manchester upon Joe's death, as well as flashbacks along the way.As denoted in my summary line, this is a very ordinary story. While the tragic event that changed Lee is revealed somewhere around the midpoint of the movie, this is not intentional suspense but rather story-telling artistry, to deepen the audience's empathy. As one incidental characters says, this sort of thing happens to millions of people all the time. And then, just like the events, all the characters are completely ordinary people. In this lies the greatness of this movie.Joe's death from a known disease, while sad, is not unexpected. In fact, he has painstakingly made arrangements in his will to have Lee come back from Boston to Manchester to be now 16-year-old Patrick's (Lucas Hedges) guardian, but without telling Lee. As Lee, upon hearing this, immediately tells the puzzled lawyer, Joe knew that Lee would refuse if he was told beforehand. The brothers love and understand each other. While Lee loves Patrick (fully reciprocated), his own pain makes it impossible for him to face Manchester again, after his own family tragedy that took away the lives of his two children and estranged his wife (Michelle Williams), a tragedy resulting from his own negligence.The story is mainly on the relationship between uncle and nephew, how they cope with the grief and how they try to handle their problem, as Patrick understandably does not want to leave his life in Manchester. You can almost call this bitter sweet. The opening scene at the Claudia Marie (which is repeated a couple of time with small variations throughout the movie) has cemented their bonding from the outset. They fight over many things, big and small, and yet it is always clear that their mutual affection never suffers.There is a large cast of support characters with varying importance. Sturdy as a rock is the family friend George (C.J. Wilson) who Lee thinks should have been made Patrick's guardian. There is Joe's long-estranged alcholic wife (Gretchen Mol) who unexpectedly resurfaces and seems repentant. My own favourite is Patrick's girlfriend (one of his two girlfriends, to be precise) played by Kara Hayward who was one of the coolest 11-year-olds ever seen in a movie: ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012). There are many others who all give solid support.But in the end, it is the three Oscar nominees. The results are only 15 hours away and Affleck is very likely to add Oscar to the proliferation of awards he has already collected. Although unlikely to win against such strong field, Hedges has his well-deservedrecognized with the nomination. Williams has very little screen timr half of which as flashback. But one scene in the end portraying a very ordinary woman reacting very normally to circumstances is absolutely heart-breaking securing her nomination. Four people (Viola Davis, Naomie Harris, Nicole Kidman, Michelle Williams) have secured Best Supporting Actress nominations in all four major awards (Golden Globe, Critics' Choice, BAFTA, Oscar). So far, Davis has swept the other three."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,8/10,"First of all it was not based on any book, but you can see that book kind of effect in the storytelling. One of the best original screenplay, I won't be surprised if it wins the Oscars for that. I actually struggled in the opening to catch the storyline. Because the past and present overlapped while sharing the presentation alternatively. But it was about the present with flashbacks popping out regularly to join the tale by comparing/revealing the earlier events. So after few occasions, I got used to it and enjoyed my rest of the watch.I always love good drama films. But not all the drama films I have seen are the masterpiece. So despite it was received so well from all the quarters, I kept my expectations low. The initial parts were okay, but its only during the final stage I begin to like it more. Especially the Casey's performance. I have seen him in many great films, in the big roles, but I think this one is his best, particularly from the positive perspective of the character he had played. Looks like the decade belongs to Affleck brothers. They have given great performances recently and acted in the great films that will be remembered for a long time.This is the story of the Lee, a man who works as a janitor. One day he receives a call that his brother had passed away as he was suffering from the illness for a some time. Since his brother got divorced, all the responsibility comes under his belt, including his teenage son. Now those two struggles to join the force, but somehow manages all. Meanwhile, till the conclusion, the Lee's life before that point were disclosed to us, like how he struggled in his own life before coming to end in the current situation.I could be wrong, but Casey Affleck's going to win the Oscars for his performance. Andrew Garfield is the other guy standing between his chance. I'll be happy whoever wins between them. I like Michelle Williams, but her Oscars nominee is meaningless. What, she appeared for 10-15 minutes in the entire narration which can be tagged as a guest appearance than a full fledged role. This is a fine drama, one of the year's best, deserved all the Oscars nod it got. Surely worth a watch and I recommend it.8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 August 2021,1/10,"How many times now have I watched a multi award winning, highly acclaimed movie that bored me to death? 'Manchester by the Sea' is such a movie and the very reason why I generally avoid watching dramas.'Manchester by the Sea' is beyond boring. The film is about...erm, well, it's about a teenager who goes to live with his uncle after his dad died. If the non-linear storytelling doesn't confuse you, the very fact that this movie received almost 400 award nominations certainly will. Casey Affleck won the Oscar for best actor, but there was nothing special about his performance. Instead, it was utterly bland.When Lee's (Affleck) brother dies, he is surprised to learn he is to be the guardian to Joe's son, Patrick, whose only interest seem to be having sex with girls when he is supposed to be doing homework. Lee's back story is told in such a way that I didn't really care about him. There were moments when I felt like hitting the forward button just to get the movie to go somewhere, but sadly it never did.Even the background music was too sentimental and quite honestly, overbearing. This film was just talk, talk, talk, talk, and more talk, talk, talk, talk....and slow as hell. There literally was NOTHING happening here. I mean, what the hell??? Am I missing something here? This was a depressing movie filled with unnecessary foul language - and dreadfully slow. I hated it. To all those critics who love this movie so much, please try to smile sometimes! Geez, this was completely and utterly boring. I'm - thankfully - going to forget this very soon. There's nothing here to remember anyway...This yawner of a movie received 392 award nominations, winning 129 including 2 Oscars. It is beyond comprehension. Why??? Help me understand how this was not boring and supposed to be entertaining??"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 August 2020,6/10,"This film is entirely carried by the weight of its actors, who deserved more Oscars than they got. The rest of the film - cinematography, settings, soundtrack, etc. - is decent but not really significant. It has a visibly straightforward and ""realistic"" look that feels absorbing but also a bit low-budget. The plot is interesting in the way that it shows a lot of flashbacks without the audience realising it, but it can also feel a bit forced at times."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 August 2017,6/10,"Placed in charge of his teen nephew after his brother passes away, a morose handyman confronts inner demons and reevaluates his life in this downbeat drama starring Casey Affleck. The film gets off to a solid start as we witness Affleck's humdrum existence and the moody residents who he has to deal with. As the film progresses though, it adopts a stream of consciousness narrative style, flipping back and forth between Affleck's memories and the present day as he processes his brother's death and his new role in his nephew's life. This provides an emotional wallop at one point as we discover just what happened to his doting daughters, but generally speaking, the flipping back and forth in time is unhelpful, subtracting from the immediacy of the drama unfolding. The film also grows repetitive as the same issues are debated between uncle and nephew time and time again. There are some really good touches late in the piece though (Affleck imaging his daughters; a confrontation with Michelle Williams) and the entire project is shot with thought and consideration; the way Affleck is only ever visible in the background when we first see the grown-up nephew at an ice rink works very well. Still, it is hard not to expect a little more from an Oscar winning film and though solid a movie as it is, it would be interesting to see the film play out in chronological order instead."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,9/10,"Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan hadn't made a movie for 11 years before Manchester by the Sea, a sombre drama that began to draw attention during a critically successful festival run. Receiving acclaim for You Can Count On Me back in 2000 before moving on to Margaret in 2005, the latter film spent five years in post- development hell due to a lack of budget and multiple lawsuits before limping into theatres in 2011. Such a frustrating experience would normally cause a director to fade into obscurity, but Lonergan has returned with a bang with one of the finest films of the year to prove that he is a film-maker of unfathomable potential.The withdrawn Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts, spending his days fixing leaky pipes, taking out the garbage, shovelling snow, and generally taking whatever s**t the tenants of the apartment block he works in dishes out. Living in a tiny, one-bed room, Lee is quiet but prone to violent outbursts, spending most nights drinking away whatever sorrows rest on his shoulders and starting fights with anybody who looks at him the wrong way. One day, he receives a phone call and is informed that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, coincidentally sharing the same surname as his character) has suffered a heart attack. By the time he arrives in his hometown of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Joe has passed away, and Lee is tasked with arranging the funeral and putting his brother's affairs in place.I've admired Casey Affleck ever since I saw Good Will Hunting (1997) and later in his brother Ben's thrilling Gone Baby Gone (2007). But his performance in Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ultimately convinced me that he is one of the finest actors of his generation, and I felt that he deserved to beat the lauded Javier Bardem to the Oscar that year. Deservedly, he won Best Actor for his work here. It's a rare skill for an actor to be able to portray such a range of emotions when massively underplaying the part. Lee is as bottled-up as one can get, clearly reaching the point of just not giving a f**k anymore. When he returns to town, people whisper his name with both anger and sympathy. Something has happened to turn him into a socially- awkward, sullen shadow of a man, but Lonergan chooses to reveal the past slowly through flashbacks.In smaller roles, Chandler, Michelle Williams and Gretchen Mol are also as impressive as expected, but, Affleck aside, the majority of the screen-time is given to Lucas Hedges as Joe's son Patrick, who is now placed into the care of a reluctant Lee. Patrick doesn't react to his father's passing as one would expect, and instead remains a chirpy, outgoing teenager proud to have two girlfriends on the go. It's a lively, highly charismatic performance, and the complete opposite to the mopey young adult I was expecting. Themes of grief and regret run throughout the film, but the relationship between Lee and Patrick provides many moments of warmth and much- needed humour. Most writers would opt for award-baiting, tear- jerking moments of emotional outpouring, but Lonergan understands that life is rarely like that, and some wounds simply do not heal. The power of Manchester by the Sea lies within this honesty, with the windy, snowy backdrop acting almost as a window into its characters' souls."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 April 2017,9/10,"The main character, a janitor or Jack of all trades, is living alone in a monastic room and has the reputation to be untalkative and even cool if not cold with the customers. A couple of flashbacks later, we know one night, his wife sick in the basement and his children sleeping in the bedrooms upstairs, he starts a fire in the living room chimney, forgets to put the screen in front of the fire, goes to the store for some shopping twenty minutes away, more or less a mile away, and on his way back he finds out his house has been burnt down to the ground, his children are dead, his wife is taken to the hospital and he is alone. The police will classify the story as a sheer accident in no way criminal, at worst some negligence and still in no way criminal. He will try to kill himself at the police station with the gun of one officer. Of course he will fail. And he will have to let the show go on.He is surviving in a ghostlike life, feeling rejected and becoming violent in numerous occasions when he feels slightly menaced. He has not been able to bring closure to his mind, to his life, and he lives in the absolute self-rejection, self-loathing of someone who considers he is responsible for the death of his children, the estrangement of his wife and the unhappiness of so many people, maybe of the whole world around him. He is unable to just make some small talk with anyone, particularly women, even his ex-wife when by accident he is confronted to her and the newborn child of her new life.Imagine then the worst possible event that can strike him down a second time, even lower and deeper than the first time. His brother who has some degenerating disease dies, more or less as planned, and leaves a sixteen-year old son behind, and a will in which he makes his brother Lee the guardian of his son up to the age of twenty-one. Lee is tortured by the idea, fascinated by the abyss he may fall into if he accepts. He actually tries to cope with the idea and moves to Manchester by the Sea, where he had spent most of his life, to take care of his nephew in his brother's house. But little by little he finds out it is an ordeal and he finally will give it up. Luckily there is always a better solution than just a foster family.The nephew is just as embarrassed as the uncle, Patrick as much as Lee, because Patrick has a closure problem too because he does not seem to be able to really let his father go, though his behavior is more or less that of a teenage American boy. The young Patrick puts too much on his plate: the hockey team, a music band, two girlfriends, probably the necessity to think of his graduation in two years and college after that. Yet he was living alone with his father since he did not have a mother any more: she was an alcoholic and moved away. But now she no longer is an alcoholic – but is she not really? – he cannot cope with her and her new partner, both locked up in some deep and austere Christianity and the new partner deciding he had to be the necessary and unavoidable go-between for the son and the mother. The son could not have any direct relation with her. She cannot come to closure either and the son, Patrick, is lost in that inconsistent life that has no real rock to which he could tie himself. Strangely enough the uncle Lee and the nephew Patrick, both unable to come to closure in their bereavements, find some contact somewhere in that zombie life. Yet Lee cannot face that teenager, that child that intensifies his loss and his impossible acceptation that life is lethal since life leads to death in all cases possible. Bereaved he is, bereaved he will always be. So he cannot take the responsibility of causing another drama, another death, even though he loves Patrick and he has found out Patrick may be in the process of falling in love with him. If he authorized this to happen he would lead that child to his death. And yet in Boston where he has found a job, he is looking for an apartment with an extra room in case his nephew wanted to visit him and spend the night, which Patrick more or less declares improbable, though we know he is attached to his uncle enough to want to visit him and sleep over at his place. It is amazing how in our male dominated societies two males, no matter what ages they are, cannot establish an emotional and friendly relationship otherwise than with fights or violent sports. There is something wrong on this planet. Some say it is the animal in males that makes them compete and fight, and that means nothing has changed for humans and they are just as bad as orangutans, or elks and reindeers. That's sad and this film is bleak on the subject. We are living with our losses forever and we can never really get over them. That sure is pessimistic. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,2/10,"I saw Manchester By The Sea because it was winning so many awards and garnering so much buzz. Unfortunately, to be completely honest, I just didn't see the appeal of why the film has gotten so much love.To be succinct, the movie was just a bit too dour and flat for my tastes. I know that there is a school of filmmaking which depicts reality in stark fashion, but I think a film needs to have at least some drama, otherwise what is the point at all? I didn't find any drama in the experience at all, as the moments were it could have been present are so underplayed.I saw the potential in Manchester By The Sea, but I feel that it was just played too close to the vest. With the exception of Michelle Williams (whom I saw actual emotion from), everything else was just too bland for me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 February 2017,9/10,"Filled with a quiet, haunting power that will only make itself wholly manifest long after the credits of Kenneth Lonergan's masterful study of grief, loss and love have rolled, Manchester by the Sea isn't ever the film you expect it to become but it's within these moments of surprise and unpredictability that the real genius of this truly poignant drama come bearing down upon the unsuspecting watcher.Originally developed by Matt Damon (who was set to star and direct but only stays on as producer here) and fellow actor John Krasiniski, Manchester was given to Lonergan whose previous film was the underseen and horrifically released Margaret, and saw the talented writer/director of You Can Count On Me at a crossroads in his career where it seemed as though the brilliant wordsmith was turning his sole focus into the theatre scene.We can be thankful Damon and Krasinski sought out Lonergan, as his ability to craft a believable and real human drama is at the forefront of this moving study of Casey Affleck's tormented maintenance man Lee Chandler, an examination that gives Lonergan the chance to slowly but methodically build up his tale and unlock the broken nature of its leading man played memorably by a career-best Affleck.So good in The Assassination of Jesse James and the underrated Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's little brother showcases here an ample display of his talent to bring broken characters to vivid life. It's far from a showy performance; there are rarely moments designed for Affleck to do so but he finds power in the small details, the human details and when Lee shows signs of what lies within it's made all the more powerful thanks to Affleck's turn.Ably supported by impressive up and comer Lucas Hedges as Lee's nephew Patrick, the always great Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife Randi and the grounding presence of Coach Taylor himself Kyle Chandler as Lee's recently passed brother Joe, it's perhaps too close a race to suggest this year's Best Actor Oscar is Affleck's but regardless of him winning the golden statue or not, this is a career defining and memorable turn.A slow film that cares little for big moment's (even if the films one big set piece is worth its weight in emotional gold), Manchester by the Sea won't be everyone's cup of dramatic tea but Lonergan's film, that never molds or conforms itself into what's the usual for this type of fare or to what it's trailer's might make it seem to be, is a cinematic treat that will only grow on you as you ponder and consider it's many quiet yet resonant human qualities that feel far more real than is the Hollywood norm.4 1/2 troublesome drummers out of 5"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 December 2016,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea (2016) was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan.Casey Affleck stars as Lee Chandler, a janitor in Quincy, Massachusetts. (Quincy is about 1/2 hour away from Boston.) It's a dead-end job, Lee isn't well-liked by the tenants, and his primary pastime appears to be going into bars and getting into fights.Early in the film, we learn about the death of Lee's brother, who lives in Manchester by the Sea, Massachusetts. (Manchester by the Sea is a small seacoast town near Gloucester.) This leaves his 16-year-old son, Lee's nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges), without a guardian. (Patrick's mother is gone.) Everyone assumes that Lee will quit his job in Quincy, come back to Manchester by the Sea, get a job there, and take care of his nephew.People know that Lee has had a terrible trauma in his life, but they don't perceive that this trauma has broken him psychologically. We learn that this is not a mental wound that can be healed. He's broken and, apparently, will never get better.The rest of the movie consists of flashbacks to earlier events, alternating with the present-time events taking place day to day. The movie is so well crafted that it's hard to know where it will go and how it will end. Director Lonergan doesn't hint about what will happen on the next day, let alone the next week. This keeps us, in the audience, spellbound and really eager to see what comes next.Often, a film rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. In this movie, Casey Affleck is so good that the film could, indeed, rest on his shoulders. However, that's not necessary, because Lucas Hedges does a superb job as Lee's nephew, and the supporting cast members are excellent.In addition--although it's hard to describe--the movie just looks right. The hospital staff, the people in the bar, the people in the police station, the people in the dockyard and in the garage all look as if they belong there, and weren't just brought in to appear in their scene and then go home.As I write this review, Manchester by the Sea has an incredible 8.5 IMDb rating. This puts it at the same level as Gladiator and Apocalypse Now. I think it deserves this rating, and I expect the movie to move into IMDb's top 100 films, and stay there for the foreseeable future.The film will work well enough on the small screen, but the large screen will be better. We saw Manchester by the Sea at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. On a weekend in mid-December, 2016, the Little was screening three films with IMDb ratings over 8. My compliments to the programmers at the Little for making such great movies available to those of us who don't live in NYC, Chicago, or LA."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 January 2017,1/10,"After sitting through a very depressing 2 hrs and 17 min, I'm curious what parts of this movie made the 8+ rating here on IMDb.This has got to be one of the most monotonic, depressing, pathetic and utterly boring movies I have ever seen, and add to it that it was 137 mins, just baffles me how this was even made.What is the point? What is the viewer supposed to get out of watching this? Where is the entertainment? Where is the climax or high point to this film? Why was the score one of the, if not 'the' worst score in any movie I've ever seen? I've felt more alive listening to funeral home background music. And why is everyone praising the acting? It was terrible! Just start filming after all the actors wake up from a night of drinking and don't give them coffee, and make sure the weather is cloudy and cold, so they don't need to 'act' miserable, as they will automatically be, just as the viewer is left to feel.This has got to me one of the worst films I have ever seen -not a movie, just a film, as a movie has some entertainment value to it. Is this world not suffering enough that we need something to depress the viewers even more?Do yourself a favor and read the Plot Synopsis, it is on point, depressing, boring and very long, just like this film and doesn't leave anything out (btw props to whoever put the time in to type out this entire mess of a film). The difference is you can read it in 5 minutes, and save yourself the other 132 minutes to do something fun and exciting, you will thank me. Oh, and you're welcome."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 August 2017,7/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie, mainly because of the deep storyline, which was cleverly written with a touch of wit. Casey Affleck plays the moody Lee Chandler extremely well, and the whole plot come together well, once it was revealed. Anyway, Lee Chandler is a janitor in Boston, who gets the sad news about his brother, Joe, dying in hospital, so he rushes to be by his side but he doesn't make the hospital in time. His other brother Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler), is also in hospital with a rare heart condition, so it is left to Lee to arrange the funeral for Joe, and to tell the family about the sad news. He is then told that his brother wanted him to move back to his hometown to look after his son, Patrick (Lucas Hedges) but he has bad memories of Manchester, which has changed him for life. Whilst staying at Joe's place with Patrick, he comes face to face with his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams), who has remarried, and is heavily pregnant. He then has to face his demons, whilst trying to play the father role to Patrick but it all becomes a bit too much for Lee, who is finding it difficult to move on from his terrible past. For a movie that is over 2 hours long, with no action or fancy effects, I was a bit skeptical about watching this film but I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I was interested throughout. Its a very realistic story, which covers a lot of different elements, and the cinematography really suited the whole mood of the film. It is slightly depressing in parts, and you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it but with that aside, it's a unique movie which is definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: WOW! What a profit! With Casey Affleck winning the Oscar for the leading role, and Kenneth Lonergan winning the Oscar for the best Screenplay, I'm not surprised that this movie smashed the box office, and with such a low budget, and Matt Damon in the producers chair, I honestly think that it was well deserved. Kenneth Lonergan, 54, also directed Margaret and You Can Count On Me, so he hasn't had that much experience behind the camera but he certainly done a good job with this movie. I just hope that other directors take on board that you don't need a massive budget to make a good film.Budget: $9million Worldwide Gross: $74millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramas, starring Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler, Tate Donovan and Matthew Broderick. 7/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 October 2016,10/10,"Dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy turns a once warm and ebullient family man into a solemn, withdrawn, and angry loner in Kenneth Lonergan's (""Margaret"") bittersweet drama Manchester by the Sea, one of the best films of 2016. Set in the picturesque city of Manchester on Massachusetts' north shore, cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") captures the rugged beauty of the New England town with its bays filled with trawlers and its winter streets and municipal buildings covered in a shimmering white. It is a town that looks as if it has not changed in decades, or even centuries.Lee Chandler, in a haunting performance by Casey Affleck (""Interstellar""), is a janitor/handyman who spends his days painting, doing minor plumbing work, repairing leaks, and so on or just giving advice while making sure to avoid any social interaction with the people he is working for. His nights are spent drinking alone in bars where he is quick to start fights or at home watching TV in his small apartment. There is no hint during the film's first half hour about what has brought him to his present state of disequilibrium, but in his mumbling inability to express his thoughts, we know that something unspoken is driving his need for isolation.Lee has been living in nearby Quincy but, when his older brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler, ""Carol"") succumbs to a heart attack, he has to return to Manchester to make funeral arrangements and attend the reading of the will and to confront the people that he has turned away from. His grief over his brother's death turns to shock, however, when he discovers that he has been named the legal guardian of Joe's 16-year-old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""), a popular high school student. Since Patrick's mom Elise (Gretchen Mol, ""Anesthesia"") is an alcoholic who left town long ago, Lee is the only person who can assume the task.It is one, however, that he does not feel ready for. Eventually, the seminal event that changed Lee's life forever is revealed, depicted in a straightforward manner without histrionics or pandering, even if the overused baroque music tends to amplify the drama beyond what is required. In flashback, we see that Lee was once a happy family man with a loving wife Randi (Michelle Williams, ""Suite Française"") and three young children and we see him joking around with his young nephew Patrick (Ben O'Brien) on their fishing boat. Assuming the responsibility of being a father-figure to Patrick, we glimpse the man that Lee used to be.The dialogue between the abrasive Lee and the feisty, sharp-tongued Patrick feels real and without guile but channeling the chemistry they have together into rebuilding his life is a challenge. Manchester by the Sea is a serious film but is balanced by humor. In one such scene, Patrick awkwardly attempts to hide the obvious from his mom about studying in his room with his girlfriend. Another funny incident takes place when Lee is used as a cover for Patrick's surreptitious juggling of his two girlfriends. The issues between them take a more serious tone, however, when Lee is convinced that he and Patrick should move to Boston, a suggestion that Patrick rebels at, citing his high school girlfriends, his being on the soccer team, and his playing in the school band.Though Michelle Williams has a small role, she turns in one of her best performances. In a powerful confrontation with Lee, it is clear that she still loves him but has felt compelled to suppress it in order to bury the past and move on. Manchester by the Sea belongs to Casey Affleck, however, who turns in what is arguably the best performance of his career. The film does not have the sort of neat resolution that you may have come to expect but what it does have are real people whose lives you want to be a part of and you know that that world is not one that can only happen in the movies, but a real experience of life fully lived in all its pain and all its joy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,9/10,"With Awards season well and truly underway, Manchester by the Sea is a drama (with hints of subtle comedy) all about a working man who has to return to his hometown due to unforeseen circumstances but is faced with his troubling past, and so must come to terms with new challenges as well as his memories that haunt him. We all probably know, from the poster, that this film is a hit with critics. I mean every poster is just covered with five stars, overused adjectives and awards that it has already won. Is it worth all of that praise? Absolutely. This is pure drama and it is refreshing to see. Firstly, Casey Affleck owned this film, the amount of screen time he had was bewildering. I usually find him quite a monotonous actor but he really outdid himself (and Michelle Williams). His character is damaged, he is a broken man and Affleck was able to emotionally involve himself with the film. In fact, I would go as far as saying that I didn't see Affleck in this film, I saw his character Lee Chandler...it was that good. Supporting cast are good, Michelle Williams was fine, nothing major, and yet she still gets nomination for everything. Kyle Chandler was good but it is relative newcomer Lucas Hedges that impressed me. His delivery and sincerity of his lines was perfect, definitely one to watch out for in the future. Speaking of the lines, the screenplay for this film was outstanding. No useless scenes, no stupid lines that were cringe-worthy...it was just meticulously thought out and I hope it wins awards. The inclusion of humour for such a melancholic drama was brave but necessary, it really allowed us to connect with these characters. I have to give director Kenneth Lonergan some credit as his camera-work was clean, some nice long takes and many wide shots to take in the scenery. Halfway through the film he interweaves the present narrative to a past memory (I didn't see that coming...literally shocked me) of the main character and switches between the two for a few seconds. A great way to establish empathy for the character and to heighten the importance of how his past has damaged him...was really good direction. However, many times during the film Lonergan chooses to not include transitions and so we could be watching a sad moment only for the scene to change instantly into something more upbeat, unfortunately it didn't enable me to prolong my emotional investment during those scenes so it did not work for me. I can see why it was done, just was not for me. The score to this film was hypnotic, mostly violins and other stringed instruments but I really thought it suited the town of Manchester (being a sleepy port town). Overall, Manchester by the Sea was a well grounded, supremely acted, excellently directed drama that has a career best performance from Casey Affleck and introduces to us the talented Lucas Hedges. If you have not watched this, I urge that you do.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,6/10,"Mrs. Shullivan and I made it a point to see this film before the Academy Award winners are announced. As Manchester by the Sea is up for 6 Academy awards including Best Picture we thought the film must be of a higher caliber from the past 12 month crop of other dramatic films. So we finished dinner, turned the lights down and turned on our Blu Ray player and commenced the film.Of course the cinematography was above par and the Boston harbor scenes were picturesque but surprisingly, Manchester by the Sea was not nominated in the best cinematography category. The two main characters are Uncle Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) and his 16 year old nephew Patrick Chandler (played by Lucas Hedges) who has been entrusted by his father Joe Chandler (played by Kyle Chandler) who died as expected at an early age due to a previous diagnosed congenital heart disease.Now Uncle Lee has left his Boston harbor town and for the past several years he has been working as a maintenance man in an apartment complex to mask the pain he is forced to live with after losing all three of his children in a house fire and divorced form his loving wife. Lee hates like hell having to face his past demons back in the Boston harbor he called home for all but the past seven (7) years but his deceased brother has intentionally and legally made his brother Lee the legal custodian of his 16 year old son Patrick. So Lee now needs to consider someone other than himself once again and somehow figure a way that the young lad that he fished with for many years before as his little nephew Patrick and with his own brother Joe, if he should uproot his now 16 year old nephew so that he doesn't have to face his own ex-wife and his own demons from the past and re-live that disastrous night when he watched his home go up in flames, as did his life as he used to know it.This film is about one couple's tragedy and how Lee and his ex-wife Randi Chandler (played by Michelle Williams) deal with their tragedy and how they decide to move on with their lives, without each other. I wouldn't say that Manchester by the Sea is deserving of the Best Picture award or for any of the other awards this picture was nominated for simply because in my humble opinion there were some better pictures. Of course Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges were excellent in their respective roles as Uncle and nephew, but I would have to say their performances were not the best I have seen this past year.This is a decent film, but not one that I will refer to as spectacular or even memorable. For these reasons I give this film a decent 6 out of 10 rating. Nothing more, but nothing less."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,9/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" takes place in the dead of winter in the small Massachusetts coastal town of the title. This bleak setting and the stark, grim imagery that accompany it set the tone for Kenneth Lonergan's third feature film, which explores grief and our darkest demons in a way so authentic it can get uncomfortable at times. Yet its that same level of honesty that gives the film an unexpected sense of humor, a kind of tranquility and a quiet hope.Casey Affleck gives a career-elevating performance as Lee Chandler, a stoic loner living as a residence building janitor in Boston who gets a call that his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) is in critical condition. By the time he gets up north to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Joe has died, leaving Lee to look after his 16-year-old nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), and bury his brother, all while fending off painful memories of his past that this town evokes.Although it would seem that ""Manchester by the Sea"" focuses on the grief at hand — a man mourning his brother and a son mourning his father — the film is actually about other challenges and traumas that Joe's death brings to the surface for these characters. That's what makes Lonergan's story and script so masterful — the present day action is only maybe a quarter of the story. What's happening beneath the surface in any given scene is everything else. Lonergan cues us in by splicing in scenes from the past that powerfully inform the present action. As a director and editor, he inserts them rather abruptly and without the sometimes patronizing cues that most filmmakers use to indicate the arrival of a flashback sequence. The transitions are instead rather jarring and require some work on our behalf to sort out, but this echoes the jarring way they interrupt Lee's consciousness as well. Lonergan puts us completely in sync with Lee, setting up Affleck to have tremendous success.Affleck does not miss his opportunity. His performance is understated, brooding and cold, punctuated by a few brief gun shots of emotion. This is not a traditional Oscar bait performance, though much of that thanks can again go to Lonergan for writing the audiences into Lee's skin, affording Affleck a great deal of nuance to work with. It's also in his character's nature to suppress emotion, to stay reserved, and watching an actor push back on emotion proves just as powerful as watching it pour out of them.That's what makes Michelle Williams' performance as Lee's ex-wife such a significant complement. Williams gets pretty minimal screen time, but when she does, it's in her character's nature to open up the flood gates. An encounter between the two characters is the emotional climax of the film for this reason. Other supporting characters also provide alternative perspectives on Lee's struggles, another part of what makes Lonergan's script so outstanding. The most complex dynamic is between Lee and Patrick, the teenager who wants more than anything to keep his life intact: being on the hockey team, playing lead guitar in a rock band and having not one, but two girlfriends. He does have his own struggles beyond needing closure from his dad's death, but it's how his life is affected by the adults, namely Lee, struggling around him that raise the most interesting points. Hedges provides a lot of comic relief, surprisingly, but he brings a lot of maturity to Patrick that helps elevate his relationship with Lee to something beyond the angsty teen and the bachelor uncle that doesn't want to have to deal with him.""Manchester by the Sea"" has some powerful messages, messages that can be hard to hear, especially in the form of a movie that's nearly 140 minutes long and full of nothing but cold, dark imagery to the point that some viewers might walk away with Seasonal Affective Disorder. Yet these are the kind of messages that we need to be reminded of, even at the movies. Grief — overcoming the darkest moments that have defined our lives, is not easy. That honesty makes Lonergan's film one of the most important, albeit one of the hardest, movies of the year~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 June 2018,5/10,"Truly a lot of attention for detail went into this movie. It is intelligent, quirky, meditative. The photography in particular is breathtakingly gorgeous. Few directors can make a picture look so enticing through images. Kenneth Lonergan's photographer made art with his work. The soundtrack deserves much praise as well. Really heavenly classical music. Placed at the right moments, the classical soundtrack really powered this in itself tedious story line. Many people hated the classic music though, but the music and the gorgeous photography were the only reason I kept watching this movie till the end.I kept hoping something extraordinary would happen in this tedious story, but no, everything stayed as dreary and boring as in everyday life.The story just is mind numbing boring, except in the middle of the story then an avalanche of misery and violence erupts. But as fast as these emotions rise up, as quickly are they played down again. What follows is a story about how to take care of a teenager who has lost his mother. Who wants to see that for more than 2 hours long? Casey Affleck really acts great though. But some other supporting and unfortunately also some leading characters (the teenager) just act at a mediocre level. Not bad, but not elevating either.If the director would have cut 45 minutes out of this too long and therefore dreary story, it could have become a great delicate portrait of a broken family. Now it only pleases the critics and other people, who are into documentary styled stories about grief stricken families."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 December 2016,9/10,"""Manchester By the Sea"" (2016 release; 137 min.) brings the story of Lee Chandler. As the movie opens, we get to know Lee as the maintenance guy, taking care of various plumbing mishaps in an apartment building in Boston. After work, he gets into an argument with 2 guys in a bar. It's clear that Lee is a loner, with a lot on his mind. Then one day, Lee gets a call that his brother Joe has dies from a congestive heart failure. Lee heads up to Manchester by the Sea to take care of the funeral and also Joe's 16 yr. old son Patrick. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Kenneth Lonergan, who previously brought us the critically acclaimed ""You Can Count On Me"" and ""Margaret"". Here he goes yet one better (and heavier) with a family and relationship drama that at first seems to focus mainly on the strained relationship between Lee and Patrick, but then the movie slowly but surely starts to sheds more and more layers, like an onion almost (and likely to cause a few tears along the way). When the Big Reveal comes, about an hour into the movie, we are completely immersed into the physical and emotional toll that the events are having on all involved. The movie oozes outstanding performances, none more so that Casey Affleck, playing Lee, in the role of a life time (and sure to pick up multiple nominations and awards in the upcoming award season). Kudos also to Lucas Hedges as the restless teenager Patrick. Michelle Williams (as Lee's wife (in flashbacks) and now ex-wife) gives her all too, but this is a very small role (at most 15-20 min. of screen time in a 2 hrs. 15 min. movie). The movie of course has a very strong New England component to it, but the overall feel of this movie reminded me of the Robert Redford-directed family drama ""Ordinary People"" in the early 80s. Bottom line: if you like a heavy-duty family and relationship drama that is short on ""action"" but long on emotion and character, you are in for a treat with this. I am going on record already to predict that this will pick up multiple Oscar nominations (Best Film, Director, Screenplay, Actor, and maybe others).""Manchester By the Sea"" has been slowly rolling out from a very limited release into now a semi-wide release, and audiences have been flocking. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was PACKED, somewhat to my surprise (it being a weekday), but this again confirms that audiences still care about a true quality movie which examines the human condition while packing an emotional wallop. Whether you see this in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, ""Manchester by the Sea"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 December 2016,9/10,"If there's one phrase that describes noted playwright Kenneth Lonergan's moving meditation on how a man broken by the ultimate family tragedy must now cope with a seemingly equal but in reality lesser tragedy—the death of a sibling—it's ""life must go on."" Indeed, Manchester by the Sea features two tragedies which affect Lonergan's protagonist Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), a Boston handyman, with a hair trigger temper and surly disposition. Ironically, Lonergan introduces us to Lee's second tragedy first and makes it clear that this tragedy—the death of his 50 or so older brother Joe from a congenital heart condition—offers Lee in some measure an opportunity to overcome the demons of the more devastating earlier tragedy, which Lonergan wisely treats as a mystery until the film's midpoint. Early on, Lonergan suggests that there's something terribly wrong emotionally with Lee. He provokes a fight at a bar and appears to revel in his victim's retaliation of beating him to a bloody pulp. Later, when he meets his friend's brother at the hospital to identify his brother's body, Lee inappropriately explodes in anger in front of a caring nurse and attending physician.In a clever plot twist at the beginning of Act 2, Lonergan's mordant Lee (who soon we'll learn has a death wish), is thrust into the unenviable position of becoming guardian to his 16 year old nephew, Patrick, Joe's son. Lee, with his repressed rage, is the last person who should be given the responsibility of caring for a family member—and he's blindsided when he realizes that his brother never gave him an inkling of his plans for Patrick upon his demise.The reality of Joe's death indeed has nothing to do with death but everything to do with life going on. Indeed the machinations in the second act—especially the interplay between Lee and Patrick—are Lonergan's way of suggesting that there is much comedy in the midst of tragedy. Whether the focus is on people in the community (the two paramedics unable to get a stretcher into the back of their ambulance) or one of the principals (Patrick and his girlfriend fumbling to put on their clothes after attempting sex with the girlfriend's mother knocking on the door), Lonergan is determined to lighten things up before explaining the tragedy of Lee's existence.But before he does that, Lonergan must also do a bit of foreshadowing, so that there's some kind of setup for Lee's modest resurrection. Initially Lee is depicted as being unbending when he plans to uproot his nephew by taking him out of school, making him leave all his friends and bringing him to Boston, where he'll be isolated and unhappy. When that plan falls apart, he sends Patrick off to see if he can co-habit with his biological mother— that plan is a disaster as well; we soon learn that the mother's new husband is a Christian Fundamentalist who has no intention of giving Patrick his ""space.""Finally Lonergan, in a series of flashbacks, reveals the root of Lee's devastating malady. One night when he was married, he went out to get some beers and forgot to close a screen in the fireplace, resulting in a fire that killed his three children. In perhaps the best and most shocking scene in the film, after he's informed of the death of his children at the police station, he grabs a deputy's gun and tries to shoot himself in the head—only to be wrestled down by the attendant officers. One only wonders why Lee didn't attempt suicide again.Lee must undergo one last baptism of fire— and that's when he runs into his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) on the street who begs his forgiveness by admitting that she said many horrible things to him at the time when their children were killed. She wants to be close to Lee again but he can't open up. Mick LaSalle, writing in the SF Chronicle, couldn't have said it better when he wrote: ""People don't always recover. Some things are so awful that recovery is simply not possible. Likewise, in the aftermath of tragedy, most people aren't completely destroyed. They don't end up in a ditch or in a straitjacket. They simply remain at a base level of pain that never ends, that never gets better and never gets worse.""But somehow there was some movement in a positive direction for Lee. As a result of his relationship with his nephew and the confrontation with his ex-wife, shall we say there was a softening up? At film's end, Lee is no longer just thinking about himself— he devises a plan for Patrick to live with Joe's friend (whom we met much earlier at the hospital) so he can remain in town but still able to visit Lee in Boston.Lonergan, in his brilliant portrait, suggests that the anomalous tragedy that befell Lee does not separate him emotionally from you or me. Most of us are afraid of our own repressed anger (or even rage), which may lead to a breakdown and resulting catharsis involving the expression of great sorrow. Lee's problem was that he was blocked from following through on his rage so he could experience the sorrow.Casey Affleck's performance will probably earn him a Best Actor Award at the upcoming Academy Awards, and additional special mention should be made of Lucas Hedges in his most convincing portrait of the beleaguered nephew. Michelle Williams also was quite affecting especially in the final confrontation with Affleck, pouring out her heart in remorse for previous words of anger.Kenneth Lonergan is one of our few writers today who can deliver multi- dimensional characters and write comedy and tragedy on the level of the great writers of yesteryear. Manchester by the Sea delivers an impeccable and moving Weltanschauung from its opening scene."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 February 2017,7/10,"The question I was left to ask myself after watching 'Manchester by the Sea' was, is a film able to be good purely on the basis of how emotionally draining it is? The answer should probably be no, and yet I feel for a lot of people that's not the case. I think back to movies that have moved me a lot emotionally over the years, 'The Green Mile', 'Amour', 'Good Will Hunting' and 2016's 'Lion' are some that come immediately to mind, and the difference they all have to 'Manchester by the Sea' is that they are ultimately uplifting. The are very sad and emotional films, but the message at the heart of it all was a positive one. I'm not entirely sure you could say the same about 'Manchester by the Sea'.That's not to say I didn't like the movie, I did. I suppose I was just a little underwhelmed by it. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in. It was undoubtedly a very well made film. A number of members of the cast have been nominated for Oscars (which I will cover shortly), the dialogue is wonderfully written in almost every scene and the direction is top notch. The only area that I can really see that let it down is the story. There are a series of events that we see these characters go through, but what was the overall point? Was it simply to show us how rough life has been for these people over the last few years? If so, I don't think that's enough.Three members of the cast have been nominated for Academy Awards. Casey Affleck has been nominated for Actor in a Lead Role and is the favourite to win it. I'm not entirely sure he will. It felt more to me like the script drove his performance, instead of the other way around like it should be. It felt a little bit like Casey Affleck playing Casey Affleck. To me the best performances come when you had no idea that the actor had this kind of versatility in his range. Michelle Williams has been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. I say every year that this is one of the weakest categories at the whole ceremony, and Williams confirms it here. She's obviously no shot of winning the award, but the fact that she was nominated at all for the tiny amount of screen time she had alone says enough. Lucas Hedges has also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. I was a little surprised by this one as well. Again he's no chance of actually winning the award, but I'm not sure I even saw enough to justify a nomination. Much like Affleck, it's the script that has got him the nod.'Manchester by the Sea' is a fine film that just couldn't quite reach the high expectations I had. No one could question the quality that has gone into the film making process though and for that reason alone it is a very watchable 137 minutes."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 November 2016,9/10,"It's just a well crafted picture.Casey Affleck fits into this role like a glove, and he was amazing in it. If he were to win an Oscar for this one that would make sense completely.Manchester by the Sea has Affleck as uncle Lee, a janitor in Boston whose brother dies and is forced by the will to take care of his nephew, a task he's not up to.The movie is very real and strangely raw to be filmed so beautifully (but I am a sucker for movies shot in the winter). It's slow moving enough to notice but not enough to bore you, cause that's life.What really grasp me about Manchester by the Sea is how clumsy it is. So many scenes in which the dramatic punches are ruined by everyday life. It's just not fake like a lot of movies are usually. It had the guts to keep in all those awkward moments that humans go through knowing that we would relate, and it does this without skipping on the romance you would find in dramas like this.It's all the real emotions people go through when life gives you a curve ball, yet life does not allow you a time out. Great movie! Amazing performance by Affleck!! A must see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 November 2017,8/10,"As to dynamism on screen, I regard myself an average filmophile - I am not into constant flashes and short scenes, but I do not value long ""profound"" scenes. Reading some local critics, they all praised this movie, but they all stressed that 'nothing really happens in there'. Therefore, I was hesitant to start watching and postponed it until now.But, virtually from the very beginning, I was pleasantly surprised. The benchmark and the development of the plot, great acting (particularly males who are more visible/present, with Casey Affleck leading) and the venue created a nice wholeness towards somewhat Scandinavian approach of depicting circumstances and human relations. Indeed, most of us do not live life full of action, yet deaths of relatives-friends occur, and then you have to move by/on in a way or another. Kenneth Lonergan has found a talented way to ""process"" it, and the viewers just have to follow and ponder on and over how they would act in a similar situation. And will find so much recognition... Definitely, a good movie, with accolades and nominations well deserved; perhaps the ending could have been more ""upsetting"". As for mood and depiction, I would juxtapose it with The Station Agent, yet the latter has more warmth and humor.PS Never believe paid critics - unless you want to miss a good movie :)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,7/10,"""Manchester By the Sea"" is a well made, well-acted drama: the kind we have come to expect from Kenneth Lonergan, whose previous two movies were both fantastic.I also think it's the least successful of the three.It's Lonergan's most ambitious project: the movie uses flashbacks to tell the story in more than one timeline simultaneously.These flashbacks are jarring and confusing. At first I didn't realise that these scenes take place earlier than the rest of the movie. They also become irritating.Casey Affleck plays a thoroughly broken man whose brother just died. Through flashbacks we see both the brother's diagnosis with heart disease and another, worse family tragedy that befell Affleck.He is given the job of looking after his nephew, who seems to be beating the girls off with a stick. This aspect of the character seemed a little unlikely.The movie should be more touching than it is, but I never got into it that much. For a performance with such focus as the one Casey Affleck gives, the screenplay needed focus, too."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2020,,"Brooding, unapologetically antisocial Lee Chandler is a janitor living out of a basement apartment in a suburb of Metropolitan Boston. Upon learning that his older brother's health has taken a turn for the worse, he heads to the titular town to discover-much to his chagrin-that he's been named as caretaker to his teenage nephew. Through flashbacks, we learn about the life that Lee once had in Manchester and the series of events that put him in such a fragile emotional state. Gripping story effectively explores many palpable themes like guilt, grief, love, family, and is expertly brought to life by vivid Massachusetts scenery, believably flawed characters, and terrific acting headlined by Affleck who's nothing short of perfect in the lead. The film's ending doesn't quite measure up to everything that precedes it, and all the emotional baggage on display is likely to take a toll on the viewer, but it's a splendid showing nonetheless. ***"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 December 2016,6/10,"I saw ""Manchester by the Sea"", starring Casey Affleck-Interstellar, the American Pie movies; Michelle Williams-Shutter Island, Brokeback Mountain; Kyle Chandler-Zero Dark Thirty and Lucas Hedges-The Grand Budapest Hotel, Dan In Real Life.Casey plays a divorced family man-you learn the reasons why he is in this predicament during flashbacks-that now makes his living as a janitor, living in a run down apartment, struggling with deep depression. He also lashes out in anger, getting into fights, mostly after he has had a few drinks. Kyle plays his brother who lives in Manchester by the Sea-the name of a real town in Massachusetts, by the way. After Kyle dies, Casey goes to pay his respects and finds out that Kyle put him in his will, stating that he wanted Casey to take care of his 16 year old son, Lucas. Michelle plays Casey's ex-wife, who blames Casey for the personal tragedy that destroyed their marriage. Casey doesn't want the responsibility of raising Lucas, especially since Casey can't even get his own life on track-with all the depression and attitude problems he has. If you like drama, you should enjoy this one. The acting is good but it would have been better if they edited the time down a little-it was over 2 hours long. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright as a rental."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 January 2017,,"Oh man! Did I have to pound my manchest with a heavy heart as I witnessed the gloomy but mesmerizing deep drama ""Manchester by the Sea"". Writer-Director Kenneth Lonergan longs us with a provoking and authentic tale of a janitor named Lee Chandler who resides in Quincy, MA but is originally from Manchester, MA. Lee is informed that his older brother Joe has suffered a fatal heart attack so he must go back to his old Manchester hood; and low and behold, Lee is informed that he has to be the guardian to Joe's teenage son Patrick. Lee is conflicted with this and also does not help matters much that he must go back to where a horrific tragedy occurred to him when he was married to ex- wife Randi. Lonergan primarily presents us an authentic focus on a relationship between an uncle and his nephew; as he did in his masterpiece ""You Can Count On Me"" between a male and a female sibling. His screenplay wisely mixes in gentle and brawny qualities; undoubtedly, one of the best screenplays of 2016. Casey Affleck gives a career tops performance as Lee. Michele Williams was not on screen very long, but she sure gave a whopper of a performance as Randi; the street-sidewalk scene is one of the best acted scenes by an actress this year. Lucas Hedges is a revelation with his stellar work as Patrick. And the immensely underrated Kyle Chandler nailed each scene he was in as Joe; I sure did hope that we would see more Joe in Manchester. The cinematography by Jody Lee Lipes was very symbolic and integral to the narrative of the picture. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is not the feel good movie of the year, but it sure felt good to watch it. ***** Excellent"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,6/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a moody, rambling film about a broken man doing all he can do removing himself from the pain of the past when he suddenly is confronted with an unavoidable responsibility that drags him back. Sea digs a hole for itself early with some torpid scenes that set a rather abysmal pace and it is left up to Casey Affleck's strong performance as a haunted father to carry the film. The writing for the supporting cast remains weak however and Ken Lonergan's direction plods with more than its share of flat banal scenes relying on uncomfortable pregnant pauses to create a sense of uneasiness and drama with little chance for any of them to play off of Affleck's powerful catatonia.Lee Chandler is a Quincy building janitor that is a capable mister fix-it but a lousy people person. Female tenants come on to him but his flat affect response hints at serious character defect that is also prone to violent outburst after a few beers. When his divorced brother in Manchester dies he is bestowed guardianship of his son, who given his dark past in Manchester wants nothing to do with it at first.Lonergan directs with an uneven, heavy hand as he rotates solid brief telling scenes of energy and the little humor the film has with mawkish lengthy takes that go nowhere as Chandler broods and the cast as well as the audience patently wait him out with Lonergan ham fistedly draping scenes in lugubrious Handel.The supporting cast offers up little besides uncomfortable expressions and measured responses to the occasionally volcanic Chandler while nearly every female character comes across arch, emotionally immature, fragile or horny.Affleck, appearing in nearly every scene, carries the picture with a melancholy virtuosity I have not witnessed in past performances. The usual tick laden, far away eyes look James Dean wannabe has been tempered and Affleck shines in a dark way that Lonergan dovetails well with the gloomy New England winter Chandler moves through. But with little support from the rest of the cast to go along with Lonergan's meandering directorial style Manchester by the Sea never reaches the high tide level of Casey Affleck's disturbing Lee Chandler."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 June 2017,9/10,"(Flash Review)The story revolves around how one man deals with a tragedy that occurred and how this effects his inner circle. On top of that, he has been charged with taking guardianship over his nephew who is a hormone filled teenager. The story progresses in a way that makes you ask, I wonder why this person did that or why are they like this. Then later fills in the gaps. Good editing and pacing at a moderately-slow tempo. Lots of interesting real life vignettes stitched together with normal and real life dialog. This film is about acting, acting and acting and will the man ever be able to overcome this tragedy?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2020,8/10,Very sad and depressing with some laughs when you would lease expect them. Casey Affleck performance was brilliant. To me it feels like he brought back the character from Lonesome Jim. This film is worth checking out.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2018,8/10,"Casey Affleck is a better actor than his better known brother, Ben. Ben is better looking. And Ben may be the better writer/director, so things seem to be evening out for this family. This film is carried by Affleck, but he aided by good direction, a good script, and positively gorgeous cinematography. The supporting cast does a pretty good job as well. This slice of life in New England appears to be depressing initially, but the film shows how the support of friends and family can sometimes get you through amazingly rough spots. The police station scene is haunting and very believable. The story of a decent man forced to submit to several slings and arrows in life is tough to take at times, and at others, a thing of beauty, just like real life itself. Highly recommended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 April 2017,8/10,"Prior to watching MANCHESTER BY THE SEA I had reservations about what to expect. My whole family had gone to see the movie and could not say enough bad things about it. It was praised by tons of critics which sometimes makes me wary. Combine those two items and walking in I wasn't sure what to expect. I glad to announce that the movie was a good one and worth watching but perhaps not near as awe inspiring as the critics made it seem.Casey Affleck stars as Lee Chandler, the maintenance man/janitor of a few apartment houses in Boston. The film opens with his day to day drudgery, showing a lack of enthusiasm for anything going on around him. His life is the same daily chores followed by angry outburst after too much to drink. Then he gets a call.Lee's older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has passed away due to a heart condition. Flashbacks throughout clue us in on various things that happened in the past, for instance here we learn of Joe's heart problems a few years earlier. These problems led to his wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) becoming an alcoholic and drug addict which led to their divorce. It also led to Joe raising their son Patrick (Lucas Hedges) on his own.Lee returns to Manchester where his family was from. He goes about the brotherly chores of dealing with his brother's funeral arrangements and the rest. He tries to help his nephew out with what to expect but Lee is a man of few words. Patrick is more interested in scoring with girls and ignoring what is transpiring around him. The conflict between these two would seem to be the heart of this film but as it progresses we discover there is more going on than that.As Lee makes an attempt to find work in Manchester people are talking. He runs into his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and an awkward moment transpires between the two. And as he attempts to find solutions to the problems left him with his brother's passing he constantly buts heads with his nephew. Through it all he rarely has time to grieve. Worse yet he doesn't seem to care.Why is it that Lee feels so uncomfortable about being back in Manchester? What happened in the past that makes people say things like ""Is he THAT Lee Chandler?"" While the issues of what to do with his brother's fishing boat (how he made his living), his house and where Patrick will live are hemmed and hawed about before a final solution plays out near the films end. Toss into that mix the return of Elise with her new husband Jeffrey (Matthew Broderick) and her born again atmosphere as she tries to be the mother she should have been and tempers rise.While watching this movie I couldn't help but be reminded of another heavy drama dealing with a dysfunctional family, ORDINARY PEOPLE. It's not just the recent passing of Mary Tyler Moore that brought it to mind either. It was the similarity on screen of a family unable to communicate, to express emotion until it seems they are about to explode. For me Lee's character is much like that of Conrad (Timothy Hutton) from that film but with less emotion on display. Both films shared something more than a dysfunctional family though.Both of these films were heavy handed dramas that didn't fit into any specific niche. Both contain characters that are in intense pain and both never reveal where that pain comes from until more than halfway through the film. It allows us to build up preconceived notions about the main characters that are completely tosses in the air when we learn more about them.The writing here is above par for most movies, moving us back and forth in time and allowing secrets to be revealed as the need arises rather than just tossed out. The directing I can't really say much about other than that it is seamless and nonintrusive. The actors are given plenty of leeway to form their characters and run with them.Standing out above them in one of the most underplayed performances I've seen in some time is Affleck. If this were your only exposure to him you might not see it. But after having seen him turn in great performances before this time I felt like I was seeing someone using body language rather than words to show me the inside of the character.This movie is indeed a downer. It has an ending that isn't quite a complete ending. But that's how life is. We move on to other areas of our lives. We deal with what life hands us and rise or fall from those circumstances. This film is not a happy go lucky date night flick. But it is a good movie and worth watching. Enough so that when looking back I felt like I could easily watch it another time. For me that's the test of a good movie. And while I'm not much of an Oscar fan it should be mentioned that the film has been nominated for best picture as well as nods to Affleck for best actor, Hedges for supporting actor and Williams for supporting actress."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 December 2019,9/10,"Ever had a lump stuck in your throat for 2 hours?Ever held in a scream you wanted to scream but couldn't because you were afraid you couldn't stop?Ever seen an actor not acting, not performing, just being?Ever seen a director do his utmost to tear out your soul, stomp on it only to rebuild it in the most bitter sweet way imaginable?Ever lost someone, wanting them back so badly, living becomes a chore?Ever grieved?Ever felt so much love and responsibility it becomes unbearable?Manchester by the Sea shows us a life, a real life, in all its ugly beauty. It uses the power only the most exemplary pieces of art possess, the power to confront, to resonate and to emote and it does so with restraint and respect.To me, the utter humanity of it all makes this film a singular masterpiece. I allowed its weight to wash over me, to take in the unbelievable performances only to end up feeling grateful to have been part of this gut wrenching glimpse into a tortured soul.Allow this film in and you'll have an extraordinarily humbling experience"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 November 2018,,"The story us good. The acting is excellent.Yet the movie is so and so. It is long. It is slow. It tries so much to be moody, in a way that people who don't know how to make movies teach in the film school. It mimics the waste of time found in European Art Movies. Only the pauses in the European Art Movies are because the state usually pays for a feature movie and the nephew only has enough material for a short or medium length movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 May 2020,4/10,"This movie was so bland. The protagonist is very interesting, he had some hard moments in his life, but the present the movie focuses on is nothing interesting. The Casey Affleck was phenomenal, it was interesting to see his character's development over the course of events. But besides that, everything else is so bland. The whole taking care of a teen story, it's just your average drama movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 March 2020,8/10,"Very real, great acting, sweet and moving. Beautiful scenery tbh. I wish the ending had been a little different, but I guess it was meant to leave it up in the air for your own imagination. Well played by the casts."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 December 2016,7/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" offers a good combination of elements that should have resulted in a much more interesting package. We have the story of a tortured soul who has to go back to his hometown and face the terrifying ghosts left behind by events that destroyed his life. The question is whether he will be able to survive this development or end up causing more tragedies before the 137 minutes are over.Casey Affleck plays the man who once had an average family with three children and a wife who he took for granted most of the time. It appears as if his life has always been a series of awful circumstances, some a result of his alcoholism; others are just some dark chapters who compound or revive the old wounds. One of the lone sources of spiritual support has now died ""unexpectedly"" leaving behind a nephew, entrusted to him. Unfortunately, this might be a task he's not ready to carry out because of many different factors.The origins of the lowest moments of his life are told in flashbacks, as we see how his various relationships were affected by his erratic behavior and his lack of self-control. He wasn't really able to maintain normal bonds with anybody around him. People tried, but he always managed to keep some distance between him and the others. Suddenly, he loses most of his family, and this time he becomes a target of people's recriminations and his own self-induced torture.We see Affleck mostly as a sad and angry man, a brooding creature who can barely handle his daily routine. For some strange reason, people put up with him; we can deduce that they know his background, and there's pity involved. Things take a worse turn when he's back in the middle of what he left behind. There are incredulous looks and very low expectations, maybe a wave of both resistance and frustration because this man is now in charge of another child, and the challenges are going to be big and intense. His nephew is 16 years old, barely knows him, and we don't know what will happen when emotions reach limits neither party will be able to handle.In the end, we see how people start getting used to each other, with some people never being able to overcome their perception of what he did in the past. Others are a bit more understanding, but people are almost never able to learn or change, and everything is a step away from escalating into a regrettable incident.Lukas Hedges portrays his character with an strength and rawness. He's real, powerful, vulnerable, capable of showing a range we don't see in performers this young, and he's probably the best actor here. In my opinion, his role is not secondary, but an equal to Affleck, and there are times when it's impossible to look away from his body language, his shattering responses which are a combination of pain and anger.Nothing will prepare us for the encounters between Affleck and his ex wife, in particular the one where he runs into her and has to keep himself from crashing when she asks for forgiveness and attempts a sort of connection that only leads to catastrophic results. Williams is able to convey, pain, sorrow, anger, regret, and other dark emotions that have been festering in her and somehow she managed to appear to control.There are many damaged beings in here. What we don't know is whether the ""accident"" is really what triggered all this decay, or maybe it was already there, and it was going to happen. There are hints that happiness was a part of this world, but that many incidents and some bad luck led to the disintegration of the relationships. They might never heal, but there is hope, and it all starts with understanding and with honesty. The last scene is real and touching, and once again it involves Hedges.Not everything works here. The use of classic music in a couple of important scenes is a little too much, a little too much manipulation, and we could have done with a bit of editing of the overuse of beautiful vistas. ""On Golden Pond"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" did a much better job using those to enhance the moment or the passage of time. The film also had a couple of scenes that could be better in the ""deleted sections"" of a Blu-Ray release. This year, ""Moonlight"" kept you wishing for more, didn't spare the darkness and the rawness of the pain. Here, maybe we are given too much, and it might have just ruined a perfect thing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 December 2016,7/10,"At first I complained about the abundance of establishing shots of the town. Not only does every scene open and end with an exterior shot of the town but throughout most of the scenes, we are witness to cut- away shots of the town. Why? As the movie starts to build, we start to understand that the pace of the movie along with the style of directing start to make sense. The movie is slow for a reason. Along with the acting, the pace builds up momentum as we start to learn about the plot. Later, as the story slowly unfolds, we learn more about the main character and the family dynamics that tell its own story. Manchester by the Sea is not a Hollywood movie. More like a Cassavetes movie, it does not begin or end. Instead, we start the story in the middle and abruptly conclude without a resolution. With that said, the movie successfully tells a story that the movie industry and most audiences don't appreciate. Therefore, Manchester by the Sea is a marvel of something you don't see everyday, even though it tells a somewhat simple story. Its the simplicity of many of the scenes that gives Manchester by the Sea its unique quality of a movie. The rawness of the simple characters in this simple town makes the movie real and interesting. If you like special effects with explosions, this is not the movie for you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2020,8/10,"Lee Chandler is damaged goods. A lonely loner, he is dragged back to his home town by his brother's death. Joe Chandler had a weak heart, an alcoholic ex-wife and a 16 years old son, named Patrick.Joe decided to give Lee guardianship of Patrick, without informing him first. This news, coupled with grief does not make Lee particularly happy.While the relationship between Lee and Patrick evolves uneasily, we learn about Lee's tragic past, the reason for his withdrawn personality and his uneasiness in being back home.The key point of the narrative is that some tragedies cannot find a resolution and that even when others forgive you, the most difficult part of starting over is forgiving yourself."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,,"I spent the first 23 years of my life living in what i regard as the original Manchester in north-west England, so I was always going to be intrigued by the title of this film. The small fishing town in Massachusetts is a character in itself and different scenes feature prominently in the cinematography. In fact, by the time I saw the movie at the cinema, Casey Affleck had already deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his stunning - often understated - performance as Lee Chandler, a Boston janitor who has to return to his home town where he is astonished to find that, following the death of his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler), he has been given custody of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges).The story starts with scenes of Lee's life in Boston and it looks like this is a man with immense attitude. Only later do we learn, though one of many flash-backs, that this is not attitude, buy grief, guilt and white-hot anger. Affleck is rarely off the screen and gives a powerful and moving portrayal of a man that just cannot come to terms with his loss. This is not ""About A Boy"" (2002) where the youngster softens the man; this is more ""Ordinary People"" (1980) where deep pain has no ultimate resolution.Among so many memorable scenes, two stand out: one in which very little is said and the music of Albinoni's Adagio has rarely been more heart-rending and another in which Joe meets his wife Randi (Michelle Williams) when little more is said but grief is shown to be unbridgeable. Writer and director Kennth Lonergan has given us a genuine tour de force."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 September 2019,9/10,"Kenneth Lonergan, the writer/director of You Can Count on Me, another finely nuanced film on difficult families and a personal favorite of mine, has done it again here."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 December 2016,9/10,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Superb acting and an honest insightful screenplay make this  family drama all the more memorable.   GRADE: B+   SYNOPSIS: A family tragedy impacts a solitary man who must now suddenly  rearrange his life and priorities.  JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone and everything has been estranged from Lee  Chandler. Divorced, content to do menial work, devoid of close family  ties and dear friends, Lee is a solitary figure ill-prepared for life.  A sudden family tragedy leads him back to his nephew, Patrick, a  confused and angry teenager. Forced into the father role, a role he  personally disdains, Lee must come to terms with his family obligations  in Kenneth Lonergan's powerful drama, Manchester by the Sea.  Written and directed by Mr. Lonergan, the film is an insightful  character study, not only of one man and the challenges he faces on a  daily basis, but of the entire Massachusetts community that he calls  home. We meet his fragmented family, including his brother (in  flashbacks), his ex- wife, and other colorful townies. Not much is said  directly, yet much is inferred as they all allude to Lee's deep dark  secret at various times and we slowly begin to piece together Lee's  broken life and intangible dreams.  The ensemble cast is wonderful. Casey Affleck is mesmerizing as the  desolate Lee. His is an introspective restrained performance. He shows  a man filled with hopelessness and pain, quiet in his words, even if  his actions seem violent and uncontrolled at times. Watching the actor  react with subtle glances away from loved ones or downcast stares to  hide his sorrow is so heartfelt and real. Abandoned by his  dysfunctional parents, Lucas Hedges also brings a nuanced and sincere  portrayal of a teenager left to fend for himself. Giving more than  ample support are Kyle Chandler, Gretchen Mol, and particularly  Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife. While her part does not share  enough screen time, her scene confronting Lee is raw and moving and  sure to earn her some award recognition.  The film has nary a false note, its dialog capturing the real life feel  of a middle class town and its vivid characters struggling over hard  times. The film is all drama without a shred of melodrama or artificial  theatrics. There are some minor directorial missteps however:. Some  intrusive classical music never quite gels with its surroundings and  that mournfulness is far too manipulative and overt, Also, in a small  role, Matthew Broderick suddenly appears. His recognizable screen  persona seems too jarringly out-of-place with the gritty realism of the  film.   That said, Manchester by the Sea is a bittersweet story (with an  emphasis on the first syllable). It is bleak, sad, and melancholy,  perhaps the feel-bad movie of the year. Yet it shows irony, humor, and  love so candidly. Mr. Lonergan's film depicts our flaws, our awkward  moments, our inability to communicate and simply express our emotions.  But, more importantly, his film shows truths that are generally ignored  in today's cinema.   Manchester by the Sea is one of the best film to convey the meaning of  family and all of its complexities in a totally honest and refreshing  way. It is one of the year's best."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 August 2018,7/10,"My Rating : 7/10While the movie is slow paced and rather bland at places, it's effective and works for me.It's a drama set in the middle-class of American society and the ordinary nature of the film makes it enjoyable."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 April 2018,,"The appropriate use of music in films is one of the crucial problems of current cinema, especially in American movies. It is a formula inherited from Tiomkin, Steiner, Waxman, Korngold and Herrmann, and the filmmakers for whom they musicalized: together they packed the complete product (as in ""Gone with the Wind""), without knowing when to stop the music. However, almost a century has passed, sound has made great advances and the effect of omnipresent music has become obnoxious. Was it necessary to punctuate the tragedy of Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) for eight endless minutes, since the moment he goes out to the store one fatidic night, until the scene when he leaves the office of the lawyer who has read his brother's will, with cloying adagio by Albinoni or whoever composed it? For me, the music selection is the detrimental aspect of the film: it has nothing to do with the history, but with the unrestrained sentimentality of director Kenneth Lonergan. I liked the uncle-nephew interplay and all the great drama about pain and death ... The excellent performances by the whole cast are enough to transmit everything! Lee's silences and fists of anger, the panic attack of his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges), the dialogue of guilt and forgiveness between Lee and his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams), the loneliness of Sandy's mother, Jill (Heather Burns)... The inclusion of classics is redundant and mawkish (and the ""house composer"", Lesley Barber, was caught up, judging from his title chorale), gaining more presence than such an adequate soundtrack as the voices of Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald or The Ink Spots. The director did not contain himself. The classics were good for ""Barry Lyndon."" Kubrick excelled at that. Even the hyper-contrast between ""The Blue Danube"" and the spacecraft in ""2001, a Space Odyssey"" was a brilliant move. But Mr. Lonergan is no Kubrick. With 10 or 15 minutes less, a selection of the American songbook and the classics saved for when he drives his car down the road, Kenneth Lonergan would have made a perfect film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 August 2020,9/10,This freaking movie man. Dang it man. This movie...
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,8/10,"This is certainly not your average cineplex fare. The acting, especially by Casey Affleck, is good to very good, as is the direction and the cinematography. It doesn't cheapen itself with warm fuzzy moments. The characters and their reactions all seem very real, very believable.The characters are, none of them, particularly endearing, however. You don't really find yourself rooting for them, or even sympathizing with them, though they get struck by one tragedy after the next. Lee Chandler (Affleck) evidently had a good job as a young man, to judge from his house, despite his heavy drinking. When he loses that life through a careless act, he doesn't seem to be able to do any better for himself than be a poorly-paid handyman. None of that is explained. Would I want to sit through this movie again? Probably not.On the other hand, I wasn't bored for a moment while I watched it, and spent the time admiring the fine performances. It very much held me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,7/10,"Manchester by the Sea is my latest review. Its title sounds like the name of a poem so I guess I'll write it as such. This is gonna be fun. OK, here goes:Manchester by the Sea, a real tragedy. Casey Affleck stars, Massachusetts sure looks pretty. Affleck re-channels his inner Lonesome Jim. There's moping and trudging with angst filled to the brim.""Manchester"" is about grieving and it feels like real life. This is independent film making, rift with strife. There's Bostonian accents and suicide attempts. ""Manchester"" is distressing family drama as quiet as it's kept.It's about alcoholism and bar fights and fishing boats and friends. It's about living a banal existence, the show that never ends. It's about uncles and nephews and coping with death. It's about a brother slash father who takes his last breath.It's about a boy of 16 who loses his papi. The kid is lady-smooth and likes to play hockey. His uncle takes over the willed, guardianship. He has to relocate sans Boston, and it's all from the hip.Matthew Broderick makes a cameo, the dialogue is improvisational. ""Manchester"" is overlong and not always directional. The filmmaker advocates close-ups. The flashbacks are aplenty. There's also wide shots and depression yet sometimes it's mildly funny.The acting is raw, with sequences that are long-winded. Newcomer Lucas Hedges, man is he gifted. Hedges and Affleck, their scenes really crackle. At times they feel bleak, at times they make you cackle.If I had to rate ""Manchester"", I'd give it a ""B"". The critics have really embraced it and so has the Academy. Would I call this film a masterpiece? My answer would be no. It's a character study, a life snapshot. Heck, it's still good to go.Rating: 3 stars."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 January 2017,10/10,"Few films of the 21st century (so far) can even come close to the breathtaking power of ""Manchester by the Sea"". It's a film that depicts grief and one's inner demons in a painfully powerful way, showcasing the greatest acting of the year. Michelle Williams is especially dazzling, despite her brief role. It's a film that made me tear up at multiple point, a film with a heartbreaking power that only the strongest films can have. It's a tragedy. It's a really, really intense and depressing and emotional tragedy. However, it is never boring because of the masterful direction, acting, and script. The film uses both extreme emotions and subtlety. The classic ""show, don't tell"" rule for cinema had been taught time and time again in every film school across the globe, and this film utilizes that tool brilliantly. The film is never overly simple, and it is not afraid to challenge the viewer. A film like this is unpredictable, therefore making it more suspenseful and, indeed, watchable. The characters are all fully developed and you grow to love and care for them. Information is revealed without it being rubbed in your face in pathetic, poorly written dialogue. Instead, much of it is conveyed through images or implying conversations. The cinematography is beautiful. The bleak, winter scenery is used to full advantage and adds to the films beautiful realism. There is not a fake second in this film, it knows how people really talk and act. The conflicts are always believable and engaging, no matter how depressing they may be, and much of the simple dialogue is fantastic due to it being filled with emotion and (believe it or not) a lot of humor! I must admit, despite this film being a tragic, emotional journey through grief and death, it is quite funny, even hilarious, at times. The humor helps us get through some of the more tough scenes, despite the film never holding back.This is a risky masterpiece. It's beautiful, realistic, human, funny, emotional, and profoundly moving."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 February 2017,7/10,"Perhaps my high expectations left me a bit disappointed in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea"", a slow-burning melancholy drama featuring capable performances from Lonergan's cast. The cinematography lends to the title, featuring a New England harbor town in dreary and cold winter. For all the talk of Casey Affleck in the lead, I found the movie to be fairly subdued and muted emotionally save for several scenes. Affleck performed well especially with aloofness, but not Oscar- worthy imo. The only emotional release Lee (Affleck character) seems to get is when he's drunk. This seems quite realistic, and the dialog is well conceived but there's not enough meat on the bone and pathos for this movie to give an outstanding mark. The score/soundtrack is a bit too simple and repetitive as well, and the movie could've cut back another 15 min on its runtime. Still 7/10 and worth a watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 August 2017,9/10,"Manchester by the Sea is at once, one of the best movies of the year and one of the most challenging to recommend. It knocks on the door of greatness by virtue of approaching its subject matter with uncommon sincerity and grace. Yet that subject matter - a concentrated dose of grief in all its uncomfortable bitterness, can't help but feel painfully real. I suppose in the strongest of terms one could say Manchester by the Sea isn't so much a movie. It's more of a human experience.Humanity itself is startlingly realized in the funereal grimace of Lee Chandler (Affleck), whose own brush with personal tragedy has left him adrift in Quincy, Massachusetts. He keeps to himself as an apartment complex handyman, avoiding all meaningful human contact almost as a form of penance. So when his older brother Joe (Chandler) looses his struggle with congestive heart failure, Lee is put in the uncomfortable position of returning to his home town and having to wrestle with the complex emotions it evokes. Shortly before the funeral he reacquaints himself with his seventeen-year- old nephew Patrick (Hedges) who is suddenly left in his charge by the order of Joe's will. ""I'm sorry, I assumed Joe had discussed this with you,"" says the lawyer. ""No he didn't. No, he didn't."" Each reiteration loaded with anguish.The film is laden with tiny moments like the one above; short, affecting and scintillating with unwieldy levels of feeling. Sometimes those emotions are so tightly knotted in the characters personal story that they apex in simple anger and panic. Yet since we know where those emotions are coming from, we automatically identify them even when we can't describe them - complexity through simplicity. In one scene the self-assured Patrick is beguiled by frozen chicken and a silent house into a panic attack. The scene, taken out of context is austere and simple yet loaded with prior knowledge, the simple sequence of events proves emotionally devastating on all counts.So too are the scenes involving Lee's ex-wife Randi (Williams) who's all-too-brief appearance proves poignant, tender and devastating in equal measure. Her dignity and quiet grace bristles with Lee's more turbulent expressions of grief yet her tenderness doesn't so much pour out as it trickles in a tactful display of beautiful, beautiful mercy. Her fate has certainly diverged from that of Lee but despite what we may think of our characters' choices, there's no filling the void in their heart.In that measure, Manchester by the Sea is an uncalculable success, if for no other reason that it explores the way humans of all stripes deal with their grief. Writer/Director Kenneth Lonergan seems to understand humans in ways few do. Every word, every tiny micro-expression, every droll interruption of unexpected humor viciously stirs all those negative emotions we rather not face. He then provides no easy answers but rather allows you to sit in on his small little drama, soak in the quiet homily urging patience, love and understanding and lets it all sink in. Manchester by the Sea is undeniably hard to sit through but damned if it doesn't make you a better person for watching it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 March 2017,10/10,"The main attraction is Casey Affleck's Oscar-winning performance.When we meet Lee Chandler (Affleck) he is personally closed down, working as a handyman for an apartment complex in Quincy, Massachusetts. He is rude to some of his clients, exhibiting a latent anger. In an early flashback Lee is seen affectionately playing with his nephew Patrick aboard the family's lobster boat. For the first part of the movie I was left to wonder what caused the personality shift, that was a hook that kept my interest until the causative tragic event is revealed in a flashback. Credit has to be given to Affleck since he plays two different characters, the Lee before the event and the Lee afterward.As the story develops the focus is on the relationship between Lee and his nephew Patrick. Lucas Hedges is surprisingly good as the teen-aged Patrick, earning an Oscar nomination. Michele Williams, as Lee's wife Randi, also earned an Oscar nomination; the acting carries this movie a long way. But wait, there is more (as the TV commercials say)--an Oscar win for Kenneth Lonergan's original screenplay and an Oscar nomination for him as best director.There is much more to be appreciated beyond the fine acting and powerful story. Filming the movie in Manchester-by-the-Sea makes that setting an additional character. The environment is often used as counterpoint to some of the emotional scenes--a quick cut to an ocean-scape or the serenity of the small New England town allows for digesting what has gone before. The scenes in local bars add a feeling of authenticity. The light Boston accents ground this in the local environment so that it is hard to picture how the story would play out in a different setting.The cinematography does not call attention to itself beyond being professionally done. On second viewing I paid more attention to the lighting and realized that care had been taken with this, particularly in some of the closeups of faces. The score ranges from Handel and Albinoni to popular. The classical pieces provide counterpoint to some of the more emotional scenes in much the same way that the location shots do.There is no sugarcoating in the portrayal of the effect that tragedy has on Lee's life. Each person deals with grief in his or her own way and I found Lee's behavior believable and understandable. One of the beauties of the story is how subtle hints are given as to potential hope for Lee. The first time he smiles, later in the movie, is a breakthrough. An affectionate pat on Patrick's shoulder signals a minor thawing of Lee's chilly isolation. But the story does not reach any expected conclusion. It is heartbreaking when Lee says to Patrick, ""I can't beat it."""
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 January 2017,8/10,"The story of a man with life torn by successive misfortunes and who behaves himself with a strong emotion most often disguised and repressed but exploding now and then. A movie that intrinsically has much to do with us human beings and with our individual, social and familiar reactions before unhappy events. A man who loses his children in a fire of their home caused maybe for his negligence when he forgot to put the protection before the fireplace and whose wife accuses him of that, destroying their marriage. Later on his beloved brother dies suddenly which puts him as his teenager nephew's guardian with whom he has a relationship with ups and downs. Everything is told and shown in a profusion of sudden flashbacks along with the present story which are deeply revealing of all that happened to this man. Excellent performers playing their roles with greatest quality. One of the best movies produced last year dealing with real human beings and without computer special effects, violence or fantasies, a kind of movie that is rare nowadays."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 June 2017,10/10,"""Manchester"" by the Sea"" starts slowly, but builds to where you feel personally involved.At first it's hard to work out who's who and what is happening, but then it all comes together. Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler, a man almost rendered emotionless by events in his past, but who must confront his demons and accept responsibility in an unexpected quarter.For a film that uses flashbacks, which are sometimes hard to tell from real time, and where a lot of what Casey Affleck says is hard to understand, ""Manchester by the Sea"" packs an emotional wallop. But of course, much of that is actually due to Affleck's amazingly vulnerable performance.The film has a sense of place, Massachusetts in winter. The harshness of the season forces people into bulky clothes adding to the sense of isolation and insularity that runs through the film.Without spoiling things too much, the characters in the story are brought together by a death. One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the way they handle their grief – not in an overly emotive way at all. Anyone who has experienced the kinds of things depicted in the film will know that sometimes events are almost too much to absorb and people don't always react as one might expect. This film is full of truthful observations on difficult relationships, especially that between Lee Chandler and his nephew Patrick.The understated score by Lesley Barber works almost as a detached observer. If I have any criticism of the music, it is the rather emphatic use of Albinoni's ""Adagio for strings"" in a critical scene. Whether it was the composer's decision or the director's, it's one of the few obvious touches in a movie that for the most part avoids the obvious.A minor point though in a movie that had already sucked me in.By the end, you don't want it to end; it's that absorbing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 February 2018,,"This Amazon Studios production gets some good (but suss) reviews, however, I'm more inclined to agree with the bulk of comments submitted from those that paid to watch. At first, I felt this movie was the work of a film school student who may have received a grant from Sundance Indi. It's a story peopled by foul-mouthed space cadets from school age and upward. The school-aged are a particularly soulless bunch. The principal lad, who, on learning of his youngish Dads death, simply wants to eat Pizza and go f..k his girlfriend (one of many). His next desire is to play in his raucous teeny band with his equally space-cadet 'other' girlfriend (number ...?) simply awful sounds then emulate from the basement. His dad's brother is a lost cause - he's given up on life since his two daughters died in a house fire. This painfully long and slow movie (2 1/2hrs) seems to take over an Hr to really get going and doesn't just introduce you to these sad characters it clubs you over the head with them.
 
The only person who looks like they belong to the real world is the dead brothers boating business partner. He at least has feelings he's not afraid to show. We are led to think maybe the brother who lost his daughters might have been an OK fella before his life destroying tragedy - that is, until we are treated to one of many flash-backwards - where we witness our 'dad' acting like a drunkard bum with his mindless boozy mates - while his wife vehemently curses them (in no-uncertain-manner) for being so thoughtless toward her and the girls. Again we fast-forward to the now... The fatherless young lad (whose mother had already left for another man) heads to the home fridge to get a frozen TV dinner. Here he breaks up because it reminds him of dad in the morgue. Very little of this comes across as strong enough to ring true as good writing. There is a well-acted scene involving a meeting with the ex-wife of the living brother who wants to apologise but, this ends by going nowhere. A great movie needs more than good acting.Constantly playing in the background (unsuccessfully and way too loudly) is screeching string arrangements of Handel, Albinoni, Massenet, etc. This is a heavy-handed attempt to add a touch of pathos and all smacks of:- 'If Kubrick could do it so can I' (Kubrick was a very mean man who even answered letters sent to him by scribbling in any spaces that may have been left clear). This musical technique only works well when done with class and sadly, there's little on display here. The overly emotional (and I'm usually one of those) or those who cry when the jug boils over will find this marvellous, others, as the many viewer comments confirm, will need a great deal more convincing. Could have been OK with better handling - maybe writer Kenneth Lonergan should stick with his other gross efforts like Gangs of New York. Overall, disappointing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,10/10,"Lee Chandler, a sullen and quiet handyman in Quincy, Massachusetts, receives word from George, a family friend, that his brother Joe has suffered a heart attack. Joe dies before Lee can get to the hospital. Lee goes back to his hometown of Manchester-by-the-Sea to break the news to Joe's teenage son, Patrick. Staying in Joe's home while arranging Joe's funeral, Lee is shocked to learn that Joe named him as Patrick's guardian. Reluctant to commit to the guardianship and unwilling to move back to Manchester, but opposed to returning Patrick to his estranged alcoholic mother, Lee makes plans for Patrick to move back to Boston with him. Patrick, deeply rooted in the Manchester community, objects to the idea.It is shown through flashbacks that Lee once lived happily in Manchester with his wife Randi and their three young children, until his negligence while intoxicated led to a house fire that killed their children. No criminal charges were filed against him, but Randi blamed him for the fire. Lee attempted suicide by pulling a gun from a police officer's holster after being interviewed. The attempt failed and he subsequently moved to Boston, becoming bitter and isolated.Joe's body needs to be kept in storage until spring when the ground thaws and he can be buried. Lee remains in Manchester until the delayed funeral. Over time, Patrick and Lee reestablish their bonds. Lee comes through when Patrick has a panic attack while rifling through the freezer, as he has been constantly bothered by the thought of his father on ice for several months. Conflict continues to arise when Lee refuses to make small talk with the mother of Patrick's girlfriend, Sandy, so that Patrick and Sandy can have sex. Patrick thinks Lee is trying to distance himself from him, especially because Lee is doing all he can to wrap things up and leave Manchester.Patrick's mother Elise learns of the situation and offers to allow Patrick to move in with her, having found religion and sobriety with her new Christian fiancé, Jeffrey. During an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds himself unable to connect with Elise. Elise's hurried departure from the room is followed by the sound of bottles and glass, to Jeffrey's concern. Patrick is later unsettled when his mother's controlling fiancé emails him insisting on being an intermediary in the future, saying that it is best for her.Meanwhile, Lee runs into a remarried Randi and her newborn baby. She expresses great remorse for her treatment of him during the divorce and asks to reconnect. A distraught Lee cannot find the words to respond and leaves before he becomes emotional, parting with the phrase: ""There's nothing there."" She sobs as he walks away. Lee expresses his rage by picking a fight with strangers at a bar, only to be rescued by George.Lee arranges for George and his wife to act as legal guardians for Patrick. When an emotional Patrick asks why Lee staying isn't an option, Lee admits that he cannot bear living in Manchester anymore. During a walk after Joe's funeral, Lee tells Patrick that he is searching for a new residence with an extra room, so that Patrick can visit whenever he wants. In a final scene, Lee and Patrick go fishing on Joe's refurbished boat that Patrick has inherited."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 November 2018,8/10,"This movie is a tour de force of emotion dragging you relentlessly through the stages grief, namely shock, bewilderment, anger, pain and reconciliation.Mr Affleck using his brooding method style to reveal a complex and brooding character that develops and evolves as the movie progresses.There are two clear examples of both masterful acting and directing that I will cite, he turns to drink after a bad experience and goes to saloon, but he tries to avoid intimacy as he can't cope with emotion due to guilt and grief and then the only expression left to him is to fight. All sounds so simple but to convey this and present the psychological depth of dysfunction is both deeply moving and uncomfortable to watch.The other is where Mr Affleck blames himself for the death of his children, he sits bewildered waiting to be condemned for his heinous crime, he waits for the lash, when the police state it's an accident and he can go home he tries to take a gun and blow his brains out. The power of this desperate act was raw and visceral and deeply effecting.I can see this slow and contemplative movie is not very entertaining for some but as an examination of the human condition it is masterful."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,9/10,"Nearly everyone faces an unspeakable tragedy at least once in their lives, and many film have deeply reflected on this emotional phenomenon. Unfortunately nowadays, many of these films tend to fall victim to manipulating audience's emotions with hokey sentimentality and melodrama. Luckily, this film directed by Kenneth Lonergan is not one of those films. Centering on a story of man shattered with grief and tragedy, this film places Casey Affleck in the driver's seat of this powerful emotional roller-coaster and transpires to a riveting tale of a man facing his past and learning overcome a tragedy that puts a gash of the man he once was. Shedding away the use of emotional manipulation and a sappy music score, Kenneth Lonergan draws a path to a heart-wrenching story that rarely feels cinematic but very real in nature. By the end credits, it should come to no surprise if you find yourself using a tissue or two. This film stars Casey Affleck as Lee Chandler, a sulky loner who works as a handyman in Boston isolated from his family and friends. One day, when his older brother Joe (played by Kyle Chandler) dies of a heart attack, he returns to his hometown of Manchester to look after his 16-year old nephew Patrick (played by Lucas Hodges). Upon his return, he is shocked to discover Joe has placed him as Patrick's legal guardian. Haunted by his tragic past, Lee begins wrestling with the decision to either take Patrick with him to Boston, or stay in his hometown -- a place he never wanted to return to.Kenneth Lonergan takes his film in a direction not intended to blackmail viewers in shedding tears but to tell an honest tale about how tragedy can tear not only one person, but an entire family apart. By all means, his effort lands with near-perfection. From the opening minutes of the film, we are introduced to Casey Affleck's Lee Chandler who's definitely not a easy guy to like, he has a sore attitude and at one point, gets in a petty fistfight at a bar. But as the story unfolds, the film proceeds in-and-out through a long series of solidly edited flashbacks that retread unpleasant events from his past that lead to the downfall of his relationships with his family and friend and eventually prompted him to leave the hometown he once new. By his point, your apathy for this character evolves into sympathy as he reveals to be not a bad guy but a man strangled with a brooding past. Before the halfway marks, it becomes clear that the lead character is not the only who's completely broken, his whole family including his nephew Patrick and ex-wife (played by Michelle Williams) are shattered as well. And the story leaves only a small room for occasional humor and levity. There's one scene with Affleck and Michelle Williams late in the film that's tough to sit through and a flashback scene with him and Kyle Chandler early on that pulls at your heart strings. And there is rarely a moment that feels a hokey tearjerker ripped from another cinematic entity.Casey Affleck takes the daunting task of carrying the film on his shoulders, and with a performance so tremendous and powerful; he greatly succeeds. This actor proves capable of carrying on sufficient emotional gravitas and honest sentimentality. Every minute he comes on screen, this talent shines like gold. If this isn't the best role of his career, I don't know what is. Supporting him by his side is Lucas Hodges playing his troubled teenage nephew who struggles trying to maintain a gripping relationship with his uncle who's plunged into sorrow to open with his nephew (or anyone for that matter). His performance stands strong especially for an actor in his late teens. Kyle Chandler, who's appearance is limited to various flashbacks is also quite powerful and worth admiring. Michelle Williams plays Casey Affleck's ex-wife and does not get a great amount of screen time beyond seven minutes or so, does a great job especially in an aforementioned scene with Affleck towards the end. Gretchen Mol does a fine job as Patrick's mother as does Matthew Broderick as her soon-to-be husband, but like Michelle Williams, not a lot of screen time. While the film shines with a diverse cast of powerful performances, it is Casey Affleck who becomes the pedaling force of the film's riveting atmosphere.Manchester By The Sea is a powerful, heartrending film bound with riveting performances by an awe-inspiring cast and a thoughtful direction by Kenneth Lonergan. It is a movie destined not to sweep you away with emotional devastation but a thought-provoking story about family, love, and sorrow that feels thoroughly honest. In a triumphant achievement, it stands tall as one of the most powerful films of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 December 2016,9/10,". . . to which MANCHESTER BY THE SEA makes the addendum, ""but if you do, be sure to bring a gun."" Since I hate to include major spoilers in a review, let me sidestep doing so a little bit by offering an analogy to MANCHESTER. Say that you're Secretariat's groom, the one person in the world that ""Big Red"" loves the most and with whom the legendary thorough-bred race horse feels the most comfortable. Say that ""your"" horse already has won the Derby and Preakness with record times so fast that almost all True Competition has been withdrawn from the third jewel of the Triple Crown--the Belmont Stakes--which your four-legged best buddy is favored to win now by 30 or 40 lengths. Then say that the night before the Big Race you forget to engage the safety lens on the old-school oil lantern which has calmed Big Red every evening since he was born three years earlier, resulting in him burning to death with a stable full of high-priced horses. When you cannot erase their tortured whinnies from your brain, and the police tell you that while your career with horses is toast, you're free to go home, wouldn't you try to use the nearest cop's service revolver to blow your brains out, as Casey Affleck does in MANCHESTER (being too poor to afford his own firearm)? Sure you would. So after watching MANCHESTER, please do not forget to contribute to your local chapter of BANGS (Broke Americans Need Gun Stamps)!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2021,9/10,"After the death of his brother Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck in a brilliant role) becomes guardian of his adolescent nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). At first both are not happy with the situation. This is a very short resume of a film that is however much more suble than this.An adolescent is an adolescent, but why is uncle Lee behaving so strange? He is not bad but he is very surly and a normal conversation with him is nearly impossible. He says as little as possible. The explanation of his socially awkward behaviour and the inpact this has on the relation with his nephew are the two main themes of the movie.Director Lonergan gives the explanation in a series of well timed flashbacks. At first I thought Lee had always been a bachelor. No woman on earth wants such a grumpy man! After a while we learn however that once Lee had a family. Alright his marriage has failed and therefore he is frustrated. The film is well on its way until we learn the horrible truth.However, and this makes the film real great, even the horrible truth does not explain 100% why Lee behaves as he behaves. In the flashbacks from his past we see already elements of his later behaviour. So the question remains if he is ""emotionally constipated"" (a term I borrow from another review) by his past or was his character socially awkward to start with?There are other things the film does not explain. Why did his brother appoint Lee as the guardian of his son in his will? Lee is all but the perfect guardian. Also the relationship between Lee and Patrick does not develop in a linear way (from bad to good) but in fits and starts. However, this in no way makes the movie any worse. After all in real life ""the plot"" is also not entirely logical.The above may give the impression that ""Manchester by the sea"" is a heavy film. This is not true. Given the character of Lee Chandler there are a lot of uncomfortable conversations in the film, and some of them are very funny. My favourite is the one in which Lee accompanies his nephew to the home of Patricks girlfriend. The plan is that Lee will have a conversation with the mother and that Patrick will have a good time with his girlfriend. The total inability of Lee to engage in social talk ruins this plan however."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 November 2016,8/10,"Like its protagonist, Lee, it'd be all too easy to write off Manchester by the Sea as another discouragingly overfamiliar tale of a broken, self-destructive sad sack hurting hadh in Bahstan. But writer/director Kenneth Lonergan is too careful and deliberate a creative force to ignore the humanity in a story due to its well-trod framework. The trappings may be familiar, but Lonergan's ode to compounded grief and the expectations of closure and healing that follow - so elusive they may as well be illusionary - is as bursting with life as sorrow, cementing its unassuming place as of the year's most powerful and moving films. Lonergan's work is understated in the best sense, eschewing big Oscar-clip blowouts in favour of subtle, achingly real moments that propel the story along imperceptibly. His writing deftly scrutinizes the minutiae of the paralyzing fog of personal loss - mountains of paperwork, weather-related funeral logistical delays, 'where did I park my car,' and the myriad of hairline fracture triggers and coping mechanisms - making it achingly real. He demonstrates an almost Jim Jarmusch calibre gift for letting a scene play out in silence, teasing out every grain of tragedy and uncomfortable humour in the process - see any of teen Patrick's thwarted attempts at covert sexual advances, or the excruciating 'stretcher stumble' scene for a bittersweet blend of both. Similarly, Lonergan's flair for interrupting scenes with contextual trauma flashbacks with minimal immediately evident rhyme or reason feels all the more truthful in its clumsiness. If there's a nit to pick, it's that the film's frailly classical musical score is beautiful, but accentuates the drama to a more pandering extent than the rest of the film's no-nonsense sensibilities. That said, the cinematography, including plenty of sweeping panoramas of beautiful seaside Massachusetts completes the package, lending the film the perfect elegiac fragility. Speaking of being masterfully understated: Casey Affleck has just about made a career out of excelling at just that, and his exemplary performance herein is no exception. Affleck wears Lee's silence like an unbearably tense gaping wound, the subtleties of his consistent (non)reactions and agonizingly closed demeanour coupled with impromptu bursts of violence speaking volumes of a man whose emotional core has been gutted still trying, painstakingly, and failing, to carry on. The few vibrant flashbacks where we snag glimpses of the laughing, loving man Lee used to be are all the more harrowing by contrast, and Affleck encapsulates the extremes of both with a raw, affable, unforgettable honesty. Lucas Hedges is just as superb as Affleck's teenaged nephew, and an interesting dynamic is forged between them: the teenager who seems almost infuriatingly functional and confident in the wake of unspeakable personal tragedy compared to the adult mentor transparently going to shambles. Still, Hedges is talented enough to sow the seeds of cracks therein, and his performance - half acerbic comic relief, half emotional centrepiece - is every bit as noteworthy. Similarly, Michelle Williams and Kyle Chandler are each astonishingly moving in their preciously few scenes, too wrenchingly, volcanically emotive and committed to the deep suffering of their characters to ever succumb to being reductive plot devices. And that Matthew Broderick cameo? Has to be seen to be believed. Manchester by the Sea isn't perfect - it's tangibly overlong, and capped by a boldly abrupt, closure-defying ending, which straddles being unorthodox but fitting, or courting snickers of derision. Still, it's a prime example of a familiar story told with affecting, resonance and gusto, buoyed by spectacular, unshowy performances and plentiful bursts of crisp humour that make the tragedy all the more accessible. And if you're ever in need of a mantra for instant, crushing heartbreak: ""I can't beat it, Paddy"" should just about do it. -8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 September 2020,,"A sad film about life as it is lived in the real world, with unassuageable pain, loose ends untied, life lessons unlearned. Life with no narrative closure. A man bearing the burden of a terrible tragedy, which explains his exile from the place where he grew up; the situation appears to offer the familiar trope of an unsympathetic guy redeemed by the responsibility of parenthood and odd-couple friendship with the quasi-child. Yet things don't work.."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 June 2020,2/10,"A little way into this dreary film our main character played by Casey Affleck sees two men looking at him in a bar. He goes up to them in a slow hostile way and asks them if they know him. They do not and he smashes into the face of one of the men. He is not threatened by them and it is plain assault. He is not arrested, but just taken out of the bar. I am not sure if this was a homophobic attack but it made me sick. Scenes like this sicken me and I frankly no longer cared about him or the rest of the film. And Affleck's acting is not so great either. I will be in an almost total minority in pointing out this scene that has no just punishment, and the message to me was men cannot look at men without a reason. If they were gay men he could have just walked out of the bar, but no they were easy prey for his frustration and anger. A preceding scene with a woman was bad as well. But everyone it seems finds this a good to brilliant film. A 2 for their right of believing that."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,7/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a heavy drama with sad and shocking moments, but is it the best movie of the year? In my opinion is not, in several respects, I found the film a lot longer than I should have, even though I think Affleck's character was excellent, I thought he had a lot of exaggerated moments, the script is very good, but I believe he would be even better If the film had a shorter duration, the direction of Kenneth Lonergan is very good, but also I think it would be better with a shorter duration, the acting is the strong point of the film, Casey Affleck gives a performance show, without doubt the favorite of Oscar (I think Ryan Gosling does not deserve more than Affleck), Michelle William is also great, and is a favorite for best actress Supporting, Kyle Chandler is very well, and Lucas Hedges does a good performance, but no performance Level Oscar, so I think it should not have been indicated, the photograph is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect for the tone of the film, plus the film can get tiring at times because of its long duration, more with a Slow pace Note 7.6"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 August 2017,8/10,"In a year dominated by the likes of 'La La Land' and 'Moonlight', 'Manchester by the Sea' went very much under the radar to start with, but is now rightly getting the acclaim it deserves. This is an excellent film and in many ways a fascinating character study of someone going through a life tragedy. It's raw, realistic and powerful, and benefits from some outstanding acting performances.Casey Affleck is an actor I hadn't seen too much from before this film, but his performance in 'Manchester by the Sea' was masterful. He got his character in this film spot on. I also think that Lucas Hedges deserves a mention for such a mature and realistic performance as Patrick. He sure has a bright future ahead of him if this film is anything to go by.'Manchester by the Sea' is one of the best films of 2016. It's a depressing picture with some dark themes, but is truly engrossing and beautifully shot. 'La La Land' and 'Moonlight' were both great, but if I had to pick a film to recommend from 2016, it would probably be this one or the overlooked 'Captain Fantastic'."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 March 2018,7/10,"Two parallel stories take place in this film: in the present, Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) is a reserved janitor in a small Massachusetts town who must deal with tragic family news and travel to a nearby small town to help deal with the aftermath; in the other story, Lee's past is told - a past in which he was married to Randi (Michelle Williams) and raising three small children.In the beginning, it takes a while to get used to the fact that almost every character in this film is a potty-mouth. But once this hurdle is passed, it's relatively easy to show an interest for these folks even if we don't quite warm up to them. The screenplay by Kenneth Longergan (also the movie's director) is quite clever in how it gradually reveals elements of the past and how they explain present circumstances.It's great to see Williams in a role that is rough-edged. So often, she has been typecast into mousy, quiet characters. Even if she plays such characters well, it's great to see another side of her talent. Near the end, her talents are top-notch in a scene in which she makes amends for her past. She's quite gripping here and it's a shame she spends too little time on screen.Affleck certainly does a fine job in his role as well but it's difficult to see why his performance has dominated the awards season. As someone with a difficult past and dealing with a current tragedy, it's easy to seen why his character is so restrained. Though there are occasional outburst moments, the role would have been more complete if there had been a scene of catharsis - like the previously mentioned one for Williams.Like the recent ""Moonlight"", ""Manchester by the Sea"" is a fine film but I personally find both films somewhat over-rated."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 December 2016,10/10,"Two water scenes frame the narrative and establish the central character's fall from grace and failure of redemption. The water scenes — like the title — are significant because they provide the serenity and beauty in counterpoise to the characters' roiling emotions, anger and guilt. Manchester is the troubled human community that abuts the surrounding, supportive sea. In the opening scene Lee, happy and carefree, frolics with his young nephew Patrick on brother Joe's boat. In their play Lee teases Patrick that he, Lee, should be the person Patrick should choose as best able to help them survive on a desert isle — not the boy's father. But the bulk of the film demonstrates the increasing gap between the competent Joe and the self destructive Lee. The film gradually reveals how the carefree Lee fell into the violent despair of his later life. Lee is broken when his drunken binge turns into the fire that kills his three children. He retreats into a life of menial chores and drunken, belligerent evenings. On Joe's death, Lee struggles to escape his brother's assignment to be Patrick's guardian and trustee. Yet that first scene establishes the memories and the relationship that would make Patrick want Lee to be his guardian, regardless of his present state.Handyman Lee can fix anything but himself. Although he recovers something of his earlier relationship with Patrick, Lee can't bring himself to accept responsibility for him. ""I can't beat it,"" he says, ""I can't beat it."" The ""it"" is his guilt and self-loathing that linger from his children's' death. Lee can't accept his ex-wife's impassioned forgiveness, precluding any chance of his own peace and self-acceptance as well as hers. His violent outbursts against others hide/reveal his inability to forgive himself. When the police interview him about his children's death, he is as much disappointed as surprised that they will not be punishing him. ""You mean I can go?"" ""It's no crime to forget to put back the fire screen.""In the last shot Lee and Patrick sit on the pier fishing. They are together but apart — as they are in every one of their conversations when the language that should connect them separates them instead. Their elliptical conversations are bridges that only widen the gaping gap. At the end the men have a new camaraderie and closeness — but it is only partial and late. It rests upon Lee having finalized his detachment from Patrick and arranged for another couple to adopt him. Patrick's cheeky but fond insults contrast to Lee's inability to express sentiments at all. Instead of openly admitting he's rented a flat with an extra room for Patrick to visit, Lee says it's to provide more room for his own stuff. To his ex-wife's desperate apologies Lee can only hide behind a shell of stammering. Young Patrick shows more aplomb in handling the nervous chatter of his mother, when she briefly flirts with the notion of having him come live with her and her new Christian fiancé (played by Lonergan's standby for flawed righteousness, Matthew Broderick). The water scenes — set in summer flashbacks, against Lee's winter present — emblematize the grace from which Lee falls and which his failure to forgive himself prevents recovery. A gull at the end of the credits suggests the soaring spirit that Lee has lost. As the most poignant loss is played against a powerful theme from Handel's Messiah, the later Lee's only joyful scene in the present plays against a song that merges romantic and spiritual love, ""I'm Beginning to See the Light."" As usual Lonergan assumes an emblematic cameo himself. In You Can Count on Me (2000) he played the minister who posits the film's central theme: ""Can you believe that your life is important?"" That question hangs over Lee here as it did over James Franco's earlier hero. Here Lonergan plays the passer-by who hears Lee swearing at Patrick. ""Good parenting,"" he snaps, provoking Lee's profane response. As it happens, Lee could be Patrick's effective father- substitute, if only he could reset his life with self-acceptance. This is a very brave film. It takes courage to unfold at such a languorous pace, with such spare and pointed music, with dialogue that leaves so much unspoken and such nuanced performances. This year we've had few scenes as rich as Casey Affleck's performance after Joe's funeral, especially the compound inflections of his glance when he meets his ex-wife's new man. Affleck deserves the Oscar hype. So does Lonergan for daring to tell a story of contemporary guilt and shame where no character finds an easy redemption and the hero a bare gesture towards one. Occasionally fishing with your nephew is a far cry from assuming the responsibility he wants and needs you to."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2018,4/10,"The negligent drunk dad that starts a fire and go out at night to fetch more bear after a party where he diss the wife was not credible for me. Especially that in previous scenes he was looking in love and the kids were lovely as well. This film is in the dark alley of the writer-director, yes. It's basically the slices of life of psychopaths in hell on earth. Makes sense! The USA!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 August 2018,8/10,"Surprisingly, it has great humor. The protagonists deal with depression and guilt and lost. Some scenes, and one in particular, is as well done as any scene ever. Absolutely crushing and totally realistic and perfect."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,10/10,"So this movie has been making a lot of noise over the past few weeks. I keep seeing the ads, decorated with all the nominations it's getting. It's December, of course. It's a big time for Oscar buzz... and Oscar bait. The ads made it seem like this would fall somewhere in between. But I went in with high hopes. I sat back and said to myself, ""Ok, movie. Blow me away."".I felt like a house was dropped on top of me. I cannot believe what I just watched. If there is a better film this year than Manchester by the Sea, I'm going to end up in the ER . This is the kind of film that makes me want to be a filmmaker. A film that is so good, you need to immediately talk to the first person you see coming out of it. A film that rips your soul out from your chest in one scene, and makes you die laughing in the very next scene. A film that sucks you into another world, and disappoints you when the credits eventually roll. But when you leave that theater, the real world doesn't seem the same to you. You've become smarter and more compassionate person. That is the power of a great film, and Manchester by the Sea possess that power.Without spoiling anything, Manchester by the Sea explores the toll that tragedy takes on a single person, and how difficult it is to move on from it. Why some people are as sad and alone as they are, and for reasons that most people can never truly understand. For a person so wrought with grief, anger and humiliation, is there ever a light to rescue you from the darkness? Does it get better? In it's own unique way, Manchester by the Sea shows you that it does.Casey Affleck has arguably become one of the finest actors of our times. In my humble opinion, he's light years ahead of his famous brother. He gives a career defining performance here that puts to rest any competition going forward this season. 2017 is his year. May the golden statuette be his to lose. Michelle Williams gives an outstanding supporting performance as his ex-wife, who without much screen times leaves just as big an impression on the audience as Affleck. Lucas Hedges is also a total breakout star, as the nephew.Everything here works. The writing, the editing, the breathtaking cinematography.. even the beautiful score. There isn't a flaw I can think of for the moment, and let's all hope it stays that way. Unless anything major happens in the foreseeable future, Manchester by the Sea is the best film of the year.I've just started my December watch list, mind you. There's a lot more out there right now. I'm on Cloud 9."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2016,8/10,"Kenneth Lonergan is a name that I didn't recognize because I've never seen any of his work. So basically for me, this film came out of the blue. Its getting early award buzz especially for Casey Affleck in the lead role. And I've got to say, its well deserved. The film is shot in and around Massachusetts, which genuinely looks beautiful in the film. Even the scenes involving winter just looked so gorgeous, serene, and real. Real is a word I think springs to mind for this film because its so genuine and just seems like an everyday story of a guy you might know. Affleck is a great actor, I enjoy a lot of his work. There was no way I was going to be let down by his performance. Its so effortless; Affleck just embodies the role of a distant loner of a man who is surrounded by grief. New responsibilities come upon him with the death of his brother. He isn't just haunted by this event in the present but also by harrowing events of his past. Affleck's Lee Chandler gets a character study that never tries to be overbearing with its emotion. Yet there's pain in his eyes throughout the film.Lonergan uses flashbacks throughout the film, which seems to be a popular (yet prosperous) form of storytelling. Events of Chandler's past are intertwined with the present. The film does enough of a job of showing why this troubled, down out of luck man, is overcome by the tragic circumstances of his life. Michelle Williams is not in this film for long but she is great in a spectacular scene with Affleck in its third act. Even Lucas Hedges is great in the film. Hedges and Affleck's interactions bring the humor in what should be an otherwise dark film (but it really isn't). Without spoiling anything, there are two scenes that pack a punch and they both are very short. I don't think this film treads any brand new ground but it does what it needs to do and it does it very well. I've been wrong about Oscar predictions in the past but surely Affleck is the frontrunner for Best Actor.8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 January 2019,10/10,"It has some beautiful scenery, stunning camera work and the cinematography is superb. The directing and writing is Oscar worthy and I'm glad it won two, one for best original screenplay that Kenneth Lonergan won and it was a great and original screenplay. The story has so much heart and emotion, it's depressing as hell but its written with such perfection that it makes you see past the depressing nature and see the heart of the movie. This was a drama that will go down in history as it shows on every level how a perfect drama should be, great writing in overall story and characters plus the depth.Casey Affleck's performance is just deep and believable, it's remarkable how much emotion he shows and the acting capability is huge in him. As you get to see the flashback events play out you notice how the character is how he is, how depressed he really is and it's truly heart breaking to watch but its quality drama and strong acting made it extraordinary. The rest of the cast was also good, doing some good performances but Casey stood out the most."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,8/10,"..should you want to consider being on the upper level of acting royalty.. then if you are a young woman, put yourself in the place of Michelle Williams and act the part of Randi Chandler in Manchester by the Sea.. it is a crucial but a relatively small screen-time role in this wonderful production.. and it might be easy enough to just get through it, and move the story along.. instead, she just makes it one of the most memorable performances of the entire film.. and although many might not think it true.. cements the statue nomination and win for him.. the best actors don't know how to do it any other way, but to give every part no matter how big or small their entire effort and talent.. she'll just keep doing it that way, there's no other choice for her.."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 March 2019,6/10,"Part of the trouble with the reputation of a film preceding it is the film rarely lives up to the hype. At least, that has been my experience. If I go into a movie with my own idea of what it will be and the movie delivers, I feel it is a good movie. However, if my idea of the movie is skewed based on what I've heard about it, then I might be disappointed if it doesn't match what I was expecting. This is why I'll likely watch a trailer for a film, but I won't read any reviews of it until I've already seen it.For Amazon's successful foray into filmmaking, part of me expected a lot out of Manchester by the Sea (2016). After all, they don't necessarily have to ascribe to the same processes and procedures that hold down other production companies. Add to this my impression that the story of Manchester by the Sea was quite depressing and my mental preparation to watch a sad film. Unfortunately, because the first expectation led to an underwhelming result, the second expectation didn't have the impact I thought it would. Don't get me wrong; there are a lot of elements adding together to try and make the film quite sad. From the plot to the music, the theme of loss is strong throughout. However, the characters soldier on.I'm not sure if it was the often confusing flashbacks or the slow plot progression (they should have just called it ""Casey Affleck drives around in a jeep . . . a lot""), but there was only one truly impactful scene in the film. If the filmmakers were trying to make a movie about an emotionally numb man who successfully deals with the death of his brother, then they have succeeded.Not as sad or as good as I was expecting, I give Manchester by the Sea 3.0 stars out of 5."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 January 2017,8/10,"What's odd about 2016 is that we've gotten a bunch of films about grief. Summertime gave us Captain Fantastic and December was Collateral Beauty. The good news (which is ironic given it's subject matter) is that there is always an audience for them as people die all the time. Death can be a tough subject that changes lives, especially to the living of those close to them. So why are a lot of people unprepared when the ticking moment finally happens? Probably because we don't like to think about it and what troubles it could bring us. Most of us would rather enjoy the happy moments if there are any. Though the idea is scary, I have sat down with my parents to find out whose going to take care of whom. Whose going to deal with the financial stuff and what about the house? These were legitimate concerns that I wanted to get a better understanding of. Sometimes, people are given responsibilities that their not even ready to get. This might include a house they can't get to or a collection they can't sell. Maybe even possibly custody of a child. The latter is explored in Manchester by the Sea. Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) is a janitor working in Quincy, Massachusetts who is introverted and is quick to action when confronted. He gets a call one morning about his brother Joseph (played by Kyle Chandler) being in an accident. After driving up north to see what the deal is, Lee finds out that Joseph has died from a heart attack. He then heads to the town of Manchester-by-the-Sea to tell Joseph's son Patrick about his fathers passing. We're shown initially that Lee used to be close to his nephew, but after a tragedy happened, they've haven't spoken in a while. Going into town, Lee sees that Patrick (played by Lucas Hedges) is now sixteen and happens to be a popular student. He tells his nephew of his fathers passing and vows to stay with him until the funeral. This seems to be a set back as Lee discovers that Joseph had set up his will for Lee to be Patrick's guardian. Lee doesn't feel like he's up for the responsibility, as he is still keen on returning to his old life. Patrick isn't too wild about the arraignment either as he would rather stay with his mother, who Lee has shunned. Lee also faces his ex-wife Randi (played by Michelle Williams) who may still have feelings for him.Manchester by the Sea is definitely not a fun movie to sit through. It is, however, a really good drama to witness. For a story about an adult having to look after a child, you'd think that I would go into a route where a lot of stereotypical stories like this go. The good news is that the stories handles itself very maturely, and seems to Segway like something that would happen in real life. I could see something like this going they way it's going, especially in the northeast. If there's something that this movie proves is that the Affleck family is really talented. Casey Affleck is the perfect actor for this kind of role. He looks like a person whose been carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders for a long time. Though their not in the movie that often, Kyle Chandler and Michelle Williams leave some heavy footprints with their performances. Though Manchester by the Sea is set in the gloomy winter, it's still photographed beautifully, giving a lot of the emotion both scope and claustrophobia. I'll give this eight boat motors out of ten. Manchester by the Sea happens to be real story about real people. I'd say that if your looking for something more fun, your not going to find it here. But it is engaging and deserves to be one of the best of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea, is one of the few films of last year, or really of any number of recent years that I could say that is deeply and truly a full fledged masterpiece of a film in each and every aspect. This is a film that not only delivers what I think are some of the best performances by both seasoned actors and actresses and some who are just starting out from any film this year, but also such a deeply layered screenplay with such great insight and character study that it truly puts many other films to shame because this film is from an original screenplay and in a time and era of so much that is not new, or remade, or a sequel to this or that, it is so refreshing to have a film with this much talent behind it that truly does not disappoint. The main character here played in what I think is the best male performance of last year by Casey Affleck, is an absolutely fascinating character not only to watch, but also to study and there is so much depth and feeling to this character that even if you do not notice it right away, or even on your first viewing of the film, it becomes so obvious later on and this is a character that truly is one of the most realistic and yet what a well done observation of what is essentially an antihero, who has gone through so much in his still very young life and how what has happened to him has essentially haunted him and has not only changed him for the short time being, but perhaps forever. One aspect of Affleck's character that I don't know how widely recognized it was from most people, was the simple fact that this is a character who is basically a functioning alcoholic. When, I say that I mean he is in all regards an alcoholic, but in some ways and then again in other ways not so well, he has integrated himself into society and can hold down a job and provide for a roof over his head, but at the same time we see how much this man is both at odds with himself and other people. Events that have happened to him have not only traumatized him, but have cost him what could have been the best years of his life. His mere existence now is just getting through each and every day and we see how much guilt he throws upon himself for past mistakes and how he can't force himself to come out of the barrier, or shell if you would like to call it that he has surrounded himself in. Part of this is because of his own insecurity and feelings of guilt and remorse, but also in part for the fact that he wants to protect himself and his feelings as he has already been very damaged in this aspect and he truly needs all the help that he can get to lead to forgiveness for himself, but also forgiveness and acceptance of others. He despises himself so much that he has virtually no contacts whatsoever in his life and he says much to little to anyone he encounters and we know truly he is a broken person in much need of healing. The only thing to bring him comfort, or to set his soul at rest is more alcohol which just adds fuel to the fire and is not helping anything, but instead making things much much worse. This is a very natural performance by Affleck, in the sense that it is so believable and I think that most people will immediately be able to relate, or find some sort of attachment to him and his predicaments because all the various things he feels and that are going on in his head, we have all had to deal with at one point or another. We not only have sympathy for this character, but we have also invested our time and interest on him and we can only hope that things turn out better. In this day and age and what could very well be a very politically correct year at the Academy Awards, by giving people awards based on things other than talent because some people got up and squawked and made noise because they were not nominated last year and ended up making a whole racial and political thing over it when it was definitely not necessary. I hope Affleck wins Best Actor, but in my gut I am afraid that the awards will be more politically minded and it will go to someone else instead simply to please an audience instead of giving credit to a performance well done. All the supporting performances in here are also fantastic and deserve all the accolades that they are receiving. This is one of the best character studies in recent years and of all the Best Picture nominees I have seen thus far, this film outshines them all by many miles. What a wonderfully scripted and made film that I am glad has caught on with audiences and I hope many more will discover it on rentals, or streaming because this is too good a film to see just once, but with repeated viewings you will discover what hidden joys and treasures this film possesses and truly there are a lot of them. As it stands the absolute best film I have seen of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 November 2016,9/10,"This is one of the best movies of the year. It is sure to make most critics ten best list and get a ton of recognition this awards season.Of course there are flaws. Written and directed by movies tend to be too long. Casey Affleck is getting plenty of Oscar buzz but actually he plays his role in one note. He's still gives the Casey Affleck the beaten down hunched over little to say performance, but it works here. He manages a smile for one moment in the back of the boat.. All the performances are excellent. An exception to the great casting is the appearance of Matthew Broaderick in a small distracting role.There are plenty of flashbacks that require a bit of ""is this a flashback"". The obvious clue is if dead Joe is in the scene, it must be a flashback. Excellent use of flashbacks to explain where and why things are as they appear.There are an abundance of dialogue driven scenes and a good number of scenes where we watch from a far and the action and the music tell the story.It's an intelligent movie that looks good on the big screen. It's in limited release and worth seeking out. It's also the kind of story that will play well in the comfort of your home. Don't miss it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 January 2017,7/10,"""MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is the feel good movie of the year.""Said no one, ever.Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, this dour film follows a janitor, Lee Chandler, as he heads back to his hometown of Manchester (by the sea) when his brother passes away.  Lee is given guardianship of his nephew, Patrick, and Lee must decide whether to stay in Manchester with his nephew, despite deep wounds that drove him from Manchester in the first place or does he pull Patrick away from the only life he knows.Casey Affleck stars as Lee and this is a perfect match of actor and character.  Lee is taciturn, melancholy and depressed with very little emotions showing.  This is EXACTLY the type of actor that Affleck is - one who does not show a whole lot of emotion on his face, but you can tell there is a great amount of emotion bubbling just below the surface.  It is an Academy Award winning performance and, I believe, that Affleck will walk home with the Best Actor trophy Assisting Affleck in this film is the great Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife, Randi.  A trauma in their past has blown these two apart.  It is clear that Randi has moved on (or has tried to move on) while Lee has just run away and returning to this town will make Lee confront this trauma.  Williams is equally terrific in her role - and has the ""ACADEMY AWARD"" scene (you know, the big emotional explosion scene) which is in stark contrast to the repressed emotions of Lee.  I believe that Williams will get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Unfortunately for this film and the audience, Williams is only in the film for about 20 minutes, but it is the best 20 minutes of the film.  Williams and Affleck have clear screen chemistry and that jumps off the screen.Doing workmanlike, strong, work are Kyle Chandler as Lee's brother (seen in flashbacks) and Lucas Hedges as Lee's nephew.  Chandler is as good here as I have seen him while Hedges more than holds his own against these powerhouses.The trouble I have with this film is the script and the direction - both by Lonergan.  This films starts on a melancholy, troubled and dark tone and goes DOWNHILL from there.  Lee is depressed - and rightfully so - and we follow this depressed man for 2 hours.  It is draining and I don't think it pays off well enough in the end to justify the journey.The performances of Affleck and Williams are worth the journey, but that's about it. If you like good acting, and can handle the dourness of the film, then you are in for a treat.  If not, I would suggest you skip this one and take my word for it that Affleck deserves the Oscar he is going to get.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 December 2016,3/10,"Manchester-by-the-Sea is a small town in northeastern Massachusetts. It has just over 5,000 inhabitants and is just over 18 square miles in area, just under half of which is water. The town is 35 miles outside of downtown Boston and sits on Massachusetts Bay, offering residents and visitors beautiful views and a variety of outdoor recreational activities. Manchester-by-the-Sea saw significant population growth starting in the late 1800s, after it became a popular summer residency community for Boston society. For most of its nearly four centuries of history, the town was known simply as Manchester, but the name was changed in 1989 to Manchester-by-the-Sea in order to distinguish it from nearby (and much larger) Manchester, New Hampshire. There. You have now learned more about the world around you than you are likely to learn from the plodding family drama ""Manchester by the Sea"" (R, 2:17).Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is not having a good decade. He's divorced and living a solitary life as a janitor in a suburb of Boston. He is also struggling to get past an unspeakable personal tragedy. His guilt and grief have turned him into a self-centered and joyless man who drinks too much, swears at people who annoy him a little and starts bar fights with people who annoy him just a little more. And then his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), dies of a heart attack before there's even any gray in his hair. Their parents are also departed, their only cousins have moved to Minnesota and Joe's ex-wife, Elise (Gretchen Mol) is an alcoholic who is living somewhere else. All of this leaves Lee with the sole responsibility for making the final arrangements for his brother, deciding what to do with his brother's house and boat and (at least temporarily) taking care of Joe's only child, a 15-year-old son named Patrick (Lucas Hedges).Lee is shocked to learn that his brother has named him Patrick's guardian. Joe's will is detailed and thorough in providing for Patrick's care and Lee's needs, but Joe had neglected to talk to Lee about any of it. As Lee stays in Joe's house while working through all this, he uncomfortably assumes a parental role, but is reluctant to fulfill Joe's wishes as written. We see flashbacks of Lee bonding with his nephew when they were younger, as well as scenes from Lee's marriage to his ex-wife, Randi (Michelle Williams). In the present, however, Lee's interactions with his ex are awkward (as are his interactions with just about everyone else in his hometown) and Patrick is an intelligent, but practically non-communicative teenager who plays hockey, is in a band and has two girlfriends with whom he's sexually active. Patrick doesn't want to leave his home and Lee doesn't want to move back home. Something's gotta give.The biggest thing this film has going for it is its main cast. Affleck, Hedges and Williams are especially good, while the other performances range from serviceable to awkward, much like the script. Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan gives us a story that's uncomfortable and unfulfilling. Actually, the few comedic moments are more entertaining than the main family drama. The movie is overwrought and its plot just shows us the kind of things that many families have to go through at some point, while offering us little insight into the human condition, or even hope for these barely likable characters. (There's more to bringing a movie to a close than simply rolling the credits.) You may appreciate the cast and sympathize with their characters, but that's not enough reason to visit to ""Manchester by the Sea"". ""C"""
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 March 2017,6/10,"If you are into movies where the narrative and characters are the prime focus of the movie then Manchester By the Sea is for you. The movie was well liked during awards season and deservedly so.The movie follows the relationship between Patrick (played by Lucas Hedges and Ben O'Brian) and his uncle Lee (Casey Affleck) following the death of Patrick's father. Lee is certainly a troubled character and the same can be said for Patrick. The entire movie is focused on getting to know the characters and the events that have shaped their characters. It is beautifully shot and played especially by Casey Affleck who deserves all the plaudits he got for the role. Very entertaining film, but definitely one for the adrenaline junkies to avoid."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 January 2019,7/10,"I watch this film a year ago and forgot 60% of what happend and it was on T.V again so i watched it twise now. This film is so depressing to watch the nephew just plods along and never talks to his uncle about his losses. The nephew just wants to get laid.
He says i need to bury my father and is sad about it but he then has time for two girlfriend. I thought the uncle might move on with his life by the end of the film but all he did was put all his time in setting up the teenagers future. The uncle had lots of dinking buddies pre family tragedy but why none after.
sad film"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 July 2018,4/10,"Kenneth Lonergan's award-showered offering from 2016 perhaps once does enough to justify all the praise, in a scene of almost vomited-out guilt, love, sadness and forgiveness between the formerly-married Randi and Lee Chandler (Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck). But 137 minutes is a lot of time to include just a couple of minutes of brilliance. And it is brilliance diluted by plenty of film-making arrogance, given the way most audience members will become quite lost at the start, before beginning to pick up what is going on at some later point.The Casey Affleck part is the key one here, but boy do circumstances conspire to make it hard to feel anything at all for his erratic, mostly diffident, though regularly violent character. So a tragedy has irrevocably messed up his life, but it is one he contributed to, even if the police refuse to pin anything on him, as no offence has really been committed. The worst thing Lee does is take drink and drugs and revel in a foul-mouthed manner with a party of his equally-intoxicated mates, thereby preventing his (equally foul-mouthed) mother-of-three wife from getting the sleep she needs. And then, when he finally waves his guests off home in he small hours, his first thought is obviously not to go to bed, or to clean up, or to tuck in his kids, but rather to buzz off to the all-night store to get more provisions, thereby abandoning the rest of his family to their fate.I've got problems of my own, without devoting too much sympathy to this guy... Roll forward to the present day, and suddenly Lee is left with responsibility for his brother's now-fatherless boy, as rather well-played by Lucas Hedges.At first glance, you may think this is all Oscar fare because it takes a heavier-than-heavy serious story and features a host of dysfunctional characters, as well as including **ck in almost every sentence, in the midst of mostly-dull-as-ditchwater dialogue. But the truth here is worse, for - read and presented in another way - this could indeed have been a moving film about one brother who would like to live on but has his life cut short by disease thinking up a perfect if risky strategy by which to give his tragedy-struck brother a chance to emerge from his zombie-like state and start again. That's actually a great story which deserved better highlighting than it got.For out here among we real-life watchers, the film - associated with simply atrocious soundtrack choices culled from classical music - can be seen to wander on in incoherence and misery, with limited plot input and confusing story-telling, and a main message that reads that some tragedies (aka self-inflicted screwups) can't ever be overcome. Well, thanks a lot for that!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 December 2016,7/10,"Kenneth Lonergan wrote and directed this critically acclaimed movie about immense grief and loss. The story is about Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), a man who left behind the town of Manchester to work as a janitor near Boston. He is called back when his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) dies from a heart condition. Lee discovers in Joe's Will that he is the guardian of Joe's son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). The movie slowly doles out information about Lee's history as the story progresses and about a third of the way through the fateful reason for his departure from Manchester is revealed. The grief builds to a haunting crescendo so unexpectedly after lulling viewers into a calm that is they ruthlessly ripped from them just like the characters. The scenes are horrifying and disturbing as it quickly jumps back to the main story. Affleck and Hedges are great together bouncing of dialogue and not addressing the sadness that lies underneath the surface.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 January 2017,10/10,"Wow! I'd heard all about the Oscar hype surrounding this film but to be honest, while I thought I would be seeing a solid and well-made indie film, I went into it without great expectations of having an 'enjoyable' time: the trailer had ""angst"" written all over it. And – sure – it is emotional and harrowing in places. However, I was completely knocked out by the depth, the intelligence and the humour of this masterpiece.'Family troubles' is a common trope for the movies, and I was strongly reminded at times in watching this movie of a multi-Oscar winning classic of my youth: Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" back in 1980. In that film the relationship between parents (Mary Tyler-Moore and Donald Sutherland) and their teenage son (Timothy Hutton) is rocked by the accidental death of another family member. Similarly, in ""Manchester by the Sea"" a drifting handyman Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck, ""Triple 9"", ""Interstellar"") gets the shocking news that his only brother Joe (Kyle Chandler, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") has suddenly passed away, leaving behind a mid-teens son Patrick (Lucas Hedges) with no-one to look after him.With the other option being an unstable and ex-alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) – now divorced and living in a strictly pious household with new husband Jeffrey (Matthew Broderick) – Joe has legally plumped for naming Lee as the boy's guardian. This is much to Lee's surprise and annoyance. For Lee is a man-adrift: an antisocial loner with a very short fuse. Having any sort of responsibility is not in his game plan.With the ground too frozen to bury his brother, Lee is forced to remain in Manchester-by-the-Sea for a few weeks: a town he can't stand and a town that, for some reason, can't stand him. Can Lee's attitude be softened by his lively and over-sexed nephew? Or will he just continue his emotional and social decline towards a gutter and a brown-bag? Where this film surprises – with a strong kick to the gut – is that while I have described the high-level story in the paragraphs above that the trailer depicts, there is a whole other dimension to the tale that is hidden and truly astonishing. No spoilers, but if you are not shocked and moved by it, then you need your humanity chip reset.Casey Affleck is Oscar-nominated now for Best Actor and I would love to see him win for this. I had a real go at his brother, Ben, for a lack of facial variation in his performance in ""Live By Night"". Here, while Casey has a similar dour and pretty rigid demeanour, his performance is chalk-and-cheese compared to Ben. He channels a shut-down rage in his eyes that is both haunting and disturbing in equal measure.Young Lucas Hedges – overlooked by the BAFTAs (he is in the ""Rising Star"" category) but yesterday nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar – is equally strong, burying his teenage grief in guitars, sex and smart phones in a highly believable way.Supporting roles are equally strong, with Michelle Williams – albeit only having limited screen time – delivering truly memorable scenes, notably the street encounter with Lee (as featured on the poster) which is electrifying. She is also Oscar nominated for the role.What really makes these performances shine is the elegant directing by Kenneth Lonergan, better known for his screenplays on films like ""Analyze This"" and ""Gangs of New York"". He gives the actors time lots of time. A typical example is when young Patrick walks into Lee's bedroom and stares at some photos on his bedside table before walking on. It must be a good 20 to 30 seconds used, but time really well spent. The film spectacularly uses flash-backs to great effect, with the only visual notification that you are in a different time-zone being the living and breathing appearance of Joe in the shot.Lonergan also writes the screenplay, and I mentioned in my introduction the humour used. There are some outright belly laughs in this film, which feels incongruous with the morbid subject matter but which also feels guiltily appropriate (we've all surely had an experience where a tense funeral mood is lightened by an uncle loudly farting at the back of the church, or similar!).Manchester-by-the-Sea is a picturesque place in Massachusetts, and the camera work by Jody Lee Lipes (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"", ""Trainwreck"") lovingly makes use of that. There is incredibly crisp focus, with the opening boat scene looks like it is hyper-HD.This is a truly stunning film, and one that will live with me for many years to come. For that reason it receives my highest accolade together with my best wishes for success at the forthcoming Oscars. If you haven't yet, go see it.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook.)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 May 2020,8/10,'Manchester by the Sea' excels at its dedication to exploring the painful and awkward details of the complexity of loss and grief. Kenneth Lonergan is a master at handling nuances of human emotions and here he explores grief in such an earnest and affecting manner that it's hard not to feel for the characters. The actors are astonishing: Michelle Williams is as exemplary as you'd expect; Lucas Hedges is equally talented; and Casey Affleck delivers a powerhouse performance. A bleakly brilliant film.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,8/10,The title of the film refers to a small fishing town in Massachusetts not the UK city in north western England.Its stars 2016 Oscar winner for Best Actor Casey Affleck (younger brother of Ben Affleck) in the lead as handyman Lee Chandler who lives and works some 90 minutes or so away from Manchester after a disturbing life event which I won't reveal.I was confused for the first few minutes until I realised that there were two separate time-lines going on some eight years or so apart. We see Lee in the events leading up to him leaving Manchester in one. In the other Lee's brother tragically dies of Congestive Heart Failure leaving a teenage son Patrick. The mother lives away in Conneticut and is an ex-alcoholic.At the reading of the will it is revealed that it is the dying wish of the dead brother Joe that Lee becomes the legal guardian of Patrick. Lee is shocked as the issue had never been discussed. He has a new life or so he thinks away from Manchester.Amongst the depressing story of death there are some light hearted moments that actually raised a few chuckles in the cinema usually resulting from Patrick's sexual conquests.Director Kenneth Lonergan weaves together an interesting screenplay and brings out an Oscar winning Best Actor performance by Affleck. Look out for an aged Matthew Broderick in a cameo.The visuals are very cold and bleak. Indeed the dead cannot be buried in the frozen ground until there is a thaw months later that brings about another arc in the story. A depressing story-line that is handled brilliantly by the cast and director.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 March 2017,10/10,A superb film an emotional roller coaster and a well deserved Best actor Academy award for Casey Affleck his co star Lucas Hedges as Patrick deserves an award also. Not a happy film but a great example of how cinema can let you enter the lives of strangers and let you identify and empathise through their struggles and life experiences with some of your own if not identical but similar feelings .
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 January 2020,7/10,"An empathic movie with hints of depression and trauma. and very sutble in its drama. honestly a great ""grownup"" movie. a little slow from time to time, but hey that is somewhat the point of it.7/10: great overall"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 January 2017,4/10,"I'll be honest, the trailer didn't inspire but the very high ratings made me curious, and I'm always willing to give a film a chance. The premise had great promise, the tragedy of loss, redemption and finding a purpose. Unfortunately the film just couldn't deliver IMO. I didn't really care about the main character, although the situations he finds himself in made him empty of emotions, it was like watching an every-man struggling to deal with issues, the kind of issues that many people might face at points in their lives. I didn't really care about any of the other characters either, they seemed mundane and selfish, with dull dialogue. They all irritated me for NOT getting on with their lives.This looked like an average low budget made for TV drama, and that's being generous. You could count the significant moments on one hand, but these seemed to drag on for an uncomfortable 138 minutes. The film could have easily covered the material over 90 minutes and might have been better with this kind of significant editing. When it very abruptly ended, I thought ""Was that it? - So what!"" It's over-hyped and over-long but will probably (and unfortunately) win Best Picture Oscar."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 August 2017,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a fantastic movie based on a brilliant script by Kenneth Lonergan. The writing for this film is extremely captivating, unbelievably emotional and heartbreaking, as well as Affleck's character. I was very concerned during the first act because I didn't feel any sort of emotional connection to Lee since all he showed me until then was that he simply hates life and the reasons behind it took a little bit of time to start developing.However, from the moment the past starts to unfold and everything's clearer, I became totally attached to this character because I truly felt for him. It's such a sad and devastating story that it's impossible for someone not to feel bad for him. Casey Affleck has his career-best performance and a more than deserved Oscar. I never thought this would be a good thing, but he's depressed as hell ... Perfect. That's exactly how his character should feel after everything he's been through. It's the best sad performance I've seen in a long time.Michelle Williams (Randi) is also brilliant, but I'm super surprised with Lucas Hedges' portrayal of Patrick. Excellent cast, all of them have Oscar-worthy performances and that's also due to the greatly developed characters that they play, so congrats Kenneth for one of the best scripts of 2016. It's extremely captivating, but not due to what usually scripts tend to go. It's one of those stories that stick with you for some days: it's so powerful. Its extreme sadness and horrible tragic events, plus the depressing performances from the cast, just left me completely floored.However, that's one of my (minor) issues. One problem is the first act's slow pacing that takes its time to develop all of its stories. Still, my main issue has to do with the tone of the movie: it's just too depressing. I know, that's not technically a flaw and you're right, it's not. This is my opinion and the truth is that I will probably never watch this film again because of its extremely high- level of sadness. It shocked me in such a negative way that I simply can't watch again and that's something I always take into consideration when analyzing a movie: do I want to rewatch it? Do I enjoy it so much that I can't wait to experience it again? The answer is definitely no.Manchester by the Sea is a brilliantly directed and written movie by Kenneth Lonergan, who definitely deserves recognition for his original screenplay and directing skills. Casey Affleck has his best performance ever thanks to a full-bodied character and an excellent script, as well as Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedger who also have amazing Oscar-worthy performances. A slow first act doesn't really bother me, but the devastating, depressing, sad tone that covers the whole film really affects me and I can't possibly see a replay value to it. Still, it's one of the best movies of 2016!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,8/10,"Manchester By The Sea is a drama film starring Casey Affleck. A straightforward slow-burner, the film is a nice bonding story between an uncle and his nephew.Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck), an emotionally distant handyman, one day finds out that his brother Joe has died of a heart attack. After returning to his hometown of Manchester By The Sea in Massachusetts to attend the reading of the will, Lee discovers that Joe has left full custody of his teenage son Patrick (Lucas Hedges) in his care. Surprised by this revelation, Lee tries to rekindle his relationship with his nephew during time of mourning, despite the fact that he has his own personal demons to deal with.Melancholic and well-acted, Manchester By The Sea leaves an impression on the viewer mainly through the terrific performances of both Casey Affleck in the lead role and Lucas Hedges as his conflicted nephew. The viewer can't help but feel sorry for the two throughout all of the personal insecurities they both must wrestle with. Every character feels like a real person and the plights they all go through feel legitimate.I rate it 8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,5/10,"What do I mean by this? I think it would have been quite more shocking with a linear setup. At first it loses a little and then you start tying threads. The truth is, I'm not going to say it's a bad movie. It is not, simply for my taste, it is badly taken. It goes so much from time to time that I can not get to empathize with anyone.I have so many plans of the sea, of seagulls, so much television plane, that only makes that I mislead and slow down the history.I think he uses the slow motion very badly and also uses it too much and for too long.I like actors, but I think they have better interpretations.Photography is simple, not bad, but does not say much, cold, yes, but little more.I do not like the direction, since it has made the decision to do a bad assembly, for my taste. It does not have a special standard marked on the planning, is not seen an order and are little composed, rather simple.I could see it was a great movie, because there is history for it, but the director can waste it.Spoiler:When you see the fire, after going back and forth in time, it's hard for you to realize, that they are your children and when you do, begins to apply so slow slow motion that does not help you empathize.In addition, when he is in the police station, you take for granted that he is going to take a gun and he is going to shoot himself or at least he will try. But he does not know how to maintain the tension and he goes to seagull planes and destroys the moment."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 December 2017,9/10,"Yes, it is sad. Yes, it is slow. It is also an achingly beautiful drama about loss and recovery and loyalty...to one's self and one's family and one's community. The acting and the script are stellar. Lonergan creates truly great film by peeling everything away rather than adding. Much like ""You Can Count On Me"" before it, this movie knows how to let the story be about the people."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 December 2016,10/10,"here it is gang. best performance by an actor in a leading role. I saw casey earlier in a film no one saw-the finest hours-and thought he was very good. here, he is exceptional. he plays a man whose life has been turned upside down. he is a broken man. death surrounds him and has made him numb. in flash backs he is the affable younger brother of joe. we learn early on joe has health issues and lee (casey) becomes guardian to his son, patrick. lee does not expect this nor is he ready for it. but lee and patty have a tenuous and loving relationship and try to cope as best they can. they have a give as good as you get bond. it has been a long time since I've seen a film this perfectly executed. it's a complicated, yet very simple story, particularly new Englandesque. think mystic river and gone, baby gone. I must give a shout out to michelle Williams and lucas hedges. and I am sorry we don't see more of kyle chandler on the big screen."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 December 2016,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea weaves together the perfect tapestry of the exploration of one man's ongoing journey through grief. Kenneth Lonergan writes and directs an instant classic with his beautifully raw tale of human emotion. Starring Casey Affleck as a man who cannot escape the demons of his past who is then forced to face them head on again, Manchester by the Sea is as gripping as it is devastating. Lonergan's feature certainly ranks at the top of the list as the best piece of cinema to come out of 2016.Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is an isolated, brooding, tortured soul loner traveling through life listlessly broken. When he gets the news that his brother, Joe Chandler (Kyle Chandler) has passed away, necessitating his return to his hometown, Lee is clearly met with demons he has never put to rest in his own life. When he suddenly realizes that he has been named the guardian to his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Lee doesn't want, nor know how to be a guardian. Too damaged from his past, Lee is unable to properly navigate his own life, yet help a teenager try to navigate his own life after the death of his father. An examination of grief to the fullest extent in cinema, Manchester by the Sea has something for everyone, and should not be missed.Manchester by the Sea opens with beautiful establishing shots leaving the audience certain that the film takes place in Massachusetts. I have never seen a film use flashbacks as often and as suddenly as Manchester by the Sea, yet in a way that is absolutely seamless and perfect. Kenneth Lonergan completely immerses you in the world he creates, his world-building is so all-encompassing and fantastic. From a messy boss's office, to the well-worn stairs of Joe's home, to the repeated wardrobe used throughout the film, the audience is pulled so far into the story they nearly become one of the Chandler's. Lonergan's brilliant writing almost fools the audience with how simple the story seems. Essentially, we follow a family through the grief process, learning enough about them through each flashback to understand why they are handling the situation the way they are. We see Joe Chandler often acting as the strength of the family, we see Lee succumb to his personal hardships pulled to the surface solely by his brother, and we even see Patrick, who seems to be indifferent to his father's death, so accustomed to tragedy through his childhood that is unscathed by additional loss. Lonergan's script illustrates the pleasantries of grief that we are so accustomed to giving or receiving and showing how inconsequential it really is to the process of losing someone. Manchester by the Sea shows in the most perfectly genuine way, real people and real families expelling the notion that there is one universal way to cope with grief and loss. Lonergan never breaks the tone of the film either by painting even the most tragic moments against the subtle backdrop he puts so much emphasis on creating. An aspect that really aids in establishing the understated tone is the film's score. A predominately instrumental score firmly established the subtle tone of the film.The Success of Manchester by the Sea, is no doubt, cemented by the brilliant performance of Casey Affleck. Affleck's performance is the best of 2016; as much as the Academy Award ""belonged"" to Leonardo DiCaprio after his performance in 2015's The Revenant, Affleck is owed an Oscar for his portrayal of Lee Chandler. Affleck adds an incredible amount of depth that a lesser actor would have missed in such an understated role. My favorite part of Affleck's characterization is that he avoids splitting his character in two between before/after his personal tragedy. Many films often make the mistake of showing the character before their turning point as a completely different person. Manchester by the Sea, however, shows us the same Lee Chandler before and after his personal tragedy as the same person with the same mannerisms, subtly broken after. The film also avoids the Hollywood ending in which everything comes together perfectly and the characters sail off happily together into the sunset. The film ends on a note that is perfectly in-tuned with the characters Lonergan painstakingly created. Kenneth Lonergan trusts his audience, he shows rather than tells, allows the audience to infer, thus creating a perfect example of cinema. Manchester by the Sea has gripping, raw, and powerfully emotional scenes injected with actual bursts of humor creating the most human story of 2016.I will certainly not be forgetting the line ""I can't beat it."" anytime soon."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 May 2018,8/10,"I'm a wreck after watching this, it's devastating. I don't mean that in the 'it's okay, it's only a film' kind of devastating, I'm mean the 'sucker punch, can't catch my breath' sort of way. I don't like Casey Affleck. I'm sure he's a nice enough bloke, but he's always annoyed me on screen. He's whiney, slurs the delivery of his lines, tends to play unlikable characters. All this is present again here, but it works, really works, he's fantastic. The whole film is, but it will rip your heart out, stamp on it and shred it into tiny pieces while you're forced to watch. It's a bleak haze depicting a tragic series of events in the cold American town of Manchester, specifically though the focus is on Affleck who's rarely off screen and although often understated, commands almost every frame as his life unravels. There's no sugar coating and the scenes are set up very matter of fact, allowing you into a world that you really don't feel comfortable in. A sombre film that Affleck will find very hard to top."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 February 2020,2/10,"If you are looking for a super boring movie, here you go cha chi... This thing is slower than sling blade eating taters. I kept waiting for it to improve and get better... It got better the moment it ended. No chance of polishing this turd up... Next... If you give this movie anything higher than a 3 you need to get out more and expand your movie portfolio a tick."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 July 2020,9/10,"This film left me feeling all sorts of emotions. It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.Manchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.This is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime. At no point did I think there were actors playing the characters because the performances and conversations they were all having seemed too real. This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.In my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.It's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant. It's may not be an easy watch but I would like people to experience it so they can see the Kenneth Lonergan's talent as well as Casey Affleck's masterful performance."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,8/10,"'Manchester by the Sea' is one of those rare movies that don't rely on spectacular action scenes, surprising plot turns or exotic locations. It relies on superb acting, a well-written script and an emotional connection with the viewer.Right from the beginning, the audience is intrigued by the main character, Lee. A solitary and sometimes aggressive man, seemingly devoid of any emotion. When he learns of the death of his brother, he is forced to interrupt his reclusive existence, and to take care of his sixteen year old nephew, with whom he has formed a bond in the past. Only after a while, we understand why he wants to isolate himself from most human interaction. Reluctantly, he tries to make the best of the new situation. But the dramatic events from the past make things very difficult.The story is told with the help of many flashbacks, inserted seamlessly into the main story. With every flashback, a piece of Lee's character and his state of mind is revealed. As the story unfolds, the viewer gradually gets to understand better what goes on in his mind, and why he behaves as he does.Casey Affleck is superb as Lee, the tormented loner in the main story, and the fun-loving guy in the flashbacks. Suppressed anger must be one of the hardest emotions for an actor to express, but Affleck is completely believable as a man who is at odds with himself and the world. Michelle Williams, in a supporting role as his ex-wife, also shows her abilities at both ends of the emotional spectrum. Another important element in the film is the setting: the New England coast during a cold and snowy winter.The film is about real people and their emotions. Small details emphasize this. When an injured person is taken away by an ambulance, the paramedics have trouble getting the gurney into the ambulance. It's an awkward situation, and they have to fold the legs of the gurney manually in order to slide it into the designated spot. This has no further meaning in the film, but it shows how this film is about real people in real situations, as opposed to Hollywood heroes in a made-up fantasy world.'Manchester by the Sea' moves slowly. There's no mystery to be solved, there's no love affair to develop, there's no bad guy to get arrested. There's only ordinary people, trying to make the best of it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2020,8/10,"Manchester By The Sea, along the lines of Moonlight and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood among many others, is a really well made movie that isn't unusually memorable or focused on presenting new ideas, and I inevitably struggle to judge these as 7s or 8s. Unlike the other two I mentioned, I'm giving Manchester the edge primarily because of Afflect's fantastic performance, along with some strong cinematography. The nonlinear storytelling does build effectively to the reveal of what he did that he feels so much guilt about. Affleck makes the emotional notes hit hard, as he plays the character with such subtlety and honesty. The characters are not particularly dynamic, but play off each other well in gradually revealing the depth to which the traumatic events in their shared pasts continue to affect them. A patient slow burn character study of how one struggles to deal with depression in the aftermath of a tragic event, Manchester By the Sea is extremely lifelike and sad, even if not personally relatable to me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 December 2016,9/10,"Surprised by the bad reviews. Perhaps one has to be a parent to get the full impact of the movie and how all have been affected by the events that take place. For me, the movie was superbly done (and my wife agrees). Portrays people broken by a very emotional experience in a way you would expect, and the ending is what it should have been. In most movies, you will see a scene or two or hear some dialog that makes you scratch your head, wondering why no one associated with the movie saw how misplaced it was, but I saw no such faults in this film. Yes, the main character is depressed, and some may not find such a character enjoyable to watch for two hours, but I enjoy movies that make me feel for the characters, and this one certainly did that. All performances were excellent as well. Highly recommend, but if you are looking for something upbeat, save this one for another time"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 June 2017,5/10,"A painful experience, and not one I feel any desire to repeat. One of the effects of a non-linear narrative is to make the viewer suspect that an essentially banal, commonplace and distinctly unentertaining story is being covered up, or embellished. Man causes death of his three children by negligence. PTSD man can't recover any purpose to his life. People attempt to help and/or console him. He has acquired a certain notoriety in his community. The viewer is presented with the unco-ordinated memories and workings of this man, Lee's, mind over a fairly long period. Their out of sequence presentation is disorienting.A highlight of the film is felt to be an apparently fortuitous meeting between the main character, Lee, and his ex-wife, Randi. The implication of this scene is that Randi subconsciously shares the guilt felt by Lee, and also that Lee's negligence in causing the deaths of his and Randi's children was a subconscious form of retribution for Randi's behaviour towards him when married. Is it possible here to discern the influence of the writer/director's mother, a psychiatrist ?The film is extremely well-acted, in accordance with the script, and that's why I give it 5 stars. But I do not think much is to be gained by watching it. Ogden Nash once said words to the effect that we are stuck on this globe for the duration, and do not survive by solemnity, but by wry acceptance of our predicament. Some people have detected humour in this film, but I failed to find anything funny about it. Lee's entire family is dysfunctional. I was not entertained. The title is enigmatic."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 February 2020,9/10,"...where Lonergan's steady hand elevates a fairly mundane, borderline generic idea, into something palpable, strangely energetic and genuinely engrossing. It's not just a performer picture, there's some excellent writing and directing, some neat, easy concepts, and a very likeable use of naturalistic sound.
It's a film that can't fully be jusdged until it's complete. It's raw and emotional but not uncinematic. It's a film about not all the pieces of a soul fitting back together. But a few pieces fall into place and that's enough to keep going. It has a contemplative and bittersweet ending."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 March 2018,7/10,"An old-fashioned indie-type film that could have been so much better. Director wringed everything out of his actors and his audience. But it was all so studied. Rarely felt involved completely. Case in point: the overbearing use of the hackneyed baroque music at two crucial points in the film, the fire and the funeral - the latter in slo-mo! Talk about laying it on! And muting the dialogue was so annoying. Took away from the acting. And time jumping was distracting too - audience jerked out of the film wondering what part of the story we were watching until you got your bearings again. Cut up the scenes. Pity, because the cast were great. I especially liked Patrick. Maybe the settings were a bit too pretty too!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2017,7/10,"Cinema portrayal­­­s of angry people are not usually enjoyable entertainment yet we are fascinated by films that dwell entirely on simmering angst. Manchester by the Sea (2016) is such a film. Perplexing, unsettling, yet engaging, it is a story without joy that is made bearable by outstanding performances and superb cinematography.The plot line has a simple core narrative framed by several abrupt flashbacks that gradually piece together a jigsaw-like story. We meet Lee (Casey Affleck) as a handyman and depressive loner whose temper blows over at little provocation. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that he lives in self-exile because of a horrible family tragedy he caused. He has become emotionally hollowed out and unable to relate to people. Suddenly his brother has a fatal heart attack and his will names Lee as executor and guardian of 16 year-old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). But to accept this responsibility, Lee must move back to the idyllic seaside town of Manchester by the Sea which is full of traumatic memories, including of his attempted suicide, his divorced wife, and people who are wary of him. He stays for the funeral, drinks heavily, lashes out physically, argues with his teenage nephew, and wants to cut and run. Gradually, he becomes emotionally re-connected with family and place through the experience of caring for the typically full-of-himself nephew. Lee's traumatic past makes way for new beginnings, new relationships, and the hope of redemption.If you look for originality in storytelling, there is little of it here. Painful battles with inner demons is a cliché, and fighting several at once is simply a compound cliché not something new. Half of this film is spent on assembling the narrative jigsaw so we can understand what makes Lee the way he is, and the other half is spent on standard melodrama tropes about re-connecting by caring for someone else. However, it is the casting, characterisation, and cinematography that save this film from being just another story of angry people destabilised by tragedy. Casey Affleck does trauma and ambivalence very effectively. His bemused tolerance of his nephew's demands and sexual exploits becomes the emotional scaffold that guides his calming from pot-boiling anger to resigned acceptance that life must go on. Lucas Hedges is the perfect foil for Casey Affleck, and both are helped by a strong support ensemble.Brilliant acting by Affleck does not hide the film's melodramatic predictability. But this slow essay on anger would be more unsettling were it not for its joyful filming. Trauma is calmed and un-likable characters forgiven when all are nestled against beautiful images of bobbing fishing vessels lapping the shores of charming Manchester by the Sea. The camera-work visually warms the film and helps bind its elements into an engaging story of loss and redemption."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 November 2021,8/10,"Some movies keep pushing audience to feel certain and intended emotions while others let it be. 'Manchester by the Sea' is the latter, telling a sad story as it is, making that story more plausible, relatable, intimate, and thus ironically sadder. Some lives are portrayed with great victory and deep meaning, but many others just live by, surviving a day after day. Many characters in movies overcome difficulties and problems at the end; on the other hand, many in real life are traumatized eternally. The film describes the life of 'the others' that many movies forget about but we can see in our ordinary lives."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 November 2019,9/10,"In my mind's eye, ""Manchester By The Sea"" deserves its praise at the arthouse and filmmaking levels, as it is a poignant examination of human grief that is hard to touch. But perhaps like few other films in history have, it also epitomizes the rancorous gap between the erudite grading scale of Academy Awards voters, and the public's desire to see their most joyously-consumed films be deemed worthy of cinema's highest accolades. It's likely the true fire starter film to the Academy's proposed inclusion of a ""Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film"" award.I personally found Casey Affleck to be very solid but short of mesmerizing as a janitor forced to care for his deceased brother's boy. I enjoyed the film itself far more than the collective acting. But regardless of the nits and gnats, The Academy's recent consideration to recognize blockbusters -- while largely frowned upon by alarmist film snobs -- is perhaps it's the best conciliatory olive branch available, allowing fine films like ""Manchester By The Sea"" to earn its deserved recognition, yet not without an equalizing tip of the cap to public sentiment.This is a very good movie that falls short of an eternal masterpiece, and perhaps might be best remembered long-term by its contribution to a larger public debate between the need to champion great storytelling while also allowing the voices of the masses to also be heard. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 November 2016,10/10,"This is an engrossing, compassionate, deeply moving film. For me, it's the best kind of story-telling: it's impossible to predict the turns it takes, but when they are taken they are completely plausible. Writer/director Kenneth Lonergan has done an exceptional job.Casey Affleck leads a superb cast with his amazing performance. A climactic scene between him and the ever-wonderful Michelle Williams is destined to become a classic.A word for Jody Lee Lipes' cinematography, which is beautiful, setting all the pain in the movie in the context of the shifting light of the eponymous small coastal town.There are a few flaws here and there, generated I think by editing less than perfectly matched reverse shots; and there is one sequence in which Lonergan takes a real risk with a famous piece of music -- for me it worked, but for others it may not. But this is nit-picking. I was so full of emotion by the end of this movie that I couldn't speak. That really hasn't happened for a long time.This is a film about real life. Please see it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 March 2017,9/10,"'Manchester by the Sea' is the first Kenneth Lonergan film that I have seen and I am deeply impressed. It richly deserves the critical acclaim and awards that it has won.'Manchester by the Sea' is a very mature and grounded exploration of depression and the struggles with coping with tragedies and the past. Lee is someone who is constantly haunted by the horrors of his past. When we first meet him, he comes across as a very soft spoken, quiet, brooding individual who seems to be a loner. He is unsocial, he is mentally unstable, he refuses to engage in anything potentially romantic with a woman and he unnecessarily gets himself in barroom brawls and remains somewhat aloof. Gradually with the help of flashbacks, we get to know what he had to experience in the past and his demeanour starts to make sense. His depression has its roots in an inherent sense of guilt and self hate. This is why when he gets to know his brother has named him as the guardian of his nephew Patrick, he is startled and shows reluctance to commit to this responsibility. It's not because he doesn't love his nephew, it's because the mishaps of his past make him believe that he is not suitable for a massive responsibility like this. Films which deal with characters riddled by depression and grief aren't very rare. But what distinguishes this one from many of the others is Lonergan's direction and writing. He constantly goes on subverting the tropes that a viewer would expect from a film of this nature. Through the quasi-father/son relationship between Lee and Patrick or the potential romantic entanglements, Lonergan gives the viewer glances of possible solutions for Lee's situation which some other films might latch onto. But Lonergan isn't interested in knowing how others can help Lee with his problem through love or care. He is more interested in how Lee himself comes to terms with his demons. Lonergan's implication that this mental pain will probably never completely desert Lee actually makes this film's stance on mental health comparable to 'The Babadook's. Lonergan like a true humanist filmmaker refuses to make any character a stereotype, pretty much every character has their strengths as well as weaknesses, but no one gets judged. The screenplay is very carefully planned. The narrative is somewhat non-linear as the linear storyline gets interrupted from time to time by flashbacks. But the flashbacks have been very meticulously placed in the precise moments for emotional impact. Lonergan doesn't do anything too outrageous or attention-grabbing visually and allows the actors to take center-stage. But there are subtle moments where the camera placements and movements become thematically expressive. In the initial few scenes, Lonergan uses the frame-within-a-frame composition by using shots where Lee is framed within the rectangular arch of the doorways to express his emotional imprisonment. Then there comes the scene in the hospital where Lee is talking to the doctor about his brother's funeral arrangements. This scene has a shot where initially Lee is again framed within the rectangular arch of a doorway, but gradually the camera moves forward and slowly the arch becomes invisible and camera moves very close to Lee's face signifying that circumstances have forced Lee to come out of his comfort zone. Similarly there are a number of other subtle moments in the film where the visuals express something without the assistance of dialogue.Performances are great from everyone. But this film will not work without Casey Affleck's jaw-dropping performance. In many films the characters going through trauma or depression are shown to resort to certain clichés to sell the mental instability. Affleck remains extremely low-key, his eyes remain pretty dead, but his face always gives you the hint of the enormous of pain and suffering inside him. He modulates his dialogue delivery perfectly to sell the semi-permanent aloofness of his character. Lucas Hedges is great too as Patrick. The relationship between Patrick and Lee remains interesting throughout as Patrick is not a one-note character. He can be very annoyingly rude like a teenager, but he can also be compassionate and understanding. Michelle Williams has limited screen time, but she is heartbreaking in the scenes that she is in.'Manchester by the Sea' is a mature meditation on depression and mental suffering. It is a humanist piece of work which is more interested in the journey and the self realisations of the characters, than contrived solutions to arrive at some sort of a closure for the satisfaction of the viewers. Highly Recommended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2019,3/10,"Well, it does finally get going towards the end, if you manage to make your way over the bleak landscape of the first 90 minutes. But I'm not sure it really says anything profound about the human condition, and what it does say has been said more eloquently elsewhere.Some of the music is way over the top, as if the director isn't confident enough that the actors have conveyed the necessary emotions.And, while it wasn't that hard to guess what had happened in Lee's past, perhaps it would have helped to have made this explicit much earlier on. It would have made Lee's depressed state more tolerable during the 90 minutes before he (somewhat, thankfully, finally) cheered up."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,5/10,"I'm not a snob out to distinguish himself from the 97% Rotten Tomato ravers. I was just really disappointed walking out of the theatre. I don't know if I've ever seen a more self indulgent domestic weepy. The film sets the viewer up with mountains of spoon-fed plot tragedy and setback and then mines every last drop of melodrama and tears out of such. Affleck's character is a flawless, blameless Everyman and behaves so heroic it becomes impossible to feel for his plight. Williams is terrific but barely on screen for ten minutes. What apparently is intended to pass as compelling real-life dialog quickly becomes mundane and boring. Likewise, our younger protagonist is a teenage lothario having far too good a time to be awarded compassion. The non- Hollywood ending comes across as pretentious, though it certainly comes as a relief."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,10/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is a film about love, tragedy (the worst kind), loss, and...life.When the film opens, we meet the main character, Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck). He works as a ""handyman"" in an apartment complex close to Boston. I cannot find words that describes this performance. He garnered an Oscar nomination for best actor, and he deserves it. You can tell from the get-go something haunts him and when the realization comes of why he is haunted, it will literally knock the wind out of your sails. There is nothing special about his life; in fact, you feel sorry for him. He then receives a call from a friend advising of the death of his brother, Joe, and for as long as he's tried to escape his past, he must now deal with it head-on. I do not want to spoil the rest of the movie because this is one you should see if given the chance.The direction, the cinematography, and the acting take this film way above what is out there. For a film such as this to work, there must be a delicate balance and the director found it here. I read another review complaining about how this movie ""wasn't funny."" It wasn't supposed to be. There are funny moments, but I have never seen this billed as a comedy. My suggestion to that reviewer: Disney movies-- lots and lots of them.This movie is rated ""R"" for language, sexual situations, and adult themes. There has not been a movie released in 2016 that can touch this one. It was amazing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 March 2019,8/10,"Manchester By The Sea is a lovely little indie feature which aims to intimately capture the essence of everyday lives of normal, working-class people across the country - their mundanity, flaws & tragic beauty - taking the time to simply observe one particular family & the impact a relative's unexpected death has on those around them, it deals strongly with repeated occuring themes of grief & how multiple individuals choose to deal with it. Its brutally honest & simplistic depiction of events also grounds the film in a reality which feels reassuringly familiar to those watching & the beautifully understated, subtle performances gift the characters with a poignancy & undeniable relatability - meaning however slow or monotonous their days progress, you can't help but be emotionally invested in their engaging stories, regardless.
Casey Affleck is incredible & must also be acknowledged especially for the stunning job he did with this movie too. His acting was absolutely outstanding."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 January 2017,7/10,"About one third of the way through this, quite long (137 minutes) movie the swelling strings and organ of Tomaso Albinoni's Adagio for Strings and Organ in G Minor start to stir and build through 8 minutes and 35 seconds.Unlike traditional screenplay music the classical piece, performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, does not subtly grace the background, it grabs you by the throat and dominates the proceedings to the point, almost, of discomfort.(Some reviewers feel it is heavy-handed, I felt it was well judged.)The fact that it is in a minor key and is achingly melancholic bursting with sadness, despair and grief absolutely encapsulates the mood of Lonergan's creation.I found these lyrics written for the Adagio and they could in fact be the inspiration for Kenneth Lonergan's Screenplay although I very much doubt he has seen them...So turn away! Turn away, turn awayI am alone, I am alone! I am alone I am alone I am aloneGo turn away, go turn away Turn away, turn away Turn away, Turn me awayAlone! Damned! Go home! Gone in darkness Light, surpassesAll . All, is one now! All, is gone now! All, is gone Truthfully Truthfully Truthfully I am gone.I don't recall a Hollywood movie so built around grief and that grief is etched into every pore of Casey Affleck's face. Surely he is a shoe in for best actor at this year's Oscars. Lucas Hedges, as his orphaned nephew who Casey Affleck, as Leo - a dead end Janitor - suddenly becomes guardian to after the death of his brother, plays a nuanced role as the troubled teen who can at least find solace in school, sex and band practice; even if his band is dire.(Actually, there are also a lot of laugh out loud, mainly awkward, moments in it which were entirely unexpected to me.)It's essentially a two header between them although Michelle Williams plays a strong support role, albeit brief in screen time.To be honest, even calling it a two-header is to downplay the importance of Casey Affleck in this movie. In truth it is really a study of him alone with supporting characters used ostensibly as dramatic devices and props.The trailers do not reveal the depth of the storyline, which is devastatingly sad, and for some almost too much to bear. My wife sobbed almost uncontrollably throughout the third act.But despite all this, personally, it didn't quite capture my heart.Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind. It's a great, albeit slightly one dimensional, movie with a brilliant central performance and a strong screenplay with a good ensemble supporting cast, but that's not enough to make it the movie of the year.That said, I would strongly recommend it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 August 2018,9/10,"Fantastically shot and acted this is one brilliant film about grief, loss and family with compelling characters and a stunning setting the story follows Casey Affleck's character taking on his nephew, son of his Now late brother and shows the growth of the characters post the death of the relative. Fantastically structured and extremely emotional this is a brilliant movie"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 February 2017,8/10,"An uncle (Casey Affleck) is obliged to return home to care for his nephew (Lucas Hedges) after his brother dies. Unknowing he is to be the guardian and struggles with the decision. Throughout the movie he recounts past memories that caused him to leave Manchester and distance himself from his past.""Manchester by the Sea"" is a highly character driven piece, an almost classical drama of present-time. Whilst keeping itself at distance from a highly-stylized approach to the story it presents the events in a perfectly orchestrated scene weave which makes this 140 minute drama pass in the blink of an eye, almost leaving you wanting more.What Lonergan succeeds the most in his storytelling is in the portrayal of the profanity of every life. He shies away from any kind of contextualization or dramatization that could lead to clichés or melodrama. The editing is symbolic of this in the way it cuts at any given moment which confers this feeling of incredible ordinariness, it implies that no one is in control of a story, there isn't an over arching veil of plot or character structure, which is why the scenes where the drama occurs hit the viewer so intensely.The filter of film is really successfully removed here thanks to some very smart decision making, the first one being the non cinematic aspect ratio, and what you manage to witness are the reality of the lives of these people in all of their unpredictability and the way they deal with their obstacles as people and not as characters. The whole cinematic language used for the film is very elementary but not banal in anyway, every choice of camera work, editing, color and composition feels organic to the through line of the film. The camera is generally steady, but when it moves it moves for a very specific reason, it charges those key moments with even more depth and adds a whole other layer to how the characters interact with each other.Still, when it comes to the meat of the story one has to look at actors and script, yet they are no less if not more engaging than the whole package of the movie. This is such a classy script, one that could fail to capture the nuance in the drama, yet by keeping such a fine balance of humor and drama and by the sole incorporation of the humor in this, it catapults it to another level of grandness. Whatever you've heard about this film being depressing is misrepresenting this picture. This is a very funny film, Lucas Hedges brings on a fabulous performance that touches both effectively the dramatic sides, but even more so the comedic ones, given his very lively character, and his chemistry with Affleck works effortlessly well. Then of course when it comes to tying it all together and giving the audience that emotional punch Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams do some showcase actor work. The way they carry themselves is brutally emotional and they manage to both really disappear in their roles from their first frame, very deserving of their acting accolades for their roles here.Where I might have got a little less out of this feature is in the way if pays off its story, I think that on one side it stays true to its honesty to these people's story, on the other side I think that its just slightly under developed, it rushes a little to the end and could have easily done with another twenty minutes for me in rounding out the characters more and fleshing out the motivations of their decisions. I also think that the ending purposefully wants us to be left still craving more, feeling like something has not yet been said, but I personally really wanted to give these characters something more, I feel like their journeys would have remained interesting for the story's purpose and I was a little cut off when I realized that some of their decisions were not being explored more.Being sharply focused on a character/story driven film has its downsides, which often seem to fall on the film's rounding off, yet it also has its peculiarities and ""Manchester by the Sea"" might just encapsulate all of them, it is nothing more than people having conversation in houses but it is alive and thrilling to watch, a masterful exercise in an modern day classic drama."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,9/10,"""Manchester by the sea"" is living proof that with simplicity we can make great cinematographic works, and it is simply this everyday beauty that enchants us, we have all the elements to have a super dramatic film that will make the public cry but not the movie Even passes sadness, but also passes joy, anger, fear, anguish and a mix between pessimism and optimism, for ""Manchester by the sea"" is a portrait of life. With a script counting linearly with several flashbacks that will give context and connotations to events in the present, but all very subtle, we do not have flashbacks too much or less, his script is extremely precise when telling the story of Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) , Who is forced to return to Manchester to take care of his nephew after the death of his brother, and during his stay begins to remember his sad past in the city while facing questions in the present. It is beautiful to see how the film relates so well to the human being, this being that is completely flawed, Lee is flawed, lives remorseful and remorseful of his failures, lives in doubt and anguish about the present and future, while his nephew lives the discoveries Of adolescence as he struggles with his father's perch and his mother's emotional bankruptcy, ""Manchester by the Sea"" and his characters portray life as it is, and to make those aspects very clear, director Kenneth Lonergan cramps the movie scenes Improvised and small details of daily life, such as a door that hangs or a dialogue in which the two do not understand each other, even the dialogue of the movies full of flaws, with words said wrong or bored wrong, as I said, is a portrait of life. The photograph of the film is very good, with a palette full of shades of blues, and always very clear, the aspect of the film in general is very pleasant, its camera simple and often handled in the tone of the scene and its great track Sound that goes from this Rock And Roll to beautiful scenes with incidental music is completely wonderful and I am surprised that I did not get an indication to Oscar in this question. All the film's acting is great or very good, we do not have any half-mouth acting, it's a great highlight to Casey Affleck who has a wonderful performance, his character reflects all our anguish and despair, but he is so clammy and cold that at the same time Time also conveys our indifference to life, Casey acts like us, he does not want to go through what he is going through, but faces how he can, always with a depressing face an unadorned look, Casey has happily received an indication to Oscar, and we must also give The congratulations to Kenneth Lonergan, great scriptwriter who now consecrates instead of director. ""Manchester by the sea"" enchants, arrests the viewer and makes him go through all possible feelings, and the phrase ""Art is the window to life"" has never made so much sense."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 April 2017,10/10,"From the moment I became aware of ""Manchester by the Sea"" I wasn't sure that I wanted to see it. Now, albeit belatedly, I have. As it turns out, I did.I don't know what I may add to the avalanche of accolades already rightfully bestowed upon this brilliant production, in part by way of the Academy Award earned by Writer/Director Kenneth Lonergan for Best Screenplay and the quiet yet deeply moving Oscar-capturing performance from Casey Affleck. Except perhaps to say that this is one of the best overall movies I have ever seen. And I have seen my fair share of flicks, good and bad.At various turns heart-piercingly devastating, genuinely funny and ultimately hopeful, Lonergan has crafted a near perfect story and film that, even at over two hours, I never wanted to end.And trust me-it has been a long while since I've felt that way at the sight of the closing credits."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 November 2016,10/10,"MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is perfect in every way. A film that's as emotionally powerful as it is exquisitely shot. Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams are phenomenal. Young talent Lucas Hedges is a must-see. Oscar nominated writer/director Kenneth Lonergan's way of capturing the struggling working class of America comes from a genuine place.Oscar nominee Casey Affleck plays a solitary Boston janitor, Lee Chandler, who returns to his hometown after the death of his older brother in order to take care of his teenage nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Lee is very reluctant about taking on this new responsibility because he's already overwhelmed as it is living from paycheck to paycheck, in addition to being haunted by a certain past tragedy that separated him from his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams).Casey Affleck originally came from Massachusetts, from this story's neck of the woods, so he brings a lot of himself and his familiarity with the region into his character. The film shows us small town USA, it shows us a fishing village, it shows us a place with long tradition, a way of living that's been handed down from generation to generation. So the region itself plays a very integral supporting role in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA. If you understand that, then you'll understand the characters.What I love about this film is how funny and how poignant it is in its approach to explaining to us the importance family, community, sacrifice and adjusting to life after so much has been taken from you. When Lee suffered a loss, his brother was there. When his brother dies, he takes care of his brother's son. There's no escaping that, but you can just see everybody in that community just starts pulling their weight and pitching in voluntarily, you don't see much of that anymore, unfortunately, these days. And throughout the film, Lonergan wants to show us that that sense of having each other's backs is not yet instinct and he does it in a way that's honest. Even the arguments between Lee and Patrick, yes you'll laugh at their trying to make it work but at the same time you're kinda glad that they at least are arguing, in their own awkward way, they're communicating. Great performances by all the actors involved, I can't say enough to praise Affleck, Williams, and Hedges. MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is an example of strength in simplicity.-- Rama's Screen --"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2018,7/10,"'Manchester by the Sea' (a town one hour north-east of Boston) is the setting and title for this film that's nominated for multiple Oscars, based around a man dealing with grief. Lee (Affleck) is a guy just trying to get by, working as a janitor, when he finds out his brother, Joe (Chandler) has died of a heart attack. He has to drive up to Manchester and try to figure out what to do with his 16-year-old nephew, Patrick (Hedges).There's not much backstory as to why Lee is separated from his ex-wife, Randi (Williams), but this, as well as some history of Lee and Joe together, is sporadically filled in throughout the film. The big reveal explains why people look at/whisper about Lee and the very heavy burden he's carrying. Affleck is great, softly-spoken, but with so much hurt in his eyes - it's easy to see why he's nominated for Best Actor. Hedges is as good as the teenaged son, grieving for his dad, but continuing on with life as best he can, including playing ice hockey, band practice and trying to date two girls, while trying to understand and help his uncle.There's a decent support cast - Joe's friend George (Wilson), the coach (Donovan), Patrick's girlfriend Sandy (Baryshnikov) & her mum Jill (Burns) - but it's really up to Affleck, Hedges and Williams to do all the heavy lifting. It's certainly not a fun or exciting film, but it is engrossing, as you learn more about the characters and some of the heartbreak they've all endured. It's a little long, with lots of slow and quiet parts, ""endure"" is an apt description for what the characters have to do."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 September 2020,,"I watched this recently again and going a second time around, I appreciated the depth in this film. Arrival probes profound questions about time, language, and human behavior. The cinematography here was also excellent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 September 2020,,"Sadness for sadness sake. Weary, dreary, for no reason."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 April 2020,7/10,"Reality and reality are not sufficient and necessary.
After watching this movie, the biggest feeling for me is true. The trend of the plot, the character's psychology, everything is true. But what impressed me most is the reality of human nature. Facing a life of failure and pain, what can we do and what can we do.
At first, the Lee movie felt like a gunpowder barrel that would explode at any time, and as the plot progressed, continuous interludes, two lines intertwined in parallel, we knew the whole story, there was no time and plot The flashback of the hint did not make the story seem confusing. On the contrary, every time the audience followed Lee 's memories, it was natural that Lee drove back to Manchester, Lee followed the doctor to see Joe 's last glance, Lee 's memories at the lawyer 's desk, etc. Wait. The people in the town are also very detailed about Lee's attitude. After gradually learning about Lee's past, all of Lee's abnormal behaviors have been explained.
Lee and his wife's past is so unbearable, but Patrick's line seems to be another tone, ice hockey team, band, friends, girlfriend, fishing boat, even if he just lost his father, Patrick's life in Manchester is still colorful, and this and Lee, who had nothing but an administrator, formed a huge contrast. At this point in the story's development, Lee had to become Patrick's guardian. At this point, the conflict seems to be fierce, including Lee's exclusion of Patrick's girlfriend and mother, Patrick's objection to the disposal of his father's body and his life will be interfered by. The misunderstanding is different from the view that Lee and Patrick's story goes high and low. I think the inner conflict between the two main characters seems to be intensified with the compromise and reconciliation of the event. At least, Lee and Patrick's heart at this time, both Very confused and helpless.
But another foreshadowing of the film is the affection between uncle and nephew. In fact, Lee and Patrick are both unfortunate and similar. Lee was reluctant to forgive himself and chose to leave Manchester. Joe and Patrick became his only relatives. Patrick lacked a complete family. It was a rare happy childhood memory to go to sea with his uncle and father when he was young. They, one chooses to sink and the other chooses to rebel, but the internal reasons for the actions of the characters are the longing and fear of family and affection, so the two people will also resonate emotionally, plus a similar black humor character, inadvertently revealed Some of the cares give people a complicated feeling similar to the relationship between father and son. The rival play of the uncle and nephew actually tested the actor's psychological and emotional performance. On the seemingly contradictory surface, it is hidden that Lee and Patrick depend on each other. The scene that impressed me the most was Patrick 's sudden onset. Lee accompanied him all night. Since then, gradually, Lee 's memories included the shadows of his brother and nephew, and in the face of Patrick 's demands, Lee Although unpleasant, try to be content.
Lee still can't get rid of the painful memories in Manchester. The appearance of his ex-wife, the job search hit the wall, reminding him of Manchester's buried pain all the time. But he saw how he should live on his nephew. At this time, Lee seemed to be standing at the fork of the past and the future. Many people thought that Lee should look forward, accept this opportunity of salvation, and walk out of the shadows. However, Lee did not choose this way. He could not abandon the past. Like many people said, not everyone can reconcile with the past. Lee 's choice is to tolerate the past. He will still suffer and still struggle, but in his life Not all suffering, he carefully left a little space for Patrick's broken heart. He will start to plan a little bit for the future, try to make Patrick feel better, take him to visit his mother, sell guns to buy new engines, so that Patrick does not have to move, etc.
At the end of the plot, people may think that this film conveys a sad and ordinary reality that cannot escape the shadows and finally compromises with life.
But my feelings are a little different.
At the end of the film, Lee and Patrick walked on the way back from the funeral. The two of them said the future one by one. Lee said that he would leave a room for Patrick in his Boston house. His nephew did n't take it seriously. . The two picked up a ball and played the throwing and catching game. Patrick picked up the ball again and again and threw it at Lee. Finally, the two fished on the fishing boat.
When I saw this, I was actually very moved. Because in my opinion, for the rebellious Patrick, picking up the ball again and again is already the most true expression of his and Lee's affection. For Lee, what he seems to do for Patrick is an ordinary thing. It is a miracle, a miracle of human nature. This is also the final distinction between movies and real life. Lee, who was already sinking, faced a series of mutations in his life. His brother died and revisited. Lee had many worse options, probably by forcing Patrick to take away and selling the fishing boat. And then continue to live in a sinking state, maybe it will be more realistic, cold, biting, and implement the reality.
But the choice of film shows the reality of human nature, just as Lee chose to understand Patrick's life, although this failed to save Lee. After a few words with the ex-wife, both of them were out of control, and Lee still could n't forgive himself, or could n't give up on the past, but in the end, Lee did everything he had with a wry smile to the most generous and the most generous and humble who had teased his life Shaking hands, because I understand how difficult it is for a man who is desperate. This is the reality of human nature, although he is more emotional and naive than reality.
Recalling the pain, the reality is gloomy, and will eventually make a choice.
The funeral is to say goodbye to the dead and the past. It is not easy, but it is full of memory and respect. The period between death and funeral is very painful for those who are alive, separated from the past and relatives. The funeral is not a one-click removal of this pain and memories, but a compression and collection. It tells you that although the past can not be let go, it should be put aside. We need to leave space for the present and the future. Lee also needed a funeral, and this funeral was too late for him, so that his life once fell.
Unlike the happy ending movie, many people will feel that this movie is very mourning after watching it, and the plot is not tortuous, just like the life itself, it is plain and dull, and many people think that this movie is showing that it cannot reconcile with the past Cold reality.
The film gave me the feeling that it was bland but not ordinary, contradictions were not targeted, but ease was not easy, haze was not dark, cold was not biting, and melting was not warm.
The most important thing is truth.
After the unfortunate arrival, human nature is not as fragile as anyone thinks, of course, far from being strong; after life fails, no one wants to be so desperate in life, of course, not so optimistic.
Please believe that it is not easy to say goodbye, and do it well.
If Wu Nan can see here, I want to say sorry to you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,,"Manchester by the sea is a very serious and well focused picture about family bonds, when grief comes all of a sudden to upset your normal life and getting along with it becomes a reiteration of useless gestures. Here's the slowness of a picture to be understood, a picture which gives time to characters and situations, and may seem not to able to stand off the ground, but on the contrary does reflect the real timing and perception of life when you are deeply affected by loss and pain.However, despite its slowness, the picture kept me involved from beginning to end, and the long runtime with its constant moving backwards did not affect my attention. The elaboration of grief is a long and slow process, and this picture reflects this process as it is in real life: unfortunately, our attention span as viewers, readers and often as human beings is often too short, but pictures like this one can remind us that attention and elaboration require time and slowness.Well deserved Oscar for Casey Affleck, who managed to exploit every single step of grief with a heartfelt and authentic interpretation, and reached a deep chemistry with the boy playing his nephew. Michelle Williams also offered a strong performance although in a minor role. The screenplay was effective, since it was able to combine the seriousness of the topic with some slightly humorous tone, but never forgetting the highly and successfully committed aim of the narration."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2020,9/10,"Actually there is a classic story but it was a great movie in terms of expression. I liked it very much, it deserved to be an oscar.
Casey affleck performs great acting i love it a deserved reward at the end.
The story is not fluent but it makes me watch it I was expecting it to be a little heavy but it didn't bore"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 March 2019,3/10,Weird.I could not enjoy this movie and I couldn't get to the mood.Totally enenjoyable
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 January 2017,9/10,"The story deals with Casey affleck character lee who is a janitor who lives a quite life and finds out the bad news that his brother Joe passes away from a heart attack which on his boat, lee is forced To become the trustee aka guardian of his nephew Patrick who he has suffered from estrangement despite the close bond they once had Patrick also has issues of his own including trying to get in touch with his mother who was a drunk that got remarried. Lee is also facing perks all demons of his own especially especially from his past that made him the anti social person he became. I will say what makes the movie interesting is how the flashbacks show the events of the past shaped the present."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,5/10,"And just a general bummer.Granted, Affleck's performance was very good. And the kid was likable. But there wasn't much of a road traveled. It was just walking back and forth on the same street. Very repetitive. I believe it took 45 minutes to get to when Affleck finds out he's the guardian. Way too long. Just a lot of regular people being regular people in the midst of a tragedy that was likely to happen eventually. I found it very odd how the kid takes the death of his father for granted. Sure, there was one panic attack very late in the movie, but it really didn't seem genuine.And everything was very repetitive. Many different ways on how the kid wants to have sex with his girlfriend. For some reason this is very important to him, even though he's having sex with another girl. Doesn't really make him likable. I really didn't find that it would be difficult to find time to have sex with either of them.Then several instances where Affleck and the kid have back-and-forths that were funny, but were numerous. No real reason why the kid had an attachment to Affleck being that he was absent a vast majority of the time. It was odd that the dead father completely prepared for his death but there was no money left over for an engine for the boat. And it was just a bummer. Affleck failed at the task at hand. He could not move forward. He was an aggressive drunk at the beginning and the same at the end. He did not overcome anything. Life just went on. How cheery!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,9/10,"The estranged brother (Casey Affleck) returns to hometown because his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges) is suddenly parentless and needs a legal guardian. There's also an unsolved story with ex-wife (Michelle Williams).This is the third movie of writer-director Kenneth Lonergan who has previously made ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000) and ""Margaret"" (2011). I actually liked both but nothing prepared me for this kind of quality work.Well, nothing except having only heard good buzz, and having read that the project has won 132 movie awards already (out of 156 nominations). No info on Academy Awards yet, but Affleck already got a Golden Globe for the role (best actor in drama).But even more importantly, the movie is strong in every conceivable way. Directing, subtle but passionate acting, slow thoughtful mood.The story is about being unable to cope with loss, just like it often is in real life – without eventual enlightenment or relief. If you push the grief down and hide it, it never really gets a chance to resolve and go away.And sometimes one doesn't even want the grief to go away because it has become such an important experience, a real part of you. You couldn't even imagine yourself without it.It's not flashy. During some of the more pivotal moments, such as the one seen in the picture abova, I almost wished it was flashier. But there's no doubt that the result is a powerful and moving. You will probably get misty-eyed. I know I did. But I'm easy that way.I am pretty glad that Matt Damon didn't star in this because of the scheduling conflict and let Casey Affleck do it instead. I mean, I love Damon, but without him stepping down, we would not know how good Ben's younger brother can really be. And he does not have this bad voice anymore either!The other cast is good as well, of course. Michelle Williams is one of the best American movie actress of her generation. Sadly, she does not have a big role here."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 June 2017,7/10,"I found the initial pace of this movie painfully slow. But by the end I felt much more involved. I got to care about the characters, especially Patrick who is virtually orphaned and frustrated that his Uncle Lee does not want to be his guardian. Lee is hard to take because he is so estranged from the world. We eventually find out why. Lee has been damaged by an enormous sense of responsibility and guilt for the ruin of his life, marriage and family. Aside from the slow pace, the telling of the story out of chronological order - with very little in the way of clues when we have gone back in time - makes this movie difficult to follow, especially for young children who, in any case, would not enjoy the movie's focus on death and tragedy.As I became more interested in understanding Patrick's predicament and Lee's difficulty in providing his nephew with what he needs, I understood the appeal of this movie for some. It is a deep and troubling psychological exploration of the debilitating effects of guilt.Lee has a pathological need to get into bar fights. We come to understand that this is a way of punishing himself. It is interesting that in the big city, everyone blames him for starting these fights, but when he goes back to his home town, at least the bartender who is a family friend, tries to prevent Lee from getting too badly beaten and then takes Lee home where his wife bandages and comforts Lee.Meanwhile, Patrick goes to visit his estranged mother, but finds that she is as nervous if not more so than he is. She is so upset by his visit that her new husband, Jeff, sends Patrick an off-putting email in which he suggests Patrick no longer contact his mother directly but only go through Jeff. Clearly, any idea of Patrick moving in with his mother is dashed.Finally, Lee works out a compromise that will keep Patrick's familial and financial options as open as possible while minimizing but not completely eliminating his own responsibility for Patrick.In the end - after nearly two hours and twenty minutes - Lee is far from creating perfect solutions to his own or anyone else's problems. Most disappointing of all, he cannot resolve the crushing guilt that keeps him from accepting his ex-wife's forgiveness or helping Patrick in the way that Patrick would like him to; Lee remains a damaged person. This may be frustrating for the audience at the same time that it is realistic. A seasoned psychotherapist once told me that people don't so much overcome their problems as, at best, find a way to go around them. This is the best that Lee is able to do, but in doing so he does show more compassion for himself and his nephew than he showed for anyone at the beginning of the story."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 June 2017,8/10,"After watching Manchester, I wasn't sure what I thought about it. But after a while, my litmus test is - would I watch it again. That's a solid yes. Casey Affleck is outstanding as Lee. Lee is constantly brooding because of all the things that life has thrown at him. Affleck gives Lee the persona of someone who is lost, no matter where he is, and he pretty much knows that his life will never be as it was.Michelle Williams plays Lee's ex-wife Randi. She's terrific too, though she doesn't get nearly enough screen time.The director skillfully uses flashbacks to show the events that led to Lee's current misery. Lee's brother Joe is sick too, and Lee gets thrust into the job of taking care of his nephew Patrick, who he's known since Patrick was little. the good ole days. but those days are gone for everyone. Now they all cope in their own way. Lee suffers constantly from the weight of life, but somehow, maybe it's the Sea, maybe it's Patrick, maybe it's his ordinary job as a maintenance man, somehow he survives, one foot in front of the other. I want to watch it again to study more the relationships and script.Don't expect anything much happy from Manchester. Good ole fashioned pathos and suffering a la Leaving Las Vegas but with the Sea instead of Las Vegas. Terrific direction, terrific acting, terrific scenery, terrific editing, and some interesting music make this a terrific film. Enjoy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 November 2021,10/10,"I just watched Manchester by the Sea for the second time. Wow. An emotional rollercoaster of a film. It was even better on second viewing because you could understand the acting nuance in its context from the start. Casey Affleck is unbelievably good. Should be oscar winning performance. Went from 8 from first viewing to 9 on second. It is so thought provoking - especially if you've had painful experience of family dying too young. If you haven't seen it, you must. Keep your tissues close by. It is a masterpiece xx."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 January 2018,8/10,"This is a movie that tries to tell a story. A plausible, real-life story. It's a sad story, but, not all stories are happy and/or exciting. Also it's a ""it can happen to everybody"" type of sad story, not some utterly tragic but ""it rarely happens to anybody"" story.It's decently acted and directed. It manages to do what it set out to do. In a time of silly, escapist, political agenda movies, this is very refreshing. I actually forget the last time I watched such a movie that's not from 1980s or older.Putting in a few well-placed and realistic laughs also works. Such is life, even in time of sadness, there's stuff to laugh about.It's not without flaws. The ending is not well done. Nobody expected a happy-ending or a tragic one. But, still, it could have been done better. A good story has some kind of conclusion. This doesn't. It seems that director wanted to leave us with a kind ""documentary"" feeling, which is alluded to during the movie, but, it doesn't work. That ""documentary"" feeling is also not working well. Sometimes it's OK, but most of the time it doesn't fit. The bond between Casey Affleck and his nephew is also not well explored. Sure, he's a teenager who lost his dad, but, still, time passes and their interaction doesn't evolve on-screen as it is supposedly of-screen. It is a sort of a distraction, because the focal point of the story is in the past and has nothing to do with the nephew or his dad (Affleck's brother), but, still, making things work with his nephew is a road to healing for Affleck, which we kind of see he knows, but is not well portrayed.It's well worth the watch, especially for a modern movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 January 2017,7/10,"Manchester By the Sea is a hard hitting human drama from veteran writer/director Kenneth Lonergan about a lonely New England janitor who is forced into fatherhood after the sudden death of his older brother leaves him the sole guardian of his teenage nephew. First off, this film has fantastic performances. Everything you've heard is true and then some about the performances in this film, Casey Affleck especially. The supporting cast of Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler, Lucas Hedges and more are all phenomenal as well. It is very clear that Affleck set the tone for the film. Without him, this film would never even have gotten off the ground. The work he does here is truly special. The only issues this film has are in its writer/director.Kenneth Lonergan is no stranger to post-production dramatics and behind the scene meltdowns. After seeing Manchester by the Sea, I know why. The man is greedy with his films. Manchester by the Sea could have easily had thirty minutes taken out of it. The issue here is that Lonergan is so in love with the film he crafted that he doesn't take into account that the film itself is actually boring as hell. The only reason anyone wants to keep watching is Casey Affleck and even then, the film is so depressing and sad that it is hard to actively want to continue to watch it.Overall, Manchester By the Sea is more of a film about Casey Affleck's performance than it is anything else. The film itself is boring and moves extremely slow but Casey Affleck makes you want to keep watching and for an actor's performance to be so good that you almost forget your watching a boring film...that's pretty amazing to me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 August 2020,7/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a moving of a depressed and helpless uncle.It is amazing to see that Kenneth Lonergan and Casey Affleck worked together to take grief and depression seriously.This movie is subtle and sad. Manchester by the Sea is even better since you can relate with it, there is no cheesy and supportive dialogue nor feel-good moments.Some moments seemed slow but were later justified by the screenplay. In other words, there is neither apparent ""cliché"" of filling in this movie. Everything is constructed as a ""dialogue"" between the main protagonists."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 April 2021,7/10,"Watching ""Manchester by the Sea"" felt like attempting to suppress a yawn for over two hours - and by yawn, I mean a fountain of tears. But to call this movie sad would be a grave understatement. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is less sad and more thoroughly heart-wrenching; at every turn, it reveals pivotal information to its audience that furthers the plot, builds character, and cultivates an image of grief in the character of Lee Chandler, played by Casey Affleck.""Manchester by the Sea"" is at once relentlessly watchable but unbearably uncomfortable. It paints a picture of characters that are either irreparably broken or freshly wounded emotionally, and allows you to bask in their personalities and interactions without judgement. You'll see people make mistakes that haunt them, decisions that destroy them and hurt others, but through it all you'll find yourself unable to condone or condemn, because you'll understand exactly why everyone is acting the way they are.The movie follows Lee as he is attempting to care for his nephew after the sudden death of his brother. Lee, for reasons of his own, doesn't feel comfortable being his nephew's guardian, but all the same it is obvious he cares for the boy and wants to do right by him while also sticking true to his own sense of self. Because of reasons I won't spoil, Lee is a deeply damaged man, and Casey Affleck portrays this damage wonderfully. Every conversation he has is so true to life that it literally felt like I was watching a documentary at times - and this is true for literally every single character and actor in this film. There isn't a single actor who isn't marvelous in this movie - the acting, the dialogue, the interactions, all of it feels extremely realistic. There is no overacting in this film, just as there is no underacting; even when undergoing circumstances so horrifically painful, no one ever milks it for the camera, and this amount of dedication to realism elevates this film beyond what I expected.You see, ""Manchester by the Sea"" has a very distinct style to it - it feels less plot-focused and more slice of life, which may bother some, but didn't necessarily bother me, as early on I understood what kind of movie I was getting. In short, the film is a character study on damaged people, and just like life, things don't necessarily resolve themselves in a satisfactory manner. What I'm trying to say is that the film feels real, while also utilizing a decisively cinematic flair with its use of score.I absolutely loved the music in this film - it was very loud, very encompassing when it was used, but never felt distracting or as if it were trying to dictate my mood. In fact, most of the music felt very ""holy,"" for lack of a better word, and it gave the film a very ethereal, almost spiritual feeling to it. I have a feeling the music may bother some, but I was loving it the entire way through.All-in-all, ""Manchester by the Sea"" was a masterclass in acting, and I can honestly say I would've watched four hours of this movie if it meant I could've experienced more of the characters interacting with each other. That said, I was turned off by the abrupt and, in my opinion, unsatisfying ending - things felt unresolved, and while I get that was the point, it still didn't please me to watch, and I can't say I liked it. That said, the rest of this movie is so good that I can recommend it as a whole, and I will certainly be watching it again in the future, as I fell in love with its story and characters, even if I didn't love where things ended up."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 March 2017,,"The classic 1980 ORDINARY PEOPLE is set in the Gold Coast of Chicagoland particularly Evanston and Lake Forest. MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is set along the Bay of Boston particularly the city of Boston and the north shore village of Manchester By The Sea. Both films brilliantly photograph and edit travelogues of the part of the country in which they are set and in both cases the visual and the pace of the aural sets an enticing and welcome tone. In both cases an accidental death has driven a family apart with none of its remaining members yet settled as to how to cope with a tragedy they have yet to totally mentally process. Both mothers - Mary Tyler Moore near Chicago and Michelle Williams near Boston are bitter after losing their children. Both protagonists, Timothy Hutton near Chicago and Casey Affleck in and near Boston blame themselves for the accidental deaths and have melted down mentally because of this unsettled inner anguish. Both films are about external circumstances and inner determinations helping the estranged family members find ways to cope which they do by the end. A classy remake but not as totally winning as the one it mimics."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2017,9/10,"This film began very slowly, we are introduced to an unlikeable main character played by Casey Affleck. I would admit that I was quite bored by the openings of the film failing to see where this would be going. However at one particular point in to movie where everything comes clear and you understand this character's motives that's when everything starts to click and come into place. This film would probably be great for a second watch because when you fully understand the reasonings behind this character's very glum outlook everything makes so much more sense. Like I said after that point every other scene just build on and on as we follow this character through a path of redemption and a path of trying to forgive himself, as he tries so hard to move on. Obviously along with the amazing and beautiful shots from the coastal towns of Massachusetts all help to tell this beautiful and emotional story. The film's use of flashbacks were really good as well, the film very subtly and swiftly transfers in and out of the past and present, this makes a very compelling way of storytelling and is really made successful due to Casey Affleck's performance, the contrast between that same character before and after this tragedy is remarkable. He so woefully depicts the character in such a different ways it really makes audiences wonder what could possibly have happened (before the reveal) building on tension. And then making audiences feel so sympathetic (after the reveal) towards this character when we see the drastic differences in the character's outlook and behavior. As Michelle Williams' character put so brilliantly, "" My heart was broken, and I know yours is broken, too."" Such a compelling quote, such an amazing delivery. All such performances all contribute to building one of this years biggest Oscar contenders: Manchester by the sea. What makes the film thrive the most is how the film doesn't feel scripted and acted but the actor's are just so real and are portrayed as such real people that it completely sucks you in. Brilliant performances from the entire cast with the underlying tone of this subdued, raw realism makes Manchester by the sea a very worthwhile watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,,"Manchester by the Sea isn't for everyone. It's no La La Land, even though the the acting is superior. It deals largely with death and redemption...A man who loses everything through his own thoughtlessness and has a chance to turn his life around by caring for his nephew.The film is highlighted by Casey Affleck's underplayed performance. Yet, the final scene he has with Michelle Williams is so powerful and heart wrenching, it alone is Oscar worthy.Manchester plays out in present and flashback scenes which can be a bit confusing without any fades to quickly let you know when there is a flashback.As I said, this isn't light entertainment. But for serious film watchers it's a must see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,10/10,"This will be one of the most heart breaking and painful story that you will witness on screen in 2016 and it will take you down the road that can't be explained in words but mostly with emotions. Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is something like janitor and from the start we are aware that there is a lot of pressure put onto him but that there is more under surface. After his brother Joe passes away he comes to Manchester to take care of everything and after he met Patrick, Joe's son, he goes around making deals and finally goes to attorney that has Joe's last will. In moment of realisation that he is legal guardian of Patrick we are presented things from his past that will change whole viewing in the film from the bottom. In most brutal way we are shown what happened to change his character in such strong, painful and unbelievable way. That accident led to pressure and blame that was put on him and that kept eating him from the inside all this years and in that moment led to divorce from his wife Randi. Now in future he need to accept everything and make something out of it but with constant pushing and rejection. Patrick Chandler (Lucas Hedges) is a 16 year old teenager that tries to cope with everything that is happening but Lee's only worry is what to do now and in all that he makes a decisions that will be useless and finally will end in only one way. Scene where Lee and Randi (Michelle Williams) run at each other in road was one of the saddest moments ever shown and filled with so much pain and grief that it was really hard to watch that and believe how much they love each other. Michelle totally stole the show in couple scene she was in but Casey Affleck gave his best performance without any doubt as he is moving but filled with scars in his heart and Lucas Hedges also gave an pretty good performance. Kenneth Lonergan brought to us one of the greatest dramatic movie that there possibly could have been and his directing and originality in writing were superb. As it started on boat with Lee, Joe and Patrick now it ends with Lee and Patrick happily fishing and having found common language they sail to new future. 4/4"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2017,10/10,"It's great to be able to begin a review with these words: this is one of the best movies I've seen!Ever! For a film year 2016 has been! The treats come in a row. Although this film is from 2016, I saw it in January 2017. And for a fantastic start to the new film year. Rarely have I seen an interpersonal drama portrayed as honest, raw and unsentimental as in this strong narrative. Characterization is true, and the main characters appear very credible. Unlike other films, works scenes from past and present in an excellent manner, and supports the action. Although this film is set in its telling tone, then the underlying feelings there all the time, and it is communicated in a strong way. When we arrived at the theater this evening, there were many young people there. They'll probably be bored, we thought. We were wrong. They sat as enthralled as us, while this drama unfolded. I will not divulge any of the contents, except that this is about the relationship between an uncle and a nephew. This is a family drama you absolutely should not miss. Here, film prices sprinkle well into the new year ...."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,10/10,"AMAZING!I dont know where to start, the film is super competent in everything that is proposed, has an excellent direction, giving the actors, and a montage of the story an incredible flow, and that makes you want more, even after an 2 hours film. The style of filming is also something that a very unique and beautiful feature for the feature film, with a set of cameras well into the ""standard"". The cast is also very good, but it's worth mentioning Cassey Affleck, who even with a few lines, goes through a sadness and depression that his character has to carry with his gaze. Besides, the reports of congratulations along the way Narrative, where this look must consequently change. But what fascinates most in ""Manchester By The Sea"" is its story, without much talk about what synopsis already says, the film has a real life story, giving problems and also in the bliss, Doing it yourself to ask, Is giving her life or worth she deserves. The end only ends all this (without spoilers), closing with a golden key a representation of the real world, where everything is not good, and not everything is bad, but regardless of how difficult, Not to be to continue living ..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 May 2018,7/10,"I didn't really know anything about this film when I went to see it other than that Casey Affleck was supposed to have given a really good performance. I think he did a decent job in portraying this troubled character. It was one of those kind of quiet, brooding characters that doesn't really say much, which to me explains why so many reviewers on here criticized his performance. To me at least it seems many viewers need lots of dialogue and action for it to be considered 'real acting'. This type of performance is literally always lost on viewers with those type of expectations. Michelle Williams also gives a strong performance, although she had deceptively little screen time. I will say that some of the 'pop' classical music choices chosen as part of the score did kind of throw off the film's rhythm for me. While there wasn't any new territory covered or introduced here I still enjoyed it enough that I felt good about having seen it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2017,7/10,"This film suffered heavily in Oscar buzz, in my opinion, a lot of critics and people on social media praising this film as one of the best. This only increases your expectations for the film going into it, which unfortunately came back to bite this film in the arse. Casey Affleck, steals the film and is his best performance of his carrier, eventually coming out of his brothers shadow in the industry at last. His character is just like anyone else in this world, incredibly relatable and a really emotion hook to the character for obvious reasons. However it is Affleck's performance that is the one stand of the film and it is a fantastic achievement to an incredibly underrated actor, in my opinion. Aside from personal difficulties of the screen, Casey Affleck 100% deserved the Oscar for best actor because that is what he is being judge on his performance, and at some points it was tear jerking and really difficult to watch. Truly brilliant and his acting in this film should be championed. The story of the film is pretty depressing and sad, the obvious reasons that it deals with two family traumas that have happened in one family. Firstly Casey Affleck's and Michelle Williams characters loosing their three kids to a house fire is truly horrifying and a huge emotional punch to film. It was interesting to see that this part of the story was inserted mid during the film instead of setting it up at the beginning with could have been done, however I don't believe it would have been as emotional successful. Then we have Affleck's brother played by Kyle Chandler who suddenly dies, which starts the main heart beat of the film, due to Affleck now having to be Chandler's sons guardian. It shows the roller-coaster of what a situation of that nature would be like in the most simplistic and powerful way. Its the small details or the long pauses in scenes that are really effective and powerful, and keep the essence of the film the same throughout. In a bizarre turn of events at the end of the film, the story decides to just give up and stop. The ending of this film is dreadful and is a bad attempt of a cliffhanger or what happened next moment. Maybe Im looking too much into it and that was what was meant to happen, but the film never tried to slowly close or tie the loose story ends and grind to a halt gradually. It felt like there was a bit of build up towards to end which made you feel as if something else was going to happen, it was build up scene, more build up, end! I don't think it worked and let the film down a lot.Other negatives Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges, firstly Williams how on earth she got nominated for awards last year was incredible due to the fact she has three-four scenes at the most in this film. One of them to be fair as very emotionally powerful but I didn't feel as if the was a enough that warranted such praise, there is nothing wrong just not out of this world. Lucas Hedges is a good up and coming actor but this film was a bad misjudgement on either his or the directors part, he was an arsehole throughout this film. I personally felt no sadness towards the character which is bizarre considering what has happened to him, he actually became annoying it was that bad, in the end I hated the character. All in all the film is good, the directing is fine nothing outstanding but solid. The score of the film is also good and effective in its use, Casey Affleck gives one of the best performances ever and the best of his career. However the slow pace of the film, the ending and the other characters were just not up to the same level as Affleck's performance which is a real shame. Unfortunately this film suffered from all the hype which is a shame, this film is 70% out of 100 a good decent film but not a happy one!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2018,7/10,"This film feels a little long and the editing/cinematography could use some work, but the acting is award-worthy! It is definitely Casey Affleck's best work and also a wonderful performance by Lucas Hedges!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,1/10,"What is this? Best picture contender? What? I went into this with high hopes expecting to like it. I might as well have watched paint dry. I've seen slow movies before and can handle them often times (I recently enjoyed Silence), but this is the type I can't. And there's nothing overly artsy about it; Silence was more artsy than this. This is the kind of movie that makes you never trust critics again. It has about a 96 on metacritic, and its page ads have raving reviews, even from the so called most reputable ones like Time and Rolling Stones. I thought with the Boston setting and hearing it's slow and about a troubled young man (Affleck), it might at least be somewhere in the range of Good Will Hunting. The first ten minutes actually began that way and had my hopes up, but that was it. The rest of the movie went downhill, and it didn't even come close to Good Will Hunting. Positives are good acting (but I didn't feel Casey Affleck was Oscar worthy outside of the first ten minutes, an over-hyped performance with him slated to win best actor), at times realistic depictions of suburban Massachusetts, and a sincere effort at feeling for the characters that works sometimes, but not all the time. I'd put it up there with all the mediocre slow movies I've ever seen through the years, most of which I regretted I even watched. They're all 3-6 out of 10 snore fests. This gets a 4. Zzzzz3/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 September 2020,7/10,A very human film showing the disfunction of family and how death can permanently ruin people. There was not much hope to be found here. I found myself sad and disappointed the way the story ended. Im not sure why Hollywood loves movies like this that tears down hope and concentrates on the victimhood of man.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2018,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a movie directed by Kenneth Lonergan and stars Kasey Affleck as a character named Lee who after an event in his life gets depressed but then he is forced to take care of his nephew and now we have a movie.This movie has a very fragmented narative structure due to the fact that it has a lot of flashbacks and at times it is hard to tell when the flashback starts and where it ends. It reminded me of ""Primer"" and just like that movie this structure is very uninteresting and uncaptivating to watch because it's not like in ""Memento"" where it captivates you with how the flashbacks are done within the story, or to put it more simply in Memento the viewer was curious about how the story would develop and in the end he was rewarded. Here because the transition while being not so obvious, it doesn'the captivate the viewer and doesn't make him curious enough so that in that he end the payoff would be satisfying. At least that's how I felt it. The story itself is very sad and overall the movie is very sad. It gives you like 70% sadness and 30% hope. But for me if it doesn't give me 55-45 is way too depressing. And I get the movie tried to depict that and in some way reminded me of ""Still Alice"" but in this movie there were more supporting performances. One of my gripes with this movie is that in being artistic and realistic it looses entertaining quality and it's less captivating. Another issue I had is that the inner feelings of Lee are not emphasised well enough to make me care for him and suffer with him. One thing I liked though are the performances which were all top-notch notch no matter the screen time. The movie also had realism... and that was mainly due to its story, set pieces and performances which at times made me forget that I was watching a movie and made me feel like in a real situation. Props to the movie for that. The last thing I'll mention that bothered me somehow was that certain scenes or moments were in there just to fill the runtime which is quite long indeed. At times the movie was really entertaining with it's real life depiction but that was only in some scenes not the whole movie. That's why the screenplay for me was good but not as good as Arrival or La La Land to be honest. Casey's performance was almost perfect and I understand him winning the Oscar. In conclusion: good movie with good story, intriguing but ultimately uninteresting narative, great performances, great sense of realism but with somewhat filler in it to make the runtime bigger. 8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 January 2019,8/10,"A really great movie. Very melancholic but I don't mind that so much. The performances are outstanding from all the cast. There are also moments of humour which are unexpected due to the overall tone of the film which is very much about family, forgiveness and moving on. Great scenery and cinematography also which made me want to in fact take a trip to Manchester by the Sea. I was not particularly happy with the ending which seemed to be quite sudden and lacking conclusion but maybe that's just me, who was hoping for a different direction in the end. Just because the direction was not what I preferred it does not make it wrong. The only thing that grated on me was the soundtrack. The music was great but at times I felt did not resonate with the scenes and film overall. Some really key, rather emotional scenes were overshadowed by random song choices which rather caused a distraction. A great movie though and would highly recommend it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2017,1/10,"This film is absolutely ruined by the constant use of loud music, sometimes overwhelming the dialogue. It's so intrusive it ruined a film I had very much looking forward to. There's an emotional part where Lee Chandler is giving his testimony to the police, and throughout it all an orchestra plays Adagio. Now this is a great piece of music, but it has no place in a police statement when we're trying to hear what is being said. This is pure and simply very poor directing and editing. 1 hour into the film, some way short of halfway I turned it off as it was spoiling it for me so much. Kenneth Lonergan...did you want to be a conductor instead of a director?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 December 2016,1/10,"'Manchester by the Sea' is set in a similar demographic to Lonergan's earlier film 'You Can Count On Me', which depicted a couple of New England siblings struggling to deal with emotional turmoil caused by some of life's everyday problems. Manchester's plot is relatively simple - a reclusive, short-tempered handyman called Lee is entrusted with the unwanted guardianship of a teenage nephew after his brother's sudden death, and this upheaval complicates his dismal existence.Michelle Williams and the support cast do a decent job creating the Massachusetts coastal community surrounding Lee, but Casey Affleck's one-note performance is too stubbornly dour to sustain interest in his lead character over a two-hour film. The camera trudges after Lee throughout the proceedings, revealing a monosyllabic, hard-drinking sourpuss. Eventually, through flashbacks, it shows how various intoxicants combined with a minor oversight cost him his sense of humor and much else besides. By the time this revelation has arrived, it's become hard to care overmuch for the surly protagonist, his sorry tale or how he resolves his current dilemma. Manchester would have probably been a more memorable story if Lonergan's script had chosen to follow the path of Michelle Williams' sharp-tongued Randi."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,7/10,"I went into this expecting something like The Perfect storm 2 , I knew it was set in New England and was about a boat but that's all I knew ,I try not to read reviews before to avoid spoilers likewise I try to avoid spoilers in my reviews and concentrate on the themes , acting and technicalities rather than reveal too much of the plot. It takes a while to absorb the information given in this film it's a while before you realise there's a constant time shift going on . Likewise you don't feel emotionally drawn in particularly as the male leads show so little emotion . It's only once the revelation is made half way through that you realise that the males are harbouring so much emotion suppressed inside and have no idea how to handle it . From this point on you feel drawn in and it answers your questions.The latter part of the film is about atonement and characters coming to terms with their loss and how their actions affects those that really love them . It makes you question your own relationships and think about how you would deal with loss . A lot has already been written about Casey Afflecks acting and the accolades are well deserved .The standout for me was Kyle Chandler ironically playing Joe Chandler , although seen in retrospect his acting was impressive. But the whole cast deserve praise too . This is another low budget film at $8.5m that shows that good films can be made and given the distribution thanks to events like the Sundance festival.It's not quite 8/10 but a well deserved 7/10 On a completely separate note I bet it increases the tourist trade to this part of New England"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,9/10,"This is a powerful film also with a lot of humor. Casey Affleck plays a man who becomes his nephews guardian when his brother dies. We see the relationship with the brother in flashback and another tragedy that afflecks's character must endure. This is a really touching and emotional film. Casey Affleck shows all emotions he can be funny, sad and violent at times. What his character has to go through is a lot and you can't help but feel for him. This film also has a lot of humor with his nephew and some very funny lines. This film really packs an emotional punch and feels very family orientated. The young boy that plays his nephew is very good and we could have a future star on our hands. Michelle Williams is also great as Affleck's former wife and she has a couple of really heartfelt scenes. This is one of the best films of the year beautifully directed and acted. I highly recommend this film"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 March 2021,5/10,"While I understand the first two are intentional, no excuse for the last part. I understand its a movie about mental health, which certainly has its moments, but its a hard watch and not all that intelligent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 April 2018,9/10,"Our confidence is not as great as we thought. its size, until faced with the destiny. Do not tell me never to do it, it could make life. The film tells this very very well. Affleck deserves the reward. We bored Heavily made, exaggerated, with the biography player. Very simple and good acting."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 April 2018,7/10,"I didn't really enjoy Moonlight or La La Land. This film would have been my pick for best picture that year. I always said Casey Affleck was underrated and a much better actor than his Brother, but I guess he isn't underrated anymore after this film. Great story, brilliant acting and despite so much tragedy in this film, you end up with a smile on your face and are reminded that no matter what comes at you, life keeps going."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 June 2020,7/10,"This is the story of an uncle who, his reluctance notwithstanding, is made a guardian of his teenage nephew according the stipulations of his dead brother's will. This is not a new concept per se, but a few minutes into the film, you can see how this one is different from all the others with a similar theme. Thus, what the premise of the story lacks in originality is more than compensated by the reason why the uncle is so reluctant.Casey Affleck is excellent as the man on the run from his demons, and what demons they are! Enough to bring the strongest of people down to their knees. To have to carry such a huge load on one's conscience!
Ben O'Brien is great as the annoying, selfish, sex-obsessed, popular and rebellious teenager.In many ways, the uncle Lee and the nephew Patrick are very much alike and so they have many standoffs and shouting matches with each other. The only major difference is in their interactions with the other gender. In fact, Patrick's behaviour in this regard was the only thing in this film that I had a serious problem with. I fully realize that there is no code-of-conduct for a teenage kid who loses his father and yet I couldn't help feeling a little disgusted by this young Lothario. At one point Patrick even asks his uncle to distract this girl's mother so that he can have sex with the daughter and gets upset when this scheme fails! All the while, he has a steady girlfriend who knows nothing about his two-timing. He's also very mean & patronizing towards the girls who meet him while his uncle is dropping him off to school. When his uncle asks if they too are his girlfriends, he replies, ""They wish"". This made me wish that Patrick's character was written with a little more empathy. I so wanted to like this kid but just couldn't.The direction, cinematography and background score are all good. This could have been an overly sentimental movie given the subject matter. Fortunately, the makers have been very objective about the whole thing and have taken effort to lighten the heaviness with slight humor.A movie that you will never forget!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,8/10,"A commendable exploration of grief without the trite, requisite, sanitized conclusions and ""happy"" endings that leave people feeling good in the short term but completely unchanged for the long term. Director Kenneth Lonergan wants to show the real depths to sadness and grief. This doesn't include wallowing in it but instead living with it in the most mundane ways possible.In that sense, Casey Affleck is perfectly cast. Some actors transform for their roles, some actors are born only for certain roles they already fit. This is probably the latter, though it's no less remarkable for being so. This isn't Affleck playing himself, but instead doing a soul-search within himself to play a variation of the kind of characters he was born to play. We are all the better for it. Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams also do great work.Lonergan finds a way to capture without exclamation all the ways in which a person can be ruined, without even being a bad person, while still dealing with everyday life. He's changed, but the world hasn't, and it won't just for him. This sounds depressing, and it can be, and it sounds nihilistic, which it's not. There is light in this, if you look, which is really the key after all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,8/10,"Screenplay/Scriptwriter Kenneth Lonergan directs his third film about family responsibility, grief and tragedy, possibly not know for writing films like Analyse This and That and Gangs of New York. Even though he's credited as the writer as well as director, which he is, the original idea wasn't his but belongs to John Krasinski and Matt Damon. I don't believe Krasinski is as famous over here in the U.K. than he is in his native states, but you might know him from Away We Go, last year's incredible 13 Hours or the American version of The Office, plus being the husband to one lovely Emily Blunt. He discussed the idea with Damon whilst on set with The Adjustment Bureau who then, both pitched to Lonergan to write, with Damon set to make his directorial debut and star. Lonergan during this time was having court issues with his previous and second feature Margaret, which delayed the writing, and once he had completed the screenplay, Damon was too tied up with scheduling conflicts he dropped out of directing and starring to produce only, Krasinski himself becoming an executive producer, putting Lonergan at the helm. Not trying to take anything away from Lonergan, it's his screenplay and more his film than anyone else, with his directing style, he gives quite a bleak, realistic impression. His camera work is brilliant using distance to create that bystander viewpoint. I don't want to give anything away, but the subject matter is harsh and traumatic as we watch Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) deal with his return from isolation, racked with remorse. A family tragedy results in him returning to his small-town-mentality home of Manchester By The Sea to watch over his nephew, both against his own choices but is obligated to do so. Casey Affleck is certainly coming into his own and I don't mean to knock his past performances, not at all. His Gone Baby Gone I think was his killer role, remembering him from Ocean's 11, Good Will Hunting and last year's Finest Hour, but this is definitely his most powerful and stand out performance. And he's not alone, Lucas Hedges who plays the nephew, Patrick is outstanding also, being his first major role to play and provides quite a bit of comedy relief. He does extremely well up against Affleck as the stubborn teenager who just wants to get on with his usual life of girls and ice hockey. Can't say remember or even noticed Lesley Barber's score but listening to it in isolation, there's some nice pieces of music, using a minimalistic range of choral, strings and piano. What does stand out is the brilliant use of classical music in parts of the film, especially the scene with Albinoni's Adagio, one of my personal favourites. It's quite a story, very believable, emotional and can only try to imagine parents would find this heartbreaking. It's a tough and shocking story but it doesn't appear to have a proper ending, however, I'm not sure how they could have ended it and maybe that was the best option out of many other ends. You're lead on a path wondering what the outcome will be and then it just ends with with a final conclusion but thinking about it, it was actually quite refreshing. It's a good strong film about guilt, responsibility and forgiveness with a brilliant performance from Affleck, but the ending is weak. Certainly worth a watch just for the performance alone. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Affleck's performance. 81% 8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,,"This is not just a depressing movie, this is about real life and redemption, and for those who can't understand that after watching it, well, sorry.I am not about to go into a summary of the film, you've either already seen it and are reading reviews to get other viewpoints, or you haven't seen it and want to get viewpoints, having already looked up a synopsis or heard about the basic plot. At least, that's what I do, and I usually look for spoilers also, but that's just me.Casey Affleck's performance was grounded and realistic, and worth an Oscar, regardless of his personal problems, as while they are not the same as the unpleasant traits of his character in this film, his performance indicates depth and intelligence, and one needs that in order to redeem oneself. I hope so, anyway.As for depressing, yes, the subject matter is depressing and the main character's way of dealing with life is depressing, but I didn't find the film depressing at all, as it all leads to growth and redemption and left me not only feeling good about these characters at the end, but knowing that there will be resolution for other characters as well."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,7/10,"Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is given Guardianship of his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) when his brother dies and he is not happy about it. He wants to leave Manchester and go back to Boston, mostly because of the tragic event that happened in Manchester some time ago. Patrick wants to stay in Manchester and ""Houston, we have a problem."" We see 2-sides of Lee, one before the tragic event (via flashbacks) and later after the tragic event. We have no idea what happened as we will learn about that way, way later into the story. While he wrestles with his past, he must find a way to accommodate Patrick so he can get back to his life away from Manchester. He does have moments of pure anger when he will start a fight when someone looks at him funny-like and there is one incident when he tries to commit suicide. So he is really not as stable as he seems to be and this causes us to be wary of him.This is slow going and is more like a ""made for TV movie."" They want to give the Best Actor Oscar to Casey Affleck, but I wouldn't go that far. He does okay, but I think flashbacks were needed to show his guilt over that tragic event. There were none. Maybe his violent outbursts shows that guilt. Who knows? When we learn about that tragic event, we see Lee keep everything inside him We do see flashbacks of nicer times with family and with a young Patrick (Ben O'Brien), and wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and Lee's father, Joe (Kyle Chandler). The acting all around is very good. Later, when we see Lee's wife, Randi who remarried and with new child, I got the feeling that she was going to tell Lee that it was she who caused the tragic event, but that didn't happen, but we do see that she is still in love with Lee. Her screen time throughout was short but powerful. Notables: C.J. Wilson as George, a family friend; Matthew Broderick as Jeffery, stepfather to Patrick; and Tate Donovan as the Hockey coach. As mentioned, this is slow going, a kind of slice of life where the players just act out life normally. A little too much language in the beginning, then it goes away. (Why do they do that?)Anything Oscar worthy in here? No. Well, maybe Michelle Williams as Randi for Best Supporting Actress. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 April 2020,9/10,"The story takes you down with itself. The family, relations, sadness and emotions. You cant feel anything else. It seems everything happening in movie is happening to you. The things we say, the regrets, forgiveness makes you question about yourself. The sound, acting, visuals all are great. You feel for the actors the way they have indulged in the character. One mistake and what society does to him? The inability to understand ones state of mind and emotions. How to handle grief? Total emotional. Stop crying now."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,7/10,"If I hadn't been as engrossed as I was in watching this film I would have given it a 6 or a 5, but it definitely scores for holding my interest. Besides that, however, I'm left feeling strangely unsatisfied. I think the reason is that I wanted to see Lee, the main character, achieve more growth than he did. The way the story was set up, Lee was the character who suffered the most, who had the most problems, and the most to overcome. Everyone seemed to have it more together than him. Yes, he suffered serious tragedies, somewhat brought on by his own actions, and that was part of the story. I kept feeling that the film was working toward an ending in which Lee would progress, so that the ending would be a real happy one. Instead,the ending was more realistic, a kind of statement by the filmmakers saying OK we'll give you something but not everything. I was also distracted by the music. I felt that the opera and somber classical music was used deliberately to give the film an air of tragedy, but it felt melodramatic. It seemed as if the director was not secure enough about the emotional impact so added this extra layer of pathos. Acting, especially by Affleck, was excellent. Overall I'd say an engaging story with a disappointing ending."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 December 2016,10/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is an amazing character study of a man dealing with guilt and loss. It is pretty depressing, but also comedic at times and its final shot is relatively hopeful. While the film and its characters may seem simple at first glance, they are layered and complex underneath.Casey Affleck, one of the most underrated actors working today, is Lee Chandler, a lonely and broken down man, far away from the people he loved. He works as a janitor and has constant contact with people, but can't truly connect with anyone. He returns to his hometown when his brother dies, and in his will it says that Lee must take care of his son, Patrick, played well by Lucas Hedges. The film tracks the way that both Patrick and Lee cope with the loss and how their relationship grows.The cinematography and editing in the film are subtle and impressive, with the way scenes are cut together adding emotional impact or depth to the characters. The juxtaposition of two scenes can make a point about a character, and the way certain scenes are edited can show the internal struggle of a character. The cinematography also conveys different layers of Lee, such as Lee's disconnect from the people in his life. For instance, in the scene in which Lee confronts his ex- wife again, his wife is standing on the left side of the screen and he is standing on the right side. In the background on the left side, there is a dark wall, while the background on the right side is very light, showing a clear divide between the two characters.Much like ""Moonlight"", my favorite film of the year so far, this film is a visually impressive, emotionally involving, subtle, very well edited, and powerfully acted character study. The progression of each character is very realistic. The characters don't suddenly get better, because life doesn't work that way. There are no sudden moments of understanding or epiphany, there is just the hint of hope underneath all of their guilt and grief. However, they also don't just mope and whine the whole time. They do try to get away from their grief, and they try to form connections, and they try to move on. But, in the end, it just isn't that easy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 June 2017,,"Am I missing something? I expected to see some great acting and a good film. Instead I see long boring scenes where nothing is happening and performances that are definitely overrated. Believe me, I wanted to like this film. I tried twice to watch it on Netflix and turned it off to come back to. But each time I still got bored watching Casey Affleck look tragic and lost in space. Where is this great acting? I know this is supposed to be some deep feeling and yet I found it very trivial. No one seemed to be doing much of anything. Not one character had any sympathy at all. Just plain folks going through a very dull life makes a dull movie in my mind. And Oscars? Please, not in this viewers mind. Also Michelle Williams just went around being a sour puss for about 10 minutes and she gets Best Supporting Actress nom? It seems I am one of the few who wasn't impressed. So many others saying it was a brilliant movie. Guess I must have missed that."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 November 2021,10/10,"I think for a lot of fathers, especially those from New England, this movie truly reaches out and talks to the challenges of raising a family while dealing with their own struggles. It's a complicated set of emotions, and this movie goes about telling its story in a very simple way. Affleck is totally on point. Nuanced, genuine, and suffering in every scene. The backstory is doled out poignantly. For me, this is what great filmmaking is all about. It reaches into you and shows you a bit of yourself. I think we all share in that experience, and in that, maybe there's just a bit of redemption and forgiveness. Maybe it's not for everyone. But it strikes a chord with me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 October 2016,8/10,"Premiereing at 2016's Sundance Film Festival, Director/Writer Kennath Longerman tells the story of Boston handyman Lee Chandler. After the death of his brother Joe, Lee must return to his old home town of Manchester Massachusetts where he's left to deal with the funeral arraignments, taking care of his 16 year old nephew, as well as attempting to cope with his past life their. Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted, this film is a real Oscar contender and definitely one to look out for.Although featuring its share of characters, Michelle Willaims and Kyle Chandler are great in the scenes they are in, but the film predominately stars a man and a boy. Firstly the boy, Lucas Hedges does a pretty decent job as Patrick Chandler, a confident and sarcastic 16 year old who deals with his grief in his own way. Hedges is great with his sarcastically comedic performance, but he also shows a serious and emotional side of a boy about to be a man only now without the man who raised him.Alongside Hedges is the films star Casey Affleck. Affleck shines in as the downtrodden and distant Lee Chandler. Casey's performance is extremely contained and interior and perfectly brings to life a tragic character that you are enormously sympathetic towards, but also Affleck brings a cynical sense of humour to the role as well. This film is a character piece and Casey Affleck plays the main focus, and for what he has shown, an Oscar may be coming his way.As well as the characters being well acted upon they are also well written. The acting and characters are great, and I believe this is hugely down to Longerman's writing and direction.Kennath Longermans script is outstanding, the structure is unbelievably good as the film jumps back and forth between flashback and present day seamlessly without any confusion. The structure and pace is as much down to Longerman's directing as well as his writing, and so Longerman is two thirds of what makes this film so effective (acting being the final third). Longerman creates authentic characters and finds the right balance of both tragic drama and sarcastic and cynical humour that makes this film really effective sympathetic.Overall, Manchester By The Sea is a fascinating yet haunting film that is well crafted on many levels. A real Oscar contender for writer director Kennath Longerman and lead actor Casey Affleck. This film will stick with you Long after you leave the theatre, and personally made me appreciate my family a lot more."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 March 2020,8/10,Amazing acting and also great sense of humor in this movie. I don't really know how else to praise it rather than to tell I laughed and cried.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2017,5/10,"No idea why people are slobbering all over this movie when it basically puts you to sleep for two hours, with the exception of two (maybe three?) scenes of powerful, emotive acting from Casey Affleck.Seriously, not sure why the screenplay wastes so much time on nothing. We didn't need six repetitive scenes in a row of Affleck fixing toilets, etc. One or two establishes the character just fine ... moving on here! It was at least an hour into the film before the point became clear, and it didn't need to be any more than 20 minutes. Blame the editor.Also, if this film had been edited into chronological order instead of trying to be all artsy with the time juxtaposition of flashback scenes, it would have been immensely more powerful. As it is, there's no incentive to invest in the boring characters.And what's with the music? Geez. Talk about failing to set mood and tone. Just a complete fail for the soundtrack.Two best scenes: Affleck in the police station and Affleck on the sidewalk with Michelle Williams (who is drastically underused in this movie). You cry right through them, and then you wonder why the whole movie couldn't be as good as those two scenes.Waste of two hours if you ask me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 January 2017,,"The seasons most melodramatic, gut punching and tragic story lays all its weight on Affleck's shoulders, that singlehandedly carries the film, from emotional moment to emotional moment, aptly supported by Hedges in a very promising performance. Lonergan writes and directs the nonlinear story, making use of suitable flashbacks to give insight and characterization to his characters, especially Williams in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it and frankly overrated performance.Despite its heartbreaking and emotionally violent themes and their unravelment, Lonergan0s final catharsis is not melodrama for melodrama's sake; it is actually a quite adult message that you should go see, digest, talk about. You might just realise that there's quite a sweet message of family, loss, limits and how to overcome them (or not)."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 April 2017,1/10,"I am dumbfounded by popular films that feature depictions of utter misery. It's as if this film (and its kind) are visual aids for people who haven't ever had anything bad happen to them in their own lives. WHY would anyone want to delve into another person's unremarkable story of bad luck to a resolution where there's literally no payoff in terms of any glimmer of hope? FIlms like like this serve almost no purpose save for being a treat for ""authenticity"" seeking hipsters.In terms of the technical aspects of the film, the cinematography was mundane, and the ham-fisted handling of the flashbacks were a tad confusing and felt out of place and poorly timed. If you want a hit film, kids, attach an A-lister to a project that features abject circumstances foisted upon your protagonist. You can't lose."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 June 2020,9/10,"Manchester By The Sea is a 2016 drama directed by Keneth Lonergan and starring Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams.
This is without a doubt one of the most emotional films I have ever sat through, I've watched it twice now and both time I cried. I also think that this is one of the best film of the decade and I'm talking up near the top, it's a remarkable film to say the least.
The acting is great, Michelle Williams is phenomenal, espeacily in that one sequence where she talks with Casey's character and tells him he can't just die that, let's be real, probably made 90% of the viewers cry, at least on the first watch, Lucas Hedges is great as well in one of his earliest big roles and of course Casey Affleck is tremendous playing this character who thinks of himself as dead inside and unable to be guardian of his nephew ,even though loving him, due to the grief from the death of his childreen in a housefire that was his fault but just like Randi says that is not true (being dead inside) and he can not shake off his emotions espeacily in the town where the unfortunate event happenned.
The story is great with numerous incredible scenes like the one at the police station or when Lucas Hedges shows how well he can perform in the freezer scene.
I also love the beautiful cinematography, the cold colours of the film, mainly blue and white, and overall the entire look of the film.
The score wich is one of my favourites from recent years is also very good.

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 December 2016,7/10,"Manchester by the Sea directed by Kenneth Lonergan is about lives of two brothers Joe Chandler( Kyle Chandler from Zero dark Thirty) and Lee Chandler ( Casey Afleck from Gone baby gone) who enjoy each other's company and spend lot of time together. Joe takes care of his son Patrick(Lucas hedges) when his wife Elise(Gretchen Mol) prefers alcohol to motherhood, moves away to CT and leads her life. Joe loves his boat, his son, his friends and his brother Lee. Lee was happily married to Randi( Michelle Williams) and had 3 kids. But after a very sad event, Lee loses his family and is now a quiet, withdrawn man, working as a super for apartments. When all was fine, Lee spend time on Joe's boat with Joe and Patrick. Lee's life is sad again when Joe dies. Lee is left with Patrick. Lee finds it difficult to gather all his inner strength and move on. Casey Afleck expresses sadness very well with his facial expressions. There is not much of a script but long silences. The story is sad and Casey Afleck did a good job . Movie is over 2 hrs long. There are many unnecessary scenes especially involving Patrick. With good editing this movie had potential to be Oscar nominee. This year Casey Afleck may be competing with his brother Ben Afleck( movie Accountant)for Oscars. Casey Afleck as Lee was exceptionally good."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 January 2017,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a film tipped to do extremely well during this awards season and, having now seen it, it's easy to see why because Kenneth Lonergan's film is utterly brilliant, well and truly living up to the high praise it has received since doing the festival circuits towards the tail end of last year. Haunted by his past, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) struggles to deal with becoming the legal guardian of his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), after the death of his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler).I need to start by saying just how wonderfully written by Kenneth Lonergan Manchester by the Sea is, both the characters and narrative combining to present one of the more realistic depictions of grief I've ever seen in a film. Lonergan taps into the human emotion magnificently, leading to an emotional core to the film that hits silently yet hard at the same time.The fragmented narrative Lonergan chooses to use really gives depth to the story, cutting away to flashbacks of Lee's past where we see his relationship with his brother, Joe, and also of his fractured marriage to Randi, making Lee a character the audience can empathise with when he is forced into his current situation. Lonergan's screenplay does include quite a few light-hearted moments, to my surprise, particularly between Lee and Patrick, and they genuinely serve the film extremely well.The performances in Manchester by the Sea are quite honestly some of the best you'll see all year. Casey Affleck gives a superb lead performance that Lonergan's film well and truly deserves, and he would definitely be a worthy winner of all the major awards, one scene in particular that should seal them all for him. Disjointed from friends and family after the death of his brother, Affleck's often muted performance highlights the lack of connection Lee has with society, an almost silent rage feeling like it's constantly building.Lucas Hedges is a revelation as Patrick, opting to deal with his grief in the opposite way and keeping himself busy and surrounded by friends. Hedges more than holds his own when sharing a scene with Affleck and certainly has a big future ahead of him. Though she doesn't appear in the film as much as I thought she would, Michelle Williams does a brilliant job with one heartbreaking scene in particular.Manchester by the Sea is brilliant example of filmmaking from Kenneth Lonergan, who uses both narrative and character in such an effective way, leading to one of the more captivating films of the past decade."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 January 2017,3/10,"Whilke watching Kenneth Lonergan's 'Manchester by the Sea', I couldn't help feeling that Hollywood, in this age of market triumphalism, does not get a break. Casey Affleck, according to year end awards buzz, is a strong candidate for best actor. And yet, his performance is of a one note register. Death tracks him: be it of his brother or the burning alive of his own daughters. He's a rock; he keeps his emotions locked up within him. Occasionally with too much alcohol his fists do the talking. Appointed guardian by his late brother's will of his nephew a lusty 16 year old Patrick, he leaves his handyman's job for Manchester. The relationship is edgy, and Affleck as Lee Chandler keeps his emotions tightly wound to the point of almost bursting at the seams. He is emotionally dead;no catharsis...he remains the walking dead he was at the beginning of the film as he remains at the end fishing with his nephew before he returns to Boston for a new post as maintenance man for two buildings. He may love his nephew,and there is every reason to believe so, bu Affleck's character is in an emotional vise, at the end of what seems a long film, we're relieved that it is over. Many may be moved by a heavy as a hammer script but tears won't flow, nor heaving of breasts as the dreariness of 'Manchester by the Sea'."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 February 2017,6/10,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Manchester by the sea. The motion picture starring amongst others Casey Affleck, who will have a major breakthrough with this film and his acting. The movie is nominated for several Academy Awards. A movie about grief and tragic events that spins into sorrow. A deep travel into a family that is hit by several tragic things. Think of losing a child. Think of losing two children. Think of losing three children. Think of losing three children at the same time as your house is burning to the ground and your wife is leaving you. Think that all the above is your fault; you caused it. Think thereafter that your brother passes away just some time after. How would any human being react? Maybe Casey Affleck in his tremendous showcase of acting in the role of Lee Chandler can give a glimpse of one human beings sorrow. Manchester by the sea. Prepare for a hard ""adventure"" into sadness.I am trying. I am really trying to accept the fact that producers, writers and other external forces surrounding the movie industry want to put people, viewers and audience in an extreme state of sadness. Putting on tragedy and extreme negative life situations to that degree that it becomes a state of mind subconsciously within people is.... in my opinion that is just terrible. Manchester By The Sea made me drop my jaw of anger and sadness after about one hour. It hurt so much to watch that it disturbed me. It brought tears to my eyes. I said ""NO!"" so loud that it echoed here in my home. It made me feel nausea. I immediately asked myself why... why does the industry move towards tragedy, trauma and sadness? Why do they want some people to almost suffer (as I did when I saw these minutes of the movie)? Is the surface of people so hard that it takes the ""core of extreme"" to shake and wake the emotions up? The more something comes around, the more of that will become and come our way. So... what about exploring, displaying and conveying more joy, more positively aspects, more light, more ""success"", more warmth, more ways of being thankful, more ways of being helpful and more understanding? Yes, terrible things happen. They do. All the time. Around us. Media is all over it. Do we need more of it through the movies and series? No, is my direct answer. If we should consider to ""Heal the world"" (as Michael Jackson once sang) and create an atmosphere as ""We are the world"" (as both TOTO and Michael Jackson said and sang), then we should build more love, harmony, warmth and joy.This movie review is one of the strangest reviews I have ever done. That says a lot.Get me right; Manchester By The Sea is a remarkable movie. Recommended to watch. Well done. It deserves to be nominated. It is so solid and burdensome it almost becomes cumbrous. Know this fact when turning Manchester By The Sea on. For the first time in a long time, I felt total despair when the end credits arrived. And... I underline the opinions above.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Fantastic editing sometimes! Audio and visuals are spot on. - The actors : Academy Award nominations. Further questions? - Entertainment : See what I wrote above about tragedy and other things. I stand my ground. - Age : 116,2 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 March 2021,7/10,"From a technical stand point, this movie is incredible. The action is spot on, Casey Affleck proves that he was deserving of best actor from the future parts of the story where is has had such great losses that he no longer feels emotion as he used to, to the past sections where his emotions entangle him and emphasise his suffering. The story is very strong and extremely saddening. The setting is just as dull as the characters and the plot, the music is horrendously depressing and works far too well with the movie.The movie however was a bit repetitive, with the same fight between characters happening over and over and people driving back and fourth. The movie was also really long, or it felt that way, I often found myself asking for the end of the movie and when it came I was kind of relieved that I didn't have to be sad anymore. The movie overall is extremely real and one of the most gut-punching things I have ever seen, real or film. 7?10 shorten it a bit?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 April 2017,6/10,"The acting was great, but the movie itself is a long, moody, scenic film with little dialogue in many parts. An actor's film, I guess they call it, but for the average moviegoer it's a long, slow, depressing, but well-done movie. This story is about the solemn loner Lee Chandler. To add to his already tortured and depressed life, Lee's older brother dies and leaves behind a 16-year-old son Patrick for Lee to raise. As the movie progresses you get flashes back into Lee's past and what made him the empty, angry shell of a man he is today. Yes, there are emotional and touching scenes and I did cry several times. The thing you need to know going in is that the film is like you are watching someone live their distraught life which includes long silent scenes of shoveling snow, driving a car, sitting on the couch in grief, all with moody music and scenes of snowy New England's towns and bays. We watch as Lee wrestles with all his emotions, either in dark silence or quick, angry outbursts and we empathize as Lee tries to communicate with his grieving, outgoing teenage nephew while trying to make the best decisions for their lives going forward. I can see both how people loved the melancholic, artistic film and hated the boring, long, dour movie. So, it will depend on your taste in movies as to whether you'll enjoy this film in my Humble Opinion. I give it a 6.5 stars because I could only truly recommend this film to a few select people and wouldn't watch it more than once."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 March 2017,3/10,"I only gave this slog a 3 because the acting was decent and the scenery was pleasant. That critics could rave about such a relentlessly depressing, slow, monosyllabic, endless film is beyond my comprehension. I am 76, and am not looking for action or simplistic violence, but by the middle of this bore, which I saw on DVD, I and my 2 other seniors were making jokes about how boring and slow this film was. There was not one moment of genuine humor, nor were any of the characters really interesting, except maybe the 16 year old, who looked 20, and behaved and talked more like a 24 year old. Even Casey Affleck's performance, while realistic, was not especially demanding, as it was the operational definition of monotone. Always morose. What a monumental disappointment for me, as I had been really looking forward to it, based on critical raves."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 January 2017,8/10,"This film is incredibly subtle and authentic, which is what made it for me. It's not an over-the-top Oscar bait film where everyone is sobbing all the time and screaming at each other. Don't get me wrong, there are some very sad moments, but it's realistic in its portrayal of people and situations. Casey Affleck is phenomenal, with a very subtle and down-to-earth performance. This is the best I've ever seen him. He carries this burden, this heaviness, that is apparent in every line he says and every action he takes. You can tell he is held hostage by his past, and it is all through Affleck's performance. No dialogue ever says this. However, newcomer Lucas Hedges might have stolen the show, with his rapid fire delivery and teenage stubbornness. He and Affleck's chemistry is fantastic, and their banter makes from some great comedy. This film was surprisingly funny. It's not a yuckfest, but it has some great humor in it..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 December 2017,2/10,"....there wasn't even the pretense of 'connecting the dots' on the sequence of events that leads up to the older brother's passing....the harpie wife he had....etc.. Rather the viewer sees the arrogant nephew and son of the odler brother full of his need.That was the sum of the plot - plenty of immorality and lots of 'bawstun' foul language as well as the 'de rigeur' drunkeness coupled with a plot that constantly meandered everywhere with no resolution for a poor guy (Casey Affleck) excpet his need to act out violently.I'd say the sole gain from this movie was a dark and blunt reason why no one would never want to live in Boston under any circumstance. The 'Irish' ghettos are awful in what they produce as the res of the nation witnesses whenever the: Red Sox, Bruins, Patriots or Celtics come to play in their arenas or stadiumsA meandering mess."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 February 2017,7/10,"Lee Chandler, a plumber with a seemingly mediocre life, is forced to return to his hometown upon learning that his uncle is dead and now must take care of his nephew. That is the main premise of the story, which then develops in an extravagant and realistic way, the pain that Lee feels to have gone through acts of an incomparable terror, empty him completely of all kinds of emotions, broken and depressed, trying to live without any happiness, but this will be altered upon learning of the death of his brother.Now he must take care of his nephew, this is where history regains its flavor. Not only is Affleck's performance fascinating, but it gives a life- empty feeling like no other, where a being has been violated of all his emotions and now faces having to wake up every day with terrible memories. But even so, he will try to give everything he can to help his teenage nephew and overcome any pain they have to suffer. A story full of sad realism, acts that can happen to anyone, where we seek the answer to forgive ourselves and move forward with new ideas, even if it is something so terrible ... The performances are just great. The script itself is realistic and well done. With a very great direction and extra touches that add good flavor. A hard and true message, a dramatic movie among the best."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 May 2021,1/10,"Do yourself a favor and steam off some old wallpaper, or scrub the stained tile in your shower instead of wasting any time on this dog. I honestly cannot imagine anybody of either sex (or however someone can identify themselves nowadays) enjoying this thing. It was like watching paint dry. Casey Affleck appeared to try really hard to pull off his staring role, if there had been a role for him. Again, OMG, skip this loser and watch Bullwinkle cartoons instead if you don't need to rake leaves or carry out the trash."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2020,9/10,"Just rewatched it and its amazing how it gets me everytime. The cinematography is gorgeous, the plot is so simple yet so powerful and relatable. Have you ever wondered how it looks to be dead inside? That's Lee Chandler. Dead and broken and it breaks my heart watching him talk and move but he doesn't give up. He goes through several transformations within the movie but never stops being emotional damaged. The cast, specifically Casey, Michelle and Lucas are so over the top, so brilliant in their performances. It's one of the best drama movies released in a long time. Truly recommend it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 March 2021,7/10,"One of the reasons I love movies so much is because they allow me to experience worlds that I otherwise couldn't. This is especially true for films that create imaginary worlds filled with things that aren't real. But even if the world feels familiar and is close to the world in which we live in, there is often a fantasy or dream that would otherwise be unobtainable. And then there are movies like Manchester by the Sea. Movies that feel so excruciatingly real that they don't just remind us of the struggles we face every day, but they make us think about them, face them. Now, some might ask, why would you want to watch a film that reminds us of some of the worst moments of our lives when you could instead by on an exhilarating and epic space adventure? It's a fair question, but I think that this film, Manchester by the Sea, answers that question perfectly.I recently went through something similar with the passing of my grandma. And indeed, anyone who has ever lost a family member, or anyone close to them for that matter, can relate to this movie in a brutally honest way. From the very beginning, this film captures the realness of life. Doing the same menial tasks just get by. Dealing with people you'd rather never see again. It's a film that anyone can relate to. It's a film that doesn't try and sugarcoat anything. Nor does it try to dramatize anything either. It's a film that shows the lives of people that could very well be real. But it isn't until the passing of a family member, that this film turns into one that feels almost too familiar. The remainder of the movie, and in this case the majority of it, explores the process of grieving. It explores the difficulty of it. And by painting a picture that doesn't even feel like a movie, it manages to do so in a way that is impossible not to relate to. The characters are, of course, crucial in this pursuit, and by making them so spectacularly normal, Manchester by the Sea makes it seem like I'm simply watching the lives of ordinary people. There is a constant sense of realness that I have never experienced in a movie before. It is, without a doubt, one of its main strengths, but oddly enough, it also feels like a weakness. Maybe it's just due to the fact that I have been through a similar process so recently, that this film just felt, almost in a way, too normal. It didn't feel like anything new, nor did it evoke any new feelings. It just felt like life. Real life.
There is no denying that this film is gut-wrenching, but then again, it should be. In fact, having heard how emotionally difficult this film is, I had dreaded watching it. Yet, by the time it finished, I almost felt at peace. For me, it acted as a reminder that it's all part of life. The ups, and the downs. Had I not had a similar experience so recently, perhaps this would've been a much more difficult film to get through. However, as is, I simply found myself flowing through the experiences and the feelings, in a way that felt eerily familiar.Now, Manchester by the Sea is, as mentioned, brutally real and honest in its depiction of life. It moves slowly and deliberately, finding joy in the little things, and struggling with everything else. It's a film that leaves a lingering effect, staying on your mind, affecting you. It doesn't leave you with a great big realization at the end, nor does it give you a sense of joy or sadness. It merely leaves you with your thoughts. Reflecting on your own experiences. And that is where its power and impact truly lies. While it is a difficult film to get through, it also reminds us of the good things in life. It reminds us of how life always moves forward, even at times when it feels like it shouldn't. And it's because of this, that I think that Manchester by the Sea answers the question of why movies like it are needed. It doesn't try to manipulate us in any way, it just presents life as it is.There is something beautifully special about this film. I won't be watching it again any time soon, but I don't think I need to. It's going to be one that will stay with me for a long time. And while it might seem instinctive that it's the feeling of sorrow and pain that lingers on, I find myself clinging to those small bits of joy, that are sprinkled around us. And as I cling on to them, I, oddly enough, find myself at peace with the challenges and struggles that life, evidently, throws at us."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 July 2017,4/10,"I can't actually say that this was a bad movie. It has some merit and is obviously well made but why should anyone want to waste 130 minutes on this kind of stuff.It was boring and pretentious in about equal measure and I really don't feel like I spent my time watching anything really worthwhile. This is a movie which, once visited, doesn't invite a return visit.I found Casey Affleck's character a pain in the a**e as he mumbled his way through yet another boring role; someone should tell him that the Brando impersonation is way beyond its use-by.As for the Patrick character, there's a teenager who was just begging for a good left.I shan't be watching this one again; just glad I only wasted a couple of dollars on a cheap copy rather than paying full whack."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 March 2017,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a great film, which is very, very realistic and truly believable. The acting from every actor that comes onto screen is on point. No other movie in 2016, had acting like this. From Casey to the side characters, everyone is flawless. The story of this movie is very well written, however for the first half and hour I was a bit confused. The movie goes back and forwards between past and present, without telling you, and I found myself confused until I realised what was happening. This does play into the movie later, when the film gives us a very heartbreaking scene. Being a father myself, seeing that scene made my heart stop for second.While the story is fantastic, the movie is very depressing. Many would leave the movie feeling like they had their life stripped from them, which I think that's what the movie was going for, other would hate it for being too dull and dark. However the moments of laughter that are scattered throughout, help keep this movie on its feet. The teenager, played by Lucas Hedges gives a great performance, and is very believable in his role. Hiding his mourning beneath sex, music and just being a teen. It was great seeing him with Casey's character, and they played well off each other. The only problem I have with this movie, is why the hell was Michelle Williams nominated for an Oscar? She was great in this yes, but she only had around, 5 minuets of screen-time, maybe more - I don't know, but it was not Oscar worthy.Manchester by the Sea is a great movie, and one of the best movies of 2016, better than Moonlight anyway.7.8/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2020,9/10,"There are many sad movies in the world, and then there's Manchester by the Sea. I literally walked out of the room when it ended and bought tickets to Lalaland because I needed to see something happy;"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 February 2017,8/10,"What can I say about Manchester by the Sea, for one its not Manchester UK and secondly its a wonderful movie that's brilliantly written, great directing and Casey Affleck in particular acts his part brilliantly.Casey plays Lee who's life has previously been turned upside down by tragedy - so he just mopes through his days, has a mundane job, drinks too much and gets in the odd fight - when his brother drops dead he has to step in, shape up and start looking after his 16 year old nephew.Don't expect a fast moving picture, its very bleak and not a lot happens really but it somehow ends up drawing you in - I don't normally enjoy this type of movie but would give it a 8.5 out of 10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 December 2016,10/10,"It doesn't happen very often. Sometimes you think it's going to happen...and then all of a sudden the rug gets pulled out from under your feet...usually in the last 20 minutes or so. What the heck am I talking about? I'm talking about movies being masterpieces. I'm talking about movies that go down as the greatest ever seen. I'm not talking about them being great. I've seen some great films in my lifetime. In fact, there's usually, at least one great film every year. Every year I make a top five for the year list, and the top of the list is reserved for some pretty great films. For example, two years ago it was Gone Girl at number one. Last year is was The Revenant. And while those are great films, I (personally...my opinion only) don't consider them to be masterpieces. This year there is a masterpiece that will sit at number one on my top five list. And that masterpiece is Manchester By The Sea, starring Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, and written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan. I like the work of all of them. In particular I liked Affleck in Good Will Hunting (in a little bit smaller role than his brother, but very well played) and especially Gone Baby Gone, my favorite movie from '07. Williams was stunning in Blue Valentine and Shutter Island. And Lonergan's You Can Count On Me has always been one of my favorite films from 2000. So, with that much talent, I expected Manchester to be, at the very least, a pretty good movie, with the potential to be great. What I got was much more than that. This is one of the best films I have ever seen from, not just this year, but from any year. It's power is overwhelming. It really is. Manchester is so moving, that I found my self doing something that I have only done one other time in my life while watching a film. I shed a tear. Usually I try and fight back any tears that might try and stream down my face, but with Manchester, I was so involved with the characters and their lives, that trying to fight back any tears was of no use. And I'm not talking about tears that have been melodramatically manipulated out of someone. The tear I shed in Manchester was earned. Very seldom can a writer and director have that much control over their films without the outcome seeming fabricated. Casey Affleck's brother has that kind of control over the movies he's directed. And, it seems that Lonergan does to. This movie is also pretty darn funny at some points. Again, difficult to pull off in such a heavy and heartfelt drama. I love this film. And I know for a fact that no film will come out in the next four weeks or so that's going to top it. Like I said, masterpieces only come once in a great while. The last one I saw before Manchester came out nine years ago. The one before that...about 23 years ago. So enjoy this one. It is, by far, the best movie from 2016. And goes down as one of the best films I have ever seen. As always...want to make this very clear...this is just my opinion."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 January 2017,6/10,"This was a film I had no real desire to see. The trailers for this film didn't look that great and the way everything looked very low budget and the story just never grabbed me. But I did go see this film, and I can say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Manchester by the sea is the story of Lee Chandler who has to take care of his brother's son after he dies. He tries his best to come back from his families tragedies as we see through out the course of the film what had happened to them and why Lee is so depressed. The first thing you will note is that the film has a flashback problem. It doesn't tell you when it goes back in time instead it just does. Which can work sometimes with certain directors, but here I just ended up feeling dazed and confused by the whole thing. Still the film does have this charming wit to it that I noticed a lot in the characters and the way they reacted to things. This film understands the pain people go through and how it isn't always a easy fix and everything takes time to heal. the film also doesn't ever try to be super upbeat even in its lighter moments. It understands the story it is trying to tell. And yet something about the film feels off. The film doesn't ever make me feel a great sense of depression to the point where I am attached to Lee Chandler. I feel bad for him, but I don't really feel what he is going through. And because of that the film can feel like it moves at this real sluggish pace at times. Perhaps it is the direction of the film? The film is written and directed by the same person. A man named Kenneth Lonergan. He has written many films in the past, but has only directed three of them. And while I feel this film has some great lines and some neat cinematography I feel like with the help of a more seasoned director this film could have more feeling put inside it. As it is the film is not bad though I simply feel there is more potential here that I just didn't see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,7/10,"If you have low attention span/have other things to do, this film is not for you. This is for those who enjoy character study/behavior, not focused more on the plot. At first I didn't have interest in this film because the trailers and buzz made it seem like the movie experience was going to be a torturous sappy marathon... however, I think I laughed more than I cried. If you enjoy or get quirky dry humor, this is actually a funny film to watch. It's those genuine awkward reactions that makes this film good and so hilarious. I don't find cheap slapstick humor funny, not easily amused, but this is real comedy. Even the little things, like in the opening of the film, when Casey Affleck, being a plumber, is trying to unclog the bathroom, the lady they chose has the most hilarious expression like she caused the most disgusting result. There's a lot of awkward moments in the film.Casey Affleck won Best Actor for this film. That is probably not surprising because you just end up really loving him in this film. He was perfect for the role. It intercuts back and forth between memories of the past and present; while it sometimes works, it also can get confusing and annoying for a moment, especially the first time they did that. The film is about Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) who finds out his older brother has passed away and must now take care of his nephew. The relationship between Lee and his nephew is cute. Along the way, we find out more about Lee's darker past, that he had it a lot worst. If you recently had someone pass away, this may help deal with it to see someone go through some extreme hardships and odd procedures in life. I was surprisingly engaged with the film, but the ending was just way too abrupt and weak."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 April 2020,8/10,"Remember when the oscars were announced in 2017, lalaland really deserved the best, and I really like this kind of love. But my personal favorite is this movie, after watching the special depression, but more sober. There are always people who say, everything will be ok, everything will pass, you have to be strong, life can be better. But, really not everything can become the past, some people leave, is a lifetime will never heal the wound, without this person some happiness no longer exist. And life has to be good and happy. Is that necessary?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 January 2017,9/10,"Casey Affleck is remarkable as Lee Chandler, full to the brim with bottled-up pain, in this masterful drama, written and directed by playwright Kenneth Lonergan. You don't learn the source of his hostile and erratic behavior until a good way in, although multiple flashbacks to earlier, happier times with his older brother Joe and nephew Patrick show different sides of this character—never easy, perhaps, but not a hand grenade with the pin pulled. The film opens with Lee tending his duties as the maintenance man—and first-line-of-defense against chaos—for four Quincy, Massachusetts, apartment buildings and living in a one-room basement flat in one of them. He has exiled himself from his home town of Manchester by the Sea and the seacoast life there, putting all of metro Boston in between him and his past. (MBTS sounds like the setting for a Victorian novel, but it's located on Cape Ann, about halfway between Gloucester and Beverly, Mass.) One wintry day—the weather in this movie is as frozen and blustery as Lee is—he receives a call that Joe has had another cardiac episode and heads north for Manchester. When he reaches the hospital, Joe has died, and he's been given guardianship of the now teenage Patrick. Forms must be followed, arrangements made, and the funeral survived. All this brings Lee abruptly into contact with his past. Being in Manchester isn't easy—too many memories, too many people who know him, too many who remember. But he needs to look after his high school Lothario nephew Patrick, so he sticks it out. Says Matthew Lickona from the San Diego Reader, ""It's Affleck's movie to quietly own as layer upon layer of Irish impassivity is stripped away from his visage until the unspeakable can be spoken."" There were no cheap or cheesy moments in this layered tale, thanks to Lonergan's superb writing. His people aren't always easy to get along with. Their marriages don't always work. Their kids aren't perfect. Yet, there can be hidden strengths in relationships, and sometimes, some people do their best, even when the going is hard. Top-notch performances all around. Besides Affleck, there are Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife Randi, Kyle Chandler as Joe, Gretchen Mol as Joe's ex, Elise, and C. J. Wilson as the brothers' stalwart friend George. Lucas Hedges is terrific as Patrick."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea has won one of the most deserved Oscars this year, for both the screenplay, but most of all for Casey Affleck's performance as Lee Chandler. In that film he plays a janitor, whose brother has passed away and now he gets to be the guardian of his nephew, but that just doesn't fit entirely in his life.The directing was really good. Kenneth Lonergan was the director. The film is visually very good looking, so was the color grading and framing. He also liked to show a lot of shots of their surroundings to set up the theme of the film, but what Kenneth Lonergan has done in a fantastic manner is to set up the emotional scenes. He brilliantly sets them up, with a slow building score in the background leading up to the ""finally"" of that scene. He really was able to create powerful scenes that'll pull the right emotional strings. The soundtrack overall is very good. It isn't anything mind-blowing, but it does what the movie asks it to do: help to emote the viewer. The editing did contain some flaws, like actors moving very little, but notable between cuts, etc. and the pacing as well could be a bit slow, but I didn't really mind, because the rest of the film was there to keep me entertained, and asking for more.The acting is the main reason why you should go see this film. The main actor, Casey Affleck really was brilliant. His acting was superb, because of the held-back emotion you could see in him, or hardly see in him. He isn't the person, who yells when he's angry or sad, but just keeps it to him. He lets the pain build up inside of him. You could hardly see it, but if you pay close enough attention, you were able to see how he felt. How miserable he was. How damaged he was. His subtle movements, gestures, facial expressions all helped with this. He was very subdued and subtle in his performance that I was blown away by him. It was definitely something you should see on the big screen in a theater. Not only Casey Affleck was great, so was Michelle Williams, who played Casey Affleck's ex-wife. She wasn't a lot in the film, but when she was there, she broke my heart. Her acting too was superb and really convincing. I wasn't seeing Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck on the screen, but I saw Randi and Lee Chandler. Lucas Hedges I found to be lesser good. I wouldn't call him bad, but he definitely fell in the shadow of the Affleck and Williams. I don't think that he really earned his Oscar-nomination. Kyle Chandler was fantastic and should've been the one who's nominated for the Oscar for best actor in a supporting role. But the rest of the supporting cast was great as well, whereby it didn't feel like I was watching a movie but that I was watching real people. The screenplay too was absolutely fantastic. I'm not sure if this one deserved the Oscar or ""Hell or High Water"", but either way I am happy with the outcome. The story takes a while to start and seems pretty simple and boring if I would explain it, but how Kenneth Lonergan does it, is magnificent. The story telling in this film is really good. The screenplay wonderfully interwove flashbacks into the story; we got to know Lee and his damaged past piece by piece, whereby you slowly start to unconsciously care more and more about him. Which is something you in the beginning of the film wouldn't expect, because at first he just seems to be a curt man, without any chemistry or likability, but as the movie progresses, you realize that there's more to him. With each flashback scene they add onto the character, building up to one particular flashback. One flashback that to me was the best scene out of the film, and even gave me chills right at the end of it. So if you didn't notice from that part: the characters were amazing as well. They all had their own depth to them and were interesting to see. They felt like real people, because everything that happened to them could've happened to anyone. The dialogue also helped with creating the realistic atmosphere the movie is going for and it absolutely nails that as well. In the end ""Manchester by the Sea"" was one of the best films of last year. Just Casey Affleck's performance is a good reason for seeing this film. He gave his all for this role and so did Michelle Williams. But only go see the film if you know you can handle emotional-heavy films, because this one contains some heavy scenes. That's why I'm giving this one a 9.6/10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 March 2017,10/10,"In the book ""The Stranger"" by Albert Camus, Meursault feels totally estranged and detached from reality when he attends his mothers funeral. With his mechanic behavior, monotone voice and absence of emotional response Lee Chandler is a kindred spirit.He doesn't get involved neither does he avoid. He is just there with no aim but not suicidal enough to take the full consequence of this state of mind. And yet you sense something. A reminiscence of character and you want to learn, find out what this points back to. And after the prologue, with Lee shoveling snow (yes like Sisyfos) and pluming without taking any pride in doing so the real story begins when his brother dies and he travels from his cellar flat in Boston to Manchester by the sea.Via several flashbacks you enter an existential detective story that brings you closer to a heartbreaking point that will make the worst horror movie seem like a fairytale story.I will rest my case now. See it. Cry with it and if you are having a panic attack it is just a sign that shows you that your ability to have an empathic response is intact.Regards SimonPs.

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 May 2017,9/10,"I guess that I relate a bit too much to the protagonist for my own good, so I especially enjoyed it. I know that we're in an era in which the highest grossing films are comic book films, whatever Harry Potter refuse is next and animated feel-good cartoon garbage, so it's definitely not designed for most people.But if you like dark, (mostly) realistic dramas you will love it.The moment in which Randi (Michelle Williams) confronts Lee (Casey Affleck) is one of the most powerful and haunting scenes in cinematic history. It was beautifully acted, and its dialogue is topnotch. Usually screenwriters are cautioned against such straightforward wording. But in this case it works extremely well.Kyle Chandler also delivers his usual stellar performance-- this time in a supporting role.If I had a minor problem with this film, it was that the teenage kid who Lee is raising (his nephew) is far too precocious to be an actual person. He is 17 going on 30. It was difficult to ever believe him. When I was that age, even the guys who were the most fortunate with the girls never behaved in that manner.It's a minor complaint about a gem of a movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,9/10,"This film is a good demonstration to show how life sucks. Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler, a dour, socially unpleasant man, haunted by the events of his past. The death of his brother means he has to become the legal guardian of his nephew and a unique bond forms between them.As this film began, for the first 30 minutes, the first thought is, ""Why are we supposed to be rooting for Casey Affleck; this unlikable, short-fused thug?"" Then it hit me. Or rather, the movie did. Affleck's character is relatable because of his tortured past, and he captures it beautifully.Lucas Hedges portrays Patrick, the 16 year old nephew, who frequently engages in conversations of cynical and sarcastic dialogue with his uncle, which is fun to watch.The Boston setting is beautifully shot and the overall tone of the movie is a sense of poignancy and sullenness throughout."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 January 2019,10/10,"Beautifully written, directed and acted film.
The very funny bittersweet dialogues are brilliant. This is really a great lovely movie and definitely deserves all the awards."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 November 2018,3/10,"One can find strong points in the film such as Casey Affleck's acting and the theme or plot of the film. In the end someone, the film maker I assume , has to #1 bring all the various parts of the film ( story, locations, cinematography,acting and script)in to a narrative that carries you along and keeps your interest. So in this film it would be drama and suspense, maybe empathy, in others it might be horror or comedy. And #2 he or she has to do what is required to do that and nothing more. This film takes at least an hour and a half to get to the relevant dramatic parts that are any good at all. By that time you are so weary from waiting for something to happen you are bound to have become impatient with the film.
I wish I had read some reviews here before I watched it and wasted , mind you, more than two hours. There many more films and series out there worthy of your time than this one, I don't think it is a matter of taste. The movie Phantom Thread is in the same category as this one but not quite as long or dragged out and that one had great locations and sumptuous cinematography and art direction. I affirm what mrsterrifrances said in his review; I do not understand the high rating of this film. It got Academy Awards for acting and script, perhaps deserved, but the film overall is not even close to being a great film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 January 2019,7/10,"From what I remember of this movie, it had a protagonist hated by the whole town for letting his children be killed by a fire he started (accidentally due to his carelessness), which makes him totally unsympathetic and a terrible person. Even so the movie is very well-acted.There's much more to justify a rating of 7 out of 10 for this ""tragedy film,"" as Wikipedia calls it. Casey Affleck plays a strong role was Lee Chandler but so does Michelle Williams as Randi, along with the rest of the cast. There is a lot about themes of grief and reticence to say the least, as Lee lives with trauma for years to come. The fact that the events of the film take place in a New England community which is blue-collar is an important part of the story itself, unlike other films. The fact that Affleck himself was a sexual harasser in real life, leading to legal battles for years, actually fits, in some way, with his character in this movie, although not completely, to say the least!In the end, I think I have provided a good review, for the time being, of this film, and will let what others say about this film stand."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 August 2020,10/10,"Powerful movie beyond explanation. I have seen it a few times and would watch more if it wasn't so hard to watch. However others may feel, this is one of the closest and most accurate movies about one who went through and will always live with the feeling of being broken beyond repair. I sadly have been and may always be one in this state. And tho others may feel its bad to watch a film like this for one who suffers from depression and feeling of defeat, it actually in some way shape or form, helps to see that even tho it is a movie, I myself and others are not alone. We stay together in hope that by the grace of God we will mend the brokenness of our hearts. But sometimes its beyond repair , beyond recondition, beyond beating. Yet for the fighters, we keep going.We as people , need to see the love others give to us even in a evil world at times. We will never know why we are tested and why tragic events happen to us. Especially tragic events like shown in this film and why someone would even want to keep living. But that is maybe the sad penance. And our loved ones need us.Godbless Us all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 December 2016,4/10,"Mediocrity by the Sea""Manchester by the Sea"" will win Oscars: it pulls at the hearts strings, children die, and the main character, Lee Chandler played by Casey Affleck, appears to have a mental disorder beyond his grief. The film contains too much exposition; things don't happen on screen, they are talked about, and the dialogue isn't good enough to hold one's interest. In one scene, Lee Chandler's ex-wife (played by the serviceable Michelle Williams) says to him, ""I said such terrible things to you."" So, why not show a flashback with her insulting him? Show what transpired. Don't have the character say it, show it. I suspect they couldn't come up with something shocking enough for her to say so they didn't bother. Another example is when there is a horrible accident, a life- changing tragic event. Why not show how that happened, again, in flashback? Was it too expensive to have Mr. Affleck on the screen for an extra minute?Lee Chandler is clearly an alcoholic, but no one addresses it. The ex-wife still has a thing for him, and I can't see why. He's not great looking, he's not funny, he's not wealthy, and he's an alcoholic. Perhaps the writer didn't see Lee's constant need for beer or his journey to get beer that lead to the film's major turning point, as signs of Chandler's alcoholism. How about his bar fights? What makes us care about him? I don't. His situation is pushed on us, demanding we feel sympathy for him. It's forced and not authentic. He's not even entertaining when he mopes. Some back- story about his life in Manchester might have helped us empathize with him. As it is, he's a jerk who drinks, fights and mopes. There were problems with the flashbacks and editing. There is no clean transition made between today and the past, and Lee looks just the same in both the present and past, leaving us to guess when events were occurring. At first, it took a while to realize the film was in a flashback. The second flashback was less confusing but still not obvious. It should be obvious when a flashback occurs, not a puzzle. Maybe I'm jaded or maybe his tragedy is not that unique. And, just in case you don't feel the tragedy, the overblown music throws the mood at you when silence would have been a better choice. The cinematography of the wide open spaces over the sea is spectacular, but the camera work during the rest of the film is pedestrian. Casey Affleck acts like a lost puppy throughout the film, as if his older brother had just admonished him for something and he couldn't get over the scolding. Affleck expertly moves between moping and anger, showing little emotional between those two extremes. But heck, the Academy likes mopers, so that should score him some Oscar points. And he's a white moper, more points. And he's slightly mental. More points. Patrick, his brother's orphaned son, is played adeptly by Lucas Hedges. Mr. Hedges does the best with the material, but it's not enough. Everyone but Patrick is dull. The story is slow, but I don't mind watching a slowly developing story. ""Moonlight"" is a good example of how a film can develop deliberately with success. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is like watching paint dry. The film has too many transition scenes of Lee driving around. How about this: car leaves drive way, cut to, car arriving at the destination. Sure, the film did some of that, but there were too many dead spots of Lee thinking, hedging and milling about. It's true to life, but so is paint drying, and I don't want to watch that either. Rating: Rent ItMany people love this movie, but I have to be brutally honest. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is dull, stilted and not compelling. The plot and tragedy in the film are forced and phony. The film stays on the surface of the characters and never dives deeply enough into Lee Chandler's life and personality for us to care. The only thing you will miss by seeing it on the small screen are a few visually appealing establishing shots of the sea. Peace, Tex Shelters"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 May 2017,10/10,"I am not a fan of drama.. I like to be entertained during films. I use movies to escape and since I am an actress myself - I just don't usually watch anything for the acting..or the art factor. Sometimes though I accidentally do, and this was one of those times ... in the first part of the movie I wasn't impressed .. seen it before. I am also not a fan of the Affleks and just on a side note - I watched this on Amazon Prime and it has like footnotes about the movie you can click on and one of them said ""Casey Affleck could relate to the toughness of his character because he grew up in Cambridge Boston himself."" I laughed out loud .. yeah. Cambridge is like one of the wealthiest towns here and it is full of - not townies. People from all over the world, just not Boston.. I mean it is tough like Beverly Hills is tough . And I think that is such a joke. These guys cashing in on some tough guy thing about Boston and if anyone knew how much money you have to have to live where they lived they would choke on their popcorn .. OK. So now that is out of the way. It was a good movie .. beautiful film. And I guess all the money for those great acting lessons paid off- he probably had an acting coach on set Im sure... haha. Stand out performance by Michelle Williams who had some plastic surgery , couldn't even recognize her. The film excels in what you don't see, what you don't hear, and what doesn't happen, if you know what I mean ..\ it's really a great lesson in finding out that we waste so much time and energy and hate and anger and sadness - when we are needed in the present and people need us to love them, and really that is when we heal. When we love , we heal. And there is never a good enough reason to hold back our love. That is what is amazing about this film. That message."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2017,6/10,"This movie is definitely not as good as the media might have led you to believe. The actors are OK. Almost everything is OK. But that's just it. It's just OK. Nothing special. Nothing extraordinary. I'm pretty sure the scenes where there's dramatic classical music running could've been acted out in a better way. Casey Affleck is not a good actor. Never was, and I'm pretty sure he never will be. He obviously was pulled into the business by his big brother, who's a slightly better actor, but also not what I'd consider a good actor. Also, I imagine this is a movie Irish-Americans would enjoy. It has funny, almost authentic moments. That's a part that I enjoyed, but ultimately this movie leaves you with an empty feeling. One that can only be filled with a better movie on the same subject. Loss, grief and maybe redemption. I'm sure there are better ones out there. 6.3/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2017,9/10,"This is a hard story to tell, and I can imagine a very hard story to act in. An underlying story line makes it hard for Lee Chandler to return to Manchester despite the untimely death of his brother. He is leading a hard life in Boston - as a handyman and loner. He has his reasons. Going through the motions of the things that are done when someone dies - the hospital, the lawyer, the funeral home, the post funeral visitors and now Lee is the guardian for his nephew. The impact of this on Lee and the young man plays out well. Even though there is little communication between them, they communicate. Casey Affleck was such a good choice to play Lee - his performance is so well done. Lucas Hedges, as the nephew, is so well performed. Michelle Williams as the ex-wife - briefly seen in this film, has a scene that must have been so hard to do - I have not seen this in films - well done. This is a film about grief - past and present - and how to move on in spite of the loss. Not a happy film but a real film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 March 2017,1/10,"Manchester by the Sea is not as bad as Manos.This had music. Yet the script is horrendous. Don't they get it? Bad dialogue leads to bad acting, leads to a plot less, pointless rambling and a waste of over 2 hours.The overuse of the ""F"" word alone makes this completely unwatchable, and added nothing to the movie.I suffered through an hour of this drivel. An hour which I will never get back.Wayno"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,8/10,"Rightfully so, I am going to start this off with 'Manchester by the Sea' was one depressing as hell film. Fantastically delivered and performed but my lord, such a sad and tragic story. That is truly what fuels this film though, the performances of such tragically defeated characters just barely making it by but still continue to move forward with life, continuously taking punches, barring setback after setback, and still.moving.forward. Another thing I truly loved about this film was how honest and real it felt. There was nothing Hollywood about this film. It felt like real people with a tragic and believable pasts, experiencing life in an unfortunate series of events. Overall, this may be the most honest film among the Best Picture contenders, in my opinion... To reflect back, I wanted to bring focus to one scene in particular. There is a five minute exchange between Affleck's character and Williams' character, and to me, this scene was the absolute icing on the cake when it came to the grief and despair that both characters carry throughout the entirety of the film. This scene made the movie for me. I had chills running through my body and I felt what they were feeling. A truly moving and memorable moment that solidified how excellent of a performance these two had in 'Manchester by the Sea'.So, there you have it. Boiled down, 'Manchester by the Sea' is a powerfully performed, honest, and true film. Nothing happy about it, no giddy and joyous feelings and if there are, it is only for a moment or two. Some humor is thrown in but it is as dry as the characters that are delivering them, which matches the personalities perfectly. A major recommendation from Oberrated but be cautious, you may need to give Pharrell's ""Happy"" a few plays after viewing this one.-- Oberrated.com --"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 April 2020,9/10,"Carry on with the original sin that never let go, and start a little reconciliation with life. Don't forgive yourself for your sins, and try to take responsibility for them."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 April 2017,7/10,"I would love to rate this movie higher but it just never got off the ground for me. I understood the moods and the conditions as well as anyone can. Yes, it has a lot of feelings rather than dialogue but you get used to it after a while and come to appreciate it, at certain times. But after a while you really want someone to show up and ACT, not just move through the movie like a breathing ""extra"". We are intellectual Beings and I find it hard to believe that there are those out there that do not communicate but just live. He experienced a superbly, extreme incident that few could ever recover from, yet he has a job and without thinking, shows humor. Things like this continue to happen to him throughout the movie, with flashback's that will cut your heart out and yet even knowing everything else, I still wanted just that little bit more. Michelle William's has played this same role, movie after movie. It's time for her to grow a little and move on. I find very few Actor's that are as equal to or above Casey Affleck. I thank him for his character, it would have never been made, if not for him."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 March 2020,8/10,"A depressed uncle is asked to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies.
On ordinary movie, ho would do that without ambivalence. Normally they have strong bond each other. But on real life, you would be perplexed because you don't wanna get involved any troubles. Even if that was your teenager nephew, you would be perplexed. That's how you feel truly on real life, I guess. That's the part where I like on this movie though."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 August 2020,8/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" could have been a real downer, depressing to sit through and troubling to think about afterward. But the fine acting and directing keeps your attention, even though the story has few upbeat moments. It examines the nature of grief, which differs with each individual, both in its impact and the manner of dealing with it. In this film, Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck in a much-deserved Oscar-winning performance) experiences two tragic moments of overwhelming loss. The first is a doubleblow of grief and guilt, as his carelessness is responsible for a house fire that kills his two young daughters, causing his marriage to dissolve and his becoming an uncommunicative loner, leaving town and getting a job as a building janitor, in effect enclosing himself in a physical shell as well as an emotional shutdown. In the second incident, his brother Joe dies suddenly at a relatively young age, leaving his teenage son, Patrick, in Lee's care (without Joe ever having consulted Lee about this arrangement). Lee is forced to move back to the town from which he had fled, where he and Patrick deal with their grief while adjusting to their awkward guardianship relation. At the film's end it is apparent that Lee, however slowly, is emerging from his emotional shell. (Much of the film's narrative is shown in flashbacks, although sometimes it takes a moment to realize we're watching a prequel because everyone appears to be the same age in the present and during the flashbacks."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,3/10,"I bought the Oscar hype. Don't do it. It's not worth your time. I don't get all the hype behind this movie. It was just... completely... slow... and... boring... and... depressing... and... slow... The acting was decent. But the parts and writing was not not Oscar-good. The writing and directing was just awful. There was no real story. No likable characters. It could've been at least 30 minutes shorter and it still would have been slow. This completely reminded me of Boyhood -- All hype, very long, with nothing to see and totally forgettable. Every day life is boring. That's why you go to the movies -- To see something different. This was like a reality show of your jerk of a neighbor after his family dies. It's depressing, boring and bland. Normal people doing normal things is not interesting.Afleck and the kid have acting chops, but the parts were just not anything to get behind. There was hardly anything to really like about either of them. The parts certainly didn't warrant Oscar attention. Michelle Williams is barely in the movie. I don't even know how she qualified for Oscar contention. She appears 3 times for just a few minutes each.It's one of those films I had to see to understand the attention, but will forget all about it in just a few days. I wish I had skipped this and watched one of the other nominees instead."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 May 2020,10/10,2 hours of scenic shots and heart breaking revelations make this a tough watch but a beautiful experience. Manchester by the Sea proves that you can't fix the past and you can't be someone you're not but you can get better and move forward in the face of tragedy.It's a slow burn but it's a kick in the gut that might not fully kick in until after the film is over.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 May 2017,6/10,"Great scenery, I love the winter in New England. This is a refreshing film, because it is somewhat like real life. Slow moving, lots of off- beat scenes that don't contribute much to the overall plot. Much like real life, many different things happen that don't amount to much, and then there are a couple of events that change everything.Spoiler alert. This is a movie about family relationships, depression, alcohol and death, not the sexiest combination of themes. In that respect, it reminds me of foreign films, meant to be thought provoking rather than entertaining. While the acting made it interesting, it left me with quite a melancholy feeling.There are many different ways alcohol can destroy lives."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 August 2021,1/10,...I'm not willing to overlook Casey Affleck's continuing inappropriate behavior.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2016,9/10,"A man and a boy, one an uncle, one a nephew, are engaged in an intimate fishing lesson off the lake on Manchester, Connecticut. This melodic view takes us from here through the uncle's cold spiritual journey of knowing his place amidst the chaos of death.Manchester by the Sea is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (Gangs of New York), whose hard work shows in how deep he is willing to dive into the darkest corners of everyone we meet throughout his record of memories. The lonely, depressed, recently divorced plumber we are invited to connect with has a lot coming at him; having lost his brother to cardiac arrest, and now left to be the only one left to take in custody of his now fatherless nephew.From watching the heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the uncertainty of the plumber's path, to the humbling, somber performance by Casey Affleck (no tears necessary), all audiences suited for the well- earned R-rating will be greatly moved by its rough depiction of an everyday story within an everyday life.What makes the chilling power of this deceptively simple story so powerful is the consistently cold feel that Lonergan maintains from start to finish. Being set in the northeast, snow appears all over to reflect the plumber's state of mind, and the cold is felt all the greater depending on the amount of stress tugging between him and his blood relatives. The screen's empty starkness takes its time to linger on the quietest of moments, screaming the loudest of internal noises without saying a word.Manchester by the Sea could have easily taken place anywhere in the world, not necessarily in one particular small town in one particular part of the nation. What makes the Boston-Manchester setting work to its advantage is its subtle handling of the culture, right down to the look, feel, and taste of the area. The much-needed emphasis on father and son bonding through the quietness of fishing bookends the film with the one single image that defines everything valued by the people who live there. Also similar to last year's big Oscar-winner Spotlight, there is a clear presence of Catholicism guiding the lives of all Bostonians, whether or not they consider themselves religious. They claim that all Catholics are Christian, which is not entirely true, nor is it said so in the feature, but it works to the advantage of making the sense of hope they seek after touch much closer to home.There are plenty of independent features out there that tackle the discomforting subject of family death and custody, but none of them handle it with the same level of detail, humanity, and personal application as Manchester by the Sea. It's not the feel-good holiday treat you may be looking for at this time of the year, but considering how family and tragedy essentially go hand-in-hand, Lonergan's scholarly study on the personal crisis will help countless others in what to do about a similar trauma.Hence, I encourage all to see this masterful, humbling work when they get the chance to, but not just with anyone, with the relatives they are the closest to. That way, you can walk out of the theater together sharing the tears of your worst and best memories. If more movies had the power to do that, then Hollywood would at last be restored to its former glory."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,10/10,"This is masterful stuff, and there wasn't a single minute in the 2 hours and 17 minutes running time when I so much as glanced at my smartphone, let alone picked it up and scrolled – as is my want.Casey Affleck plays Lee, the younger brother of Joe, who lives with his son, Patrick, (Lee's nephew) in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a small picturesque coastal town in Massachusetts. Lee lives in a single room, 45 minutes' drive away, where he works as an apartment handyman. We soon realize that Lee is not exactly your run of the mill handyman. While he knows his job pretty well, he is surly, rude and prickly to the tenants, prompting one woman to complain about him. Later, he is rude to another woman who tries to befriend him in a bar and after that, in the same bar, he becomes violent with two men who he thinks are talking about him.So we get the message – our friend Lee is a troubled man.Then Lee gets a call from home – his brother's doctor is calling from Manchester – Joe is in hospital and it's very serious.Joe has died by the time Lee arrives, and after viewing the body, Lee drives to the local school to break the news of his brother's death to Joe's somewhat obnoxious teenage son. The two of them drive home. It is all very low key, with little - if any - emotion displayed on either side. Patrick also behaves as if nothing has happened. He just wants to continue his rebellious teen-life with his two girlfriends and practice playing in a heavy metal band. His uncle remains taciturn and non-communicative.By now, we are bursting to understand exactly what ""gives"" with this family.Joe's will is read. He has left his property to his son but has appointed Lee as Patrick's guardian, with the house and property to be held in trust by Lee until Patrick is of age.Lee is furious and tells the lawyer he cannot take on the role. Patrick is also none too impressed by this turn of events and the two of them quickly develop a love /hate - more hate than love – relationship, as they both are obliged to come to terms with the reality of the situation. Through a series of flashbacks, we start to put this puzzling jigsaw together. The heart of this drama is a terrible tragedy. After a drunken party at home with friends, Lee forgot to put a fireguard on the fireplace when he went out to buy some beer in the middle of the night. He returned home to find his house engulfed in flames. His wife, Randi, who was sleeping downstairs, was saved, but his three children, who were upstairs, all perished.Lee went to the police station to explain what happened and he grabbed a gun and tried to kill himself, but the cops, aided by Joe brother and his father prevented another tragedy.We now completely understand why Lee is so troubled. Everyone blames him for his children's deaths – including his wife who leaves him - but nobody blames Lee more than Lee himself. There is much more that happens in this bittersweet melodrama. Poor dead Joe has to be kept in a freezer until spring as the ground is too frozen to dig a grave. Lee and Patrick have a very hard time of it with each other, with Patrick rebelling at every turn and Lee desperately trying to do the right thing, but he is woefully ill equipped for such a difficult task.A woman sets her cap at Lee until she finds she has more chance of charming a sheep than getting a rise out of the embittered protagonist. And it keeps on coming There's the boat... ...and Lee's chance street encounter with his ex-wife, Randi, who has now remarried with a new baby. This becomes one of the most heart- rending moments into the whole film, as Randi tells him she deeply regrets leaving him and it is clear that she still loves him. Lee goes to a bar to drown his sorrows. He soon picks a fight and the entire occupants of the bar gang up on him and he is very badly beaten. Rescued by a family friend, he is taken to their home, when he finally breaks down and cries.The tale continues, and eventually reaches a satisfactory conclusion - of sortsIf I was unkind, I could describe ""Manchester"" as a very high-class soap, But this film is so much more than a soap. It is a raw, totally believable drama that cuts right through a slice of life in small town America, pop. 5136. If you enjoy watching family dramas, I promise you that you will never get bored with this film with its strange, poignant narrative and superlative acting throughout. Would the film have been as good without the incredible performance by Casey Affleck in the lead role? I'm not really sure, but there is no doubt that he fits the part like a glove. Those who say he acted the part badly haven't the foggiest notion of what they are talking about. Yes, he is that good! Not for him, the shouting and histrionics – Affleck is so effective with his understated and brilliant portrayal of a man who has basically lost the will to live. Whenever he is on screen, your eyes are riveted to that tortured soul.This movie is ""note perfect"" - writing, acting, directing - and I am more than happy to award it ten stars."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 May 2019,5/10,"There is some attractive scenery in this film, and some nice music. These are things to be grateful for as otherwise I took a long time to get into this movie, there is so much ugly and negative human behaviour in the majority of scenes. However, the screenplay does achieve a modicum of success in developing a degree of sympathy for the main character in terms of his tragic past. There is also effective mileage to be had out of the scenario, with an unexpected death throwing the lives of those affected into the melting pot. So I persisted with the movie although with continuing discomfort at the level of foul language and the unreasonable and disrespectful way the characters talk to each other. They alternate between violence and sullenness, argue over everything, contradict each other, talk over the top of each other and basically need an empathy transplant. And all the time I had the cringing consciousness that a big dose of sentimentality was probably in the offing. In the latter respect I experienced huge relief when the film ended in quite a mild mannered and realistic way. The outcomes seemed to be that characters affected by the past appeared to achieve some rapprochement, and characters thrown together in the present started to communicate in a more reasonable manner. So the writer/director is not without talent, I just wonder why his vision of people's behaviour is so unattractive. Does he think this is what the public enjoy watching? (and is he right??) The actors in this film are blameless however I never want to see any of them ever again, I disliked their characters so much."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 February 2017,8/10,"A fantastic story told in a fantastic way. Everything has a reason to be and a reason to why it happened or is happening. This movie portrays a story, that although might not even happen to us exactly as depicted, it may make us feel near the characters to whom this happens. Reality.The story is told in a nice way, that it doesn't feel heavy or boring for an instant, and the movie is 2 hours long. You just want to keep watching not only what is going to happen but what happened and most important, why happened. Why are the characters now like that when we see in the flashbacks that they were something completely different. Yes, there are flashbacks but not in a Fast & Furious way but in a way that if you blink you might miss them.Of course a movie wouldn't be good if the actors on it weren't at their finest work portraying their characters. That is the case of the young Affleck brother. He is absolutely terrific playing the main character of this movie: an uncle that needs to take care of his nephew when something happens to his brother. He is the star of the movie but also the supporting actors are an important piece in this movie. Just see by yourself how many times have they been nominated to certain awards.It's a hard movie, in the sense that what it is depicted on it may not be enjoyed by many as we normally want to watch happy stories. Well, this is not a sad story but a realistic story that feels nearer than expected and which might happen to anyone of us."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 March 2019,7/10,"A beautiful and heartbreaking screenplay, shot in a nice location. It's full of real emotion and heartache as well as lots of witty dialogue to defuse the tension in scenes.My problem is the fact that watching Casey Affleck stumble through his depressed motions, however heartbreaking his acting, gets frustrating after a while. This is especially true as usually one single sentence would make his life, and more importantly the lives of people around him, better. Although it's understandable that the lead is heartbroken and therefore prone to self destructive behaviour, by the end of the movie you don't feel any of the characters grew. Nothing really changed, Lee will visit Patrick as much as he ever did.Another problem is the marketing. Now while Michelle Williams' 5 minutes on screen are very well acted (not deserving of an oscar nod though, especially in such a strong year), they are just that; 5 minutes. And she's in no way central to our story, and marketing this as some sort of love story is really underselling the family dynamic of the actual main characters.And finally, this writing of depressed introverts as central characters in real world dramas simply to be used as oscar vehicles for stars, is becoming so prevalent that it seems almost cynical. There is something lazy about writing a character that doesn't ever say what he feels, rather leaving all of the weight on the actor."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 April 2020,8/10,It is easy to perceive sadness and precipitate sadness. But how to face grief and even stand up to face the future is more difficult than grief itself. The movie tries to tell people that the deep sorrow will not dissipate quickly and easily. What we can do is try not to close your eyes and see the scars once on sunny days.

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2017,6/10,"I'd heard so much about this film, that it was depressing but good and featured fine performances. I agree that it was depressing and the acting was of high quality but I don't think the film was particularly good. The lead character is too emotionally closed-off from everyone. He's almost catatonic in that he reacts the same to just about every stimuli, which makes it difficult to really get to know or care about him. Similarly, the son's reactions don't seem very believable. He's a lothario juggling two girlfriends and is more concerned with getting in the pants of the girls than honoring his father's memory. There's a scene where the son, his girlfriend and two pals are sitting around, ostensibly to help the boy cope. But, they start talking nonsense about Star Trek and the entire conversation feels pretentious and forced. In reality, that type of situation would feature more silence and awkward moments, not the bravado on display. There's also a strange, somewhat creepy scene involving the boy's estranged mother, a recovering alcoholic, and the new man in her life, described as ""very Christian."" Their home is eerily spartan, with just a picture of Christ above the fireplace, and the dinner table discussion feels more like a mind-probe by some vaguely sinister agent. It's almost as if that was a not-so-subtle way of making the boy's lascivious behavior seem more normal.Some good acting by Casey Affleck but, ultimately, this is fairly mundane fare."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 August 2021,8/10,"This movie is a slow burn, until that scene towards the latter part of the movie with just Williams and Affleck, tears just gush out of my eyes... I think that one scene summarizes the whole movie, it is a mix of strong emotions: guilt, sorrow, regret, anger, hate and most importantly, love, and the movie keeps everything real and more precisely, all bottled up until that scene and everything just exploded. Williams did a really good job, that is an emotionally sophisticated scene to shoot and she has to carry it and she did with flying colors."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 May 2017,5/10,"I just need to stop watching movies that get high marks from the critics. Most of the time it leads to disappointment and this was another case of just that. The story had potential, but it just went nowhere. While the lead acting was not bad, neither was it Oscar worthy. It was very one dimensional IMO. After over two hours of waiting for the kid to make a change in his uncle's life, the movie pretty much just ends. Boring."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 September 2021,7/10,Casey Affleck is a much better actor then Ben. Really sad movie though.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 May 2017,10/10,"My husband and I just finished watching this movie. We both thought it was wonderful, although of course tragically sad. It was so realistic, so well acted, written and edited that not only is it the best movie we have seen in the past year, it would have to be one of the best ever.We loved the choice of some classical music, the setting of Manchester (?) is beautiful and lends an element of stability, charm, class, to content of seediness, language, and very flawed characters.I have a relative (young) who wants to direct/write movies. I would consider a movie like this written/directed by him a remarkable achievement"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,3/10,"This is the least uplifting movie of the year. It may even make the all-time top 10 of movies guaranteed to make you contemplate jumping from a bridge. Moody, depressed people have bad things happen to them which make them even moodier and more depressed. it is a very thick slice of life film that has grown moldy.I'm not sure why Affleck is praised for his acting skills in this movie. He played much the same role in the film, Out of the Furnace, only that film was interesting. He seems to be type-cast as a perpetually, psychologically disturbed individual. In truth, I found none of the acting compelling. I was simply annoyed by the teenage Patrick played by Lucas Hedges. I really hoped Affleck would get as annoyed as I was at him and drive his depressing car into a psychologically disturbed tree. But, alas, we had to wait over 2 hours to watch everyone have bouts of depression and a variety of psychological breakdowns.So, if you watch this film, make sure to carefully lock away all handguns and stay off of bridges for a couple of hours. On the other hand, if you are teaching a class on elementary psychology, this is the film for you. Academy Award material? I don't think so, but that probably means it will get several. Such is the credibility of the Academy committee these days."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,6/10,"...Manchester by the Sea is tedious. It views like an audio book, inspired but not cinematic. Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges (promising in a breakout role) are excellent, both award-worthy. Kyle Chandler and Michelle Williams are box office bait, performing well in minor roles which benefited from their talents but could just as well have been done by less well-known actors. MBTS is not a project designed to move briskly. It is contemplative. The novel on which it is based (and I haven't read it) is undoubtedly of the same intent. So don't expect anything else. That's not necessarily bad, but it doesn't make for an engaging film, at least not for a mass audience. Kenneth Lonergan both wrote and directed, not usually conducive to a range of approaches to a project. Film-making is a community effort. Vesting both writing and directing in one person narrows the viewpoint, and that is evident here. Slowly rolling out may work on the printed page, but on the screen, it often results in... tedium."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 April 2020,10/10,"Interpersonal communication is always the most difficult, so we have been talking, arguing, apologizing and chattering for hundreds of millions of years. The best life-streaming movie, it is rare that the narrative technique is also changed. The uncle and nephew each faced their own loss, and their affection was calm and casual. There is no deliberate pursuit of positive energy, but Manchester 's cold sea is just filled with trivial and small humor. --Like the snow all over the world, it will eventually bring the spring wake up all over the world. There is no doubt my best of the year."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 August 2020,6/10,The Writing and acting is excellent and the story powerful but I did not particularly find the two main characters very likable though they are sympathetic because of circumstances. I'm not a huge Casey Affleck fan. For me a little of him goes a long way. But it's certainly a powerful story about dealing with tragedy and loss that rings true in many ways in spite of his flaws.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 January 2017,,"An emotionally hard hitting and raw film that focuses on Lee Chandler, a man whose life has gone down the drain and is now leading one of personal emotional mayhem. There may be those out there who find that this film drags in certain parts, however the cleverly executed non-linear plot and near-flawless performances of conflict, hate and sly humour from the likes of Casey Affleck (who is now my favourite for the Oscar) makes 'Manchester by the Sea' one of the most gritty and emotionally-reverent dramas of recent years.With a plot that dashes backwards and forwards, Lonergan has crafted an intense and almost shocking plot that gradually builds Affleck's character through the clever use of flashbacks and disguised thrills. Affleck has slowly been proving himself as an acting body to be commended, and this film has finally given us his most complex performance to date, that of a man on a path of self-inflicted emotional trauma. A film that hits hard and leaves a lasting impression."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,5/10,"This movie is up for Best Picture in 2017, but why? I just rented this from Redbox and stopped this ""odd"" picture 30 minutes in. It may just be me, I normally hate ""indie pics"" like this, but this one was given such high acclaim I thought I may be wrong. I was not wrong. If you also have a ""gut feeling"" that you don't like these kind of movies...listen to your gut! This movie has no sense of continuity, the dialogue is slow and oddly paced, and the plot is not ""obvious""(at least not to me), you keep asking yourself ""what is going on?"". For people as old as me...here's the test to see if you'll like this film -- if you didn't fall asleep watching Dances with Wolves, you might like this movie...if you did, avoid this like the plague. My rating of 5 is generous...if I didn't hit the stop button, I would have fallen asleep again."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2021,9/10,"After his brother's death, Lee Chandler is named guardian to his 16-year-old nephew, Patrick. This forces him to return to his hometown and confront his past.Manchester by the Sea is one of the strongest/genuine if not the strongest/genuine drama films I have ever seen. A deep/sad story that the cast & crew made it 10x better and unique whether it's the directing, cinematography, or the acting. The film is absolutely great.The script is very well written and unique especially when telling the backstory, it'll take you a while to release that this specific scene is a flashback which was a bad thing at the beginning of the film because it was casing a little bit of confusion especially when I didn't know the characters so well and who's who but after that it actually starts to be obvious and it starts to look like a very great way of telling a backstory. Each scene seems like it was written so well and in a way to take the audience on an emotional/dramatic ride, which the acting, set design, and directing made then even more emotional/dramatic. The dialogues were so REALISTIC and that's thanks to the great acting performances and the screenplay. I think without one of these elements, we would've not had this beautiful result, both of them worked together to give us such dramatic/emotional dialogues that would make the audience emotional.The acting performance of each actor/actress was genuinely very well done. Michelle Williams didn't appear much in the film. But, when she did, she absolutely killed it. Lucas Hedges gave his role the nephew an amazing little unique touch, a great choice. And the incredible Casey Affleck who proved to everyone that he is so talented and can put on a performance that will live for ages.The film's pace was a bit cold and slow which caused troubles in the first hour of the film and specifically before explaining the backstory. I felt bored a bit and didn't know where the film was going but after the backstory was explained, the film became much better and started to all make sense.Manchester by the Sea is a ""must-watch"". If you want a deep/emotional/sad/dramatic film that has great acting performances, then this is the perfect film for you.My rating is 9/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 July 2019,9/10,"This film affected me deeply. It was one of the best and most astute depictions of grief I've seen in a long time, heart-wrenching and beautifully told. I loved the non-linear storytelling, and the scene towards the end with Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams was one of the most beautifully realized scenes ever committed to film. Haunting and brilliant."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,3/10,"I went into this movie with sky high expectations based on all the hype. But like a lot of other reviewers on this website, I was disappointed. This was one of the bleakest movies I have seen in a long time. It begins with the death of the main character's brother and then goes downhill from there. The first two thirds of the movie, which deals mainly with preparations for the brother's funeral, is slow and boring. I've had to plan two funerals after the deaths of my parents, and it's not a pleasant process. I didn't want to be reminded of all the mind numbing details that you have to go through. The movie runs long at two hours and 15 minutes, and at least ten minutes of funeral planning could have have been edited out. In my opinion, Casey Affleck's acting is good (perhaps better than in any of his other movies) but not great. One big disappointment for me was that there is very little dramatic arc to Affleck's character. His character remains so dead inside that by the end of the movie, I had grown tired of the same expressions and reactions. A less serious problem is the score. The music is too operatic for my taste. It is so loud and obtrusive in a few scenes that it is hard to appreciate what is going on on screen.In fairness I need to mention a wonderful scene near the end of the movie between Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck that will almost certainly earn Williams an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. The film is worth going to see for this scene alone. I suspect that this one scene (like the bear attack in The Revenant) is responsible for leaving such a strong positive impression of this movie on the minds of many critics. Manchester by the Sea could have been a masterpiece with leaner editing and a better story arc. But, sad to say, I can only give it a ""C""."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 June 2017,5/10,"I don't get how this was an Oscar winning performance for Casey Afleck. He was very wooden. The flashbacks and forwards were terrible, with no transitional knowledge given for the viewer to get what was going on, till later in the film. To me,that kind of artistic garbage push by a director, insults the audience. The story itself was pedestrian at best, and this movie only served as a star vehicle for Afleck. And quite frankly, I think everybody else bought that except me. None of the characters were likable, with the exception of the captain of the boat and his wife. The only good thing about this movie was the ending, which was far more realistic than most of its ilk. It was the only thing that kept me from dropping this thing to a 4 rating. Very rarely do I rate a film, and say its not worth the watch. But this time, unfortunately, that's exactly what I am saying."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 May 2017,9/10,"Here's a man that gave up on his life due to his negligence, causing the killing of his children. He wants out and tries to, by attempting to shoot himself in the police station, with an officer's gun, but forgets to unlock the trigger.His brother, in some sort of knowing way, and knowing his illness is fatal, wills his brother to care for his son, and that this in some way, will help both son and brother..... which it does. So basically, his honor doesn't permit himself to refuse to help his brothers son, after that brother's illness/death. And the son still has a blood tie.There are pages and pages of negative reviews. I assume from people that are used to watching fast twitch no thought or character development movies. The scenes and acting are superb. Yes, it's a sad movie. Yes, Casie's character is ruined and to the point of him using his loss as a mode of self-punishment, and even to the point of figurative self- flogging by bar fights.But there is no denying this is a superb movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 November 2019,3/10,"Am at a complete loss to see the virtue in this deploringly prolonged journey in depression. The movie is overhyped, as it is mneither brilliant nor inspirational. Oh, so where to begin? Start with a main character who cannot even stand himself, then cast him into the pain and accompanying forgotten, once but no longer happy memories, of the death of his only sibling, an older brother. Mix that up with the resultant reunion and guardianship over his nephew, his now deceased brother's only child, who despite the countless flashbacks of happy childhood memories with his uncle has now inexplicitly forgotten, probably as a not-so-bright teenager. So of course the nephew is miserable over his dad's death, but not so much as to have his mind taken off of sex. Then of course he is foul-mouthed and disrespectful to the uncle he supposedly once adored, and our main character, his uncle, remains emotionally dwarfed and incapable of acting like an adult. Mix in the failed marriages of both the main character and his deceased brother, who had wives go off the proverbial beam, and some shame and guilt. If your idea of having a good movie experience is wallowing through and with characters dripping of self-pity, but resolving differences through contrivance and placating instead of really maturing or overcoming, then have at it. The movie achieves nothing, and could find no character worth caring about because they are all so self-absorbed and self-centered."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 October 2018,10/10,"Headline is true if you like deeply felt movies about families going through a crisis, which this family certainly is. Only a ""feel good movie"" if you can pick up on the indication in its last moments that the two characters are beginning to heal. Because of its seriousness and realism, it was not a popular success. It's reminiscent of movies like Ordinary Peeople and Rabbit Hole- and it's got a great performance by Casey Affleck."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 May 2020,7/10,"It's deep sad and sometimes confusing but we get to the main idea by sympathizing with the characters of Lee, definitely worth watching"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,6/10,"Casey Affleck's marvellous performance of Lee Chandler, a brooding, depressed and occasionally violent alcoholic is the saving grace of this otherwise fairly dreary film. Lee's brother Joe dies unexpectedly, putting his 16 year old son Patrick in Lee's charge as legal guardian, without either's knowledge. Lee can barely look after himself, let alone an angsty 16 year old youth in another city, and this is the basis of the plot. However, the central relationship between Lee and Patrick never really gets anywhere, nor did the explanation for Lee being the way he was gel for me either. There are a lot of side plots which I thought detracted rather than added to the impact of the film. The film looks the part, shot on location in USA's New England north east Quincey and Boston locations, capturing the bleak wintriness brilliantly. I found the relationships between some of the characters confusing, and I wonder whether editing removed some critical lines which established who some of the people were and their relationships with others. Much of the story seemed predictable and I'm not sure that the relatively shallow depth of the story and characters justified the film's length."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,3/10,"I am an hour and 20 minutes into this snoozer and it is almost 100% arguments. Arguing between Casey's character and his nephew and anyone else who is around in the scene.It is well shot but there is not much to work with. Scenes are just draggy, going on and on and on. And, then, there are these cuts to a different time of day and back to now and cut away again and back and ... what's going on? Why all these cuts. Was the film editor bored and just decided to mismatch pieces of scenes just to confuse people? Don't get it! This snoozer is 2 hours and 16 minutes long. An hour could have and SHOULD HAVE been cut out of this to make it move along.And when the arguing quits, somebody dies. And the pointless draggy police interview after the house fire. It, too, was pointless.The high point was the Barber Adagio on pipe organ and violin. And that is the saddest piece of music ever written. Goes well with this movie.HEY DIRECTOR -- If this is the Director's Cut then I want this director to go back to school and learn how to direct editing. Good acting but you have to like arguing and dying and very sad scene after scene. Can't imagine how this one got nominated for best picture. Wake me when it is FINALLY over, please..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 April 2020,9/10,"We can not choose the direction of fate, let alone reverse the foregone conclusion of life and death, but in the face of some irreparable pain, we can choose whether to sink in the pain or embrace a new life in the pain."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2017,5/10,"The story of tragedy and homelessness, quite believable and well acted, but far too long, far too pessimistic, far too boring and tedious. I doubt it will do well. People don't want to relive tragedies and disasters quite so fully and totally, I think. The only humor concerns the teenage boy left fatherless; he will be OK. No one else will.My criticism has nothing to do with the actors or the directors. It has to do with the cold and brutal view of New England lower middle class society and the hopelessness given full dominance over any other emotions.The publicity given this film does not led one to expect something quite so bleak. I can take bleakness because life is perhaps nothing but tragedy but I don't need to seek any more of it in the cinema, thank you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 March 2021,10/10,"What an extraordinary film, what a surprise. Casey Affleck is incredible, a joy, a masterwork.Must see!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 October 2020,6/10,"I've watched Good Will Hunting several times, and now I've watched Manchester by the Sea a second time. These movies go very well together and both involve at least one Affleck. The working class neighborhoods of Boston and the sea community of Manchester seem like another world to me as compared to the mid west where I grew up. The Afflecks definitely know Massachusetts. I read that Matt Damon was originally cast in the lead role instead of Casey Affleck. As much as I love Matt Damon, I will say I can't imagine anyone else in the role as Lee besides Casey.The film was successful in transporting me into Lee's depressing guilt ridden world. There was something missing in this movie, and it's hard for me to put my finger on it. I loved the real aspect of the dialogue. I especially appreciated the real situation of having to wait until spring to bury Lee's brother because the ground was too hard to dig by hand.I read in some other reviews that Lee did show some growth, but the ending did leave me wanting more. Lee's character wasn't able to give more, but perhaps that's the problem. Perhaps I needed the script to offer more of a way for Lee to come back from his guilt. The people in Manchester weren't going to forget what happened, which didn't help. Lee wasn't able to get work in Manchester because of what happened, so it was going to be virtually impossible for Lee to stay even if he decided to stay. I guess it would have been too contrived to save another family from disaster. Perhaps there could have been a hurricane and Lee rescued his nephew. Perhaps he could have rescued his ex wife's new child from a falling beam and became paralyzed himself. Yes, this is all too contrived for most people's tastes. But perhaps there could have been something less dramatic, and Lee could have saved Patrick from Patrick. Perhaps Patrick could have been into drugs like his uncle. Perhaps Lee could have helped Patrick from self destructing as a path towards redemption. It's hard to say, but I was left wanting more at the end. I did think that the actors were fantastic, and I loved the dialogue as well as the realistic feel of the film. I also loved the ""Shark"" dialogue with the Manchester accent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 December 2020,9/10,"It is a dark movie but somehow isn't too heavy to watch. The feeling of grief and guilt is so universal that even tho I haven't experienced such trauma, I can relate to the characters. I love how they show different ways people deal with loss. The dialogue are short but very powerful. The scenes are straight to the point. It's therapeutic to watch such an honest piece."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 July 2020,9/10,"These ty pe of films don't come around that often, and for good reason. It takes focus and effort to come up with stories and the mes that touch dee per than the usual Hollywood dirge. The story-line is completely unpredictable, unlike 95% of the films out there. W hat is most intriguing about MBTS, is the way in which highly depressing the mes are kept in check with humour, intelligent scripting and a subtle feel good factor, which seems to creep in at exactly the right time. The overall feel is also kept balanced by the intricacies of the relationships between various characters. Affleck has taken his game to the next level , his character and mannerisms are completely believable -he is submerged into ty pe. As a couple of mid 40 somethings, we grew tired of the ty pical film genres some years ago. We long for films like this, and having seen many of the nominated films for this year (bafta), this one is by far the clear leader. Hacksaw ridge is just another glorification of war, predictable, overly violent and boring, silence is good OK but not special and the list goes on. Manchester by the sea deserves recognition for standing out in a sea of mediocrity"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 February 2017,7/10,"***Watched for the 2017 OscarsI went into this expecting to hate it since there's a lot of people who say it's overrated, and I tend to be one of those people since I'm very picky. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this. By no means is this a fast paced movie. It goes with the common movie story trope of 'two people who hate are forced into a relationship and end up liking each other by the end'. I tend to enjoy those types of films to see how the relationship between characters grow and how many ways it can be written. There was a lot of comic relief which I didn't expect, but I laughed a lot during this, even if some points seemed unintentionally funny.My main complaint is that the arguments between the two leads that kept recurring got old after a while since they didn't last long and went absolutely nowhere.Either way, this was enjoyable at the least."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,8/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" may be the most realistic and emotionally draining movie in a very long time. It's written and director by Kenneth Lonergan, produced by Matt Damon and John Krasinski, and stars Casey Affleck and Lucas Hedges both in Oscar worthy performances. With the success of this movie, it's too bad they could not squeeze in Ben Affleck. It would have given him at least one good movie under his belt this year. Anyways, Manchester soars with amazing performances, realistically clever dialogue, a devastatingly sad story, subtle soundtrack, and witty Bostonian humor. Never has there been a movie that so strongly displays day-to-day human interactions than ""Manchester by the Sea."" The awkwardness and frequent misunderstandings maximize the authenticity and credibility of the film. It is so eloquently crafted through its use of subdued silence and brief phrases that unearth suppressed feelings. Casey Affleck's performance strongly depicts what a victim of trauma would act like by his cynical reticence. When you see this character you don't see Ben Affleck's scrawny younger brother. You see an actor that is so absorbed into the role he's basically defined by it. With the above mentioned, ""Manchester by the Sea"" surely would seem like a definitive masterpiece and the year's best film. Although it has the craftsmanship of a great film, it comes up short of greatness. It is on its own merits a life movie which can have a positive and negative connotation. Positive as in its realistic and grounded in real world struggles, and negative as in it won't wrap up or conclude as most people are accustomed to seeing in a standard film. So in other words it doesn't follow in the same formula and tropes of a Hollywood picture, which can be considered bold and original by some but boring and anticlimactic for others.For instance, after the revelation of Lee Chandler's (Casey Affleck) haunting and devastatingly sad past, which may be the best movie scene of the year, the movie focuses on the lesser of the two compelling story lines. After reveling Lee's past, the movie then never touches upon that topic again thoroughly. They don't show how Lee was able to find a reason to keep living or the drama that would have followed after that soul-crushing moment. Kenneth Lonergan spends the rest of the time focusing on the main story at hand which is the coping of the death of Lee's brother, and finding a suitable guardian for his nephew. The main story is still bitterly relatable and emotional yet it doesn't hit as hard as Lee's painful past. One of the main reasons for this is that Patrick (Lucas Hedges) never really seems to be that effected by the loss of his father. He does have one instance in which he shows vulnerability (the freezer scene) but that's really it. One can say that people grieve in different ways yet it is still difficult to connect or feel for him especially since he does come across as a brash and selfish teen. With all these critiques noted, they still don't take away from the emotional impact, palpable realism, and the incredible acting in the film. They just weigh it down slightly past greatness. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is still one of the best movies of the year and it's one of the few movies that can actually bring tears to your eyes. 8.5/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2021,4/10,"A man who lost his three children brother dies from congestive heart failure and leaves a teenage son's guardianship to him. There is is really no resolution to anything and there is no plot. There are just a bunch of depressed people going through life. the summary said that it changes the man, but I really didn't see much change. I kept waiting for someone to have an epiphany. Its an ok movie if you want to be sad and depressed. Casey Affleck did a good job. I really didn't see a breakout performance with the teenage son. He was just acting like a normal teenager."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 January 2017,10/10,"In Manchester by the Sea, a man on the worn edge of youth lives out a solitary and humorless existence as a custodian in a Boston apartment building. Played by actor Casey Affleck, Lee Chandler regards the world through wary, guarded eyes and keeps humanity at arm's length, drawing no more or less satisfaction from a cold beer after work than from unclogging a tenant's stopped toilet during his workday.One afternoon while shoveling snow, Lee receives a telephone call: His brother has suffered a heart attack, and has been taken in critical condition to the hospital in the nearby town of Manchester by the Sea. Lee displays no outward emotion at the news—he quietly assures the caller he'll leave for the hospital immediately. Manchester by the Sea is Lee's hometown, we are told. He left there years earlier under unknown circumstances.Arriving at the hospital, Lee learns his brother has died, and that he needs to assume a measure of family responsibility and attend to the brother's unresolved business and final arrangements. In the process he'll need to interact with friends and family members he hasn't seen or spoken with in a number of years.From that point forward, Manchester by the Sea departs from a traditional narrative structure. As the estranged Lee begins to somberly address his burdens he draws upon memories of the past, presented to the viewer in the form of flashbacks. Little by little, we learn about Lee's family and his background. And as we eventually discover the unspeakable tragedy which devastated the laconic custodian's life and drove him away, we realize what a selfless and heroic gesture he's undertaken by returning home to assume his brother's responsibilities.The highest accolade for both Manchester by the Sea, and for Affleck's performance in it, is that is seems as if writer/director Lonergan conspired with cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes to simply camouflage the camera and capture life itself, in all its emotional pageantry. Like film ancestors such as 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer and 1980's Ordinary People, this picture actually seem natural enough to enforce the notion that we're eavesdropping on actual occurrences, or viewing another family's home movies.We learn that Lee's brother Joe, a charter boat owner, has always guided him and tried to shield him from life's unfairness. And that in either one final lesson in responsibility or a cardinal gesture of confidence—we're not quite sure which—the now-deceased brother has entrusted Lee with the custody of his 16-year-old son.Playing Joe in flashbacks is Kyle Chandler, an actor whose movie star good looks belie his range and effectiveness in the roles he plays. Late of television's critically-acclaimed Friday Night Lights—he played the coach—Chandler has also contributed quietly authoritative and eminently persuasive supporting performances in such pictures as Peter Jackson's King Kong remake, Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, and the 2011 Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams collaboration Super 8.Also contributing a memorable characterization to the picture is the superb Michelle Williams, who enhances and enriches seemingly every film in which she chooses to appear, from the title role as Marilyn Monroe in the acclaimed My Week with Marilyn, to Brokeback Mountain and Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. As Lee's former wife, Williams etches another memorable characterization in a resume as one of the finest performers in American film, although her role in this picture is not as large as her billing suggests.But a real revelation in Manchester by the Sea is the performance of Lucas Hedges as Joe's emotionally-orphaned son, Patrick. Alternately outgoing and guarded, aggressive and vulnerable, manipulative and trusting, Hedges' Patrick persuasively invests the character of the wounded teenager with all the qualities found in real life. Near the end of the picture is a brief episode which takes place on the deceased Joe Chandler's charter boat. The scene is set in the present, after Joe's burial, and onboard to test the craft's seaworthiness are Lee, Patrick, and Patrick's girlfriend. The boy is piloting the boat around the harbor.Impulsively, Patrick invites his girlfriend to take the wheel for a moment, and steer the boat. Nervous, she simultaneously accelerates and turns the craft sharply—a deadly combination. But Lee, in the back of the boat, never flinches or reaches out to steady himself. Instead, he just flexes his hips and knees and rolls with the lurch of the boat—a balanced man, living with confidence for possibly the first time in his life.But the real denouement of the scene is the expression we see in that moment on Affleck's face: His brow, until now darkened and knotted with anxiety, is bright with confidence and optimism, and his guarded face is melted into a broad smile of ease and happiness. For the first time in the picture there's love and affection in his eyes. It's a family moment, and at long last Lee has assumed a place in his family dynamic, tasting responsibility and liking it, making decisions on behalf of others—good or bad, right or wrong—but prepared to live with the consequences.It's an important moment, not only in the picture but also likely among all the films of the year: It is in that moment that we behold a flawed and fallible character embrace maturity, and begin to grow and more forward. Manchester by the Sea is the rare motion picture which invites us to invest in its characters, and walk along with them. Even at 137 minutes the film leaves us wanting more. It enlightens us as it entertains us, and leaves us with an impression of humanity we sense might remain with us long into the future."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2018,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a blast to watch. Especially if you love being sad and uncomfortable the entire time. There are no happy parts about this movie. There's also no real climax. It's like watching a documentary about the saddest person imaginable and then it just ends. There's no real resolution. Even though I know we're supposed to have harsh feelings about Casey Affleck, everyone casted is perfect for their role. I don't think this movie would be as good as it is with any other actors. Definitely worth a watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 January 2021,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and stars Casey Affleck, Kyler Chandler, Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. The film tells the story of Lee Chandler, a depressed man, returning to his hometown after his brother dies where he must care for his nephew while battling his own demons. Manchester by the Sea, released to glowing praise in 2016, and after finally viewing the film for myself, it sure lives up to the hype.Manchester by the Sea, is a crushing tale of grief and mental health, supported by excellent performances. Casey Affleck is phenomenal as Lee, delivering one of his best performances in his career so far. The film does a great job at setting up Lee, building intrigue with the character's past and establishing his personality. As the audience you feel a very real connection to Lee, he is fully fleshed out and feels like a person that actually exists. Lonergan and Affleck did an excellent job in this aspect and watching this story of a broken man play out were as thrilling as it was heartbreaking. The rest of the performances were also great, Michelle Williams is superb in the few scenes she's in and Kyle Chandler morphed right into his character of Joe. The only performance I found to be a little inconsistent was Lucas Hedges. He was serviceable, but given the talent around him, he felt overshadowed even in the big role that he has. I didn't totally buy his accent and the breakdown his character has in the middle of the film almost took me out of the film since it was pretty laughable. I have found Hedges fine in other movies he has been in, but here there was just something about his performance I wasn't sold on and given how much screen time he has, it did take away from the experience a bit.One other aspect of the film that I wasn't totally in love with, was the score and how it was mixed. The themes are very string-heavy and operatic, and at times I felt it didn't fit with the vibe of the story. It is a depressing tale and the music most certainly provokes feelings of melancholy, however, something about it felt like it may have been a little too pretentious, and given how it is mixed in with some scenes, it was almost distracting. In one particular sequence where Lee is recalling his actions during a flashback, the dialogue is almost unclear due to how loudly the score was being played. Whether that was intentional or not, to convey how the feeling of sadness can drown out everything around someone, it was something that I wasn't the biggest fan of.Outside of those gripes, I found myself loving a lot about this film. As noted almost all the performances are great and the way the story is pieced together is done quite tastefully. I was deeply enthralled with the way the story unfolded itself and was touched by Lee's struggles to cope with the loss of the people around him. Manchester by the Sea, is also shot beautifully, there were main captivating shots that truly felt like paintings; Lonergan did an excellent job at capturing the cold Massachusetts town.Overall I enjoyed my time with Manchester by the Sea, I found it to be a well-realized and riveting story that I see myself revisiting. The performances were mostly excellent, particularly that of Casey Affleck who was fantastic and the cinematography was also a work of art. I do highly recommend this film, just take into mind the couple issues I pointed out as they are noticeable, however, do not totally ruin this film and for that reason, I am giving Manchester by the Sea an 8.5/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,9/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" becomes, amazingly by way of humanistic comedy, one of the most moving portraits of grief the cinema has ever given us. With this film, screenwriter and director Kenneth Lonergan has finally fulfilled the promise of his two previous features, ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000) and ""Margaret"" (2011), the latter a particularly beautiful film (called ""a masterpiece"" by Martin Scorsese) that was finally released after having spent many years drowning in financial problems and various lawsuits over the editing of its final cut.""Manchester by the Sea"" originated from a script idea pitched by producer John Krasinski and actor Matt Damon (in which Damon had intended to star and direct until he signed with Ridley Scott to star in ""The Martian""). Lonergan went on to write and direct this story of a deceptively reserved janitor in Quincy, Massachusetts who becomes obligated to return home to Manchester to care for his nephew after his brother has died, and the subsequent emotional can of worms this opens up in his past. It is a veritable masterpiece due to Lonergan's method of realism which avoids all clichés both in scripting and directing, but most of all due to the performances of its perfect cast, of which Casey Affleck as the emotionally-scarred Lee Chandler is the standout, putting in one of the most nuanced and perfectly-modulated performances of recent years. He never allows a single moment of forced poignancy or even obvious empathy, always finding unpredictable, new ways of approaching truth to keep audiences off balance. The supporting cast all perform at the highest level, especially Lucas Hedges as the nephew Patrick, Gretchen Moll as Patrick's 'reformed' substance-abusive mother, and, most of all, Michelle Williams as Lee's estranged wife Randi who, in a minimum of screen time, sears her character into our memory. In fact, one of the great movie scenes of the entire year is when Williams and Affleck confront each other near the end of the film and we feel two hearts irreversibly broken. (And look for Lonergan himself doing a cameo as a pedestrian who accuses Affleck of being a bad parent.)Deceptively unpretentious while it paints its narrative as naturally as daily life, ""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of the great films of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 June 2017,8/10,"After the sudden death of his older brother, Lee, played by Casey Affleck, is made legal guardian of his son Patrick. He then returns to his hometown and is forced to deal with a tragic past that separated him from his family and the community he was born and raised in.Manchester By the Sea is without a doubt one the best films that has or will come out in 2016. Casey Affleck has my vote for best actor for the Oscars this year as he leads this incredibly powerful, sad drama.The director never shot a scene longer than it should which means that the director really packed many many scenes in, making editing work all the more difficult and time consuming. But the end result is a masterpiece. Manchester by the Sea is beautiful and unforgettable. ---Yidioo"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 January 2017,10/10,"One of my all-time favorite movie scenes is in 1980's ""Ordinary People."" The story follows Conrad, a high school student who is dealing with the sudden death of his brother and living with two parents who have no idea how to cope. Behind a picturesque middle-class facade, things are slowly unraveling. The final moments of the film, after we learn that Conrad's parents have decided to separate, shows him and his father in a quiet and cold backyard. Even though these two have rarely seen eye-to-eye, and in a conclusion where everything seems hopeless, Conrad simply tells his father ""I love you,"" and in response his father breaks down and says the same. I think the reason I love this scene so much is because it offers a movie so full of darkness the slightest suggestion of hope. It suggests that the love of family is still stronger and cannot be overcome.I only mention this scene and ""Ordinary People"" in particular because almost 40 years later here is a movie that is a spiritual equal. ""Manchester By The Sea"" is a massive undertaking that deals with loss in such an intimate way that it would be hard to call it anything but profound. There is something entirely universal everyone can grasp and yet watching this movie feels like a peek into a very real life of a family.Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a man whose life is stagnant. He works as a handyman in a series of apartment buildings, fixing leaking pipes and whatnot. He lives in a basement studio apartment that is sparsely decorated and lifeless. He drinks by himself, and he is rude to those around him. In the first half of this film, Lee is not a character we understand or even like. In fact, he is oftentimes despicable. He gets into bar fights and swears at women. When he takes a phone call to learn of his brother's sudden death, he calmly says he will get there within the hour.Manchester-by-the-Sea (the town's actual name) is where Lee seemingly grew up, raised a family, as evidence by many flashbacks that pepper the film with glimpses into his memory. We recall the moment when his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) was first diagnosed with congenital heart disease, or when he took his nephew Patrick on a fishing boat. Now in the present time, Patrick is a high school student with no mother and only Lee as his seeming guardian.The movie becomes an evaluation of the stages of grief and we focus on the relationship between uncle and nephew. Lee, who remains shut off from the community, and Patrick, who invites friends over for pizza and stories on the very day his father died. No one is to say which way is the preferred method for mourning, and of course the emotions begin a series of highs and lows as the two men begin the process of moving on with life. Lee, who is adamant about living in Boston, faces pushback from Patrick who is adamant about finishing high school in Manchester among friends. Here, he has a boat, friends, a band, and two girlfriends (I know). In Boston, all Lee has is a sad apartment. There's no arguing there.What is surprising about the film (where can I start) is the stark humor that comes amidst moments of such melancholy. This is easily a story that could have sunk into our hearts and left us feeling cold, but there is a joy that comes from the way these characters talk to each other and interact. There is an established history that is evidence in the writing. What else is mesmerizing is a score that incorporates classical pieces as opposed to an original soundtrack. There is something so powerful about the contrast between the New England setting and such complex music. Maybe more impressive still is the tight structure of the script, which weaves back and forth through time and gives us such a sense of depth and backstory. Kenneth Lonergan (the director and screenwriter) has surely written the favorite for an Oscar nomination.Casey Affleck, an actor of considerable talent, seems to have finally become his own person outside the shadow of his brother. His performance is quite simply jaw-dropping. Closed in and reclusive and yet with hints of a broken heart, there are glances and gestures that are so nuanced that you can't help but think that this could be the best performance of the year. As with Michelle Williams playing his wife, this could very easily be her best role to date. Her brief screen time in all but 4 or 5 scenes encompasses the themes of the film and reveal the deeper heartbreak just below the surface of their relationship. The same can be said of Lucas Hedges playing Patrick, a young actor full of promise and grace.There were several scenes when I found myself genuinely moved, mouth agape at how honest this movie actually was. When Patrick finally comes to term with his father's loss while looking for a snack... When Lee and his wife exchange a hug at the funeral and a surge of emotion sweeps through both of them... A scene where Lee picks up a gun... These are candid moments that are so real, so perfect, I can't help but think that ""Manchester by the Sea"" is the year's best film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,9/10,"Not everything in life is neat and wrapped and happy ever after. And boy, does this movie show that to you in ever increasing lumps of pain (and sometimes joy). Having had a couple of weeks to digest this since watching, I can only say that the memory has grown in brilliance. There is so much going on in this beneath the surface and we intrude upon Casey Affleck's superbly acted grief, rage and despair in such a human way.I really did find his performance mesmerising and as the story unfolds, the quivering, suppressed fury gives way to happy memories and laughter and a tale told not quite backwards but in fragments of memory. Thankfully without the standard happy ending or reconciliation. Some of this is deeply painful to observe but it is true-to-life, it's a compelling story and the performances and scripting across the piece are top notch.I really can't recall seeing self worth and self loathing and guilt and blame and redemption and family and time and place and setting and love and hate being done this well for a long time. The story is simple but the circumstances are anything but. Throughout, I found myself feeling moral quandaries and taking sides, only to change allegiance or hope for something else to happen later on. It grabbed my brain and my emotions and made me very quiet for a little while.And it wasn't set in Manchester either, which was a shock. Although I do acknowledge there's a world outside of England....."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 October 2018,4/10,"Really don't know what to make of this film. Certainly overhyped. I really didn't see the big deal. Very simple story of a man whose brother dies and he becomes caretaker to his nephew. The film is composed of flashbacks designed to help you understand affleck's trauma but it really doesn't make any sense. Nothing is coherent. Just an underwhelming mess of a film. And I didn't see where this 'devastating' angle comes from. Everyone told me it's 'sooo sad', tragedy happens, yes, but it was an accident, and I wasn't beside myself 'titanic' style in grief. Nothing to see here, certainly not any oscar worthy performances."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 June 2017,5/10,"This was, without a doubt, a good movie. Casey Affleck does a great job, as does Lucas Hedges. (I confess that I had to Google the name of Patrick's actor. I'm mildly ashamed.) The film's many slow, somber scenes convey more emotion than I thought was possible in the silence between the actors' words.However, after the intense revelation of the fire, the movie really seemed to slow down to me. The conclusion was pleasantly bittersweet, and it was nice that this film defies the clichés in that way, if not others."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2019,4/10,"02/28/2019 Casey Affleck is one of my favorite actors but this ""Nothing Movie"" is bland. Zero excitement - Zero suspense - Lots of arguing - A Pity-Me-Casey throughout the entire movie. I can't stand Pity-MeMe's Po-MeMe's people. The inflated positive reviews must reflect an imaginary viewer storyline that was never present for the rest of us? At one point Casey in his dispair attempts to shoot himself. I was hoping for his success so that I could dump this whole-lotta-nothing pretend movie and move on, but unfortunately I had to go it to the end. Over rated - Big Time. Bon Appetit"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,9/10,"I haven't really watched such a realistic film in a veeery long time...Although, this movie will go in my records as not the best of the best films of 2016, it will surely keep its value over the years. Not only because of the two pivotal scenes (at least for me) in it - with Affleck in the Police station and with Affleck and Williams in the conversation from the screen which I post. But because of the overall feeling which this film piece relates to the viewer. This is reality, this is as close and as rough as it is.I don't necessary enjoyed every act of the performance of Casey Affleck, but he surely strikes us as a very believable ""dead"" living person. The story vehicle takes its time to reveal the cause of his miserable existence and we slowly dive into his ""ashes"". I really liked all the supporting cast as well. Starting from his nephew, played by Lucas Hedges, going through Kyle Chandler (is the coincidence in the family names purposeful?) and all the other minor participants (Matthew Broderick and even the director - Kenneth Lonergan).The background of the real Manchester town is reassuring that this whole story is happening where it should be. I cannot help but remember the great song by Billy Joel - ""The Downeaster Alexa"":""So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa"" And I go where the ocean is deep There are giants out there in the canyons And a good captain can't fall asleep""And yes - the musical coverage is great. We get the classical pieces at the right time, we feel the emotion overwhelming us at the right moments.This movie is a slow ride, at times a bit dragging in the details. But we all forget where we park our cars and we have all been through the moments of choosing the right condom :)Anyway, I wanted to emphasize on the two really meaningful moments for me which really grabbed me by the throat and made me remember this film - Lee Chandler's breakdown at the police station and Randi's remorse during their conversation towards the end of the film. I see them as emotional knots, culmination, nervous exit from a stalemate situation. And since we all reach such moments in our lives, when it's all coming over the top, I feel that these two actors did their best. And they did it both subtly and extremely. The viewer correlates and empathizes in key moments with our main character. Kenneth Lonergan directs really well here and we see these actors strengths profoundly clear. What a wonderful lesson in cinema!Of course I have to admit that Patrick's character is really a separate center in this movie. You cannot help but feel sympathy for him throughout the whole film. His actions and words are thoughtfully adult amidst his uncle's reserved and unresolved behavior. This is a film about losing and finding what is most precious in life. It is a movie about family, about time and about real life. It does not want to help you forget where you live and what you do in your every day routine. It stimulates you to do it better and not to lose your values and faith in good. It is a quiet story of ethereal meaning. The meaning of a lost and found reason to live."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 March 2018,2/10,"Depressed? I have seen many depressing movies. I have seen many bad movies, but this is both. I stuck with it because of the accolades assuming it would spark into life at some point. Sadly not. If the pregnant pauses were taken out of this film it would have lasted less than an hour. A lot of the scenes started with an inexplicable pause let alone the ones added during the dialog. Very difficult to watch. Boring, unnecessary length of time taken with each scene most of which had little to do with the story, just repeating the turmoil of each character and, boy, they had so much turmoil. If being depressed wins you an Academy Award this wins hands down. I don't think that acting depressed is too difficult. No change in emotion during what felt like three hours is not too hard to play but by God it's hard to watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 June 2020,10/10,That's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 February 2017,1/10,"I do not understand how this film is acclaimed. Casey Affleck did his usual non-acting with no emotion or range, but yet somehow all of Hollywood is calling it the best performance. The movie goes nowhere, ends on nothing, and quite frankly, I want my time and money back. This has been the trend for ""award winning"" films as of late. Don't waste your time and don't fall into the hype surrounding yet another one of Harvey If this is what garners awards nowadays, then I am done with Hollywood."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 January 2017,8/10,"Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea has been one of the year's most acclaimed films and all that Oscar buzz is certainly justified. Manchester by the Sea unapologetically explores themes of grief, family, teenage youth and just general daily inconveniences. Along with phenomenal performances from the main cast, Manchester's incredibly intimate and personal story will resonate deeply, and differently, with every viewer, not only making this one of the year's best films, but one of the year's most human films.Casey Affleck has only yet been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar, but it truly wouldn't be too naive to say that he has already won. His performance may be seen as lacking of any emotion, but within the context of the film, his emotional subtlety and understatement makes him just as real as anyone in the audience. While it is easy to dismiss him as emotionless, the grief that his character has been subjected to more than excuses his lack of social skills and general introvert nature. The rest of the cast is simply fantastic as well. Michelle Williams is perfectly damaged and Lucas Hedges is believably juvenile, making the entire cast of characters feel like real people, which is just about the best compliment an actor can receiver for his/her work. The story is very well told, despite some admittedly borrowed ideas. No matter who you are, there is guaranteed to be something within Manchester by the Sea that you can relate to on a personal level. Whether that be hitting your head on the freezer door, forgetting where you park your car or awkward family dinners, the screenplay features many little details that all work in part to make Manchester a completely immersive and human story. There is always a sense of heart within the film as even the darkest and most emotional moments are all handled sensibly leading to some beautiful sorrow and hilariously dark humor. The tone is quite inconsistent but it never becomes too distracting as new layers of meaning and emotion are revealed throughout. There are scenes of gut- wrenching tragedy and ironic comedy within seconds of each other, making for some choked-up chuckles, but nonetheless a memorable experience.Sometimes hilariously insensitive, sometimes emotionally devastating and always engaging, Manchester by the Sea tells a story that anyone can relate to at some point during it's run-time. It's at its strongest when it serves as a window into a life not too far from the viewer's. It may not be life-changing or endlessly re-watchable, but Manchester by the Sea is guaranteed to evoke emotion from any viewer, whether it be through laughter, tears or the painfully accurate and relatable actions of the characters. Most importantly, it serves as a beautifully human beacon for a year that was at times seriously lacking sympathy and love, making Manchester by the Sea feel like a warm hug when comfort was most needed."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2020,7/10,"""Manchester By The Sea"" is a pure melodrama. It is not a period piece, bildungsroman, dramedy, or story entrenched in identity politics. Nor is it based on a book or true events. It is just a heart-wrenching tale about a heartbroken man going through a tough situation.In recent years, pure melodramas have not received much attention, often existing in the independent realm or adding in dashes of experimentation to keep them cinematically interesting. ""Manchester By The Sea"" does not fall into either of those categories. With a dazzling cast of Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, Michelle Williams, and Kyle Chandler, as well as Matt Damon in the producer's chair, the picture is far from an indie flick. Likewise, it is in no way subversive. It stays within cinema's fundamental language and doesn't try to emulate anything other than a straightforward movie.Instead, writer-director Kenneth Lonergan simply crafts an original story riddled with unforgiving tragedy. When Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) learns that his brother (Kyle Chandler) passed away, he must return to his hometown of Manchester-By-The-Sea, Massachusetts, to become his nephew's (Lucas Hedges) legal guardian. However, Lee has demons in this prosperous New England coastal community, making him an infamous face amongst the residents. Through flashbacks, the movie slowly reveals Lee's dark past and it becomes evident that coming home brings him immeasurable pain.At its center, the film deals with family and death, two highly relatable subjects that many melodramas attempt to dissect. ""Manchester By The Sea"" thus stands out by never depicting these complicated matters in sappy or clichéd manners. Much of that is thanks to Affleck's breakout performance as Lee. Every syllable that the soft-spoken character utters carries melancholic weight, and his every action seems emotionally excruciating. Even before the movie explains his tragic backstory, audiences can tell that Lee is a broken man.Another contributing factor to ""Manchester By The Sea's"" effectiveness is the music. Composer Lesley Barber fills each scene with appropriate choir or orchestral scores that capture the emotional tenor. Not knowing much about music theory, I cannot necessarily back this up, but the songs also seem fitting for the setting - an upscale New England town reflecting terrible personal history for our protagonist.As its title probably gives away, ""Manchester By The Sea"" is a deeply New England movie. Each character has a signature Massachusetts accent and references to the Boston area and culture are abundant. Narratively, it profits from the greater-Boston setting the same way ""Good Will Hunting"" did nineteen years before. The location helps sustain the notion that the characters are aggressive types with hearts of gold, just trying to make their way through the bitter winter.In the end, ""Manchester By The Sea"" does not offer a full resolution, but it doesn't leave the audience hanging either. The characters overcome a lot and they surely grow, but the film does not trick us into thinking that happy endings come for free. By the final scene, the waters have cleared substantially, but Lee still fights, and there is not a dry eye in the house - such is the nature of the pure melodrama."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,1/10,"After the first 45 minutes I was ready to turn this movie off. I felt like I was watching somebody's home movies. Lee Chandler is living in a one room apartment in Boston as a janitor and he is a brooding, morose character, who drinks too much, picks fights in bars and is generally full of angst but we don't find out why until about half way into this 2 hour movie.He gets a call telling him his older brother, Joe has died in Manchester so he immediately drives there. They make funeral arrangements, etc. and Lee goes to see his brother's lawyer who tells him that Joe wanted him to take care of his 16 year old son Patrick. Lee doesn't want to do this, however he does stay at Joe & Patrick's house for a while, not sure why because he has made it clear he doesn't want the responsibility of the house, the fishing boat they own, Patrick, etc. I assumed he wanted to be there for emotional support for Patrick but he doesn't seem to do much for his nephew except drive him all over.We watch Patrick with two different girlfriends, find out that his mother was an alcoholic who is not around and generally there is a lot of talking, no action.We later find out through a flashback (there are many) that around 10 years ago Lee had been partying with some friends and his wife got mad because they were making too much noise. She made them leave, Lee walks to the store for more beer because he is too wasted to drive. While he is gone, the fire he started in the fireplace gets out of control because he didn't put the screen up. He comes home to his house in flames, his wife screaming downstairs that their three children are still in the house. The kids die and now we find out why Lee is such a broken, sad individual. His wife left him, accused him of some horrible things which we find out later in the movie when he runs into the now ex-wife who has a newborn with her second husband.However, we think moving back to Manchester and taking care of his nephew might give Lee a reason to snap out of his depression, guilt and self loathing but nope, in the end he lets some friends of his deceased brother adopt his nephew and then leaves for Boston again telling his nephew he will get a larger place so Patrick can come visit. The End. That was it - no sense of closure. Lee is still the same brooding, morose guy he was at the beginning of the movie with the exception that he is getting a 2 room apartment instead of a 1 room place.I don't understand all the praise for this movie. Michelle Willams, who has been nominated had about 10 minutes of screen time. I've never seen Casey Affleck in anything else so don't know if he was playing himself or if he did a great job. Sometimes critics seem to praise movies because they think a little too highly of themselves. Some of the worst movies I have seen have been reviewed by critics as ""the best movie in years"" yet they are not embraced by the average person. This is one of those movies. Read all the other reviews who seem to agree with me. My 29 year old son thought it was great so everybody has their own opinion of what makes a movie great I guess.I don't expect a lot of action in a movie but I do like a good storyline or some sort of a plot. This seemed to have none of that. It was so boring that if I had shut the movie off at any point I wouldn't have even cared how it ended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 May 2017,2/10,"Normally a high IMDb score and critical acclaim indicate that a film has substance, style or other attributes which make it a good film. This one is more than two hours of dullness, with almost no plot development or character development for that matter. I can't believe the high score or the response of critics - have they taken collectively leave of their senses? There is almost mo plot, and as an illustration of lack of character development, the depressed central character began the movie depressed, remained depressed throughout, and ended it depressed, seemingly unaffected by the events (such as they were) which occurred in the course of the film - some of which were harrowing enough in their own right.I wouldn't say this was as dull as watching paint dry, but perhaps as dull as watching grass grow in a cemetery. Avoid - and this has taught me to never take the IMDb rating or critics reviews as an objective measure of film quality. Thanks to this pretentious trash I am now depressed."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 September 2021,6/10,"I think I might be the only person in the planet who thinks this but, I found Casey Affleck suuuper boring and unemotional. It is very sad because I really wanted to enjoy 100% this picture, but I couldn't because of him.However, Olivia Williams is outstanding, as always. And Lucas Hedges did it pretty good too. The cinematography and script work fantastically here... so there goes my 6.5 out of 10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,6/10,"I really like gritty realistic movies so long as you can vicariously learn something, like The Machinist. Manchester by the Sea just had nothing much to learn other than watching other people's lives and awkwardness.Somewhere on the north east USA coast a man dies at 50 from a degenerative heart condition. In his will he springs the caring for his teenage son on his brother. This film limps along all winter with stone faced characters wearing grubby hoodies and jeans with some even worse winter flashbacks. It's all too likely with the tragedies that can actually happen in anyone's life. However life is good as well as bad. I don't know if I really want to be dragged into a contrived depressing winter with bleak skies and brown snow piled up on street corners to enhance the gloom? Is it entertainment? I found that the score just didn't work well with the film. The characters seemed fairly well rounded but did a lot of mumbling and swearing.It's not terrible, worth a watch if you've got nothing else to do and you're in a mood where you won't mind the obviously depressing content."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 March 2019,8/10,"I thought this one will be about an ""infantile"" man recieving a lesson on how to live ""responsibly"" and definitely wasn't planning to see it, but it was on my Prime, so I played it. And - surprise! Casey Affleck's take on life as we don't want to know it is truthful, heartbreaking and in the end - very mature! So I got surprised yet another time to read that people see his character as dull and/or bad. Obviously, a lot of them also expected the ""depressed"" uncle to change, but, unlike me, they actually hoped and even insisted for it to happen. They wanted him to pull himself together and go back to being a useful member of society. Instead life happened and they are angreeey, and they stomp their feeeeet! But what's broken stays broken and not how you repair it, but how you live with it, shows who you are. And the ""depressed"" uncle lived with it beautifully - he was self aware and honest, and thus he was caring in a way that overcomers, achievers and super heroes of all kinds could only dream of! So it's maybe not that bad when those in need of a leadership (the nephew, all of us), although they would probablly prefer to sail with an optimistic captain (the father), get stuck with someone lower ranking (the uncle) who doesn't guarantee them safe travels. Actually, to accept that the first one is cold dead and to go out fishing with the latter is all that being an adult is about. Give that boy a passport already!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 March 2017,10/10,"A movie that tells a story in such a way that you feel you know the people inside and out by the movies end. Oh, its also one of the most realistic and depressing stories you have ever seen. Some say the film is slow, but in all honestly it runs at the pace of real life. Casey Affleck and his surrounding cast play characters that feel real so they are ""real"". There are twists and turns and by the time all is revealed, you learn that in real life things don't always work out for the best and there are no easy solutions. Sounds like a great time, right?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 March 2017,7/10,"The society shown in Manchester by the sea, is composed of ordinary people whose life has nothing special. I would say they are middle class folks of a back country town. These people are all banal and some of them even mediocre; for example, Lee ex-wife and Patrick with the youth he frequents. Lee is the guiding thread that drives us in the visit to this society. He travels from Boston to Manchester to take care of the family problems created by the sudden death of his brother. During this journey, he interacts with the people who are part of his past in this city. Throughout this interaction we are presented to episodes of his past, through his memories or through the initiative of the storyteller.Some facts remain unexplained. The constant bad temper and rudeness of Lee's ex-wife, attitude, which is partly responsible for Lee's drunkenness that originated the fire that destroyed his home, his family and his life. Lee's profession before the tragedy and the reason he was known kind of popular in the city. The psychological process that led Lee to a kind of suicide that consisted of alienating life, leaving Manchester to adopt the life of a nonentity who lives in Boston. The reason why the people of Manchester are reluctant to to hire Lee.The camera travelings through Manchester landscapes reminded me of the camera travelings through Bordeaux (France) in the movie Moderato Cantabile by Peter Brook. These camera travelings are in tune with the suffering felt in background by the people who are presented to us. Because of this resemblance between Manchester and Moderato, I felt some lack of a soundtrack in tune with the drama which is presented to us. The film proceeds slowly through situations that are not encouraging, except at the end, when Lee seems to have overcome partially the state of alienation in which he had plunged after the tragedy that marked his life. I liked the film in that it consists of a character study of a set of ordinary and banal people living in Manchester by the Sea, and hit by tragedies."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 June 2021,6/10,"Do I like this movie? Yes, I do. This is a very touching film to the one who always have some place to return, some memory to remember. It will bring us around with the past and present, when a lot of things happened. First half of it is quite fascinating, but the other may not be like it, it's like the Producer didn't want anything special with it and made it in a normally acceptable way. Well I expected more than that in a Best Picture Nominee, but it's still OK with that. However, I really love the acting of all characters, they're all the soul of the movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 May 2020,8/10,"As the funeral proceeded, he listened to Darling's cries and shared with the man who was trying to soothe the baby a palpable sense of anxiety under his eyes. He reached out to take the child, calmed darling with the kind of magic he might not have dissipated, and then realized that he could not, and had no reason to, stop the chain of consumption for anyone else. He was tired and tried his best, and believed that all men were the same."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 December 2016,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea, since its famous showing at Sundance in January of this year has been a front runner on most year end awards lists by people who saw it, and by more than a few who had not. It can be difficult for a movie to keep a buzz around it for almost a year, especially when it does not have aliens or batmen. Somehow Manchester by the Sea has been able to keep the good word of mouth going and now has finally gotten a wide release. Was the wait worth it? Does Casey Affleck truly step out from his brothers shadow? Will Manchester by the Sea save 2016? Lets find out.Lets start off with what everybody wants to know. How good is Casey Affleck? I have been impressed with the younger Affleck brother since his monster 2007 when he starred in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Gone Baby Gone(Directed by his brother)and then went back and realized that every time he was on screen he was good including his role in the Ocean's Eleven franchise and Good Will Hunting. Is this Casey Affleck's best role? yes. Is it his breakout role? yes. Is it his best performance? probably. He plays a tough character in Lee Chandler who to call a ""broken man"" would not do him justice. Affleck plays it perfectly and while not a mind blowing performance like something from Daniel Day-Lewis, it is without a doubt the strongest performance from a lead actor I have seen this year.For what it is, Manchester by the Sea is a white bummer movie. With that being said it is a really good one, and while not necessarily a blast it is a really well made movie. There are actually some really well placed funny moments throughout the movie, but for the most part Manchester by the Sea is a movie about loss. Without giving too much away I will say that the movie takes on this difficult subject head on and tackles it. It is about all different types of loss, losing a loved one or losing a life you once had or just losing yourself. People react differently to everything, and it is no different with loss and Manchester by the Sea shows this brilliantly.The writer/director Kenneth Lonergan has been around for over twenty years in some form or another. He has written tons of stuff from Analyze This to The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle(2000), he even wrote an episode of the children's show Doug. It is Lonnergan's history with the stage that really makes its mark on Manchester by the Sea more than anything else in his filmography. While there are some pacing issues and the movie is just about 17 minutes too long, Manchester by the Sea is a tremendously told story, both in the script and visually. Long bits of dialogue have real meaning and there is real character development here, not movie character development where everyone is changed drastically at the end, but they do learn and you can realistically see how these characters will live on after the movie.Manchester by the Sea is certainly one of the best movies of the year. I did not really get a chance before to mention the other actors in the movie but all the lead performances were great. Michelle Williams and Kyle Chandler both are strong supporting characters given their limited time on screen. I had a problem with the way that flashbacks were used at times in the movie but that is something I can forgive. If these types of movies interest you then Manchester by the Sea is necessary viewing. Get ready to do some self refection and enjoy a really well made movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,7/10,"Manchester by the sea is a fine film, well directed, and extremely well acted. The first hour was my favorite segment of the film where we jump between different time periods of the characters in the film, it's non linear and the viewer has to be attentive to figure out what's going on, there is no hand holding and you never know how many years ago these flashbacks happened and you are doing mental calculations to figure out the ages of the characters and how much time has passed between events. This was just fantastic as it pushed all the right buttons for me. The second hour however saw a dip in the level of the film when the film reveals all it's cards, the movie just hangs around aimlessly for 15-20 minutes before eventually coming together for a decent end. Casey Affleck just nailed it in this one and I hope he gets an Oscar but while I liked the film I don't think it was very memorable, ala last year's Carol good film with good direction and great acting but I don't remember anything about it, like Carol before it other than the acting nothing is a standout, direction, cinematography, editing and even the script after the first hour are workmanlike. I assume MBTS will go the same way, in 7-8 months it will be the movie for which Casey Affleck won his Oscar but will not occupy any space in my head which great movies do even after tens of years. Overall 7.5/10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 August 2018,8/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is a sensational drama that was nominated for 6 Academy Awards including the Best Motion Picture of the Year, and won two of them; Best Original Screenplay, Kenneth Lonergan, and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Casey Affleck. When I start watching the film, I had no information about it, I didn't know what the story is about, I didn't even know there is a place called ""Manchester by the Sea,"" in Massachusetts. After a couple of scenes, there was one thing I was sure of, Casey Affleck has won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his exceptional role as Lee Chandler. His performance is one of the best performances of the 21th Century, and ""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of the best films of the year 2016. It is so annoying that I came across this beautiful film accidentally. I haven't seen any commercials about it, I haven't heard anyone talking about it. I was making a list of Oscar Nominated films, and there I found it. ""Manchester by the Sea"" was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan. It has 137 minutes of runtime and grossed over $77 Million against a budget of $8 Million. This film is a slap in the face for the critics who claim cinema can't produce any more original stories. It is also a strong proof of the fact that you don't need big budgets to make beautiful films.In the first 10 minutes, the director helps you sympathize with the main character of the film, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck). You get the feeling that even you meet him in real life, he is not going to be your friend. He doesn't care anything else other than his business. You can see the constant sorrow in his eyes, and sadness is all over him. Immediately you get to think that, there is something wrong with this man, something has happened in his past. This intense description of the protagonist in the early scenes of the film indicates that his emotional self is going to set the limits for the ""Manchester by the Sea."" The more you understand, the more you relate to the story. That's why director pays special attention to the character details. After this intense visual description, director starts to reveal the mystery over Lee, by showing us flashbacks from his past. After this point, story evolves with two directions, present and past. Everything starts to make sense about Lee's inner self. This storytelling technique is one of the reasons why ""Manchester by the Sea"" is nominated for The Best Motion Picture of the Year. A similar storytelling technique is used in Christopher Nolan's Memento.Lee works as a janitor and a handyman in a different part of Massachusetts. He receives a phone call about his brother who has a heart condition. When he reaches the hospital, which is 90 minutes away from where Lee lives, he finds out that his brother has passed away. In his will, he assigns Lee as the legal guardian for his teenage son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Through the flashbacks, we understand the relations and life of Lee. He used to be married with three kids. One evening, after intense drinking with his friends in his place, he goes out to buy more beer and forgets to put the screen protection for the fire place which he just lighted up to heat the house for his kids. House burns down and all his three kids die. During this scene, there is almost no talking and if I am not mistaken, in the background Bach's Air is playing. Such a tragedy was shown with a relaxing and equally emotional classical music. Throughout the film, there are other scenes accompanied by classical music.Imagine yourself as Lee, your life is destroyed. You kill your three kids by burning the house by mistake. Your brother dies, your wife divorces you, when you can barely take care of yourself, you are asked to take care of another human being. No one wants you in the town you used to live and, under these circumstances, Lee manages to survive. His soul is damaged, he doesn't feel humane feelings anymore, but he manages to survive. This is one of the most realistic films about people who survive through such tragedies in life. It is a beautifully made true drama. With exceptional performances and cold atmosphere that suits the progression of the story, ""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of the best films of 2016 and it is not going to be easily forgotten once watched."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 April 2017,8/10,"There are rare moments, usually in comedies with a heart, that leave you in a profound state of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Those who know tragedy have felt that tinge of guilt from smiling when there shouldn't be a reason to. But, there always is. That's the little known crux of grief, life doesn't know you're in pain. As the world carries on around you, the mundane can leave you irate just as easily as it can leave you in stitches. This build and release of tension can be seen in occasional, but effective moments in black comedies. It is unprecedented how ""Manchester by the Sea"", a true drama, sustains this emotion throughout. Casey Affleck fits into the role of Lee Chandler almost too comfortably. Affleck's casual Massachusetts brogue and understated delivery would seem lazy if it weren't so effective. Lee is the maintenance man in a Boston two building tenement, full of renters you'd expect in such a place. A flirty college student, a cheap dad, a bored housewife just begging to be somebody's problem. Lee lives on the property, in a room Not an apartment, just a 200 Sq Ft hole in the wall. We see that he splits his days between hard thankless work, and a steady flow of liquor. Lee's particular brand of affectation is dialed just above valium haze. His conversations are void of any platitudes and awkward moments draw out like a blade. His demeanor may not change from one extreme to the next, but the drink reveals a short fuse.The story kicks off with a death in the small family. Lee is called back to his hometown of Manchester after news of his brother's passing. As Lee takes the 50 mile drive up North, the film reveals one of its greatest strengths, editing. Flashbacks are handled with an understanding of mood. Often, movies treat backstory as a pillar for story structure. The need-to-knows are doled out for little purpose beyond continuity. Manchester is such a vivid setting that past and present share a harmony. We see Lee from years ago, lively, humorous, happy. His older brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler), has been on borrowed time since a heart diagnosis. Joe has a son, Patrick, a red-headed kid with a loving father and Uncle. In the present, Lee arrives at the hospital, where friends from his old life treat him delicately. Seemingly too delicate even for a man who lost a brother. The contrast between Lee, then and now, establishes an emotional investment that doesn't disappoint.Details of Lee's life pour in naturally. Lee learns that his brother left the responsibility of raising his son, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), in Lee's hands. Lee's nephew is now going on 17 with a blessed high school life, and difficult home life. Patrick's mother is still around, but the women in these men's lives don't seem to make a single thing easier. Lee's estranged ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams), stays at arm's length in the story until she provides the emotional pinnacle. The gravity of the turns of the story doesn't drop like a Shyamalan twist, but hits just as hard. It would seem that in this setting, there would be no room for comedy, exactly wrong.True to life, the grieving family copes with their changes and must eschew pleasantries, simply to keep sanity. When needless social graces are dropped, reality shines its natural funny light. You can't call a single moment unnatural, if only because moments like these are rarely shown with such honesty. Gallows humor is one of the few privileges granted in misery. And these characters earned theirs in spades."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 May 2017,7/10,"I like the story basically, but the undercurrent of the weak guys portrayed in the film becomes tedious early on.So typically the not overtly gay guys get their asses kicked by Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck). Come on. Really? He's definitely not typecast. I found it a cheap shot and blatant overshadowing. The Affleck acting dynasty seems to revel it what they know little of, but then they are just actors, go figure. (Casey, for instance, went to Hollywood when he was 18 to pursue his acting career.) Anyone remember the ""casting couch?"" I also grow weary of the portrayal of weak guys in the film, and oh yes, they are what ""real men"" always hate. Guys who are not drunks, guys who actually provide for the family or treat their wives as more than high school girlfriends.That being said, when it comes to dealing with death and what people go through, the movie is spot on.Worth watching for sure, just be ready to suspend your disbelief when it comes to any Affleck brother's real machismo."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 December 2016,10/10,"I realize that I have to write at least 1000 words (or 10 lines) in order to give a rating to this movie, I just got out of the theater after seeing Manchester by the Sea, and feel still a bit blown away but also feel that I went in knowing nothing about the movie or the plot, and believe my lack of any expectation likely contributed to the profound effect this movie had on me. As did the ending. And for that reason, I feel any review to people who haven't seen it should reveal little to nothing about any aspect of the plot, as to do so would be a spoiler of sorts. It is, instead, a movie to be experienced. The acting by Affleck was outstanding and do not believe any actor will be able to top his acting this year or anytime soon, meaning he SHOULD be Oscar bound (and I've seen quite a few contenders, was even in Cannes where I saw the wonderful Toni Erdmann, not yet released, and other popular choices.) In conclusion, this movie, to me, was a small but powerful must-see movie with incredible acting by Affleck"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2017,9/10,"Quiet and thoughtful, Manchester By The Sea engages from the very first scene with an icy sophistication and disconcerting quality that feels totally alluring to audiences. It's careful and considered, telling a simple story in an astounding way. It's themes of death, regret and loss are mixed with an unusual dark humour that ensures the film never slips into completely depressing territory, preventing viewers from feeling as if they are imposing on these characters during their time of grief; the humour is so important here and is nailed pretty much constantly scoring everything from chuckles to belly laughs across the board. It's thanks to Lonergan's script that that it strikes such an effective balance between these two opposing tones, and even more in thanks for his work behind the camera; from sweeping shots of the ocean to intimate moments homing in on a sole characters' smallest of expressions, it is textured piece of directing and filmmaking captured wonderfully by Lonergan. His use of flashbacks enables the film to unfold as a slow burner, drip feeding information and revelations that, although arguably foreseeable, is executed in a way that still shocks and breaks us despite our suspicion, demonstrating Lonergan's firm grip on this film. That one scene in particular is unbelievably powerful and profound, with the subtle and elusive hints in the lead up to the reveal never hampering its impact.FULL REVIEW - goo.gl/VRmPq2"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 October 2018,10/10,"Wow this film is just a compelling character study of a man stricken with unthinkable pain and tragedy. Yet at the beginning unbeknownst to the viewer such tragedy is not shown (yet) but brought to life by the amazing Casey Affleck, a janitor/handyman whos subtle nuance of behavior entice the question in the viewer of whats behind and inside this man who clearly has issues.Once the truth is revealed to the viewer as to the backstory of Lee it becomes a heartbreaking tale of a man who can't forget or move on from his tragedy, as long as he remains in Manchester. The performances are just simply top notch, even from the brief appearances from certain actors.If character studies or character driven films are your thing you simply HAVE to watch this. This is the greatest performance from Casey Affleck hands down"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2017,6/10,"I must be missing something. This movie reminded me ""The Master"" where the script was so pointless that I didn't care about any of the adult characters and only cared a little about the child characters. None of the characters seemed to care about each other either, so maybe that was the point. The acting might have been great, but how would I know and why would I care?Casey Affleck's character was the only one that had any depth. Unfortunately, with the exception of a flashback scene, Affleck played the part with less emotion than Marlin Perkins playing Mister Spock. I assume the lack of emotion was part of the Director's plan, because other than Michelle Williams, none of the adult characters had any emotion. Is there something in the water of Manchester that leaves everybody stoned? Given the events of the story, somebody should have a reaction other than ""oh well"". Lucas Hedges, who played a 16 year old, occasionally showed some emotion, but it was completely out-of-line with the story or the character. Erica McDermott's character would have been interesting, unfortunately, her character only had one line that mattered, and they never managed to follow up on it despite a movie length of two and a half hours."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,9/10,"Perhaps the mediocre reviews are due to the incredible angst of the film. Perhaps it's due to the unfulfilled ending. Perhaps it's due to the long and winding telling of the tale. However do not let any of this deter you.This film is a beautiful portrayal of family tragedy, loss, and the low grade heartache that never quite goes away; no matter how much time passes. Yet at the same time, it's not overly depressing or morbid. It's just a great film that doesn't feel like a film at all. It feels almost voyeuristic as we watch the time-line of two brothers who's lives are intricately entangled, no matter what distance is between them. At times painful, at other times not so much. It's real human emotion on screen. The emotions of everyday people trying to cope with circumstances within and beyond their control.The acting is all so subtle and I loved it. Two stand out for their impeccable roles: Gretchen Mol who plays the unstable fragile woman to perfection and Casey Affleck who is now becoming one of my favourite actors. Every role he plays is better than the last.Yet in truth, all actors play their roles to perfection. Kudos to the teens for being- teenagers! This is real life folks. You won't find any smarmy shallow hipster humour or over the top special effects- thankfully so.If you like intricacies of ""the night of"", you will definitely like Manchester by the Sea."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,9/10,"Manchester by the sea is a beautifully tragic film about loss, life, and the coping methods required. Delving into some dark waters, this film maintains a level of intrigue until half way through, when the premise is revealed in its rooted foundations. These foundations make the rest of the film that much heavier with more meaning and depth. The tragedy of Manchester by the Sea helps bring the message of the film to the front, and the volatility of emotive coping methods. For Kenneth Lonergan's third film, it is an inspiring feat. It is well paced, it measures the scene, it allows enough time to delve into the current environment, and at no point in the film, is there a taste of uselessness movie-creating wise. Every scene, every action, plays an essential ingredient to delve into the deep dark mind of Lee Chandler. This then makes a point of Casey Affleck. Affleck is the power house of this film. Competently carrying it on his shoulders, Affleck portrays the burden of man, the misery of guilt, the pain of life, to a unbelievable level, riddled with a genuine touch, made easy for relatability. Manchester by the Sea is a dreary painting of despair, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and through the tears, comes moments of hopefully serenity."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,1/10,"Besides the rants of so called Hollywood ""stars"" like Madonna,Ashley Judd, Cher,Whoopie Goldberg,Manchester By The Sea has confirmed my belief that Hollywood movies have reached the lowest denominator in years. I expected a great movie considering all the acclaim by reviewers.It is a boring,unimaginative,slow moving,depressing,film that a middle or high school student could do for a class project to show how not to make a movie. Casey Affleck is a terrible actor.Most of the time he stares into space with little dialogue.And suddenly he's smashing someone in the face.There's no depth to this script and no character development either. I kept yawning about to doze off and looking at my watch. The cinematography is good but if I wanted a travelogue about the Boston & surrounding towns in winter,this would be appropriate for that alone. The baroque music just added to the depressing qualities in this film. It never lets up.There are no redeeming features for this film. It should be tossed in the garbage heap never to be heard from again.Please ,don't waste your money & if curious watch it at home on Netflix."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 March 2020,4/10,"Casey Affleck puts in a wooden performance as a man dealing with grief and stuff. The brilliant Michelle Williams only appears in about five scenes across the two hours and does all she can to get Casey to act, but fails. The lad that plays teenage Patrick is quite convincing. Casey chooses not to respond though.The cinematography is good. Maine in winter is beautiful. But the film is really boring. The script touches on developing some drama and some emotion, but hides away from it. Leaves the whole film flat.A drama needs to be grounded in character for you to engage with it. Stories are fundamentally about people. Lee (Casey Affleck's character) is an a-hole. Why so many awards?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 January 2017,6/10,"I read and heard some hype about this film so it was on my radar to see. I had watched a number of reviews online, including those with spoilers, so I was pretty primed with some preconceived notions when I ended up in the theater to see this film. Perhaps this is was my downfall --I had expectations which I have found over the course of my life is rarely a good thing and never a good thing in film. So if you haven't seen it elsewhere, there was a lot of talk about the performances in this film. So right of the bat I want to say I didn't see anything noteworthy in Affleck's performance or that of Michelle Williams. Affleck seems very disconnected and there is nothing that happens in the film that turns his character into someone you can relate or empathize with. If realistic is your thing, then Affleck is very realistic, but it would be a realistic portrayal of someone on Prozac. I am not sure there is much talent in that. I did not see indications of much more hinted at in his performance--no signs of something brewing in deeper waters. I saw disconnection. As my movie companion said as we walked out of the theater--it fell flat, affleck felt flat.The same goes for Williams for different reasons. -In a scene where she is quite emotional it doesn't resonate. The pitch of her emotional outburst seemed out of place given the context of what we had seen of her earlier in the film. In fact it almost seems out of character this outburst of emotion but I wouldn't go that far given the history of this person in the film. While intellectually it seems a rationale, emotionally its jarring because we've seen this person functioning fairly normally and for all intents and purposes appears to have moved one. So, what should be a powerful arch in the story feels a bit out of place, out of character and I frankly found myself reacting much as the Affleck character did to this confession. So Williams performance falls flat as well, albeit for different reasons.One character I want to give a shout out to is the nephew. I read/heard a lot about the nephew in this movie--nothing was flattering. However, I found this character to be the most human and relate-able of all the cast. His story arch and Hedges performance was very real and engaging.So, enough of the nitty gritty. General impressions. The movie from beginning to end feels odd--as if the main characters are disconnected from the events in an unnatural way, as if they were all heavily medicated and not engaged in what was going on. Even in the most traumatic moments, they seemed disconnected and strangely flat and inauthentic. In fact if I was to characterize this movie's tone it had a Fargo like quality but lacked the humor. On this note in particular my theater experience was odd--a packed house that on occasion a large portion of the moviegoers would burst out laughing. I and my companion sat in silence. For my part, I just wasn't sure it was meant to be funny. The cinematography was spot on but, the soundtrack--it is SO HORRIBLE it literally ruins the film experience time and again. Again and again there is this ODD instrumental music that seems off relative to what is going on up on the screen. It seems so out of sync emotionally that its distracting. When it began to be a pattern I started to wonder if it was intentional and some sort of humor device--it was that disconcerting.I can't say 'don't see this movie' but I can say, don't go out of your way to see this movie. I wouldn't necessarily skip seeing this film, but there is no reason to rush to any theater. I think I would have preferred seeing this on netflix or something. And perhaps I would have been better served by knowing nothing about the film before seeing it.Edited to add--if you want to see a good Casey Affleck performance, he is pretty awesome in The Finest Hours."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,2/10,"This movie is one of those movies that maybe because it's produced and advertised by Matt Damon it is supposed to be great. And it's a real story with solid acting and in a nice setting that I've been to several times having grown up outside of Boston. But the movie is just a total downer and it's way too long. Even Casey Affleck when he hosted SNL opened his monologue saying it's a sad movie. When we saw it the theater was packed and the movie was so freaking depressing that people were laughing out loud at little funny jokes that the writer put in just to change the pace a little. I was looking around thinking, OK that little quip from the kid made me smile but it wasn't close to being laugh out loud. I don't really see why Casey Affleck won best actor either. I mean he really just acted dour and grimaced throughout the whole thing. Pretty sure I've acted that way around work just to draw sympathy or something. It's really a fairly straightforward simple story that is sad and then sadder but then it ends being...mostly sad. I guess if I want sad I'll bring the trash to the dump or watch a Trump speech. The movie is just tough to get through. Do yourself a favor and go see La La Land or Matt Damon's The Martian. This one a Debbie downer."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 August 2018,3/10,"Massachusetts family beset with tragedy. The family is dysfunctional, but not in an interesting or tragic way. Blah, blah, blah.....more filler. Casey Affleck mumbles through his lines. Attempts tp show a close knit, weird Boston family. Blah, blah, blah...more filler. The end. There might be a bit more to the story than I've let on but it's the same ole same ole. A complete snooze fest. When will Casey Affleck stop mumbling??"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 November 2018,2/10,"I just spent 137 minutes watching the critically acclaimed ""Manchester by the Sea."" My review: every single person who was involved in the structure of this film should be required to multiply 137 minutes by 60 seconds, and then in legible long-hand write ""Manchester by the Sea is stupidly and pointlessly long"" 8,200 times. This film had far too many shots, and far too many shots that went on far too long. I'm sure there is a meaningful story someplace in that massive pile of wasted electrons, but the production lacked a sharp enough editor to pull it up."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2017,10/10,"This film is powerful, sure, very emotional and raw in a lot of ways ... but I actually found myself laughing a lot more than I expected, at the humanness of it all.It is a long film - 2 hours and 17 minutes or something - but the time disappeared and final credits rolled before I knew it. It is one of those rare films that doesn't feel like a film, so much as real life.Main character Lee (Casey Affleck) - amazing, speaks volumes when he says nothing, carrying pain - learns that, after his brother's death, he has been named guardian of his 16 year old nephew (Lucas Hedges) - also a very real character, excellent authentic depiction of a 16 year old, even in the way he deals with his father's death.Michelle Williams is Lee's ex-wife - and even with small amount of screen time, she blows you away, also with the pain she's been carrying. Gretchen Mol and Matthew Broderick are also great in a very awkward but amazingly authentic scene.So yeah - believe the hype, the film's amazing, gritty, real, emotional - but the humanness of the story will make you smile more than you might expect from the material."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 November 2017,2/10,"This film will either make you feel better about yourself and your life or it will just drag you right on down.It is simply RELENTLESS. The misery snowballs and not a single character can relate in any normally functioning way.I guess the acting is good.... The cold atmosphere of the season is appropriate.Sorry, but I just would not recommend this to anybody for any reason whatsoever. I ended up finding it funny because of its totally unforgiving commitment to being depressing.Didn't like this at all"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 August 2018,8/10,"This movie shows us the present Lee and the past Lee. Lee lost his children and he's been left in a dark alone. Joe had helped him get well and Lee has been getting over the distress. And one day,Joe died and his will says that Lee is going to be Patrick's guardian. Lee refuses it first but he decides to be his guardian after all. And then the new life starts and the movie starts showing us Lee's past. Lee's felt a great responsible to his children's loss and he's not sure if he can take care of Patrick. We can see Lee's distress of the past some times on the movie. On the other hand,Patrick doesn't look so sad at Joe's loss. But we see Patrick get sick when he sees the frozen chicken and I think that expresses that Patrick's had the sad feelings and he's been patient. Those things happen between Lee and Patrick and they develop together. But at the last, Lee decides not to take care of Patrick as his parent. The complicated situation is built between them but their relationship is never broken. At the last scene,they ride on the boat and go fishing as they did when Patrick was little. 
This movie is about the development of each people,Lee,Patrick,Lee's ex-wife Randi and so on. This movie is about their lives' journeys."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 August 2020,10/10,"I don't like Michelle Williams, nor overly care for kyle Chandler and Casey Affleck kinda always rubbed me up the wrong way but this movie.....Wow. It's brilliant. Affleck is unbelievable and the story is powerful. Can't recommend enough"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,7/10,"I really don't know what to think of this movie. There are things that I like about it and at the same time things that I dislike. It is a moving, psychological story about a family that is crushed by a string of bad luck, failures and mistakes. The emotional moments are well-presented, without sentimentality, and maybe because of this, they are more impressing. The flashbacks are very- well merged into the overall story ( a rarity in movies) and I could easily follow the chronology of events. Also, the setting is wonderful-New England coastline in winter-evoking sadness and melancholy. The music also corresponds to the mood. So far, so good. The bad things: the movie is too long (over 2 hours) for such a story and it could have been cut as there are numerous unnecessary scenes which only distract the viewer. And what I was disappointed about: there was no climax to the whole thing--it just ends unexpectedly. There was no ending whatsoever.It just stops and I have the impression of it being unfinished."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2017,8/10,"i watched Manchester by the Sea last night with some reservations. I had read about the basic plot and it sounded a little like a made for TV movie but I decided to give the movie a try. I am very pleased I did. I told my girlfriend the movie would be slow and relationship driven (no car chases) and she wandered in and out during the two hours but i was riveted to the screen. The director maintained a leisurely pace but avoided me dozing off by showing multiple time lines so I had to pay some attention not to lose the thread. The movie is really a two man show and i enjoyed the performance of both of the male leads. I did think at times that Patrick (the nephew) would have been more upset by his fathers death but then remembered he would known about his father's congestive heart disease since he was small so it was something he knew would happen. There were a couple of scenes with Patrick that resonated with me especially when he went to see his father's body, took one look, said something like ""OK, i've seen enough"" and went out. It is very hard to evaluate the quality of the lead actor's (casey affleck)performance. He had to play a person who was detached from the world and who said very little. i cannot remember any extended conversations. His body language was largely the same. Subdued. it was either a very easy or a very hard role to play. i am not an actor so i cannot tell which. however, the academy awards are decided by profession of the industry and i am sure they will know which of the two cases it is."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,8/10,"The premise is quite simple and so it's the way that it's put on. Manchester by the sea it's one of the movies of the year by the way that it tells the story, in my opinion. What does it have (again, in my opinion): a simple premise but raw, close to reality...the way things can happen in life and the way we are going to deal with it, not for a second I thought ""Right, like that happens on real life"" the way so many movies make us wonder. In here I think the viewer really feels like we're watching someones life. The way the story it's told, with moments from the past being introduced very well to explain the why of the present. Last, but not least, a strong interpretation from Casey Affleck (not an actor that I pay much attention to, but in here I really think he helped putting together the story). There are some moments that get our attention, but for me it isn't very intense. In a way I guess I like that, because as I started by saying, I guess it makes it more real, less fictional but on the other hand does the emotions get to me? Not so much. So overall for lovers of the genre this is definitely a must watch, it brings an original way of telling the story and really focus more on real reactions then the drama, but it makes the action more slow."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 March 2017,8/10,"Really enjoyed this in the end. It's moody, dark and never ever funny. Affleck overplays his part a little bit. Too many Long Pauses, Longer glances and unnecessary outbursts, but he gets across the difficulties he feels with the situation he finds himself in.Other good performances are hard to find (other than Lucas Hedges who appears to have a good career ahead of him)Even saying all this, it all seems to come together to create a gripping watch.Seems unnecessary to be 2 and a quarter hours long though."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,1/10,"I'd love to give this ""film"" a ZERO, but I can't. So, with that, an over-rated ONE will have to suffice. I've only walked out on one movie before in my life: the Chuck Norris stinker ""Firewalker"" I was heavily tempted to one other time: the original ""Blair Witch"" fiasco. This movie - boring and pointless from start to finish - ALMOST had me walk out. The fact that I paid to witness this BOMB is what kept me in the theater in the vain hope that there would be some sort of payoff. I want my money back.I watched this whole movie hoping for something - ANYTHING - exciting to happen. There is no climax to the story as it just drones on and on and on until it (mercifully) ends. Maybe the relief you feel that the flick is finally over is intended to be the climax...?How did Michelle Williams get nominated for Best Supporting Actress for about 5 minutes of screen time? She has almost no dialogue (which isn't bad work if you can get it). Playing the part of a severely depressed person, Casey Affleck does it well - but the role couldn't have been all that challenging. Heck, Ben Stein (Mr. Excitement) could have done just as well. The bottom line is that this was a very, very poor film with no plot, no point, and it plods along until it just... ends. If you want something to do on a Friday or Saturday night with your date, go to dinner and then take a stroll in the park or see a live band somewhere. This dreck is not worth your time. I wish Roger Ebert were still alive - he may have been the only critic to have the guts to pan this movie and save countless thousands of people from losing two hours of their lives they'll never get back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,10/10,"Nominated for six Academy Awards, most notably Best Actor (Casey Affleck) and Best Original Screenplay (Kenneth Lonergan), 'Manchester by the Sea' is worth all the praise it receives, standing out as one of the best films of 2016. The story follows Affleck's Lee Chandler and his conflict with his past traumas, suddenly forced to parent his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) after the death of his father Joe (Kyle Chandler).The film opens with a daunting contrast from a scene in a happier life with his brother and nephew, to Lee's present monotonous life as a handyman in Boston. There is a distinctive tone established from the off, using flashbacks cleverly to relieve the moments of despair on occasion, but ultimately developing towards a single heartbreaking scene outlining Chandler's reason for his extreme discomfort in returning to Manchester, which resonates monumentally throughout the entirety of the narrative. The way in which writer and director Kenneth Lonergan undertakes the harrowing past of Lee Chandler is brilliant, serenely yet brutally combining the context of Lee's self-punishment and his battle with it in the present. The story unravels fantastically; Lonergan reveals the details of the events progressively with a certain neatness that merges wonderfully with the devastation of the characters' lives.It is one of those movies that you don't just watch, you feel. Not only because it is mercilessly hard-hitting, but it is also funny and warm in places, adding to the emotional attachment of the film. This juxtaposition works magnificently, further highlighting Lonergan's flare for dramatic disposition.However, the film would certainly not be as emotional if not for the astounding acting by the primary cast. Casey Affleck gives a career defining performance, demonstrating the anger and contest within his character with sharp and alluring charisma. Undoubtedly, 'Manchester by the Sea' finally allows Casey to receive noteworthy acclaim in acting over his brother, Ben, after years of battling with his counterpart's successes. The on screen dynamic between Affleck and Hedges results in the impact of the eventual storyline being seismically more powerful, consistently growing in depth, and its simplicity to follow alongside the complexity of human emotions makes the bonding process realistic, moreover relatable on a personal level. Michelle Williams also fully justifies her Oscar nod, although not in the movie as much as possibly anticipated, she performs with often terrifying conviction.Having seen this film comparatively late, it is now easy to see why it has received so much praise. Its expert acting and sublime storytelling compile wonderfully to form this dark, bruising yet also soulful cinema experience that pulls hard on our heartstrings, and leaves us truly moved by the narrative's close. 'Manchester by the Sea' is a masterpiece. No other way of putting it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 March 2017,9/10,"My rating- 4.3/5 March 23, 2017 Manchester by the seaManchester by the sea Review By- Ridin Bal ""Very good movie with realistic dialogues and Casey Affleck's acting is top notch. Its definitely worth a watch""My rating- 4.3/5 Positives-1.) Direction , script and story- Direction was good and never bored the audience. Kenneth (director) Utilized each actors capability and it helped the movie being engaging and never boring. It might bore some depends on your taste but true movie lovers wont get bored. Script which is also written by him was also good and succeeded in giving realistic touch to the dialogues. Story was an emotional one and i personally loved it. Especially Casey's character which was having emotional background and narrated in a non-linear pattern suited the movie well with help of amazing direction and script.2.)Casey Affleck and Lucas hedges- Casey Affleck was outstanding and his performance was realistic. Emotions which he portrayed was too good and never showed any flaws in his performance. Lucas performed well and was apt to the character.3.) Cinematography4.)Bg scoreNegatives-1.) Duration- Duration could have been reduced because it was too slow and might bore the audience at some scenes. I agree it was slow paced narration and it was required for this movie but makers were slowing it even for unwanted scenes which wasn't necessary .Overall- Its a good movie which is worth a watch. But you have to go with different mindset to enjoy this flick.My rating- 4.3/5"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 March 2017,10/10,"I was not too sure if I would stay the whole time in the theater because Casey is one of my least favorites, but wanted to give it a try. I couldn't believe myself at the end of the movie, so glued to my seat - just like the few others around me.This is so fantastic!! A great movie!! Great acting and directing!! Casey did the best job and changed my perceptions forever about his previous boring acting. He really lives in this character Lee Chandler like the live wire, makes the whole movie so powerful. Lucas Hedges as Patrick equally does a great job, effortlessly fitting in to the rebellious teenage nephew. There is great acting altogether by all, knitted cohesively in to their characters and the movie flows so smoothly connecting to each scene, one after one. Director Kenneth Lonergan cleverly uses the flashback technique to enhance the power of ongoing scenes.Brilliant cinematography and editing has done its justice to this movie. Music is good but sometimes too noisy and inappropriate. Particularly when Lee was describing the fire incident to police Officers, the background church organ music was not only inappropriate but too noisy as well. That scene warrants subtle piano, cello kind of music actually.Don't miss this movie! Because it is quite hard to get great movies like this one from the Hollywood these days!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 September 2016,9/10,"After the sudden death of his older brother, Lee, played by Casey Affleck, is made legal guardian of his son Patrick. He then returns to his hometown and is forced to deal with a tragic past that separated him from his family and the community he was born and raised in.Kenneth Lonergan is such an extraordinary and talented writer; his beautifully, and richly, textured drama draws upon the timeless themes of recovery, redemption, and the persistence of guilt in such a way that feels fresh. The emotion is never overbearing for the sake of being overbearing, rather it feels all too real, which is a credit to the writing as much as it is to the fantastic performances. This is the 'Casey Affleck show' from beginning to end; you can just give him the 'Best Actor' Oscar right now and save everyone a whole lot of trouble. He radiates this aura of subtle magnetism so brilliantly and effortlessly; there's not a single emotion on the spectrum that goes unexploited. As much as the film is about Lee and his internal journey from tragedy to something a lot more hopeful, it's also about his nephew, played by Lucas Hedges, who has a very bright future, and his personal struggle to cope with his father's death. Despite having a small yet significant part in the film, Michelle Williams' performance is a treasure to behold. There's one scene, in particular, where she got everyone in attendance wishing they brought a tissue. Unlike many big-budget studio movies, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA is not afraid to make the audience work and test the viewer's patience with its constant, and unannounced, cutting between past and present, as well as its unwavering unravelling of character background and motivation. In fact, one of its best aspects is the lack of close-ups. Almost everything is filmed from afar, which reflects Lee's emotional distancing. And it's not until later where you finally find out why this guy has detached himself from the rest of the world. Then, from that point on, you're in his head; you watch the film unfold from a point-of-view almost entirely foreign to how you viewed it at first. Regardless of the second half's slackening pace and film's familiar DNA, this is without a doubt the most personal and heart wrenching film of 2016 thus far. Maybe even the best."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 February 2017,9/10,"Though requiring exceptional skill, it still surprises me that the most affecting films often involve a handful of actors who authentically portray the human condition – all aspects and that mirror is spellbinding just as much as it can be confronting. So it is with Kenneth Lonergan's latest film which he both wrote and directed. There is no escaping the fact that this film will break your heart. I wept openly and started tearing up just seeing the ad a day later – that is artistic power. The premise is quite simple. Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is forced to return to his hometown when his brother dies unexpectedly so he can care for his teenage nephew. Unfortunately, returning allows the demons of Lee to resurface as he tries to be a proper guardian while facing his past. The film is nicely shot and captures that New England aesthetic – you feel cold while watching it. It is a crisp film – the scenes are often short intercutting on top only to have a long pause, sometimes silent, which says more about the characters and story then any heavy handed exposition could. The whole film rests on the ability of the audience to follow Lee's journey as the hints to an awful trauma become more and more insistent and this is made possible by the most beautiful, authentic acting you may have seen this year. Because the film does flash between pre and post trauma, Affleck essentially plays two versions of the same character and the first time you see it happen it is incredibly jarring. You watch knowing something is off but it is only as the film unspools that you can put your finger on it. Essentially Affleck plays the same character and same personality, but one version has been irrevocably broken. You almost have to look away and this is an Oscar worthy performance and the best of the year. Add to that his brother Joe played by Kyle Chandler and Michelle Williams as Lee's ex-wife and the film displays virtuoso acting. I must note the nephew, Patrick played by Lucas Hedges who is genuinely self-absorbed as a teenager piecing together grief and fear with the normality of girls and sport. There is much humour between the cracks and nearly all of it is the interplay of Lee Chandler and his nephew. The film will not be for everyone. Rarely do I see a film which I think is so well made, brilliant even and yet I would not recommend it to many people. The film demands everything it can from the viewer and it is an awful lot, perhaps too much for some. However, if you are the person who wants cinema to present a view of the world and the human condition, unvarnished and tumultuous, then this film will reward that bravery."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 June 2018,2/10,If your day was going well and you had a smile on your face just watch this film and that will completely change. Not a single shred of sunshine or cheer in this pile of garbage.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2017,9/10,"Once in a while, a film will make you shake yourself down, and it will take hour,s maybe even a couple of days to get your real self back. This is one of them.From the very first minutes, Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams and the rest of the cast just transport you into their world. So much so that you feel like you're sitting in the corner of the room just watching them go about their daily business.It's one of those movies that you think you are done with the grit in your eye - then a larger piece of grit appears. Then an even larger one. At the end of the movie I was reduced to a wreck and just felt like curling up in the fetal position for a few hours. Some may question why one would want to experience this feeling. But the answer is for me at least, it is a cinematic emotion that I so rarely go through, that I know, when I have it - I have just seen something and experienced something that very few other movies have made me experience. This film conjured up memories of watching 'Dear Zachary' (a devastating documentary) and 'Blue Valentine' (another Michelle Williams movie). What we learn about the characters in this movie is tragic. The first half is a journey into why Casey Affleck's character Lee Chandler is so aloof, distant and angry. When the reveal comes you begin to wonder what the movie has left to tell us. But the manner in which it resolves (or doesn't) the plots and subplots is masterful. Kenneth Lonergan has simply created a masterpiece of drama that I would quite happily call 'the movie of the decade so far'. The scene in which Williams and Affleck meet towards the end of the movie just has to be seen to be believed. The dialogue, the mannerisms and the circumstances all meet to create one perfect storm of bubbling, weepy, tearful masterwork that has to go down as one of the most heart-wrenchingly brilliant scenes in cinema.The movie is so achingly brilliant that in the days after watching, not only did I not stop thinking about it for almost every waking moment, but I also had doubts whether I would again ever feel the same way about another movie. I am sure I will, but I would guess not for a long time. I have no real desire to see this movie do well at the Oscars or any other awards because this movie will stand the test of time nonetheless.This is a masterpiece of modern drama. 10 out of 10."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 September 2019,6/10,"I was really hoping this was gonna be happy movie, I really was hoping the main character was gonna have a moment and lighten up but, nope he stays a broken bitter man till the end.
Both lead actors did an awesome job,
Just was hoping for a happier ending.
Happy viewing!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 February 2017,6/10,"This movie started like any other drama, the main character has a problem, where the story of the film has a beginning, the main character and history suffer a turn and in the end of the second act, and them is the end of the story (third act of the movie itself). In other words, like any other drama, this film follows the already very used old paradigm of Syd Field for scripts. A story told a thousand times before, the same way a thousand times, only the characters change and nothing else. The same situations, the same problems.However I must say that the director of the movie at least had the idea of the main character does not learn anything (moral lesson) at the end of the third act. This earned points to the movie for me, at least.The characters are interesting in most of the part of this film, but only three of them take advantage of the good actors that are in the movie , the characters of Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams. The remaining characters are irrelevant in movie story and they basically do nothing interesting (basically they are filler for this movie).Casey Affleck is good enough but only shows potential in only one scene with Michelle Williams. There are other scenes that his character underutilized, like the scene in the police, in which Lee tries to commit suicide, this scene fails, because the construction of the character itself until then, there was no indication that this character wanted to kill itself, there is not enough tension until that moment. Michelle Williams is also underutilized in most part of the film (she is annoying, to speak the truth, but she also appears little time on the screen), except that scene with the character of Casey Affleck (In the third act of the story, Randi appears with a baby of its new husband). In which both have a talk about their past and about their separation. In this scene there is a lot of tension, and the drama of the actors is well applied. It's an emotionally amazing and perfectly executed scene.Lucas Hedges is good enough, not amazing, but good enough for me to sympathize with him, the freezer scene is pretty good, nonetheless. It's a perfectly executed scene to watch and be admired.But this is the problem of the film for me, taking some scenes (pretty good by the way) where the actors can show their potential, the film is the same thing seen a thousand times before, with the same situations and problems. Nothing new under the sun. If you do not see this movie, you will not miss anything new that you have already seen. It is a good movie, but no classic or masterpiece level of quality."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 May 2019,8/10,"Manchester By The Sea is a naturalistic, character-driven Drama which punches you in the guts and leaves you breathless. It's a film which hinges on its trust in a lean cast to deliver complex emotions with minimal dialogue and, for the most part it delivers.In a film which conveys so much with so little exposition, the less said about the actual plot the better. Suffice to say ""A depressed uncle is asked to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies"" is about the limit of what you need to know up front.Describing Manchester By The Sea as a bleak to gut-wrenching Drama is no understatement yet along the way it manages to strike upon moments of genuine comedy which derive naturally and believably from awkward interactions.
Manchester By The Sea's occasional missteps are stylistic; Namely, one jarring and unnecessary dream sequence and a strange choice of non-diagetic music which accompanies a pivotal flashback.Yet thankfully overall, Director (and writer) Kenneth Lonergan and Crew take a back seat to a career-defining, powerhouse performance from Casey Affleck and a more than capable supporting Cast.The film packs one hell of an emotional punch when it needs to, yet there is universal hope to be found in its portrayal of a set of circumstances so unique that it is testament to Affleck and Co that Manchester By The Sea remains all-too believable."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,7/10,"This film is polarizing. I haven't seen so many 1-star vs. 10-star reviews in a long time, save for Arrival. I understand why, however. I think if you've seen it or will see it, you will too. There is a pain that centers in the heart of this movie, very similar to the main character. It does a great job in conveying the simple stress and burden of living a life in grief. The pace is slow, the actors ""normal"" and human. Ordinary, if you will. There are intense admissions, Apologies, expressions of love and disgust, fear and loathing, loss and even rekindling. It does run through many human emotions, but subtly. Quietly. Almost gently. I can easily handle the pace of films like this. I enjoy a good character study. Yet I also understand that it makes some people want to jump out of their chair and run away. It's not a film for everyone, and that's OK. Did Casey Affleck deserve the Oscar? Obviously many thought he did. I don't believe he did enough to warrant a win, but I'm just one person with an opinion. I believe there was greatness in the role, but he was up against men who acted their tails off. Comparably, it could look to some like he phoned it in. But that's Casey Affleck. He's got a quiet intensity and I've seen everything he's been in, and he's the same. Even keeled, intentional, and slow paced.I liked Manchester. I thought Michelle Williams was wonderful, as well as a solid supporting cast. It's an interesting film about an area of the country that isn't shown much, and the people in it. That's always nice."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 August 2021,8/10,"Manchester by the sea shows grief in a slower and for many people a more real way, showing how we can look to be fine and coping but in ways like scenery with memories and even doing small things not happening as they should can bring up all those emotions after how they seemed to cope so well. It shows another way of grieving that many forget."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 January 2017,3/10,Production value is fabulous. Acting spectacular. But I cannot conceive how anyone in their right mind could conclude that this was the story and script to put all this talent into. This film was so depressing and long I couldn't wait for the end. It had to be FANTASTIC to make up for all the torture the filmmakers put me through. But no. The end came - that was the end wasn't it? I don't know. It didn't seem like an end. IT just seemed like more of the same depression that goes on apparently beyond (thank God) what the viewer gets to see. Holy smokes...what a downer. My conclusion is that I wasted my time and money. I hope that if you go to see this that you have a much better experience than I did.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 May 2021,9/10,"Goof film, can see why Afleck got the oscar , the writer for this film did an amazing job."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,9/10,"These is the kind of films I love, adore and enjoy watching; because of screenplays like this, actors like this, soundtrack like these, the length of the film, and many more reasons. Strating with screenplay and script, using that kind of language is rough and difficult to create, and the way actors took it was amazing, that lead to those incredible performances; the story that each character had and the way they showed it, the before and after the event changed their lives. I love the order in which the story is told, because it means that only some people could understand it and more important will find the movie interesting and stick with it till the end. Kenneth Lornergan is a true artist, a man with passion, that everything he creates is art, is magnificent. Affleck's performance was excellent, got me speechless. Also William's was pretty good, and Hedges' was good. Also the production and cinematography was perfect to the film. The soundtrack was very very nice because it had the combination of modern classic music and old classic music."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 September 2017,4/10,"It is hard to imagine a less sympathetic protagonist than Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) in Manchester By the Sea. He is emotionally blocked and in almost all his interactions, passive-aggressive, with a few drinks teetering him over to the aggressive side. When he hears that his brother has died, he leaves his handyman job in Boston and drives to Manchester by the Sea to join his stereotypically swearing, beer-drinking, working-class family. We find eventually, through often-confusing flashbacks, that Lee was traumatized by what, in the script's terms, is a Great Tragedy – although real tragedy involves thwarted ambition, and this was a drunk, stoned goof-up that killed his children and alienated his wife. The Chandler family perpetually bicker and curse each other out – in Kenneth Lonergan's world, working- class people have no social skills whatsoever. These, however, are fake, Hollywood-imagined working- class people; when discussing (or rather arguing; these characters never discuss anything without arguing) how Lee's brother is to be buried, his nephew suggests a ""mini-steam shovel."" A real character who lived in a world where people ran heavy equipment would call the machine what it is, a mini-excavator. But there is nothing real in Manchester by the Sea. It is not even, as advertised, a Michelle Williams movie, as this great actress appears only in glimpses throughout this bullshit scenario. Fake all the way!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,6/10,"A detached man comes home to bury his brother. The story of his detachment unfolds over the course of the movie. Unlike many of these US East Coast dramas it is not about the living who survive the dead but about the living dead, namely the main character (Lee). The cinematography and bleak winter setting capture a sense of isolation which is probably intended to complement Lee's own isolation. There seems to be a conscious effort to hold the movie together, to not descend into melodrama, and movie is often about what is not said more than what is. However, the movie plays its main card early and is a cheap device for generating empathy. All in all, you have to cut the characters a little too much slack to make it through this film. Here is an example of form dominating function in a downbeat movie. Not surprising given the thinness of the script. It may get you emotionally, it may make you feel, which is all well and good, but it won't make you think anything new, unless you are into the craft of movie making."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 June 2020,2/10,One of the WORST movies I have watched -- ever. Plot? Message? Waste of time. I kept forwarding to see if anything really meaningful too place. Still searching -- not. Casey should find another career. He is no Ben
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 June 2017,8/10,"A defeated man defeated by grief going through the motions is jolted from his routine . Manchester by the sea has a realistic authentic feeling that is relatable and explores the heart of human emotion. It achieves an excellent balance of dramatic circumstances and unforced humor. This is an in-depth look at human isolation and interaction,grief,sorrow and ultimately how the characters deal with that grief and sorrow let it consume them or pick up the pieces and move on. The main character Lee is convincingly portrayed by Casey Affleck in a performance that is so genuine that halfway through it I truly forgot I was watching a movie. Lee is appealing to the audience as he is shown having unavoidable experiences and frustrations we all go through at times. The non linear pace of Manchester by the Sea, had me as the viewer intrigued and by it's conclusion it all made sense. Effective flashbacks and a real world exploration of the human experience accompanied by harmonious music made this film an excellent experience for me and it's much needed humor is timed perfectly."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 November 2020,4/10,"Obviously some powerful performances and very real emotion involved, but overall just a lot of material with no real anchor or takeaway. It's like a painful clip out of real life with no narrative direction. Felt aimless and bleak."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 December 2018,7/10,"GREAT ! One of the best films ever. Phenomenal charactarisation and acting especially from Casey Affleck. I was mesmerized by this film. I felt like I was reading a novel, there was so much to contemplate and digest. I did not know what to expect or where the plot would lead. Captured the complexity of life and tragedy in a masterful way. Excellent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 December 2019,8/10,"This is a film that creeps up on you. Deliberalty low-key throughout, the story unfolds in pieces as you jump fro the past to the current. The first couple of these jumps were a little disorienting, until we became familiar with the characters., but eventually the story unfolds nicely.Casey Affleck is the whole show, and he carries it nicely. His understated performance carries the film, and its success largely rests on his shoulders. I think the film could have benefitted from more of a role for Michelle Williams, she's a bit wasted here, but lights up the screen when she's there.This film is not eveyone's cup of tea, it does move slowly, but give it a chance, and it's ultimately a pretty rewarding experience."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 May 2020,10/10,"I know that this movie is not for everyone, because here a man, an ordinary man, is portrayed so realistic that this movie is probably one of the most realistic of the 21st century, something that most Hollywood movies lack. The way Lee Chandler talks and acts, that man has such a miserable life that I guess many men can relate to him, but he has one thing that most men didn't experience: A tragedy that I can't tell because I don't want my review to contain spoilers. The other character, Randi, is also brilliant. She suffered too, but she and Lee have a difference in how they handle this suffering. Anyway, a must-watch for people who prefers to see real stuff on screen than typical super-heroe Marvel movies. Even this movie has its touch of comedy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2016,6/10,"Found this movie to be over rated. It dragged out so long, that I was ready to leave before the final third or so of the movie. Confusing too, as people showed up and could not understand their relationship to Casey Affleck's character. Nice acting by most of the performers, and some nice photography, but plot bored me. Perhaps this is more like a chick flick than a male movie. Also did not think the music was all that great unlike some other viewers, but then music is a matter of personal taste. Also detected a couple of miscrepancies. Main one was that Patrick told Lee that he was on the basketball and ice hockey teams at his high school. I find that hard to believe as both those sports are played in the same time of year, so mighty difficult to practice and play with both those teams at the same time. I won't mention the other, because it might be considered a ""spoiler""."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,5/10,"I have watched every movie nominated this year in the Best Picture category for the Academy Awards. I have to say, this movie should not even be nominated. I almost fell asleep watching this incredibly boring film. Its slow, it drags on and on and on and on. By the end of the first hour I wanted to turn it off, but i forced myself through the rest. There are a few very good films this year that are nominated, however, Manchester by the sea is not one of them. Aflecks performance was very good, but the competition that he is up against this year is head and shoulders above him. I go into every movie with an completely open mind, unbiased to any reviews from critics and in my opinion, this movie sucked. Period.5/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2018,10/10,This movie shows very close experience of a real life. It feels very real & natural. Of course it is a slow movie but after watching you will realize how good this movie is. A perfect real life situation.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,7/10,I expected this movie to be better based on the golden globes and Oscar buzz but the fact is that the movie is very slow at times and runs 137 minutes when it could have been edited easily down to 100 minutes. The main character is hard to sympathize with because he is so introverted but that may be because of a tragic event that happened in his life.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2021,7/10,"By far Casey Affleck's best performance. A somber, sad, and emotional story written and directing very well. This movie will make you feel the pain and sorrow that Lee, the main character, is going through."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 January 2017,6/10,"I will not divulge into the details of the movie but rather touch on some basic topics noted throughout. Casey Affleck performs masterfully in this film and I have to say that most of the acting performances were very well done. There are several moments in the movie that are laugh out loud funny and others that pull at your heart strings.I normally don't view movies for their realism because commonly people don't want to see a movie portraying real life scenarios. The music and cinematography added to the performance rather than distract from it. The one thing I can say about the movie is that you can really see the raw emotion that the actors were portraying during the film.I personally wouldn't view this movie again and I think the movie was very well done, but it was not a movie I walked out of feeling a lasting impact. There were a few scenes that really made the movie for me and this is a movie you must watch intently or else you will miss the small things that makes the acting great and the movie more than just so/so."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2017,5/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a slice-of-life, straight drama set in Boston's suburban North Shore area. It is a tragedy as much about a place as the people living in it. Filmed on location, the nautical backdrop provides a realistic glimpse into the way of life in those parts, i.e. a fishing village culture. It's Good Will Hunting meets Young Adult. Casey Affleck (Good Will Hunting, Gone Baby Gone) plays with type as the hotheaded janitor with a dark past. There are cameos from Matthew Broderick, Michelle Williams, Tate Donovan, and Gretchen Moll. Newcomer Lucas Hedges steals the show as the grieving ginger nephew forced onto Affleck's hands pursuant to the will of his deceased brother. Therein lies the plot, albeit deconstructionist. The biggest drawback for me was the nonlinear storytelling. To be sure, Manchester is a slow burn. It has its moments of poignancy and dramatic irony. Like any good Boston picture, there are plenty of dropped Rs and local references. One mistake that got past the cutting room was the line ""You're a janitor in Quincy."" Quincy is a separate city from Boston, where the protagonist was supposed to be doing his janitorial penance. He is depressed. Regret, loss, substance abuse, heartbreak, life going on, coming of age (getting laid), the awkwardness of forced small talk, replacement, boating, and family are the central themes. Some of the characters were needlessly introduced without developing their story arcs or serving as plot points. Fair warning, there is a lot of profanity. Manchester is about going back to your hometown, in this case, the titular town being a metaphor for facing the past. The future remained uncertain, leading up to the culmination, of what to do with the living situation and legal guardianship arrangements. The tone was wry. Like life, the story is messy. I think that was the point."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 September 2021,10/10,"This was slow moving and you had to go deep to feel what wasn't being said. I could see the non spoken pain, thoughts and feelings. Human connection, pain, tragedy, unbearable guilt, healing, life mistakes that can never be undone. Oh man...this has all of that and more. Get the Kleenex ready."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 February 2017,10/10,"This movie is probably the best film in years. The plot, the directing and the powerful acting of the great Casey Affleck (who is one of the most underrated actors although he should have at least three Oscars by now) makes this film an unforgettable and exceptional event for everyone who watches it. This film goes deep down in everyone's soul and it's absolutely universal. Those feelings and behaviors depicted can happen to any human being on Planet Earth. Casey Affleck is a person with an inner secret, carrying with him something from the past and as we learn what it is about we understand why is he how he is and what makes him doing what he does. Kenneth Lonergan with this European style drama lives up to the highest expectations of an Ingmar Bergman aficionado and proves that he knows what's going on in the human soul on a rainy day and on a sunny day. If someone deserves an Oscar, than Casey Affleck, the great actor is the one. Of course, the film also deserves an Academy Award. Number one film on any what-to-watch list."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2018,9/10,"When I walked in to see this movie I literally did not know whether the Manchester it referred to was in England or the US, that was how much I knew in advance. I looked at the poster and said I would give it a try not knowing what kind of movie. With no expectations I was truly impressed by this powerful piece. Its treatment of the subject matter was astounding and it manages to weave in dark and black comedy as well as touching all other bases. It avoids taking the routes that so many other movies do and I found this refreshing. Academy awards should have been liberally distributed to all concerned. I was so impressed I went back to see it again about a week later. The one caveat I would add is that had I known the subject matter of the movie I may not have gone to it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,5/10,"showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-manchester-by-sea.htmlMelancholy-inducing Manchester by the Sea's attempts to tell a passionate story of tragedy, loss, and the importance of family in times of struggle, fall short; all that felt received was a mediocre presentation with a lack of convincing portrayals.It is clear to see what Manchester by the Sea tried to achieve here; the plot follows the death of main character Lee Chandler's (Casey Affleck) brother, and his new-found guardianship of nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges) - Lonergan envisioned a hard-hitting movie encapsulating real-life reactions to trauma, gripping the viewer until the bitter end.The main storyline carries the predominant issue Lee faces - being left custody of his nephew after his brother, Joe (Kyle Chandler) dies from a heart condition. Lee is incredibly reluctant about this and spends plenty of screen time trying to palm off said nephew on others, and the ending is inconclusive as to how this issue can really be resolved.The faults in Manchester by the Sea include an unjustified runtime, near-emotionless acting (particularly Affleck) and some rather odd pacing; flashbacks occur frequently - detailing Lee's past and why he moved away from Manchester - but these flashbacks have no indication of timing so it is often unclear whether each scene is a flashback or part of present day events. Affleck's performance is wooden on the most part; the majority of intended powerful moments fall short with Lee - a brooding loner - just being portrayed disinterested and expressionless; mundane to watch, to say the least.Casting decisions were not entirely on form either - both Lee's ex wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and Joe's ex wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) looked very similar (and had uncanny styling) so, particularly in one certain scene where only the back of her head was visible, it was unclear which character we were seeing.The film did have its merits however; the location the film is set in was an excellent directing choice; the scenery was beautifully shot at times, and the writing of the story was touching to an extent, were it not for poor execution. Manchester by the Sea did have some comical moments as well - especially during the first half an hour of the film. It was a let down that this dissipated throughout the film because it appeared as though the movie couldn't decide if it was entirely sombre or if it had light-hearted aspects despite a dark plot-line.The film succeeded in the sense that I did leave the cinema feeling melancholy - Affleck did display an on-screen presence of depression and angst; and there were times during the film that this did absolutely fit the tone, but not when there were attempts to show his compassionate side towards his nephew: which were key to the plot.Manchester by the Sea's greatest fault is that it is mostly uneventful and uninspiring, I never found myself enthralled or anticipating what was to come - only waiting on the movie end. How Casey Affleck won a Golden Globe for his performance I remain uncertain - but one can appreciate he made some semblance of effort with respect of the material given.Lucas Hedges' depiction was of note; it is disappointing that the character of Patrick Chandler was written merely as a bratty teenager (with an injection of lothario and absence of empathy) above all else; reduced to an irritating on-screen presence.The film is at times a bore to watch, as some plot lines don't go anywhere (perhaps in an attempt to simulate lifelike events), but the premise of the movie is commendable and despite an inconclusive ending, Manchester by the Sea was not completely awful."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 March 2017,8/10,"This is a great film that moves at a slow, thoughtful pace with some beautiful cinematography and long shots that leave the viewer to decide what is being said.Kacey Affleck is raw and gritty and the film does not pull any punches leaving you to suffer through some awkward scenes.The characters are not always very likable but they are real.The only thing that let the film down for me was the motivation for Affleck's misery, the fact that he had wandered off at 2 in the morning to buy beer at some shop 20 minutes walking distance away in the snow and before he went he had lit an open wood fire and while he was away the log had rolled out, started a fire and burnt his baby son and two small daughters to death. And his wife survived. And he only went to get the beer because he had been having a table tennis party in the basement of his house at 2 in the morning until his wife told him it was late, the kids are sleeping so send your friends home. And so he got rid of them (noisily shouting as they went). And then he wanted another beer. But there wasn't any. So he went for his hour long walk through the freezing cold to get one lighting a fire before he left and returning to fire engines and little burnt bodies.Who does that? Is it realistic? Could it not have been done better? How much sympathy can you have for a father of three that parties with his friends in his house while his kids are sleeping till 2 in the morning then goes out to buy beer leaving them all to burn to death cause he is drunk and didn't remember to put a screen on the fire or even better not light a fire at all? Still, that's life eh? Anyway, apart from that it is a great film. Not as good as moonlight, but still a great film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2021,7/10,"All humans have regrets, and it's especially inevitable when there is a tragedy involved that could've been avoided. At least, that's what a regretful person is likely to think through: how they should've behaved in those past circumstances, and what their live should've been thereafter. This relentless rumination is what might make them live in their past, turning them into a shallow copy of themselves, a living zombie.In this very state the main character is presented at the beginning of the movie, when he's suddenly awakened by his brother's death and its consequences. He returns to the town of his former life, which confronts him with his both gruesome past and rather bothersome present.What appears the most fascinating about this work is the provincial atmosphere of the town itself - Manchester right near the sea - and its picturesque settings. Additionally, winter scenery reinforces the philosophy of the place, forcing their spectators into taking stock of their own regrets and past events.However, there's a conspicuous shortage of any other prominent happenings or characters in the film. Additionally, the protagonist himself is rather an annoyingly non-emotional individual, which is quite fair in his circumstances but doesn't make the whole action more interesting in the lack of other bright personalities. On the other hand, it might be perceived closer to realism: after all, this story is about common people's lives and tragedies as opposed to biographies of superstars or historical figures.In any event, as its name implies, the main character of the film seems to be that very Manchester by the Sea. The place itself and its inhabitants' tragedies give a great opportunity to get another perspective at one's own live to understand whether one is stuck in the past too, blaming and torturing oneself for it repeatedly, avoiding the reconciliation that the sea of one's destiny constantly washes ashore."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2020,9/10,"Casey Affleck nailed it
this is maybe his best acting till now"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 January 2017,9/10,"In spite of a most annoying & pretentious score, this was a very moving film--actually a mouth-gaping appreciation of Casey Affleck. He carries the film, along with the actor playing his brother, Michelle Williams, & his nephew. Some scenes early on seem to plod on, and the pivotal scene of Affleck's past (that will forever haunt him) is reconstructed by voice-over rather than __seeing__ the evidence, which becomes a little disconcerting, considering how important it is. I was really impressed by Affleck's character, who seemed incapable of enjoying anything in his life. His alcoholism is palpable, as well as his violence, but he plays a wholly realized character--infinitely better than he did in ""Gone Baby Gone."" I hope he wins an Oscar for this role: I've never seen him better. And Michelle Williams is wonderful, especially in a near-conclusion confrontation with Affleck: that alone is Oscar-worthy. It's beautifully shot in the actual Manchester-by-the-Sea, and it's definitely worth seeing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,10/10,"A melancholic yet uplifting movie was due a long time from Mr Lonergan. Since I had watched 'You can count on me', I was in awe of the movie and the director. It has been one of the reasons why I started loving movies so much. MBTS is YCCOM 2.0.Casey Affleck has played the role of his life, without using any boisterous dialogues he has conveyed a lot through body language and suppressed emotions. Real sadness is emanating from his character throughout the movie. Michelle Williams comes for not more than 3-4 scenes still gives a riveting performance which is totally worthy of an Oscar. She is one of the best actors alive and she has proved it again.The role played by the young Lucas Hedges is befitting and lends the narrative a modern and fresh look which could have been easily overdone and rendered tacky by another actor. The bonding or lack of bonding between the nephew and uncle is very different kind from what is expected still gives it an authentic feel. Kyle Chandler delivers a powerful performance and delineates the role of a strong, loving brother.It's a movie about how the meaning of the family is different for different people; for some it's superficial and shown off loudly and for other it's silent and sacrificial. Relationships can be formed and broken due to sudden tragic events but the true family members not only say but show that they got each others' back. Always."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 July 2020,7/10,"What I fear most is this kind of movie. After watching it, I can't tell anything, so I want to stay quietly and indulge in the lingering depression. The ending seemed to see light, and it seemed to have nothing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 December 2017,1/10,"It was a good story, but the scenes, the dialogue, the editing were just irritating. Everything in this movie was fragmented. Scenes started and ended abruptly. I became claustrophobic where I was subjected to be in the back seat of a car looking at the back of the drivers head. The conversations between Lee and Patrick were labored and unnecessary. I wanted to like this movie, but all the characters were irritating. I guess it was supposed to be ""moody"", but it was just ""boring"". I only watched it all because my wife heard it was a good movie. It was not."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 September 2017,9/10,"This 'slow' movie takes it's time to get to the core of the pain of LIFE, which is so deeply inside of us, that we don't even notice it, until it is touched. This movie is DRAMA, but if you go through it, even if it knocks you of your feet, it also has the old Greek way's of what them Greeks thought drama should be. It should purify the spectator, as they believed in, it should WORK. Here the drama DOES work and purify in some mysterious way. I totally believed the main character for having experienced all this.. and I will thank him for having taken the effort to get into this role so deeply. Of course he couldn't do without all the others..Thanks to them too. By the way, the music is wonderfully, and fits in perfectly."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 April 2017,10/10,"This is very good drama movie. This is a story of a family , uncle and nephew to be precise. When his brother died by a heart disease the uncle got the guardianship which was unintended by him. The movie also give background story of some sort to provide the information about the characters .Overall the movie is great but it is new level drama movie. So if you are not into drama the experience may be unpleasant otherwise the movie is really great , really calm and soothing.Warning - Very bad and cursing language is used , way too much often. They have used f-word ,like 1000 times . It could be a family movie if curse language was not used.But the movie is really great."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 July 2019,8/10,"It's a beautiful, quiet picture portraying trauma, guilt, redemption and bonds. This was a very moving film. It is deceptively simple with a powerful emotion at its core. Ben Affleck was superb. The film in a poignant way and approach explains the importance of family, community, sacrifice and adjusting to life after so much has been taken from a person. But it is not for all. You need to appreciate the melancholic art that is here in this movie. A regular free for all action fan would perhaps not like it - but a real film lover would."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 March 2017,3/10,"Casey Affleck is a very good actor, but this miserable movie could not be saved by anything including the cast's best efforts.Judging from the many glowing 8-10 star reviews of this movie, I can only conclude that when faced with a movie that has virtually nothing to recommend it, some critics must feel obligated to exert a great deal of effort and to find something in the movie or about the movie that not only redeems it, but elevates it to an ""Emeror's New Clothes"" type of praiseworthy status. I'll bet that this movie fades into a well-deserved obscurity faster than yesterday's prizewinning hotcakes.Awful, boring, pointless, tedious, frustrating, empty, a waste of time and of the efforts of the movies creators."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2017,6/10,"I had been anxiously waiting for this flick to be available to stream so I could watch it as I am one of those people who never goes to a movie theater. I scrutinize every single new movie out to see if it is worth seeing; reading reviews on IMDb, looking at critic reviews, specific genres, etc etc...Needless to say, ""Manchester By the Sea"" made the top of my watchlist.However, now that I spent two hours of my life that I can never get back, I am perplexed. Why? Why was/is this movie receiving such great reviews? As the viewer, what did I miss? Clearly I am missing SOMETHING. I dunno. Maybe you can watch it and come back and explain it to me? I don't get it.From start to finish, this is a hardcore drama..pitch black..with no silver lining. And being a very ""dark"" person myself, dramas are my favorite genre. The story line appears to be heading somewhere, yet never makes it there. Kudos for the acting; I thought Affleck and Williams were both on point and the story does keep you engaged. (My reason for giving it a ""6"") The next thing you know, the end credits are flashing across the screen and you're asking yourself: ""That's it?!?!?!""Perhaps if you watch it with no expectations and dismiss all the hype, you may not be as sadly disappointed as I was. It would make for a good Saturday afternoon ""Lifetime"" movie. Beyond that? Nope."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,8/10,"Kenneth Lonergan's latest film is an insightful study of how people deal with loss, grief and trauma. A very powerful movie indeed that aims to show us that love can be healing and hope is always present. The story is unfolded slowly and requires our patience, but by the time it's over, we realize that it has taught us many a lesson.Our main character is Lee (Casey Affleck), an ordinary working man who lives in Boston. At the beginning, he seems like a normal single man who carries his everyday job with no flaws, no complains and most notably, no smiles. Until someday, he learns that his brother is dead, which forces him to go back to his hometown, Manchester, Minnesota, and take care of his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges), whose mother has left the family. Meanwhile, we get to see flashbacks of Lee's former life in Manchester. There is a striking difference between the past and the present: Lee used to be happy. He had a wife (Michelle Williams), three children, his friends, his brother. So what happened? Well, a tragic mistake has cost him everything and continues to haunt him. Combined with all the memories he has to face in his hometown now, Lee is a wreck. Surprisingly, what seems to be a heavy burden, becomes his salvation. Lee is reluctant to become Patrick's guardian, but as it turns out, their relationship becomes his redemption. It seems that he has forgotten how it is to care for someone. It seems that he has finally a reason to live, something that he lacked for some time. He is not expressive, not at all. However, you can see that his life with Patrick does him good. It is obvious when in the last scene he does something he hasn't done in quite a while: he smiles. Not just a smirk or a movement of his lips, but a true, heartfelt smile.The film is powerful and filled with emotion and it's impressive how Kenneth Lonergan can transmit so many feelings through a character so self-contained. Casey Affleck delivers the performance of his life with the rest of the cast doing an excellent job as well. What I loved the most was how beautiful the picture was both visually and aurally. I was surprised when I noticed that although the film was nominated for a lot of awards, it got no nominations for the score apart from a Satellite award. I hope that next month's Oscars will not overlook it. If there is something missing from Manchester by the Sea, it is a climax. Every scene seems like another day in the life, nothing too memorable. This is the only drawback (if you can call it a drawback) I could note. I'm afraid this may result in the film being forgotten in the near future, so you'd better go watch it now.More reviews at https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2017,9/10,"The story of a guy who could live next door to any of us. He parties with his mates, much to the annoyance of his wife but always puts his family first. He loves his family but likes to let his hair down. When tragedy occurs it is sharp and painful. Blame is easy to apportion, from everybody's point of view but it is not clear cut. He takes it all upon himself, moves to a new place with a shitty job and retreats to a life of solitude. When his brother dies and he is called back to the scene to look after his nephew, questions are asked as to whether he can put the past behind him for his brother/nephew's sake. People remember him and the tragedy that befell his family. He meets with his ex-wife, a couple of times (I cried at the second meeting) but again he carries the can. Will he pull through for his nephew? Can he put the past behind him? A strange film. It builds on what seems nothing but is ultimately engrossing. The lives of real people and the different ways we react to events in our lives. All of it believable. Each character could be real and you could know from your own life.I haven't mentioned direction, lighting, acting.... this is because when things feel this close to home all these factors become secondary. It is all about story and realism, which this film has in Spades."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,9/10,"I find it challenging to review a movie nominated for numerous awards, including an Oscar. It is even more difficult to recommend against seeing it despite my agreement with critics that it is an outstanding film. Let me explain.The story is about a custodian (Casey Affleck) living in Manchester who grapples with many family crises, including tragedies and a stormy relationship with his nephew, brilliantly played by Lucas Hedges. Other characters like wife Michelle Phillips and minor characters are fully fleshed out, smoothly integrated into the story and equally praiseworthy.Casey Affleck is outstanding in the lead role, but is overshadowed by Lucas Hedges, playing his nephew. He portrays the complexities and mood swings we attribute to teenagers growing up. Nonetheless, I did not find Manchester enjoyable, despite the wonderful performances and panoramic shots of the Manchester/Boston landscape. The story is not only bleak, but also Dystopian, a reflection perhaps of the times we live in. There are fires, deaths, custody battles, funerals, fights, family disputes, and characters with borderline emotional problems.Casey Affleck, featured in almost every scene, is moody, prone to violence and unhappy. He speaks sparingly in short monotone phrases, and displays body language that projects isolation and alienation. His nephew shows similar tendencies, but is wordier. (The characters have trouble enjoying even everyday tasks like eating or watching TV.) Neither person is one I would like to befriend.This melancholy would be more palatable if balanced with at least some moments of joy, people smiling or laughing, or being happily engaged in their work, marriage or relationships. Alas, that is not the case. Am I too harsh, or are lives as joyless and stressful as those of these characters? To sum up, Manchester deserves its acclaim. I do not regret seeing it, but it left me with an empty, dare I say depressed, feeling about people."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 May 2019,1/10,"I honestly fail to grasp why anyone would would want to confront their audience with a relentless and uncompromising torrent of sadness and depression like this movie.
The film is well made, which only makes it worse.
I wish this film didn't exist. I am angry."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 April 2017,6/10,"I think best comedy of the year should go to all the Hollywood awards people and critics. They managed to pull off the biggest pranks in awards history. First they hit me with ""Moonlight"" and now this. At least Manchester is slightly more watchable. Neither are even near Oscar material in my opinion.Both Affleck and Ali did not deserve to win Oscars too. Not that they are bad actors, in fact I like them, but these two movies simply did not give them enough material to justify it. Sorry for doing two reviews in one, but I didn't want to waste more time on such mediocrity passing off as high art."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 September 2018,2/10,"After suffering through Manchester By The Sea, on blu-ray, in our living room last night, along with my wife, and our friend, a likely explanation occurred to me which may account for why many critics just lost all perspective, as they heaped more and more raves upon this movie.
Because most professional movie reviewers must sit through so many brainless, non-stop action flicks, as well as absurd superhero movies, that any relatively quiet drama, though it may wallow in the slow tedium and pain of the mostly dull and plotless lives that so many people lead, actually comes as a welcome type of relief, to certain movie reviewers who are exhausted from having their ears constantly assaulted by the loud sound effects present in big budget action flicks, that often contain little intelligence to compensate for the high volume chaos.Of course, I really enjoy a smartly written, and even witty, action movie like 1993's The Fugitive, with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The Fugitive actually deserved having been included among the only 5 films that were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar for movies released in 1993. Of course, instead of The Fugitive, it was Schindler's List that ended up getting 1993's Best Picture Oscar. And to me, it's awfully hard to disagree with that choice, because as a drama that says a lot about the pain, evil, and ultimate tragedy involving human beings from the individual, personal level, up to the experiences endured by a large group of people, Schindler's List is a powerful drama that is not only far more enlightening about the human condition than the one note drama presented in Manchester By The Sea, but in spite of it's grim subject matter, Schindler's List actually seems shorter than ""Manchester"", although it is about 55 minutes longer than the film about a depressed alcoholic who becomes his nephew's guardian. 
Actually, the fact that a movie containing such stark scenes of human depravity and suffering, as presented in Schindler's List, can still present us with a film that hardly seems much more than 2 hours in length, to many viewers, though the movie is actually more than 3 hours and 9 minutes long, is evidence of Steven Spielberg's terrific directorial skill, which tremendously dwarfs the directorial skill that's indicated by a 1 note film, like Manchester By The Sea, being a result of it.
BTW, the 2 stars that I gave to ""Manchester"", are not only for it having some nice cinematography, and a few good performances, but also to give some credit to Mr Affleck for having almost super-human patience in being able to continually go on in portraying such a constantly dreary, depressed character, all throughout the many days of filming that Affleck had a camera and microphone focusing on him."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 October 2019,6/10,I was hoping for a happy ending .. if you are having a bad day don't watch it or if you're depressed
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2020,9/10,"This film is truly a masterpiece. An incredibly powerful portrayal of grief and loss. Casey Affleck truly joins the ranks of the acting giants in this film like DeNiro in Raging Bull, Pacino in The Godfather Part II and Nicholson in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
As the film slowly peels back layers into Casey Affleck's character you get the felling that something has happened in his past but nothing can prepare you for the revelation half way through the film. It is a sucker punch to the gut unlike anyting I have seen in a film.
I was so effected by this film and the amazing heartfelt performances. There is not a scene or a line of dialogue that feels out of place or false. Michelle Williams is also excellent. One of the most moving films you will ever see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,9/10,"Alright since i saw hacksaw ridge and i can't get Andrew Garfield's performance from my head and i was about to hate Casey Affleck just cause he is going to win the Oscar for Manchester by the sea until then i said both deserve it they are both the same i wont be angry and i won't hate him cause he was the best thing in the entire movie he was persuasive in his acting so as all of the cast of the film I'm OK if Michelle Williams won for best supporting actress she is the second best although she didn't appear a lot,Lucas hedges was great in the film , lets speak about the problems the screenplay was frothy in scenes it shouldn't be, and the editing was choppy the scenes just cut off in the middle of the scene i cant know if it's just for the bluray extended edition or Kenneth Lonergan was lazy to complete scenes It will Be A Shock If It Won Best Screenplay Other than that it was great that i teared at some scenes it never happens with me my rating is worth watching and worth buying on Blue ray or DVD and my score is 9/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 July 2018,7/10,"A film about the story of ordinary people in the most ordinary, quiet and beautiful town. Everything is good: from actors, to camera work. If you are willing to give enough time to watch a slow story, then this movie is for you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 November 2021,6/10,"So I really like Casey Affleck and I love his style, his voice, his way of hiding his intensity until it suddenly bursts out in the open. In this movie there are more talented actors. The 16-year old boy is well played. I would like even more scenes between Affleck and his ex, they are both so incredibly gifted actors. The story is good and credible and heartbreaking, yet with glimpses of hope. Yes I would recommend a watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 October 2020,8/10,Highly recommended a movie with a very good message unbeatable performances
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 November 2016,3/10,"This movie works as an effective instruction video for dealing with the practicalities after someone close to you die. If you've ever been in contact with an experience like that, you will be very much reminded by watching this movie. Thanks to that, me and my husband had an awful night out at Stockholm film festival. Funeral music in the background, and a story which is downright sad and tragic. Hospital and morgue visits, lawyers visits, funeral parlor visits, funerals, sad pub visits with sad drinking and lots of built up grief and aggression. A movie about a man who has lost almost everything and, understandably, fails to deal with it. The relatively positive element of the relationship between the uncle and the nephew fails to compensate adequately for the total amount of darkness in this story. The acting is good and the story and the reactions of the actors are all very realistic, but as a movie experience it failed to entice me, and I was rather annoyed instead of my ruined night out. This is of course much down to expectations. Manchester by the sea should really come with a worming sign, saying one of the most depressing movies ever made."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 December 2016,6/10,"Based on the reviews that I read, there have been few films that I have looked forward to any more than this one and then have been so disappointed in. It was showing in only three theaters in the Seattle area and I had to drive quite a distance to see it. I remember You Can Count on Me and, despite how long ago it was, I recall it as being among the best films I have ever seen. But this one left me cold and I could not wait for it to be over. There was nothing particularly original about the plot. The fact that it was about such a serious subject as profound grief and its effect on an individual does not automatically make for a good movie. Neither was I as blown away by Casey Affleck's acting as others so seem to be. This is more a reflection on the limitations of the role than on his acting skills. After leaving the theater and chatting with a few others who had seen the movie, I found none that were particularly enthusiastic about it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2020,6/10,"Before anything, I consider it an important point to mention something: This movie is not applied to all types of moviegoers. I'm a type of crazy-about-plot person and this movie doesn't live up to my expectations in that point.
Central to the plot is the story of a depressed man who becomes responsible to take care of his nephew for his brother's death. Personally speaking, the story is not of a kind that would hit home, nevertheless without the use of over-actions or a commercially star stubbed cast, we are given ALMOST all that could be asked for in a movie. Though not being of a fast-paced plot or twists, it offers us the most realistic story. It's not a movie without hope, but the hope that does emerge as it winds down is realistic, mute and believable.
Without any intention, the cast is mediocre , except the phenomenal performance by Casey Affleck. His touching performance makes you think of him to be in the wrong place as other actors seem to be kind of miscast!
Regarding soundtracks, in spite of being some famous classical artworks, the smart usage of them in right places has made this movie utilize to its most potential. It was one of the points that hit me off and aroused my interest right away.
To sum up, touching and emotional certainly it is, it might turn a little sentimental at times. However, as I've already mentioned, it mostly depends on your taste of movies and as a general view, it is a must see."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 January 2017,8/10,"This is not a movie for everyone. The critical acclaim would suggest otherwise. This is one of those times when following the critics will let some of us down. The soundtrack breaks in jarringly, at the wrong time? Over and over.. Also, opposite of that, a lot of the scenes are the ""no background music"" type, and they are like watching normal everyday people - boring everyday people - go about their business. Then it shows ""out the moving car window"" scenery over and over... If you like road trips AND are familiar with where it was filmed, that's awesome as H E Double Toothpicks. 95.9999% of us do not know where it is. Lots of moviegoers won't care for it, overall. I did, through the flaws, with little problem. The acting, from EVERYONE, along with the underlying story, once revealed, redeem this movie. How many Actors (Male) do an Oscar-caliber, or almost Oscar-caliber job of emotionally exploding and breaking stuff, then maybe a tear or two, etc. Casey Affleck takes that, and without even saying a word, or breaking any objects or whatever, elevates it to the stratosphere. Amazing. If he does not win the Oscar, then we moviegoers got extremely lucky with some other incredible Male Lead performance to enjoy at the movies this Year!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 December 2016,6/10,"This is written for people who have already seen the film. Holding the audience captive in suspense as to what is the dark beyond in the main character's life does nothing. It slows down the movie and makes it tedious. When writers contrive these flashback-to-present scenes, it has to have a big payoff, or what's the point? In general, telling this story mostly chronologically would have served the pacing and sense of the film much better. After an hour or so into the film we finally know 'what happened' and finally we can really just watch the movie. The movie is about how a guy recovers from a tragedy by facing the prospect of becoming his nephew's guardian. But you don't get to be in on that until it's almost too late. It's stupid. The relationship between the uncle and nephew does turn out to be quite interesting and worth watching once you get there. Before then it's a conceptual writer's device to jump back and forth in time to somehow make the movie more suspenseful or something. Once the tragedy is revealed the movie becomes much more cohesive and for me, a pleasure to watch. Overall I think it is good, it's just perplexing as to why writers go to such great lengths to invent concepts that don't serve to tell the story well. Being artistic is mistaken for contriving conception. Oh well. It's still pretty good, with solid acting compensating for writer/director ego."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 July 2019,3/10,"Let's start with the obvious, Casey Affleck is the king of mumblecore and unsurpassed when it comes to an Average Joe crumbling under the weight of a tragedy (unfortunately, the 'tragedy' sucks, but more about that later). Michelle Williams is amazing, as always, and you even believe her as a working class mother (she played Marilyn Monroe once, FYI). The great Kyle Chandler is totally wasted in a tiny role that could have been played by anybody (literally, anybody).What brings down this movie is the story and, above all, the character of the son played by Lucas Hedges. I mean, think about it: his dad just died, and this dolt is just smirking/grinning through the proceedings (no, really, watch the movie again and you'll notice he's literally smiling like an idiot half the time). He's bedding two girls (who don't know about each other ... what a prince!), has a band, and in general skates through life. WTF? I felt zero sympathy for his plight because he didn't seem to *have* a plight. Like he couldn't care less. Honestly, the movie would have been 100% better if it was the son who got hit by a dumpster truck and we could see Kyle Chandler dealing with the loss (just imagine!)The other terrible plot point is the 'tragedy' of Casey Affleck killing his kids accidentally (because he was drunk). Why? Why couldn't their marriage just deteriorate because of his drinking and financial troubles? Wouldn't it have been a more grown up movie? Killing kids is a cheap, easy high to get tears. Like smoking crack. It's so heavy-handed that you're pulled out of the movie: it doesn't feel real. It feels like a plot device (which it is).A terrific cast, wasted."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2017,8/10,"What makes this movie so special ? Ben Aflack primarily, of course. But first-it's the story-line. It's so very somber, and realistically so, from start to finish ! Ben provides that vibe, he reeks of melancholy and displays that whole spectrum of sadness, vividly,he is not acting in this performance, which makes it so outstanding. The supporting cast are PERFECT. How often does that happen ? And, remarkably, after 2 hours..I wanted another 2 hours! We the people demand a sequel..and soon. Tell me if you don't agree! Of course that would be OK, it would not spoil the uniqueness and tone of the first Movie..let's leave that alone. But..the next one..or one after?, is going to be a different ending. What do you think.. SWEET ...or Sour ending in the sequels ?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,7/10,"FYI, this review will contain spoilers, so please don't read it if that's an issue.The biggest problem with this film, for me, is that the people in it are LOSERS. This was really punctuated in one of the final scenes, where young nephew Patrick says ""I'm not going to college"" and no one objects.Likewise, lead character Lee, who ""Wikipedia"" describes as ""mild-mannered,"" actually gets into bar fights for no reason whenever he gets a chance. And his lifetime dream seems to be, being a janitor with responsibility for LESS buildings.I didn't get his reluctance to retire young and live in Manchester by the Sea for a few years, but apparently, he was so traumatized by killing his first family there (in a flashback house fire) that he can't stand the place. I did NOT get this from the film - just that he didn't want to be responsible for his nephew.There is one shocking scene of absolute brilliance in the middle of the film, but it lasts barely 15 seconds, and towards the end, there is one tiny part where the characters, who have spent the whole movie working against each other, find a tiny moment of cooperation.I've got nothing against slow Casey Affleck films - in fact ""Gerry"" is one of my favorite movies! And this honestly wasn't a bad movie. But it wasn't a great movie either, and if you make a movie with so little happening, you really need to make it great or you've made nothing at all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 November 2016,7/10,"There have been many great movies about personal tragedy and the difficulties involved in facing them. One must take special note of the films of Ingmar Bergman and Yasujiro Ozu as masters of this genre. Kenneth Lonegran, who directed this film, can only aspire to their mastery and this film, which is currently rated 8.6 by IMDb viewers certainly is not worthy of a rating higher than Citizen Kane (The highest rated movie of all time according to AFI).It is, quite simply, a good movie with many flaws. The two most noticeable are first the abrupt and poorly demarcated flashbacks. And second is the over wrought musical score drawn from classical music. Most notably, the use of the Adagio attributed to Albinoni (a contemporary of Bach who never wrote this kind of treacle) but actually written by Remo Giazotto - his 20th century biographer. Modern Italians certainly know how to pour it on, emotionally, in their music as you can also observe in the film Cinema Paradiso - another good movie rated an astonishing 8.5 on IMDb. The problem is, using tragic music to supplement the emotional content of a movie does not make it better or more important.To be clear, this movie was well acted and has a good plot line. However, even apart from the technical flaws mentioned above, it is not great because it fails to open a new dimension for us. There are many tragedies that are quite compelling which happen every day, most especially parents who lose their children to war. This kind of tragedy is played out in film and in ""real life"". When it is, we find it familiar. This films tragedy is also familiar. But great films give us much more. Films like Le Grande Illusion show us tragedy in a way that is unique and that makes it monumental even without the need for special musical support. These great works are worthy of being seen again and again as, each time, we absorb their full intent and the brilliant yet subtle ways this is communicated. This is not such a film. It is worth seeing, once."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 April 2018,9/10,"So many people are talking about the movie's lack of ability to portray the loss of the people you love. This isn't what this move is about. If you want to see a movie that depicts loss well then please don't watch this movie- because although that is one of its themes, the main theme that this movie is about is regret.As you can tell when Casey Affleck's character forgets to put the screen on the fireplace, therefore causing the entire house to burn down, the movie portrays the inevitable mistakes that we make through life and the process of flipping the blame from entirely ourselves (Casey tries to kill himself) to understanding that loss is everywhere and somewhat of a random, natural process. We can see this point of acceptance when Casey talks to his former wife and she tells him that it wasn't his fault. Casey simply says ""no"" but he knows that deep inside it really isn't his fault anymore. He's accepted that sometimes our mistakes are just a natural process of who we are, no matter how large or small.Now he needs to live with mistake over his shoulder, and instead of killing himself he's found redemption in helping his nephew buy a new motor for his boat, and helping him settle in after the death of his father.It's a great metaphor about regret and the ability to eventually overcome."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 July 2018,3/10,"This movie has an authenticity to it that is one of its leading strengths. It's also why it's so dreadfully boring.Casey Afleck does give a performance of a lifetime. In fact, the whole cast is pretty rock solid overall.This movie is just so boring to watch that I felt like clawing my eyes out would be more entertaining."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 December 2017,8/10,"For starters, Manchester by the Sea is the saddest movie I have ever seen. From the onset of the beautiful and uniquely filmed New England scenery with incredible music throughout, the viewer is taken on some very personal and very intense emotional journeys throughout. What set Manchester apart for me was how real it all seemed. I felt as if I were involved in every scene watching a broken man go through life, certain relationships build and crumble, mixed in with the ups and downs of life in this world. As Red stated in The Shawshank Redemption, ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin."" In Manchester by the Sea, we start to see what Red means. Casey Affleck is fantastic in this. I believed in his character from the beginning and it never faltered once for me. His relationship with his brother's son is critical, and the film does an excellent job showing the subtleties of love, connection, raw emotion, heartbreak and loss in the context of film and life. I also thought the film did an excellent job portraying living conditions in highly impoverished areas of Boston and the northeast. Some work two, three jobs for minimal pay, missed opportunities, minimal returns and more. It made me really sad seeing just how hard some people have it in this world. It is important to show compassion for others because you never truly know what certain people are going through, and you never know who can save them along the way."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 March 2017,4/10,"A few random thoughts, not very well expressed .....My gosh, if this wasn't the most tedious film I've seen in a while. Nicely filmed and edited but filled with overly long and lingering-too-long scenes, not to mention completely unnecessary (we had already established that he was troubled) ones, this film is the antithesis of cinematic economy.Then there was the extreme over-use of flashbacks throughout the film. The back and forth in time thing has been done to death now and maybe ""Manchester"" was the peak of this technique. Having snow/no snow on the ground helped to figure out where the heck you were.Surprise punching people really hard in the mouth (yea, I know, he was troubled) doesn't do anything to gain your main character sympathy with the viewer (which the story needed because there was virtually nothing positive to latch on to), especially when you stand around looking morose and mumbling for the entire movie.The cause of his angst -- learned well into the film -- was a pretty big downer especially since the rest of the movie up to that point was so darn tedious and oppressive. This movie tried way too hard to be like real life and not a movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 May 2020,6/10,"The pain caused by the unmemorable past does not necessarily destroy a person completely, but makes him indifferent and seem to stay out of the situation, but he can never get rid of it completely. No one sees this decadent repairman named Lee as himself, but how many people have experienced a heartbreaking moment and then hide all the scars and live as usual. What we see is just their ""most normal"" appearance."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 March 2021,4/10,"I don't see the point of this movie.
Does the producer or script writer want to show you how bad life can be so that you can feel a little better with your life? I can do even better. At the age of 36 I lost my wife and I was left alone with, thankfully, 2 children aged 3 and 6y. Lost my sister at 41 and my youngest when he was 22 He attended college for a masters degree. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Still, I still have good friends and so I stay social. Therefor .... Forget those depressing movies"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 February 2017,3/10,"I started to watch this movie with big hopes... and I insisted to watch it for over 45 boring minutes. And I just can't stop asking myself, where from those high ratings (at IMDb) come? Or maybe it's because I'm from Europe, not understanding how people live and act over the pond?... how they cope with death in family? I ask, because whole 'drama' in this movie is highly unnatural and relationships unreal. Not to mention, that so many ""f*ck you"" just has no place in such story -I assume script writer ran out of ideas on many places. C.Affleck is.. as he is in most movies: in bad mood, thinking about something all the time, asocial. For the rest of the cast, I already forgot them. ""Masterpiece"", huh? I would give it 1 star out of 10, but because I suffered only first 45 minutes, I give it 3."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 January 2017,3/10,"""Manchester-By-The-Sea""...don't bother...wait for twenty years until it comes out on an old time movie channel at around 2 am and you need something to put you to sleep. The script is bad. The direction is bad. The make-up is bad. The sets are bad. The costumes are fine, because they are everyday clothes of working class people in the Northeast (Boston and other areas). I found Casey Affleck's performance to be the only redeeming quality in this overrated piece of digital media. He (Affleck) portrays a brooding, jack-ass, violent, bully of an alcoholic very accurately...almost as if he were one or was a another victim of the Hollywood hamburger machine(I applaud him..not standing ""O,"" but polite applause because everything else in the movie was BORING). About that corpse (yes, there's a corpse in one scene): Not a corpse. Not a dead human look-a-like...but a live person trying to pull it off. It doesn't work. How was this evident? The cheeks and face were still naturally pink and flesh tone. There was a popping vein near the temple area. Really? Did you studio execs really think no one who would see this ""movie"" would have seen a real corpse? Come on. If you have seen dysfunctional, violent alcoholics who attack people in bars who they think are staring at them, or are smaller than the drunk, and families who have a hard time handling ""life,"" in real life, you have seen this movie. Three stars because of Affleck's performance. Zero for the movie as a whole."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,6/10,"Not quite a waste of time, per se; as a lifelong Bostonian/New Englander,etc.I do enjoy these peeks into the Affleck version of surly New England narratives, as a bit of nostalgia, sights, sounds, and accents that sometimes even succeed at making me homesick when I'm away. But this could have been so much more. The plot was intriguing, the actors were adequate, and the atmosphere was heavy, but ultimately, it didn't deliver the gut punch or epiphany I wanted, despite a few viscerally touching scenes. It felt a bit hollow if you take out that reoccurring, central character in these kinds of films: New England itself. Sometimes filmmakers rely on their interpretation of ""place"" a bit too heavily, at the expense of story-telling and filmmaking skills in general, and I think Manchester is a victim of such gimmicks. Another thing that bugged me: the music. While finely curated as a soundtrack, the organ and choir numbers made potentially dark and somber scenes feel more than a little heavy-handed and completely distracting. Several other curious choices, without giving away too much. In all, I'm still happy I watched the film; it just could have reached higher heights, and given the hype, it didn't approach my expectations."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 April 2020,7/10,It's a solid drama. I had dark clouds over me the whole movie.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,7/10,"Okay, okay. Everyone* adores it. Considers it a masterpiece. Well, yes, it is understated and extraordinarily muted in its portrayal of a tragedy-marred life of its main character (Affleck) who mainly acts as if on heavy sedation then bursts into short fits of rage. I *get that a subdued and underplayed emotionally-traumatized portrayal is likely a huge accomplishment, but not my cup of tea. It was like living with someone suffering severe depression *in reality, and not being able to interact. Frustrating, though you empathize. **And then it ends. Suddenly**. Not my pick for BEst film of the Year, nor best performance. We shall see. Yes. fine acting. But ugh."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 June 2017,9/10,"A depressed janitor grieving about his former life losses named Lee, played by Casey Affleck, is made the legal guardian of his son Patrick. He is forced to try and act as a father while dealing with his horrible past. This drama's story seems simple and used; however, Manchester by the Sea soon becomes far different than anything that has come before it. Kenneth Lonergan delivers an excellent drama filled with fleshed-out characters, like Lee and Patrick, that the audience can get invested in. When Lee grieves, the audience grieves for him. It also helps that Casey Affleck gives the best performance of his career, solidifying his role as one of the best actors working today. The film really takes its time to set up the characters, who in turn propel the movie forward. Kenneth Lonergan does an excellent job making the film feel very grounded and realistic, as you believe these events are occurring in real time. I have not seen many films like Manchester by the Sea in years. Definitely recommended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 August 2019,,Great cast! Expertly acted. A beautiful movie about moving on from loss. Something different!
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 June 2021,10/10,"It's a very well executed drama. The comedy style mixed with serious emotional subjects took a bit if getting used to. But, it delivers."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 October 2021,9/10,"This is such a powerful movie that after years of watching, some of the scenes and dialogues still come to me. There was an unthinkable tragedy making it suffocating throughout, reminding the viewers of the pure pain life could bring - even with the most innocent and tynist mistake, or oversight. No one is close to perfect, but has to bear the weight falling upon, often uncalled for.There are many motivational stories, but as many other times, have you been there - ""I can't beat it"", which deserve repeating - ""I can't beat it"". Does it even matter if ""I am sorry""? Yet then life goes on, somehow most will manage, compromise and move on. We don't have to beat everything after all.Love the movie and bravo to Casey Affleck's acting. The blinking of tear in his eye when hugging Williams at the funeral, the unspoken thousands of words in his eyes... That Oscar was well deserved.Simply powerful."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 July 2017,4/10,"Whilst I appreciate that this film is emotionally raw, it was so depressing for so long that I just found it generally depressing rather than absorbing. Its like watching something you know is good because you've been told how worthy it is, and yet the experience itself left something to be desired. I found the "" street scenes"" annoying - whilst no doubt having people interacting in a "" real fashion "" is very truthful - in practise I couldn't follow a word that was said a lot of the time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 December 2016,3/10,"These days no movie should be over two hours, especially when it has nothing to say. Tragedy followed by more tragedy followed by some slice of life supposed comic relief followed by one scene with Michelle Williams followed by what you think should be the conclusion, but no it keeps going. Don't do it. Go spend time with your in-laws, go to Walmart, get on the 405 during rush hour traffic, go pick up the dog poop around your neighborhood. Spare yourself the pain of sitting through this. Lastly, is Michelle Williams' one scene really that worthy of a Golden Globe nomination or is the nomination merely a reflection of the paucity of women's roles? Mind you I love her but come on. And the score...in this kind of movie you'd expect at least a little subtlety, but when you get an ultra extended remix of Albinoni's Adagio during an especially ""sad"" montage and the uppity ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"" when the story is supposed to give you a little hope you know the Emperor is as naked as can be."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,4/10,"MINOR SPOILERSLike Remains of the Day, this movie has a lot of great acting, but ultimately it's entirely depressing. In Remains of the Day, the main character was emotionally stunted and in this movie the main character is emotionally damaged. So you get to see the damage and how it occurred and how he can't get over it and that's about it. The music is very depressing, also. I thought this was going to be much better, so basically I wasted my time and money, but fortunately it wasn't much money. I won't be recommending this movie to anyone."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 November 2018,1/10,Completely depressing and slow. This may be one of the slowest most depressing movies I've ever seen. Casey AFLAC's character is Frustrating. Couldn't even finish the movie and couldn't wait to turn it off. Thank God I didn't have a gun around I probably would've shot myself LOL
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 September 2020,9/10,One of the most powerful stories i ve ever seen and the realness of it. Must watch but i need to warn you if you in depression or something or going through a tough time just skip it for now. Its like sadness and depression comes to life and turned in to a 2 hour movie to see us whenever we want such a brilliant work. When you watch it you gonna understand if you can relate to some thing that is going on through the movie.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 March 2017,9/10,"Manchester By The Sea drives its audiences to a heartbreaking story of loss and acceptance while pretending that everything's OK.The concept of its story is something that isn't new to our eyes, we've seen several films who dealt with something or someone they've lost, but Director Lonergan separates this film from being formulaic by maintaining its slow-paced tone instead of going for a melodramatic approach.Affleck's shaky voice and bored eyes adds up to his convincing performance, making it look like an artless charm, a look on his face that defines all the problems he's been through, waiting to be ignited, Lee is the personification of a man lost and doesn't want to be found, a man decided to mourn his entire life.Patrick, Lee's nephew, played by Lucas Hedges, represents the innocence and irresponsibility of most teenagers, the way of living their life in the riskiest way, their lack of understanding of other people's life, where they would think that their demands are the one to be followed.When Lee (Casey Affleck) learned about the tragedy, just after he goes back from buying groceries, we see that he didn't cried out loud, he didn't forced his tears just because he heard the bad news, instead what we saw is an actual state of shock, reactions where you'll somehow be paralyzed, no words, just pure heartbreak. This is the film's moment and Affleck is just outstanding.Another emotional sequence is when Lee abruptly stole one of the police's gun and tried to kill himself, and the look on his face when he realized that he didn't charge the gun yet, its a look of someone who's already decided to end everything.Manchester By The Sea also reminds us that it's not every time that the man will overcome his sadness faster than women. As what was shown, when Lee received a call from her ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams) about her new life, her new husband and baby, he stuttered, words gone missing, unable to respond to his past.Now, before you brand someone as bitter, make sure you know where they are coming from, why they preferred to be isolated, why they see life different from you, because their silence speaks a thousand words, their eyes flooded with tears and their hearts are pounded into pieces and is forever lost in the abyss and only a few can get out of the trap of depression once they're imprisoned on it, doesn't matter if its the man or the woman, let's just then be considerate."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 December 2016,3/10,"Well another 60 minute movie in a 2 plus hour FILM! I am starting to think there is a fundamental sea change kind of thing happening, where movie makers confuse elapsed time with increased drama. It is a good story. It is presented clearly.I think several scenes could easily have been cut and LESS IS MORE.Oh well, my wife like it. I think.The thing is, several acquaintances said ""Way awesome"" ""Oscar contender"" ""Must see"" ""Best ever"".Maybe. But that only detracts from the quality of really good movies.This is no Forest Gump."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 December 2020,6/10,"This is one of those movies I wanted to like but at the end it failed to hit its mark.The problem is with the central character Lee. He was never a great husband or father, but after losing his three kids in a house fire he just falls to pieces. His marriage fails and he escapes the small town environment of Manchester by moving to Boston and taking an anonymous job as a janitor. And there his life just stagnates.The somewhat expected death of his brother from congestive heart failure is supposed to be the catalyst for change. He discovers his brother has left Lee with guardianship of his son Patrick. Teen-aged Patrick is well-played by Lucas Hedges. Like all teenagers he's completely self-absorbed in his grief. For most of the movie he can't understand that being in Manchester exposes Lee to tragic memories, and to top it off none of the townspeople like Lee or will give him a job. He only sees it as Lee trying to move him away from everything he knows in Manchester.But Lee does temporarily move to Manchester, which we expect will force him to face his demons eventually. And here the movie fails. Lee goes through various emotional events in a fog. He turns down every opportunity to connect with other people, even with Patrick for most of the picture. At most by the end of the picture Lee is about where he started before he lost his kids, a failing husband who wasn't much of a parent. About the only self-awareness Lee gets is that maybe he shouldn't be in a relationship with anybody. He heads back to Boston where you get the feeling that he will once again fade into anonymity and even his weak connection with Patrick will eventually break.There is an unintentionally humorous subplot in Lee allowing himself to be roped into driving Patrick to various booty calls with his two girlfriends with the full knowledge of Lee and the girls' mothers. Don't these parents have any self-respect? Lee and the girls' mothers are shown to be lonely themselves, are they living through their kids romances? Or are they just automatons conditioned by years of driving their kids to playdates? Patrick whines about not being treated as an adult, yet he expects Lee to make his love life possible.I used to think that Casey Affleck was one of our most underappreciated actors. But watching ""Gone Baby Gone"" and this movie back to back I'm not so sure. He's definitely a master of the flat, unemotional character. But truly great actors can play many roles and I'm just not convinced that Affleck qualifies here. I even wonder if he's like that in real life."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 May 2020,4/10,Casey creates a flat character that goes nowhere but down. He is not interested in his brothers son whatsoever. Crappy jobs in other states seem to be his only interest.. that and fighting the world or anyone who looks at him. The son does not have any empathy for this dead dad.. except for fridges. The director shoves music in between scenes of talking.. which is all about everyone talking at the same time.. with dogs or babies crying at the same time. Wow. Never want to see it again. -
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 March 2017,4/10,"I typically find that, for my tastes, IMDb reviews align pretty well to my opinion of movies. This time they missed by a country mile.This movie was an utter waste of 2 hours of my life. The reason has everything to do with the script / story. The movie is about a man who goes through a tragedy and can't let it go. It robs him of happiness, and even when faced with this truth he just accepts his past as his only option. Then the movie ends.When the movie ended, my wife and I looked at each other with stunned looks like ... What just happened here? You mean, that's it? This is how this long, slow, unentertaining movie concludes itself? This the Oscar winning performance and movie that folks raved over and praised? I found this movie to be slow, uninspiring and difficult to connect to any of the main characters. It was an utter waste of time and not even remotely close to an Oscar piece."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,9/10,"You'll read some IMDb reviews on this movie that will criticize it for its length. Or its originality. Or both. They say it could have been cut down. Or that there were unnecessary scenes.First, I think the movie is unique. The protagonist is profoundly emotionally crippled. So much so that he can barely react to people in a normal way. This is evident from the start of the movie. Right there, I think this movie is unique, and I can't think of another in which the main character is at a dead end from the beginning of the movie.More importantly, the movie has to leave you all sorts of clues as to the nature of his plight. I suppose you could reduce any novel to just a few sentences, or a symphony to just one movement, but the part of the movie that is not summarily discarded is part of getting to the point, instead of just giving you the point which would seem shallow, forced, and ultimately hollow. There is a journey that takes place during the movie, despite the harsh conditions. But it comes about subtly. Take your time with it, and I think you will be amply rewarded, just as the industry, the critics, and many in the public have been rewarded by this creation."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,1/10,"Wow... the ONLY reason I had for renting this stinker were all the rave reviews by ""so- called"" critics, and the many award nominations. Up front, I admit to not finishing this movie... because I was so bored and disinterested at the 1hr45min point. I did read the IMDb synopsis to see what I missed, which was evidently NOTHING.The movie started slow, then never gained momentum. The acting by the two main characters was utterly wooden, boring and depressing. I had absolutely no respect for either of them for their self-centric, self-absorbed attitudes and generally rotten treatment of others in their lives. The story utterly never climaxed at all... with no payoff whatsoever for having endured over two hours of depressing, BORING performance.Why so much ""love"" for Casey Affleck by the critics? He was OK in ""Their Finest Hours"" but, after this I'll be steering clear of his films in the future since he is obviously the critic's darling right now- totally overrated.My advice- if you aren't liking this movie within the first 70 minutes, dump it because it doesn't get better and you ain't missing anything."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,9/10,"I have seen a few reviews being harsh about the structure and content of this film – I wondered how many of them had been luckily enough never too have felt real grief or regret. As someone who has had to deal with significant lost on several occasions, there were many scenes when I found myself genuinely moved. It was often the scenes where Casey Affleck performed less or said nothing that really captured the feeling of grief.In time of trouble and loss it's often that someone can become insular and feel that your alone in the world. The film captures this brilliantly and like De Niro in the early years, Affleck pulls off one of those rare films that doesn't feel like a film, so much as real life The positive I took from the film is that I was affected by the movie, I cried, I've had loss, I am not that different. C.J. Wilson and Lucas Hedges were also very strongMy Verdict : Brilliant."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2017,5/10,"I suppose the actors must have took the budget money for this movie because it is so cheaply done, i realise a film is only as good as its story but this just isn't the case. Its not well written and the acting is bland and tedious. You can tell an Oscar nominated movie a mile off. Usually they are long and boring like this,however on the odd occasion one can be brilliant. I am guessing the high score are for the drama itself all be it very boring. I love great movies and having seen the scores and loving casey afflecks previous work i thought i would love this. I really hand on heart couldn't wait for it to end, hey thats just my opinion."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 October 2016,9/10,"People in the Northeast take their time. This movie takes its time. I guess Casey Affleck is a movie star now. He holds it all together and keeps punching.... literally. He does complexity with every man simplicity and takes us along for his bumpy ride. Substance and style. He lets us into his character and we have mixed emotions about him just like he does. Michelle Williams disappears into every role. A face to launch a thousand scripts. I was thinking of Geraldine Page before her. Another actor/scientist who formulates until we can't tell she's acting. Lucas Hedges was super, transparent and endearing. Young talent aplenty. The chemistry, real or imagined, was due to the talented cast and fine-tuned script by a man who takes his time putting his plays and films together, the wordsmith Kenneth Lonergan. In awe of the talent and dedication in Manchester By The Sea. Fingers crossed at awards time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 April 2017,3/10,"This movie is depressing. And I don't just mean the story. If I didn't know this was done in 2016, I'd swear it was a movie from the 70s. From the dimly lit scenes to the horrible, annoying music to Casey Affleck's inaudible mumbling, this is a sloooowww moving torture to sit through. The dialog is so mundane and boring. Just go spend an evening with your worst relative and you'll get the same effect. Even though these people have been through a lot, they are terrible people who either swear at each other or don't speak. The settings are such dumps. I'm sick of characters who do nothing but drink.There isn't a flicker of hope. So unless you'd like to feel depressed for a couple of days, just skip this one. Awards don't mean anything."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,10/10,"Manchester By the Sea is one of those rare films that causes the viewers to look within themselves and re-evaluate their lives and by the end, hopefully, find insight into which path to take in life. The film is beautiful, real, heartbreaking, and at times humorous - just like life itself. It hits all the marks and never disappoints.The film follows Lee Chandler, played by Casey Affleck, who lives a lonely life as a plumber and handyman to the residents of Boston. Life seems like it isn't going anywhere and he just tries to make it through each day one at a time. His life is turned upside down when he gets a call that his brother is in the hospital close to death. He makes the drive to Manchester, only to find that he's arrived too late. Lee stays in his brother's old home until he can figure out the funeral arrangements. Patrick, played by Lucas Hedges, is Lee's nephew and now an orphan. Lee decides to take care of him at least until the arrangements for his brother's burial can be made. Life makes an unexpected turn when Lee's brother's will states that guardianship of Patrick will go to Lee. Lee is distressed, reeling from a past tragedy that causes him to believe he isn't fit to take care of Patrick. Lee must now face his past in order to save Patrick's future.Casey Affleck performed splendidly, giving one of the best performances of his career. There's one scene in particular in a police station that really sticks with you and really makes you feel what he's going through. Michelle Williams, who plays Lee's ex-wife Randi, may not have but a couple scenes but those scenes are emotionally powerful and really brings out the heartbreak she must have felt when her late husband Heath Ledger passed.In conclusion, the film is one that will not be forgotten anytime soon. Should it win Best Picture? I wouldn't mind if it did. It relates to everyone on some level or another and never sugarcoats reality. I give it a 4 out of 4."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 March 2017,5/10,"Before I go into my review I have to point out how incredibly suspicious it is that this movie got such a high rating on IMDb. Additionally the user reviews switch from 10/10 to 4/10; that along with the Oscar wins and nominations this movie received. Considering Amazon now owns IMDb and also this is the first film they produced I find it highly suspicious to see such admiration juxtaposed by low reviews.The movie itself is VERY slow. Affleck's character and acting is completely stoic and monotone for the entire movie. The structure of the movie consists of constant flashbacks which are very difficult to understand. There is no indication of when we are viewing the past or present. Until about halfway through the movie i had no idea some of the characters were actually the younger versions of them self, nor the relationship one character had to another. There is no growth for the main character nor is there any closure in the ending. It is like watching Seinfeld in the form of a movie. In that it is a film about nothing.If you read the other USER reviews along with checking the breakdown of the IMDb rating, you'll see there are many low rating balanced by a large amount of perfect 10/10 ratings. That reeks of rating manipulation. Something Amazon products are know for by hiring people to leave ratings on products to boost their standing. The Oscars them self are akin to a political election in that a movie and actor must be able to fund parties and exposure in order to be considered for nomination and gain votes by the Oscar voting committee. Something Amazon could easily achieve with its deep pockets.If this movie was produced by any regular studio it would have a 6.0 rating on IMDb and be lucky to have even be mentioned at the 2017 Oscars.I am sure my review will coincidentally become squished between two 10/10 long winded (paid for) reviews.Do yourself a favor and read all the non 10/10 reviews here if you want an accurate and honest understanding of how mediocre this movie is."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2017,,"* spoiler alert*Fails the Bechdel test badly, but more importantly every single female in this film is portrayed as cold-hearted, annoying, and/or crazy. Even the tragedy that befalls the main character is indirectly blamed on Michelle Williams' character. The males are the only characters with depth, the females merely exist to torment the males or as sexual objects. Even the preschool-aged daughters are portrayed as being cold! Beyond that, I found the film to be tedious and although Casey Affleck's performance is commendable, his character is mostly unlikeable. I can't say I enjoyed this movie at all and it's not one I would be able to recommend."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 May 2017,,"...outside of a middle school or a corrupt pharmaceutical company. My mother used to call these cigarette movies and would rate them accordingly. Thus, a five cigarette movie was one in which she spent the majority of her time in the lobby sucking on her own depressant (nicotine) in lieu of having to absorb it visually and auditorialy. This movie, I'm sure would get a half-a-pack rating from her if she were still alive. Me? I hate cigarette smoke, but it would be a close toss-up as to which I'd rather be exposed to again. Second- hand-smoke, or Manchester By The Sea?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 January 2017,5/10,"Our hero is an angry man who can't seem to hold it together. Through a series of flashbacks we learn why: a great tragedy has traumatized him. But this is not just any tragedy, I can't think of anything worse that could happen to someone. Oedipus Rex plucks out his eyes with less cause. So there is plenty of motivation for him becoming an angry loner, but his past could motivate any dramatic outcome, celibate monk, mass murderer, iconoclastic artist, CIA assassin, raving lunatic. Call a suicide prevention hot line with his backstory and they might direct you to a right-to-die website.Psychotherapy is apparently never an option in the townie macho culture the film depicts; the local police have a very strong reason to get him counseling, but there is no indication they ever do. Self-medication with alcohol is the only succor he gets. OK, so I understand why our hero is angry, but why are most of the other characters attempting a Boston accent so touchy? The accent-free characters in the film never get upset. Despite the portentous music, the film's front story is not so tragic. (A different score could turn this glass-half-empty downer into a half-full feel-good charmer. Some film school should do the experiment.) Our hero realizes his limitations and makes some reasonable choices. The brilliantly acted and Oscar-headed moment when his ex-wife tries to help made me wonder just how she managed to get over it so well.An inability to control his fists is our hero's one shortcoming. Watching a seething Casey Affleck staring out his late brother's bedroom window, my immediate reaction was at least he isn't punching his fist through the glass, and then, a second later, he does. No angry-male stereotypes were harmed in the making of this movie.My takeaway? Check your smoke detectors regularly."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,,"This one is about conversations. Things happen, but real men do not reveal themselves. Unless they take a couple of beers.There is no therapy. You are what you are.And that is all there is to it.. . ."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 May 2021,8/10,This is such a heartbreaking story about how our past can haunt us and shape who we are. Healing is a complex process.Stellar performances from both Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 April 2017,8/10,"Don't buy into the bad reviews just yet. I read the bad reviews telling me this movie is so sad and slow...etc... and I avoided watching it because of those reviews until my wife insisted on watching it. Im nearly 2/3 of the way through Manchester by the Sea as I write this review and I am blown away by the touching drama. The story is well developed and the screenplay unwraps the events in a fashion that leads us to want to know more and more about the characters. I can see why certain reviews didn't like it. Its a matter of what one appreciates. I appreciate quality drama, and the subject of loss is one ripe for quality drama. On this level Manchester by the Sea delivers very well. If you're looking for something up beat, then perhaps this isn't your show. But that is not justification for a poor review. And as I stated in my opening, I avoided this movie, and watched it begrudgingly yet the story and acting has moved me to the point I feel that Manchester by the Sea deserves my vote for a very positive review. Casey Afleck is becoming a great drama actor, perhaps even better than his brother."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 January 2017,8/10,"At last -a film for grown ups with a real story, characters to care about and dialogue. Not a machine-gun,rocket launcher,or flame thrower in sight-will it ever catch on?.We open with a young extrovert Lee Chandler teasing his young nephew on board the family boat with his brother then cut some years on to the same man seemingly transformed as an introverted handyman /janitor, living alone in spartan accommodation carrying out any menial task required by the residents in an efficient but perfunctory manner and with the minimum of personal interaction.A character who we later discover at one point would have welcomed incarceration or death has now settled for this penitential hermetic lifestyle with his only temporary relief found in solitary drinking. He can no longer handle relationships and his emotional range is restricted to silence or rage .The cause of this personality transformation and his chance at self reclamation forms the movie's core.This humdrum insular existence is interrupted by his brother's sudden death and a will that leaves him an unwelcome legacy which threatens to throw him back into the social maelstrom. The snowy New England landscape reflects the cold relations between many of the principals until the breaking of the ground for the burial suggests the thawing of Lee's many estrangements . The rest of the film charts his gradual social rehabilitation through the enforced responsibility of caring for his teenage nephew. But ultimately can he go all the way-can he beat his past?Serious,thoughtful,sad, but not sentimental ,even at times bitterly funny. ""Manchester by the Sea ""is brilliantly acted and beautifully shot,with effectively emotive use of music, and terrific dialogue.Rarely can a non linear narrative have been better deployed and unlike a lot of longer than average films these days it ends exactly when it should and on the perfect note.Casey Affleck is superb.What's not to like-go see"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2019,10/10,"Is this as good as it gets for cinema drama? I think so. This film deserved all the adoring attention it got, from Oscars on down.
Astonishing and riveting. Powerful and moving. Heartbreaking and infuriating. The writing and direction is perfect, the acting is blisteringly real and affecting. The relationship between all the characters feels poignant, painful and absolutely moving, especially between the uncle and nephew. Their relationship starts strong and moves in directions that feels so right for the story. As you watch, there's no telling how the story could end because the filmmakers keep the narrative constantly on the edge between surprise and honesty.
The film uses a simple flashback technique - no signposts - that is slightly confusing at first but settles easily and works so well to establish the history of these people.
For me this is a perfect movie and I wish we had more like this from Hollywood."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 April 2020,10/10,"An emotionally devastating movie. Takes us to a place that few films have ever gone, with a depth and maturity that is a rare commodity in modern cinema. It is a realistic depiction of what grief really looks and feels like. Casey Affleck gives one of the finest performances ever put on film. He lives the agonized character in a way that will haunt you for a long time. Brilliant fim, one of the best I've ever seen. Manchester by the Sea will restore your faith in movies."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 May 2017,1/10,"DO not bother.Seriously this is my first review and only writing this because, for the life of me, why did Casey win an Oscar for?The whole film is a total bore-fest.One would be better off watching anything else, so long it isn't this.I recalled no humour/jokes. There was two fights, both for absolutely no reason. Probably only done after filming when the directors knew it was so boring and the audiences need something to keep them from falling to sleep."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 April 2017,10/10,"I really cannot believe and understand why some viewers give a score of only 1 or 2 out of 10 for this movie. Have they seen another movie than I have? Together with Moonlight this is the best movie that I have seen at the cinema in 2017. Casey Affleck gives a stunning performance as Lee Chandler, a handyman who spends his days painting, doing minor plumbing work, repairing leaks and so on or just giving advice while making sure to avoid any social interaction with the people he is working for. He is a very silent man and we only learn later on why he is such a person. The younger brother of Ben deserved the Oscar for this role more than anybody else in the last ten years.With the magnificent classic music of Albinoni and without any dialogue the cruel truth is revealed later on. I will never forget this scene, so beautiful. I like the slow pace of the movie, the quiet dialogues without shouting to each other and the beautiful classic soundtrack gives the movie an ultimate 10/10. There are just no flaws in this very realistic drama.The movie is very real and strangely raw to be filmed so beautifully. It's just not fake like a lot of movies are usually. It's all the real emotions people go through.Excellent movie and one of the best movies I have seen in the last ten years, and an amazing performance by Affleck.A must see. What are you waiting for to watch this excellent drama?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2017,6/10,its a fashion to rave about a film and give it a cult status...same goes for this one...it may win best film and the best actor in upcoming Oscars but for me this film was not up to the expectation it arose after so many star ratings it gets here on IMDb..frankly its a Hollywood satire on the American society and its a morbid take on American beauty and American history type films and shows how the have ones are suffering more then the have not of the world..compare the situation with the one in film LION and you will understand what I'm talking about...is American & European society suffering from getting too much in their platter ? ..whereas the developing nations and third world countries which still are rattling with existential & survival issues are more optimistic in approach....here the melancholy of western society in comparison even after being materially secure is astonishing...i support the films like lion and also the fantasy musical la la land which is more real then Manchester on the sea..a self inflicting pain indeed this one.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 January 2021,10/10,"The screnplay is simply brilliant and the acting of Casey is just the same as the screenplay. This is one of the best, most fulfilled movied I've seen so far... and I've seen movies."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 December 2016,1/10,"Possibly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The main character was so bad I kept hoping someone would kill him so the movie could end. This movie was way to long and was pointless. It's an example of ""I will never change and be normal"". I'm still trying to figure out how it got such a high rating. The flashbacks weren't that great, the plot was awful and the story boring. And yet people liked it, I have no idea why. If you only have 137 minutes to live watch this, it will seem like an eternity.The main character is a loner and is flawed in an environment of others. You start to realize this in about 20 minutes. Guess I'm the odd man out on this movie as there are a lot of good reviews. There were so many better movies at the theater that I'm disappointed in myself for picking this one. I was actually afraid it wasn't going to end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2017,7/10,"I began watching this film with high expectations and trepidation, as I knew of the Oscar wins, and I assumed there was a devastating backstory for the main character, and devastating it is -- incredibly painful to watch in a series of flashbacks.The film has some brilliant scenes, especially those between Affleck and Williams. They splinter with pain when near each other. In addition, the uncle-nephew relationship between Affleck and Hedges develops nicely at times, though so little is said. I'm rather stunned that this won for best screenplay. I think the music and the performances carry the film, but the dialogue is often so meaningless and gnarled with obnoxious swearing, F-this and F-that. Maybe working-class people in eastern Massachusetts really talk that way, but it hardly makes for great literature.Ultimately I was left disappointed. I kept hoping that one of these damaged, broken individuals -- the characters played by Affleck, Mol, and Williams -- would have a breakthrough. I kept hoping for the uncle and nephew to have a real conversation about the past, the hurt, and how they could negotiate a future together. Don't we want our protagonists to move forward? Maybe Williams' character does.The remainder is somewhat of a spoiler . . .What was the purpose of this film if the tragedy of a young father's death doesn't lead to the redemption of his younger brother, who suffered so much -- more than anyone should -- so early in life. I felt like this was Affleck's character's one last chance to confront his painful past and become the man, the father, he could have been. Why not try?The teenagers will be fine. Hedges' character is resilient and strong, probably beyond his years because of his mother's addictions and his father's illness. Anna Baryshnikov is wonderful as the young man's main love interest, bouncing between awkward and self-assured as young people often do. Heather Burns has a few nice moments as the girl's single mother, seemingly overwhelmed by her daughter's emerging sexuality and her inability to garner any interest from Affeck's character. I kept thinking maybe she'd help him gain his emotional balance, but as the film ends Affeck's Lee Chandler is still emotionally stunted and closed off.I think there was real potential here for an uplifting film of great depth. Again, the teenagers are fine, and that's something to feel good about, but if you come to feel empathy for Affleck's character, you ache for him to make a breakthrough, but then the film ends."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 January 2017,10/10,"Casey Affleck recently won the Best Actor (Drama) award at the Golden Globes for what is arguably his best performance to date. He plays Lee Chandler, a socially awkward, lonely and tightly wound janitor in Boston who is forced to return to his home town following the untimely death of his older brother. As next-of-kin, Lee becomes the trustee of his brother's affairs and reluctantly, the legal guardian to his teenage nephew, Patrick (played by the excellent Lucas Hedges).We follow Lee and Patrick as they form a strained bond together and deal with their grief in their own separate ways. Lee focuses on taking care of the various arrangements as quickly as possible so that he can return to Boston, whilst Patrick, the antitheses of Lee, surrounds himself with attention from his friends and girlfriends.What makes this such a fascinating drama is not just the development of the relationship between these two, but the study of a tortured soul facing his demons and battling for redemption. It's a stunning performance from Affleck who shows great maturity and sensitivity in his portrayal of Lee. This is a character so full of self-loathing and bent on self-destruction, so consumed by shame and hurt, but is determined to do the right thing despite the turmoil this brings. He could almost be Shakespearean such is the tragedy that defines him. This is a character so compelling to watch, the audience could be on the verge of heartbreak in any given scene, and the audience's resolve is severely tested towards the end of the film during a conversation with his ex-wife (Michelle Williams, excellent as always but surprisingly lauded given her considerable lack of screen time). Seeing a younger Lee in a series of flashbacks also makes the present-day version that much more complex; the younger Lee appearing to be popular, sociable and fun, much like Patrick in fact.Hedges deserves many plaudits himself for his performance. At just 20 years old, he already boasts an impressive CV which includes appearances in two Wes Anderson films, Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel, as well as Michael Cuesta's Kill the Messenger. As Patrick, he must contend with the loss of his father, the arrival and interference of his estranged uncle, and the potentially impending upheaval of his entire life. He is quickly thrown into conflict with his uncle, who wants to take him back to Boston. Patrick summarises his popularity to Lee; he has lots of friends, is on the hockey and basketball teams, has two girlfriends and is in a band. Lee is a janitor, ""what's it matter where you live?"" Patrick asks. The conflict between the two of them turns into a battle of wills, and thankfully this brings about a relieving injection of humour, particularly when Patrick feels compelled to run his love-life by Lee. Patrick has his own complexities, too, evident in a lack of visible emotion over his father's death but devastatingly abundant in his need to fix his father's boat and the panic attack he suffers at an innocuous reminder of what happened to his dad. These are reminders of Patrick's vulnerabilities and the fact that despite living an almost perfect life for a 16 year old teenager, he is still very much a dependant; a point subtly repeated every time he asks Lee for money or to drive him to one place or another.The bond between Lee and Patrick naturally encapsulates a theme of paternity and this is something that is explored in greater detail throughout the film, particularly in the flashbacks in which we meet Lee's brother Joe (reliably performed by the ever brilliant Kyle Chandler). These flashbacks also introduce us to Lee's and Joe's ex-wives (Williams and Gretchen Mol), who personify the related theme of maternity, and the flashbacks hint at the close relationship the brothers shared, too. It becomes clear that this is not just a story about parenting, but one about family and the hardships that familial relationships can bring about, especially when dealing with loss.Understandably, Manchester-By-The-Sea has a bleakness to it, embodied by Affleck's outstanding performance but also represented by the titular location, serving as a character within itself and in doing so as the source of conflict and turmoil that Lee must battle with. Situated in Essex County in the northeast of Massachusetts, it is a small coastal town which is portrayed by Director Kenneth Lonergan as an intimate and close-knit community in which everyone knows each other, rumours and stories are prevalent, and it is bitterly cold. Coldness becomes a pivotal element of the film; it is a cause of anguish that highlights Patrick's grief but also provides a metaphor for the repressed emotions of the protagonists, especially the hardened and guarded Lee.Lonergan, as Director and Writer of Manchester-By-The-Sea, deserves all the nominations and awards he has and is yet to receive. With a clear eye and astute observation for complex characteristics and emotional catalysts, he combines a myriad of familial complications and pitfalls into a wonderfully sensitive story that tells of love, loss, joy and pain. With a running time of over two and a quarter hours, some may feel that this story is too long, but given the complexities and development of the characters and their relationships, it felt perfectly pitched and elegantly told. Accompanied by an almost operatic score that enhances the drama and sense of tragedy, this is a truly accomplished, polished and beautifully crafted character-based drama. Astonishingly, this is just Lonergan's third film in 16 years. With such assured talent, it's a shame he is not more prolific.Ultimately, Affleck will take all the plaudits and like Lonergan, he deserves every nomination and award he gets. Manchester-By-The-Sea certainly won't be to everybody's taste as it is a slow burning and bleak character study. However, in terms of pure accomplished drama and story-telling, it is sublime.For further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2021,1/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a terrible film. It's not well acted, it's not well written, it's not well directed, it's depressing, it's awkward, it's unpleasant, it's ugly, it has annoying music, it has terrible characters who are all terrible human beings, and it feels like the cinematic equivalent of dying a slow and painful death. I hated this movie with all my heart. There are no redeeming features. Even a few days after having watched this film, I still get a very unpleasant feeling when thinking about it. Manchester by the Sea is nothing more than two hours of having all the joy sucked out of every part of your body."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,3/10,"I do not mind slow. I do not mind dour. But I am left wondering what the point of this film was. It drags on and on in a monotone, monochrome torpid crawl. It is difficult to empathise with the characters, difficult to follow the plot - and impossible to care about any of what happens. I cannot believe so much effort went into this sluggish mess. The music was nice but otherwise the best moment was when it finally ended - what sweet, sweet relief."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 December 2016,9/10,"Manchester by the sea is such a thoroughly and richly written drama about Lee, his past, present and future. Kenneth Lonergan has done it again, testing the audience with unannounced scenes of the past that invites several perspectives of the protagonists mind. Lee (Casey Affleck) is forced to decide whether or not to be the legal guardian of his brother Joe's (Kyle Chandler) son Patrick (Lucas Hedges). The minute he reads the testament from his deceased brother, we embark on a past that becomes a standpoint for this story.We see a burning house and a woman screaming 'my children are there!' while officers and firefighters restrain her from running in. Lee is returning from the store and standing grand still, watching the house burn to its ground, feeling the remorse, sorrow, guilt and realization of causing the devastating accident. The soundtrack in the scene creates the terrorized and emotionally severe atmosphere (as well as the acting), the song itself intense and sentimental (Adagio in G minor by Tomaso Albinoni), also reflects on the understanding part of Lee's present psychological issues. While the scene is provoking one to act out the anger caused by Lee's foolishness (how he the same night had several drinks and used drugs with his pals while playing Ping-Pong), you could either loath this character or feel with him.Because the previous scenes of his family consisted of him showing love and affection for his three children (all under the age of ten) and how attached he was to them. One could tell he was a loving father and husband only in that particular scene. I felt for him, I cried during the scene, how it takes so little to be regretful for the rest of your life.As he returns to Manchester he's forced to deal with the tragedy of his past and struggling with internal complications, he reunites with the city he was born and raised in. The community hasn't forgotten what he's done, nevertheless, he doesn't seem affected because the deepest vexation lies within him. However, motivation is awakened as he takes care of his nephew and becomes a part of another's life since the tragedy.When he embarks upon his ex-wife (Michelle Williams) in the street, she's trying to absolve herself from the words she could've left unsaid, but he keeps interrupting her and attempting to leave. One of the greatest scenes in the movie as it captures the essence of love. Michelle Williams is so so so good together with Casey Affleck, who contributes in the film with a lot by their nuances of acting. You'll never get tired of it, the emotions are real and there's never really a scene where you doubt the credibility of it. Affleck definitely deserves an Oscar and so does this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 March 2019,,"A few minutes into the film, in the bar scene, Sharon spills her beer on Lee. She is then shown picking her glass up and it is full."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2020,4/10,I love these type of stories but I have no idea what happened to this one at all. JUST DON'T.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,10/10,"This movie pulls you in and breaks your heart and before you even know what is happening you are sobbing. The critic in me was pointing out the flaws, but meanwhile my heart was broken. This movie is about Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) who learns he is now guardian of his nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges) after his brother (Kyle Chandler) dies. Lee and Patrick are both trying to deal with this in their own ways and together and neither is very good at it. It does go on for a very long time, but that just makes you feel that much more attached to the characters. By the end I felt like I knew them and had a responsibility to make them happy, a level of deep human empathy that Kenneth Lonergan did a brilliant job in capturing, and that is not an easy feat.Casey Affleck was brilliant. Completely wonderful. One of the most powerful performances I've seen in my lifetime. Here is a man who's life has been so tough to deal with and he's not doing great. He has problems. He can't quite control himself and starts bar fights and can't make small talk or act like a human being or a general good person, but somehow you root for him with your entire heart. Lucas Hedges is so incredible in his breakout role. He is a wonderful new star and I hope to see much more of him in the future. Michelle Williams, whom we have come to know as an incredible actress, so much so that you almost get used to it after a while, continues to wow, and raises the bar with her latest performance. I would like to have a ten minute standing ovation for Mr. Kenneth Lonergan. His script makes your heart grow and pule and explode and the pieces try so hard to fit back together until you're left with a mismatched heart that can still love this movie. This movie is SAD. Be ready for that. Don't think you won't cry because you will. It wasn't perfect, but that can be forgiven at the expense of such a deep and moving film that is somewhat of a rarity nowadays."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2020,2/10,"I didn't like this film at all. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and they didn't seem to connect with each other. It's a film about people struggling with grief basically, a sad and harsh reality of life, but not entertaining to watch . I don't recommend it at all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 September 2021,9/10,"A great movie with great performances
I watched for the first time as my friends suggested me was disappointed a bit but watched it again was too good
Changes you as a person
Highly recommended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2017,1/10,"I attended this movie with my wife and one of her girlfriends. I was squirming within minutes but I presumed they were enjoying it and resolved to stick it out. At last my wife leaned over and said, ""We think this movie is TERRIBLE!!!"" I said, ""Let's give it ten more minutes and see if they get off the dime and something starts happening."" It just got more painful to watch. We walked out. It was tedious, boring and depressing and I'm at a total loss as to how it got such positive reviews."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 July 2020,6/10,Story is good but the film is over two hours and can put you to sleep in most parts. Filmed in ice and snow in dreary towns. Would appreciate a few leaves on the trees. Acting is very good but the dialogue could be better.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2017,9/10,"I am in many ways a masochist, and many movies of 2016 indulged the part of me that wants to cry. But dear god, nothing quite like Manchester by the Sea. My sister saw it first and explained it as ""It starts as the saddest movie you've ever seen, and then halfway through, it sinks into another level of incomprehensible despair."" I am paraphrasing. But she is correct. At every plot turn, Kenneth Lonergan takes the road less traveled and much more depressing. The writing and screenplay work together in perfect emotional harmony, highlighted by the quietly dynamic performances by Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges, and one spectacular scene by Michelle Williams that left me crying into a dirty scarf from the bottom of my purse. This movie isn't about redemption, it's about surviving and self-preservation, in spite of the most horrific thing you could ever imagine, and despite what others may need from you. 8.7/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 March 2017,10/10,A masterpiece....achingly beautiful....wonderfully acted....Casey Affleck portrays the torment inside him in possibly the most understated performance i have seen...watch it...it will move you...its painful and tragic..coupled with anger and acceptance...and finally in the depths of loss and mourning we will be aware of the preciousness of things....the joy of spending time with your loved ones...
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 November 2017,7/10,"Great story, but way too much/too loud music. Like... overwhelmingly loud. I've grown to love silence in drama movies and the strength it gives the shot. Scenes that were emotional were drowned in heavy sound and it killed pretty much everything that would drive me emotional. If it wasn't for that, i would have given it higher score. The film is well made, the drama is strong and it has somewhat of a satisfying finish. I probably won't watch it twice though. It's not that good and it's not really that memorable. Just part of the life of a random guy - Tragic part of a tragic life, but still, just a normal, broken guy.6.5/10 Good movie, but not really much more."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 December 2016,10/10,"I see no problems with this movie. A masterclass of filmmaking on every level. The direction is superb, the cinematography is gorgeous, the music is great, and the acting is some of the best ensemble work I've seen in a very long time. Lonergan uses an immense amount of poise in this movie, making it so that it is not overly film like. By that I mean about halfway through this movie I forgot that it was a movie. I was watching real life. It was like a freaking documentary. Of course in all facets this is not a documentary but everything in it is so unbelievably believable it's hard to put into words. That is a major compliment to Lonergan and especially to Casey Affleck. I will be upset if he doesn't win the Oscar this year. His performance is so understated and so believable. Like I said, I felt like I was watching real life, and Casey Affleck was no longer Casey Affleck. He was Lee Chandler. His performance is quiet but powerful. Every frame that he is on screen I felt bad for him, which is what they were going for. Michelle Williams is in the movie for like 6 minutes and every time she showed up she stole every word. Lucas Hedges is fantastic in the movie as well. The story is sad though. There is not a happy thing you can really take out of this movie. It's depressing and sad but at the same time very funny. There were times when the entire theater I was in would burst out laughing. To all those complaining that the pacing is slow, it's supposed to be slow. This is a depiction of life and a study of one humans journey through one really terrible life. Life is slowly paced and that's what the movie was going for. Look, if you like film then this is essential viewing this year. It's not a fun movie to see. You will probably get really sad, you may cry, you may feel a pain in the pit of your stomach whenever you see these characters. But in the end it is a painstakingly wonderfully crafted film. Every element of it is exemplary work from all parties involved. It's slow, sad, depressing, painful, beautiful, funny, wonderful and all around great in every way. 10/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 February 2017,3/10,"Another example of Hollywood losing its way. Is the art of telling a good story gone? Its one of those movies I couldn't wait to end. A slow plodding story you hope takes off and goes somewhere but it just ambles along until your telling yourself enough! Best picture.....please. A waste of 2 hours! Boring melodramatic and predictable. I felt like I opened someone's from door and watched there life go by for a wile.............ugg.Casey Affleck might be a good actor some day but this movie was just to get his feet wet. And it was at the movie goers expense. if Hollywood keeps this up... ""critically acclaimed"" is SOON going to be CODE for steer clear!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 August 2019,8/10,"I get why someone might not like this movie (in my house alone there are very conflicting opinions about this movie), but I really enjoyed it. There is just something about this movie that spoke to me. The way it is told and the realness of what happens. It is the type of movie that stays with you long after you have watch it... And for me, that is what makes this movie great."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 April 2017,7/10,"the movie is all Grey ,silent and depressing and revolves around the performance of casey affleck mainly,... it focuses on how dealt with tragedy, the main character played by genius casey afflek has lost his home and children,on what seems an accident that he caused on first place,because of his irresponsible behavior we then watch him transform ,to go from a reckless casual guy to a broken man,who after failing to commit suicide leads an empty soulless life , moves to another town to avoid the memories, works as a plumber,and goes through boring daily routine,hard faced and cold and looses all sense of socialization, then has to take care of his nephew whom father died,.. depressing but deep and touching,worth watching!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 July 2018,9/10,Very very good indeed ! The play of the actors indescribable ! Casey - number one
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 June 2019,9/10,"Really well written and outstandingly acted drama. Flashbacks unfold the full scale of the tragic events only by and by, but considering relatively little happens overall, the movie flows really well anyhow. There is a very authentic feel to it, that makes for a couple really amusing scenes amidst all the drama, too. Ultimately a very rewarding viewing experience, for which Affleck completely deserved his Oscar."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 January 2019,10/10,"This film, that was both directed and written by Keneth Lonnergen, focusses on the adult life of Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) whose extended family still seem to reside in and around the eponymous Manchester by the Sea.Let me say first off, that this film will not be good value for money if watched, once only, among other pre-paying customers at a movie-theater or drive-in. I watched it, twice, on a widescreen computer monitor via the English BBC TV public screening on 'Iplayer' and did enough research before watching it a second time to recognise the face of Keneth Lonnergen, himself, playing the passer-by in light blue - who makes a judgemental and inflamatory comment while Lee and his nephew Patrick are arguing.I recently watched a profile of film director Nicholas Roeg, which included his own story of his early involvment in film-making, as a cinematographer. It showed me one of the keys to unlocking the sense of Manchester By The Sea and the character of Lee Chandler.It's also in John Huston's story (in his autobigraphy) of the very early days of Hollywood when he visited as a sick child, with his mother. He, too, was fascinated by how film when edited or simply reversed could make swimmers dive back out of the swimming pool and seemingly jump back up onto the diving board. A great film star of the silent movie era, Charlie Chaplin, explained to the child how this is done.Film-makers can not only conquer the conventional experience of space; but also the conventional experience of time.This film, like most others, has a beginning - signalled by the opening frames of the idyllic seaside village of Manchester and an end - which is signalled by the credits rolling. But in between, and also by way of explanation or insight into Lee Chandler's earlier life and subsequent behaviour, includes a number of flashbacks which include the audience of the film in the probable effect this may have had on Lee's life.The fact that film is a serial medium is what makes it nearly impossible to 'get it' at the first viewing of the film. Time is jumbled up in this film and also the interraction of the characters does not always include handy hints like them addressing one another by name in the dialogue. After nearly a day with the IMDB cast list and photos, I had worked out more or less who was who. I'd written down most of the action that I could remember from the first viewing, before watching it for a second time.Only by the end of the second viewing did I feel I'd 'got it'. Only at the end of the second viewing did it all make sense.'Full use of the gun' is a phrase from English clay pigeon shooting (target shooting with shotguns at moving clay targets launched at angles and speeds which challenge the shooter's skill). It means that you may load 2 shells and fire both if you need to, to break the moving target, without penalty.Guns feature twice in this film and both instances it involves Lee. But by the second instance, Lee's mind is working in quite a different way and his intentions are much more in tune with his brother's puzzling intentions when formally appointing Lee as Patrick's guardian in the event of his death, which occurs unexpectedly soon.Enjoy it and give yourself time to unscramble what has happened."

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 February 2017,6/10,"This is that type of Movie which won't be everyone's cup of tea. Some will relate to it, some won't and some even after relating to it will never achieve satisfaction with the movie.The transitioning between past and present is perfect and fluid and only strengthens the story telling. But what makes this an incredibly Boring and Dull movie, is the dialogue, which has no details, is mundane, dull and flat. For a genre being Drama, that should bring down the movie to a really low level for a viewer.The technical aspects are appropriately executed & extremely grounded and never try to overshadow or take the focus away from its characters. The slow narration is fitting, given its premise, but it will be frustrating. The story might've been great, as it offers truths of life right onto the screen, but overall it will never strive to be better as the ratings expect it to be."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 January 2017,10/10,"I saw it 3 days ago at a preview screening for PictureHouse members in Brighton England, I am still affected by it. It's a superb film in virtually every way. The acting is so good and understated by the whole cast, it's impossible not to believe that you are part of these lives as they are laid bare before you. The plot is simple but cuts straight through to your heart, the perfect editing ensures the pace of it keeps you entranced the whole way through. I haven't cried in a film since my parents took me to see Dumbo but I sobbed in this. The cinematography is quite beautiful, showing these down to earth people in a normal environment with perfect clarity, some scenes framed like paintings. Even the music, some classical and some contemporary, is chosen well to enhance the mood effectively. I will definitely see this film again...and again....and probably again...and I can't wait."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 October 2021,3/10,"How did this movie rate a 7.8 on IMBD? Lousy script, terrible acting. Hard to follow for all the backflashes. Drepressing beyond belief.Boring boring boring premise."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2016,4/10,"My expectations were not met by this movie. Although a tragic story, it was not that interesting a plot. The pacing was incredibly slow and the acting at best fair. I found there was little in the dialogue that was gripping or compelling, but rather dull and banal. Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is a despondent figure who is obviously in distress but there is no depth to his character. Although there are moments of released pent up anger, most times Afflect just sleep walks through the scene. Most of the action centers around the released anger, but these scenes seemed forced with too much inappropriate vulgarity. It felt like over the top caricatures of how Hollywood views blue collar America. The best scenes were the interaction between Lee and his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). But it was not enough to save this picture. I cannot recommend it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 June 2020,5/10,"This is the definition of overrated. There is no any fluency in it. Alomng the whole movie, I expected something to happen, to change the way pf the movie, it was all the same, a sob story. It tells an unhappy or depressed man's story about his unexpectedly ended marriage with the accusation of death of their children in a terrible way. Besides it, passing away of his brother and the only thing that left from his brother is some kind of rebel, fainted-hearted, nephew. I cant imagine how can it have 7.8 rating ? Questioning this but cant find any reason, there is no any development in the story, it all happened and there is one man which we need to respect to, considering that he still has a robust standing. Nothing else, by the way, a nephew.. he is such a reckless that he can cross having sex in his mind, every single time. Acting of the man was awesome. So slow..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 January 2019,8/10,"Not a lighthearted Friday night feel good film.Very, very heavy. Make sure you're in the mood.If you are, it's great - well worth a watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2020,,"Depressed uncle story. Quite a long movie that may leave one as depressed as the uncle. The soundtrack is tough to listen to, quite funereal. Some good acting but watching this overlong and grief-infused movie bordered on an ordeal"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2017,5/10,"This film is less about plot and story and more about portraying to an audience the feelings and thoughts of the main characters. This goal is perpetuated by the methodical pace and gloomy wintry imagery. Slow moving. Glad I watched because it is critically acclaimed, but not something that I would sit through again."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2019,9/10,"Life turns on a dime. Sometimes towards us, but more often it spins away, flirting and flashing as it goes: so long, honey, it was good while it lasted, wasn't it? Stephen King, 11/22/63I hate it when I simply love all aspects of a film and want to lavish praise on it, but it's all been said before (some more eloquently than myself) and I end up sounding like a two-bit plagiarist who echoes overused accolades of other critics (many more famous than myself). I want to say that Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea was a brilliant Tour De Force; extraordinary, a masterpiece, riveting. I want to say that the entire cast was absolutely flawless and each one of them gave the performance of their acting careers. But then my review would sound just like the plethora of others it received at the Sundance, Telluride, Toronto, and New York Film Festivals.So, instead, I'm going to say - It was a damn fine piece of filmmaking and I wish with all my heart that I had written and directed it. It's an engaging, authentic, mesmerizing film that will haunt you long after it is over. Indeed, it's the kind of film that, like life, must be processed in its own time; one that you wake up in the middle of the night with a sudden flash of realization and say, ""I got it!""Manchester by the Sea is a real place. And the characters and events in the film are SO real that even for an old film guy like myself, I got caught up in the verisimilitude of it all. Of course such reality, such authenticity (there's that word again) can only come from an incredible script, a visionary director, and a fantastic cast. All of these elements are present in the film.When I saw the trailer and read the one-sheet blurbs about the film prior to seeing it, I still had absolutely no idea what it was about. And in writing this review, I understand now why that occurred - because no trailer and/or promo piece can do justice to this film without giving away critical spoilers which MUST be experienced in the context of the film. So what can I tell you about the plot or storyline of the film? What can I tell you about its themes without giving away anything? It's about love and loss and tragedy and forgiveness and unforgiveness and redemption and condemnation. It's about life and maybe people we know. Maybe it's even about all of us in some way. There is so much emotion packed into the film that it would be difficult not to resonate with someone at some level.Obviously, director/writer Kenneth Lonergan's background as the offspring of a psychiatrist mother and doctor father was not wasted on him. He has created a brilliant, masterful psychological matrix; a minefield where one wrong step opens a Pandora's Box of our worst fears and nightmares.In talking about the cast, I realize that there is no possible way I cannot sound like a used car (I mean pre-owned) salesman touting hackneyed superlatives. Casey Affleck is simply superb. He says more with his eyes and body language than any actor I've seen in a very long time. His performance is so precisely measured and executed, manchester11always simmering just below the surface, waiting to erupt in a crescendo of emotion at any given point in time. Michelle William's performance is staggering in intensity. Kyle Chandler, who plays Casey Affleck's older brother in the film is wonderful (I cannot help but think how far he has come from the TV series Early Edition and the George Straight film Pure Country). And the charismatic and thoroughly engaging performance of relative newcomer, Lucas Hedges, will melt the coldest heart of the worst cynic alive today. A special shout out must go to Mathew Broderick as well who demonstrates that there is no limit to his range as an actor.What else can I say about Manchester by the Sea that hasn't already been said? I don't know. I do know that it is indeed one of those rare Venus flytraps of a film that comes along every once in a while that has the unique ability to reach past its own celluloid borders and pull you into its world. It's a film that MUST be experienced, not just seen.On a totally different and somewhat irrelevant side note, it's also nice to know that when I make purchases on Amazon, my money is going to support the distribution of films like Manchester. (Amazon reportedly paid ten million dollars for the domestic rights - a bit pricey, but a smart investment.) Kudos to Jeff Bezos as well!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 August 2021,1/10,"What a boring crap i just witnessed. I totally feel for the guys who said they wasted 2 hours of their life on a crappy movie. I feel the same way.Boring, useless storytelling. Not addicting at all.Oscar worthy perform,ance????? Get lost please. Cant believe this guy wom against Washington with Fences. Pathetic - proves how scripted all Oscars are."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 December 2016,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is one of the best Oscar bait movies I have seen on a technical level. The acting is grounded and always character consistent. The character consistency is the key to the overall film's success. Kenneth Lonergan's directorial accomplishment is utilized to anchor moments that might otherwise be drama cliché. The consistency would, of course, be an even more impossible task without an excellent cast. Casey Affleck will undoubtedly get the quarterback like attention at the Oscars. What that comment means is that I failed to see a single bad performance from the rest of the cast. For narrative, the contemplative structure allows the viewer a chance of gaining character insight without letting most moments explicitly define the players. A tragic event will occur and a given scene only allows a character minor fallout before a transition in time. Lonergan's script/direction doesn't need to hold the audience's hand. The cinematography is fine with an excellent focus on the little quirks one might find in a small New England town. In addition, the blend of cinematography and location lends to the rare cinematic experience of a story feeling like it comes from a genuine place. Manchester is an uncomfortable film when it comes to dishing out any form of conclusion. The result is a narrative more in line with postmodern sensibilities. The ending can easily be dismissed as a typical indie climax. However, the conclusion is anything but a simple artistic gimmick. Seeing the ending as a gimmick robs rewarding the narrative of its logical continuation. In fact, I daresay Manchester by the Sea contains one of the year's best movie endings. The butterfly-like effect of grief is the central theme I pinned down. A question of, ""Do I deserve my grief?"" is also asked. I can't say I admired the film as much on a personal level. The film contained a lot of scenes which were a little long for my taste. Additionally, the movie works better as an example of fine film- making over anything I can take with me in life. Many people will see the film as a relatable experience but nothing more. I am curious as to how long the movie will stay in the minds of the average viewer. Manchester By The Sea may very well get better with age. See the film for its cinematic accomplishments and marvel at the emotional realism."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2017,8/10,"It is a quite sad story. but it also full of life and all the normal stuff we face while making our sailings from port to port! at first i thought it might continue some romance in it, but it was clearly out. killing all the hopes and dreams of those who dream about rainbows or those who want good things to just happen, it's simple. life. and aside from the awesome performance by Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams who truly proves that you don't have to appear so long or many times to make the Ohs comes! she was there in small scenes and her performance was just great in all. it's not easy thing betting on a movie like this since not all the crowd is gonna like it or feel it, and i want to congratulate Kenneth Lonergan for his guts also his talent. I think it's different in a positive way and that's the secret of this movie along with the reality and simplicity of it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2021,10/10,"Such a good movie but made me very sad.
Pure raw drama. Every one did a great job."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 December 2016,10/10,"Silence is often the most deafening sound. A loss can trigger the strongest of emotions. And there is nothing louder in this film than the quiet performances of its leads and virtually say everything especially in moments when no words are exchanged. I watched this one as part of the London Film Festival 2016 and it blew me away for its equal measures of heart, humour, love, despair and humanity. The casting is superb and deserve to scoop up the awards of the year in a story which even though one can guess from the start what is in its nucleus, we sit and admire the masterful director peel it off to gradually reveal an even richer and more layered core."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 November 2017,1/10,"If you like movies that are full of very dysfunctional relationships, constant drinking, using the f word more than you are able to count - this is your perfect movie. What a shame. Seems most of the characters in the immediate family, and their friends, never got past the 9th grade in their maturation process. I must admit I stopped watching the movie about half way, it was so bad. Per another reviewer - it couldn't be said better: A sign of a good film is that one wants to return to it over and over for repeated viewings. It is difficult to imagine many viewers who would wish to endure an encore performance of ""Manchester By the Sea."" What were the metacritics and the various awards people thinking ??"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2021,10/10,Depressing and touching at the same time. How a man can survive out of this pain... I cannot even imagine something like that....
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,5/10,"Men are, by convention, less adept in dealing with their emotions than women, partly due to the school of thought that upholds it is unmanly to express feelings. The subject of this film concerns the consequences of this traditional view, set in a traditional community. In the opening scenes, we see Lee Chandler, the protagonist, as a reserved and inscrutable apartment caretaker, who appears to have more to him than a track record as a handyman. Tenants are put off by his aloofness and just can't relate to him. You want to know what is going on inside his head. Later on, you realize the distant manner is just about held together and ready to explode into violence. When you walk out of the cinema and know why this is, it is somewhat disturbing. That's the main takeaway, and it's a man thing.The film could have been better with a little more work on the script and character development. For instance, near the beginning of the film, a person says ""you mean THE Lee Chandler?"" So, Lee is famous – but why? Is it because of his (former) career, or because of what has happened to him? His previous life, successful and happy it seems, needs more explication, so that we can understand better how circumstances have changed him. I assumed at first that Lee was a famous ice hockey player, but there was no further reference to his old career. Lee is also more well spoken than you would expect from a career handyman, until the point when the F words start to erupt.Lee's teenage nephew is also strangely inscrutable in the opposite way. When his father dies prematurely, Patrick behaves as though nothing has happened, carries on as if life is a party, and picaresque entertainment ensues. Again, it's a man thing.As for female character development, it wasn't that plausible that so many of the women were hitting on men, including a 16-year-old who yells ""F me!"" to a character, (when her own mother is in a nearby room!), a stranger who sits next to Lee and deliberately spills her drink on him so she can start a conversation with him, and yet another woman, a near stranger to Lee, who is said to have possessive feelings for him, but who then turns to her daughter to seek help in conversing with him. A predatory character would surely have had a conversational repertoire? In a sense, these poorly drawn females just seemed to reflect a fantasy that women now don't need to check first-off impulsive behaviour that expresses lust. If the scriptwriter was trying to say that these female characters were emotionally better off than Lee and Patrick because they allowed their feelings to take over and didn't repress them like Lee did, then that is just as immature a way to behave as repressing everything.There was also a disturbing aspect to the character of Lee's ex- sister-in-law's new man. He is outwardly Christian, yet inwardly very masculine and controlling. Somehow there is an implication that his inadequacies were because of his Christianity rather than because of the human condition. I've noticed a little meme of Christian-bashing in films lately (I'd cite Spotlight here too, which, although of course based on a horrific true story, the number of abusers seemed exaggerated on examination, and the only gentlemanly hero of the film was the non-Christian, the Boston Globe publisher). I do not attend church myself – so, just sayin'.The film didn't lack fine acting – Michelle Williams delivered an incredibly moving scene, and I'd also like to mention Josh Hamilton, who did a fine cameo as the lawyer. As for Affleck, he just deadpanned through most of the film, but that is what the script called for.The score was marred by being cheesy in places, with instantly recognizable classics played, volume up. However, the opening vocals were atmospheric, and the choice of ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"" was a nice touch.Cinematography was crisp, and portrayed the beauty of the coastal community along the north coast of Massachusetts well. The film was nearly a travel brochure for the area. In addition to that, it was refreshing to see no chain stores in sight, but instead several towns still getting by, based on small businesses and local traditions, as if out of Lake Wobegone Days. The colonial style architecture was pleasing, the harbours full of various family boats, the skies clear enough to see the stars at night brightly. Yes, this is an America where a strong sense of community still exists outside of the large cities and their metal-and-glass, high-rise corporatocracy. Think Naragansett Bay in Rhode Island (in Moonrise Kingdom), Punxsutawney (in Groundhog Day), Glencoe, Minnesota (in God's Country), Paterson (Paterson), Manchester by the Sea....experience these while you still can...."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,5/10,"As one person wrote, we're ""spoon fed weepy."" We are to the point of overkill. We gets tons of flashbacks. Flashbacks to flashbacks. At one point he's with the reader of the will and he's sitting in a chair and it's like ten minutes of various flashbacks and I'm going ""is he just sitting there for ten minutes looking at the wall all this time while the guy just stares at him?""Affleck's character has had a terrible tragedy and cannot cope. At no point does he. There's no character development, he's basically the rude jerk he as at the beginning. Hey, did everyone give a good performance? Surely. But the kid's a jerk, we don't really see him coping with his father's death outside some lame refrigerator scene, he's more worried about getting laid. I didn't care about anyone in this film which is fine, you should at least find them interesting, and I didn't find them interesting either. Didn't hate this film, just found it severely overrated. Yeah, it will win awards because all the pretentious people predict it so it happens. Does it deserve it? Not in my opinion."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,4/10,"Our Hollywood critics, Les Roberts and Ann Elder, rate this film a ""flickering yellow light,"" on their traffic light review scale. Casey Affleck's performance as Lee Chandler absolutely blew them away. While this is probably his strongest performance in a film to date, the overall tone of the film left our critics wanting more. In this case, they feel that the script and direction were a disservice to Affleck.Michelle Williams as Randi Chandler also gave a stellar performance. Our reviewers have loved her in past films, and she complements Affleck well. But again, her performance was not enough to overcome this depressing script.Ann and Les felt that the subject matter was a workable plot, but the overall tone was too sad. People like to go to the movies for something uplifting or hopeful, and this left them both feeling miserable.They found the cinematography appealing as well, but when you're not enjoying a movie it's hard to enjoy the scenery.They are hopeful that they will see these leads together in another film with a better script and a stronger director.For their full in depth analysis of this film, search for their ""Manchester by the Sea"" podcast here: https://www.thefrontporchpeople.com"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 October 2019,3/10,"Sorry, I generally don't comment unless I am really impacted by a movie. This movie is really an over-hyped, artsy-fartsy waste of time....."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,7/10,"I really enjoyed this movie, there is a reality to this movie which is played out with incredible performances from Affleck and Williams who's connection is so deep and so unfinished its heartbreaking. The character ""Patrick"" is very natural and convincing the actor certainly deserves recognition for his part in this beautiful, sad and totally believable story of real people with real feelings. Still there are two problems I have one is with the profanity, having lived in the US, I never came across people who used the f.ck word so much, it is not how most Americans talk and certainly in the area where the film was located, I think the people from Boston might be offended. Secondly PLEASE STOP FILMING while someone is driving, the number of times the ""Lee"" character had his eyes off the road was incredulous.....most people would have crashed and died by then. Otherwise...This is a great movie"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 January 2017,10/10,"Massachusetts audiences will be able to relate, because it was filmed here and all the actors and scenery are genuine. But everybody can relate because it's about the universal experience of loss, and of hurt people who can't express it and carry their pain, just trying to survive.Before I went, I read two reviews that said after seeing this it bothered them for weeks, and that they were so depressed they couldn't get out of bed for days. This movie could be very painful or even traumatic for people who may have their own pain dredged up by the emotional performances. Casey Affleck plays an unforgettably broken man. The movie shows you exactly how he turned out that way – not in a series of long scenes, but small snapshots. It's an extremely affecting way of telling a very sad story, and getting to know and feel for these characters in the small details that make up all of our lives.I did feel sad at the end, but much more resolved to have more compassion for my fellow man. All of us have losses. There's no way to know what a stranger is going through inside and the pain they're in. The Dropkick Murphys just released a song inspired by the Boston marathon bombings in which they sing, ""we're all just people trying to make it through another day."" Ain't that the truth? Can't we all try a lot harder just to give each other a break once in awhile?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,9/10,"This is a very disturbing film because there are no easy answers and no feel good conclusion. There is plenty of humour and the characters are all far more complex than anyone seems to give them credit for. Lee, whose brother has held the family together, finds that he has been left guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick ( a lovely guy)but it seems an impossible conundrum because of an unspeakable family tragedy which presumably leaves him feeling he is not a fit father among other things, he cannot find work in Manchester where Patrick needs to stay, presumably because people think he is unlucky and he has to work in Boston. If there is any thawing in Lee's terrible grief it is slight but perhaps as he tries to do the best he can for Patrick, he finally finds a solution that allows Patrick to stay in Manchester but leaves the door open for Patrick to stay with him in Boston."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2017,10/10,"These type of films don't come around that often, and for good reason. It takes focus and effort to come up with stories and themes that touch deeper than the usual Hollywood dirge. The story-line is completely unpredictable , unlike 95% of the films out there.What is most intriguing about M B T S , is the way in which highly depressing themes are kept in check with humour, intelligent scripting and a subtle feel good factor, which seems to creep in at exactly the right time. The overall feel is also kept balanced by the intricacies of the relationships between various characters. Affleck has taken his game to the next level , his character and mannerisms are completely believable -he is submerged into type.As a couple of mid 40 somethings, we grew tired of the typical film genres some years ago. We long for films like this, and having seen many of the nominated films for this year (bafta), this one is by far the clear leader. Hacksaw ridge is just another glorification of war, predictable, overly violent and boring, silence is good OK but not special and the list goes on. Manchester by the sea deserves recognition for standing out in a sea of mediocrity"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 March 2020,4/10,"To make a hero out of violent head case who routinely attacks innocent people is verging on the sick. The writing and screenplay is tedious, and overall it is far too long. The huge popularity amongst film critics says a lot about the film industry and awards system. On the plus side the acting and casting is excellent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 January 2019,3/10,"This is so boring it is beyond belief. I think the other reviewers watched a different movie. Nothing of any interest happens, the end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 April 2017,4/10,"The 4 is for the acting otherwise its a 2, which is pretty good, but what a depressing dreary movie. Affleck wasn't the best actor in this movie by the way. I just kept waiting for something interesting to happen...and it didn't. Typically IMDb ratings are pretty close. I'm at a loss as to the high ratings, good acting can't save this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 March 2020,8/10,"I can understand some of the low reviews for this film. It is not an action/adventure film or a comedy film. It is a film, for want of a better word,about grief. For the first 45 minutes of this film you are wondering what is going on, why the rave reviews by the critics, but then it slowly all makes sense. If you have experienced loss, you may understand the reluctance/ numbness by Casey Affleck to start new relationships. For me, the scene where Casey is packing up his things and comes to wrapping up 3 photo frames speaks volumes. Re-connecting with his nephew at the end left you with the hope of him healing a little."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 January 2019,4/10,Nothing happens... felt like a 2 hour intro. Not for me I'm afraid.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 February 2017,4/10,"The film is pretty familiar to watch the drama is good and realistic , but i see nothing else other then how good casey afleck is acting in a drama role otherwise the film is really boring to watch and very long drama and drama nothing else then drama , i don't see the point of drama witout action or suspen that make your heart beat and make you live the moment like your in the film, anyway in my opinion its could be a better film if they added something else in the film , otherwise i respect others opinion that they may liked the film so much but its is truly an overrated film"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 December 2017,6/10,"Anyone who describes this film as a ""masterpiece"" hasn't seen any true masterpiece made before 1990. Anyone who rates this film without remarking on that intrusive and overbearing musical score has equine hearing or otherwise is prepared to sacrifice crucial dialogue for a curiously inappropriate score that pleads for emotions that the screenplay fails to muster. Not that Kenneth Lonergan, the screenwriter,is at fault. He must have been furious that even the opening dialogue is swallowed up not only by the chugging of the fishing boat, but also by that shrill and un-melodic opening piece. The performances are excellent, but overshadowed by Casey Affleck's unsympathetic Lee, prone to violence after a few drinks, probably homophobic and hostile to many in the cast. It simply could have been vastly improved by more lineal story-telling and sharper editing. When will film-makers learn that music must be background, not foreground, when actors are striving to delineate their characters through words, not music! My hearing, by the way, is fine. Frankly, the most overrated film since La La Land."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 March 2020,9/10,Excellent movie and I would thoroughly recommendBrilliant acting by Affleck and a well deserved Oscar ably supported by Michelle WilliamsAs others have said ( Spoiler Alert ) the only thing that lets it down is the editing and in particular the flashback scenesI am normally quite good at following the thread of a story but what threw me was that the young prepubescent Patrick had dark hair and dark features and the teenage hormone raging sixteen year old Patrick had red hair and a somewhat paler complexionI know they were obviously two different people and it definitely looked itAnyway once I got my head round it I was fineDefinitely worth a a watch
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 September 2017,5/10,"My wife, who wanted to watch this, fell asleep on two successive attempts to watch this film.Myself I liked Casey Afflecks performance. Albeit over the top in his morose depiction.As a movie this staggers along. As with many such movies of the day it engages in numerous flashbacks, at first almost indistinguishable and to a degree that they become highly distracting. I can't count the number of chronological diversions in this film. Nor is it clear how they add as device. Instead they seem to occur for the sake of it as this is the present day version of Hollywood story telling. With people confusing 20something flashbacks as a riveting film requiring apt attention. If a book read this way you would close the cover and chuck it.Still, I put together the countless disconnected weaves of this story into the kind of understanding of it that was intended. But still with several gaping holes in the plot.For instance the son is the progeny of a great caring man but he is somehow aloof, mean, and a chronic womanizer. With no explanation given for how this has come to pass or for why he needs a girlfriend of the day or is consumed by serial sex and or is attractive to the opposite sex. The boy would more properly be considered as a walking disaster younger version of his distraught uncle. Avoid at all costs would basically be stamped on his disturbed forehead.His mother is mentally ill, apparently is the nude on the couch although this was another flashback and poorly captured and easily missed. The movie didn't cover this at all. Why the mother is even introduced in the film is not well understood. Nor is the brief depiction of the visit adding anything to the film but an opportunity for a weird cameo by Matthew Broderick.Then the strange chicken scene. The oddest depiction of grief seen and I'm not saying that kindly. The scene was stupid, poorly conceived, poorly acted, poorly understood. Through others comments I'm supposed to equate this somehow to Patricks father being in a morgue freezer. oh..The worst scene, and acting was Casey trying to shoot himself in the police station. A depiction of the over melodrama taken in this film.Or of a hero, the protagonist, so willing to be lifelong destroyed by the fire that he would kill himself, cast away anybody that loved him or dared to try to love him (again with the unlikeliness that females would line up to throw themselves at such a depressive character) and indeed casts the boy away despite him owing his departed brother dearly. Indeed the last potential gift that life gave him to have any meaningful role he casts away so that he can rot in his eternal peace of self loathing and hate. The film ends on that note, with him giving up yet again.Its that kind of film and that kind of modern day hero I guess. Not sure what else to make of it. I enjoyed moments in the film as long as I was watching it. In retrospect it was nothing but idiosyncratic."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2018,8/10,"The fact that I actually wanted to write about such a depressing movie makes me wonder WHY? The life of both Lee and Joel is such a tragedy that can make anyone feel so sad. Not the beautiful kind of sadness, but -20 degree Fahrenheit sadness like the weather in east coast right now. Lee has to live through a mistake that he would rather kill himself for, and he kept reminding himself of it every single day by having the photos of his 3 dead kids in front of his bed. Perhaps they are exactly what keeps him from killing himself. They are what Lee cannot beat. When you can't beat it, you will have to live with it. And you will always be haunted by the defeat, regret and sorrow. In real life, sometimes it's so hard to beat it, especially when you don't know the everlasting suffer in front of you, even if you know the everlasting suffer in front of you. Not everyone is Indiana Jones or Bruce Wayne. It's always easier to say ""move on"". I guess this is what resonates with our lives in this film. The story is so real and the acting is so powerful. Casey totally deserved the Oscar. In fact every person was so real, which just makes the film even more depressing. Except for the music. First time I found Albinoni's Adagio so relieving. I'm gonna watch Silver Linings Playbook now."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2021,9/10,"One of the harshest and most realistic film i've seen
Cassey Affleck clearly deserved the Oscar for this one"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2016,1/10,"We saw it before all they ads and hype started. We hated it. What a waste of time. Actually too much like real life with dumb dysfunctional people. An ad finally came on TV saying is was funny. I started yelling at the TV. ""Funny??? Funny???? Where????? While yelling a description of some things that happened in the film. My husband came in to see if I was OK and wanted to know if I was having a seizure.It did have pretty scenery. But I would like to know how a bachelor and a teen age boy had such a clean house. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. None were likable. So, no I can't recommend it unless you are into depressing films."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2019,8/10,"This film is painfully realistic - it moves slowly, there's lots of grief and pain and awkwardness and it has no dramatic or sentimental ending.Some reviewers have written that the lack of outward grief shown in the teenage boy and then his sudden, awkward outburst over the freezer is unrealistic, but in my experience it's not. I've known a teenage boy who lost a parent to cancer and he behaved very similarly to the boy in this film. I think when a loved one dies from a terminal illness you've been grieving for a long time already so the shock is absent when the time finally comes. Sometimes busying yourself with your normal daily routine is the best way to cope with it. I think the teenager in the film embodies this kind of grief successfully.Unfortunately, for me, I've experienced a similar trauma to the main character in that both my children died very young. I can vouch that the behaviour the main character and his ex wife display is very realistic (for me anyway). That sort of grief becomes very internalised in the end. You try to hide it the best you can, but it shapes you and scars you. I think the script writer and director (Kenneth Lonergan) understood this perfectly and found some beauty in it in his film, which for me I found cathartic. This film has helped me on a personal level.A strange contradiction to the realistic feel of the dialogue and pacing is the intense melodramatic music. I can understand why this would jar with some people, but I quite liked it. For me it was a successful, balanced contrast because the music reflects the melodramatic grief the characters feel on the inside and the dialogue and acting reflect the numbness and squashed down/censored grief the characters display on the outside.There are two reasons why I don't give the film a 10/10. The female characters are much less realistically written than the male ones. They all easily fit into one dimensional stereotypes of motherly, shrew/drama queen or frivolous silly young female. I think partly why Michelle Williams outburst is so effective towards the end is because suddenly a female character breaks free from her caricature in a really direct way.Secondly I predicted the death of the children and how they died much earlier than I would have liked to. As soon as they showed the first clip of the main character with his kids in a flashback I was thinking to myself ok I get it, all the children died. And then I was wondering how - first I thought drowning, but dismissed this as Michelle Williams played a mother in 'Shutter Island' where all her children drowned. Then I considered fire and decided this was the most likely cause of the children's death, as their house looked like the type that would easily blow up and this would work better as a dramatic device in the movie than, say a car accident. I'm not sure if they could have done it any other way, but for me this was the only part of the movie that was easily predictable and so it lessened the power of it for me.Over-all though I loved this movie. I can't think of another that I've seen that has portrayed grief so realistically and sensitively and beautifully, except maybe 'Truly Madly Deeply'."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 June 2020,1/10,"Only i press is F for this film ......
I was like now story takes peak now now now and then BGM of ooooooooooo and movie ended. I was like really is this the film for that i wasted my 2 hrs !!!!!!
And depression is not like that"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 May 2021,8/10,"As with most movies involving Ben or Casey Afleck, and even Matt Damon for that matter, the story could be shortened by at least 20 minutes and still tell the story simply by eliminating all the ""F"" bombs."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 June 2020,7/10,First i heard this film wining two oscar for best screenplay and best actor. i don't have a problem with this win best actor but for screenplay i was like really!? overrated as its finest. don't get me wrong im okay with movie that go slow. but for this movie i see nothing for than two men sorrowed for their loss and trying to keep their life as normal as possible. anyway i think it's good but not for oscar level.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 August 2020,9/10,"Casey Afflect deserves high praise for his performance as a grieving, self destructive man with no purpose in life ! The emotions felt raw and very real and the supporting cast did a fantastic job too. I watched this movie years ago but its still one that I never forget and always come back too. Definitely worth watching, Casey is one of the under- rated actors that should be over-rated !"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 February 2021,9/10,"Slowly explored main character life experience truly makes me feel like I should always rethink everything my mind defines about others, before it even happens."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,,"The acting is stellar. You find yourself totally wrapped up in this intense family drama. Yet central to this story and often ignored is that the core of this drama is 100% rooted in alcohol abuse. From the opening scenes as he explains how many beers he had on the boat with his brother over how much time. Growing up in a family filled with alcoholics this is the typical rationalization. Boys will be boys, we are just having a good time. There isn't a bad event in his life that isn't precipitated by alcohol abuse. The home, the bars, fighting, and dealing with his ex. When he says "" I can't beat it"" we want to think that it's his gut wrenching grief but is it? He has lost it, lost all sense of caring, he is flat and without feeling at times unless he is drunk. Then he is a tough guy. Yet throughout it all he has people that still care about him and love him. He has a horrible burden but he is still luckier than he realizes."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 March 2018,10/10,"This movie hits you in the gut and the heart. It's gut wrenching and heartbreaking.I can't ever remember watching a movie where I was so uncomfortable watching a character in a scene, but that's what Casey Affleck was able to do with his Oscar winning performance. It's all ready been well established what a terrific actress Michelle Williams is, and she was also brilliant in this as well.You get so sucked into every scene in this movie where Casey Affleck's character is. He wasn't acting, he became the character in the film. Because he did such a good acting job, you forget you're even watching a movie, and you actually feel uncomfortable for the other characters in a lot of the scenes. It's also extremely original (rare for Hollyweird nowadays) and I've never seen anything quite like it. It sticks with you for a while, and it's really hard to watch, but so worth it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,3/10,"This was an awful movie and I must have checked my clock 50 times hoping it must be almost over! This is the most depressing movie ever made! Did the actors in it do well? Yes! Each one portrayed their soul sucking, make me want to kill myself roles perfectly! Wow! I absolutely believed they all hated their lives! Seriously, maybe I don't watch movies for the same reasons other people do but I want to be entertained or informed or at least moved! Again, the actors in the film are incredible! They truly delved deep into their roles. I just don't want to sit through a movie that every character feels like a Dementor from Harry Potter! When they are on screen, I feel cold like all the happiness in the world has been sucked out and will never return. Instead of watching this crap, go out and learn how to make a hangman's noose, it'll give you the same feeling!!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 November 2021,4/10,"Really that's it? I don't know how this movie got such high praise with ABSOLUTELY NO ENDING!! The acting was really good and the story was pretty good but slow 🐌 but the slowness
didn't bother me dramas are normally slow but it literally felt like the writer was like ""weeeeeeellllllll I'm board with this story so let's just stop here and call it a day. That's a wrap people everyone go home"" it was seriously annoying my 4 stars are for the great acting..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 April 2020,9/10,This is a film the way they used to be. Well done story and character development. I feel sorry for the people who thought it was too slow. Most audiences today have to have the constant action and explosions of super hero movies.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,2/10,"My husband & I just watched this movie and I cannot believe how bad this is. Characters are so unlikeable, the score is distracting and awful, story is terrible. I was so disappointed since this is an Oscar nominated movie for the film and for the actors. The acting was not good. A total waste of time and not entertaining at all. The only promising thing I can say about the movie is the scenery. The town is right next to the ocean and is really pretty. The only likable character is the brother who dies at the beginning. I usually don't take the time to review a movie but this one is so bad, I just had to put my thoughts on this site."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 August 2018,6/10,A slow movie - build a lot of background. Depicting real emotions with slowly converging plot to the main message. One thing you realize after watching the movie is intense lifelong pain a silly mistake can lead you to.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2017,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea manages to be subtle and strong at the same time, never falls into melodrama, and gives the impression of being real at all times. The credit goes to Kenneth Lonergan, who directs and writes and succeeds in both roles. The film is not rushed, has excellent representation of the daily, a great direction of actors, and the script is singular and daring. The words are correct and loaded with symbolism, the silence is very representative, and the metaphors is interesting. The unexpected use of a mild humor naturally inserted and very tenuous, even in heavy contexts, is very happy, inventive, and reinforces the naturalness of the movie.The picture has other trumps. The editing work here is fundamental, both for narrative non-linearity and for the considerable amount of plans. Scene and time transitions are calm, intelligible, and organic. The cinematography has an inflexible commandment to observe the story. There are no great camera moves (and when it comes out of the tripod it's never abrupt) or daring angles, and the post-production is invisible. The shades of blue that prevail throughout the film, in addition to being very beautiful, create a mood melancholic and cold, but never impersonal, which is enhanced by the excellent score. A celestial symphony, solemn, serene, almost funereal that carries the audience.The performances are another highlight. The set creates a palpable world and characters. Casey Affleck has a cadenced performance and conveys with his gaze and gestures the immense pain that this man carries, and which lives constantly disturbed and in a mode of self-destruction and self-punishment. Lucas Hedges is vivacious, and completely free of clichés of the genre, he builds a credible young with multiple and conflicting layers. Kyle Chandler and Michelle Williams, despite reduced screen time, have solid performances. He is charismatic and generates empathy in the public. And she in each of her scenes has a powerful and painful interpretation, with a huge explosion of feelings and incredible dramatic features.Intimate, believable and powerful, Manchester by the sea is beautiful and grandiose to have the honesty and courage to show that sometimes life is so broken that it is impossible to repair, it at maximum sets. A masterpiece."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 March 2017,8/10,"I feel like this movie could have been better and it doesn't however mean that it's bad either.More than the plot around which the actors revolve,the kind of expression that Casey Affleck could muster and exhibit of course deserves attention and delving into.The withdrawn yet inwardly gusty psyche of the Uncle(Casey)can be felt but not be seen anywhere in the film.Especially his response has never been so compulsive or impulsive while dealing with the nephew who mostly is unaware of his uncle's circumstances.It is capable that much to draw one's core feelings out sometimes.The movie could have ended better but we need to understand this is life.Generally speaking Casey had been able to exhibit what the director truly wanted irrespective of the plot and that's to me the strongest part of this film.This movie has much to teach or to learn from especially about parenthood and juvenile orientations.Even as anything otherwise,your time won't be wasted."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2017,8/10,"Firstly Casey Affleck deserved his Oscar. He managed to give out to the audience so many feelings while his role had so little expression. He managed to show us how this man stuffed it all in without expressing to anybody nor his feelings nor his thoughts. Also the rest of the cast did a really good job. Impressively enough even the youngest actor Lucas Hedges, was extremely good. Also I should mention that a really good performance was given by Michele Williams. About the script, I found that it was somewhat excessive at some points. It felt like Lonergan was trying to stuff some more drama where there was already too much of it. Although I must admit that it was impressive the way he did the backs and forths inside the movie. I think that it is quite difficult to have so many anachronisms added so successfully. I mean it was quite clear in which time of the story you were, and it didn't leave you with any gaps. Lonergan did a really good job with the main story, and with all the subplot, and in my opinion this movie had more to offer than some drama. It had really well roundrd characters and none of them was a hero. I was all totally realistic and I think that is why it was so emotional."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,4/10,"How disappointed I am to see today's movies. Either lacking of substance or just simply distastefully full of sex scenes which is supposed to give some sort of oversight to the lack of plot and substance? Why must I be relegated to watching older American and also older and present day foreign films for actual substance in movies these days.Seeing 8.4 on the IMDb was why I chose to watch this movie and also believing that perhaps this lead was better than his brother. The plot and lead fell flat with the movie ending and leaving me feeling I wasted my time.Affleck, much like his brother, had one face, one expression with little depth behind it for most of the movie. There were parts where one might think something is going to happen that makes this movie worthwhile, but nothing does. In the end, I thought, well maybe this is just a boring, ""Based on a true story"" so it wasn't supposed to be creative or interesting. However, I felt annoyed at the end of this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 September 2018,9/10,"This title totally and absolutely enveloped me, real life and touching stories of how life occurrences can affect us and that not every story portrays a happy ending, shows growth as it is; a continual process..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2021,,"7.8?? seriously, this movie is clearly overrated ! most of the movie is boring"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 June 2019,8/10,"The best film to come out of 2016. Casey Affleck turns in one of the greatest cinematic performances of all time. Excellent supporting cast as well. Direction, writing and characters are all front and center and you go along with a very dramatic but empathetic showcase. Well done by all!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 June 2020,1/10,"Looking to watch a feel good movie I mistakenly chose this one. Trying to escape for a couple of hours from the reality of Covid, rioters destroying our country and our economy being destroyed, this made me actually feel worse. Small children killed in a fire, moms who abandon their children and the father who stays dies suddenly at a young age and the survivors turn on each other. I warmed my family not to watch!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 December 2020,7/10,"Manchester by the sea has a stunning atmosphere that takes you inside, you lost while you are watching. This movie probably can come slow and inadequate for many people because of his vibe but it is drama my friend. You should be patient when you watched then you can feel yourself as a part of the story cause the movie provides that to you. The movie is going on very plain and calm. In the movie you can obviously see emotions of characters: unrest, despair and regret. Script and dialogs were wonderful for the story and they successfully show vibe of movie but there are some problems in editing part in my opinion, during the whole movie they have used flashbacks and until the first hour, scenes are very intertwined and incomprehensible. You can't understand what happening there at the beginning but on the other hand in every flashbacks we are going to the deeper side of Lee Chandler's inside and learning his past, memories and why he is like that. In short some flashback scenes were unintelligible at first but generally they were nice.In the movie both of the leading actors were very gorgeous: Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. No wonder Casey Affleck has received an Oscar award for his performance in this movie. He deserved this till the end because he was very successful and natural, like i said beginning their performances take you inside of story and reinforce power of feeling.In the scene that Lee and Randi encounter on the street, both of them was very impressive. Especially Lee couldn't say almost anything but he was felt his emotions to us. I can say cinematography was adequate we have seen many sights from town and sea and I loved it.In short, If you a person that likes drama you should watch it. There are not too many things like this one. The emotions felt in the movie were so powerful."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 April 2017,6/10,"I found ""Manchester by the Sea"" to be an incredibly dull, boring and uninspiring 2 hour and 17 minute piece of melodrama that went nowhere. The acting was okay in some scenes, but nothing too spectacular, especially that of Casey Affleck. I understand his character is supposed to be an introvert who is angry at himself, but even during the scenes where he was supposed to be emotional, he still continued to have the same wooden expression on his face, and the same monotone voice. I do not think that he deserved to win an Oscar for this movie, as I felt he largely played himself in the entire movie. Lukas Hedges did a decent job of playing an annoying character, but I still really could not stand the way his character was written. I understand teens are obnoxious, but this kid's father just died, and he does not care whatsoever. All he cares about are his girlfriends, his hockey, his friends, and his crappy band. And the only scene where he does show emotion, he's crying over frozen chicken. I rolled my eyes so hard at that scene, it was so bad. Michelle Williams always plays the same annoying character from Dawson's Creek in every movie, and this was no exception, although this time, she laid a crappy Boston accent over it. The only actor in this who I thought was great was Kyle Chandler, and he is a pretty underrated actor in general, and it sucks that he did not have more scenes in the movie, I felt he even could have played Casey's character better than Casey did. I think that the script had decent promise, and I did not have a problem with the ending like others do here, but it really fell flat for me with the performances.As somebody who occasionally enjoys a family drama film, this one did not do it for me, as it came off as too melodramatic for me. The reason I have given this a 6 out of 10 was for the story and the characters' potential, but I cannot give it more than that, because the acting was too overdone in some scenes."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 September 2018,2/10,Utter swill. This is one of the only movies I have ever walked out of. A classic example of Hollywood mistaking a dead-inside emotionless vibe for quality acting and storytelling.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,2/10,"I love movies. I love movies about regular people. I enjoy movies that take place around New England, because that's where I am from and where I live. - So while this movie contains elements I would generally love (regular people, New England, etc) I couldn't get through this garbage. - It was so bad I actually stopped watching before the final 15 minutes. And you might be saying ""well you didn't give the movie a fair shot because so-and-so happened at the end and made it all worth it"" - and you might be right. I generally go on the message boards here on IMDb to learn about stuff like that. But since they're gone, and these reviews contain ""no spoilers"", I'll never know. - This movie was bad. Nothing good happens. It's depressing and full of sad-sack characters. Lots of cursing, which I don't mind, and I know it's very New-England-y, but come on - it's really too much. It tries way too hard. I almost never give up on a movie. I love movies - I'll watch anything. This was just plain terrible."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 January 2021,7/10,"The music/score to this film was absolutely, painstakingly horrible. Had to mute it, it was so bad. It ruined a great performance and a great story... the ending was very anticlimactic too."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 July 2021,9/10,"This is not your everyday HooHaa Movie. This Movie is intense once you get attached to those character. Grief is a very powerful thing, it can make you or destroy you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 August 2021,4/10,"If you like getting depressed, then this is your movie. Not even a single try to put things in another perspective."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2017,7/10,"Oscar season unearths a wave of scepticism deep within me. The academy rarely rewards the best all round titles of the year and instead prefers to reward the films that are deemed 'Oscar worthy' by the establishment. The 'best film' category is usually littered with 'worthy' or 'thought provoking' titles which include ripe martial for good performances by its lead actors but they are rarely the 'best films' of the year. Dallas Buyers Club (co-incidentally with the same IMDb rating as the title I am reviewing today) is a recent example of a title with admirable subject matter and wonderful performances but was it the 'best film' of the year? Not by a long shot. The best film category in my opinion should be renamed 'most worthy subject matter combined with strong performances'. Upon its release I was convinced that Manchester by the Sea was another example of a 'best film' nominee that is full of good performances but lacks the qualities of a truly memorable cinematic experience. As a result my own advice prevented me from seeing this title at the cinema but I was recently stuck on the long haul flight to the US so I deemed this the perfect opportunity to confirm my preconceptions. Kenneth Lonergan has various credits against his name but primarily away from the camera and instead behind a desk writing screenplays and stories for titles such as Analyze This and That. This is his third directorial outing and I was surprised by the confidence this title exhibits as a result. This is a bleak yet bold portrayal of a harsh life in the suburbs of the US expertly illustrated by the colour pallet & cinematography. It would be remiss of me to not discuss the performance of Casey Affleck within this film and I am pleased to say that he is fully deserving of the best actor award. I have been a fan of his work for some time and he has finally found a character that perfectly complements his talents as an actor. He is an unassuming individual who is tortured by his past. You can see the anger and sadness brimming just beneath the surface and he makes this film work due to this towering performance.I do wish to add a disclaimer to this review as this film is certainly not for the faint of heart. This is two and a half hours of truly harrowing subject matter. If you have ever experienced loss in your life I assure you this title will unearth any buried feelings you may have from the past. This is indeed a testament to the way the film is constructed but on the other hand it does mean that you are not given an easy ride. So as you can probably tell my preconceptions were incorrect with this particular title. I certainly wont be in a hurry to watch this again but this is a strong all round picture that delves into loss, heart ache and our ability to move on from trauma."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 January 2017,1/10,"Perhaps one of the worst films to start the year off with; the film began simply enough, with a few flash backs and a few references to general guiding story lines of the movie, but then it all went downhill from there. In this film, there is not really a climax, nor really any kind of action/plot at all. It is basically Affleck avoiding his past when he has to go and take care of his brother's kid, who is just another awkward twist to the movie. The kid is an egomaniac, who has two girlfriends, is a general jacka** to everyone, and is generally obnoxious during the whole movie. The part that really got me, and several other people who left the movie before it ended (I stayed hoping it was going to get better) was the extremely awkward scenes, or the awkward persona of Casey Affleck. There would be minutes of just sitting around, which became common enough that about 40% of the film is just awkward conversation or awkward encounters, which is probably why such a film with no actual substance lasted a horrifying 2 hours long. And then to top it all off, the Bostonian ethnicity shared by everyone in the movie made every conversation appear like an argument, with great amounts of language, which although trying to accurately portray the regional people, became more of an ear sore for those who can have conversations without abysmal amounts of language.I would give it a 2/10 for the occasional laugh that it gave, but for 2 hours of screen time, I can't find a reason why it would deserve it.(This film is highly rated on this website, but me and most people I have talked to who have seen it all agree it was not that great. It definitely was not a highlight film, so perhaps those who did see it are refreshed by some of the themes? Regardless, I did not enjoy the film, and will be seeing La La Land to make up for it tomorrow.)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 March 2018,10/10,"Refreshingly mundane yet heartbreaking. When the mood strikes to watch great cinema, I get a sense of unease. Countless times have I been let down by the conventional storylines of some rather promising films. No names. This film however, had plenty of opportunities to go down the path that gives us all a sense of empty closure we'll find in other productions. Manchester by the Sea delivers on the gritty side of close family bonds. It felt incredibly real and I connected, almost instantly, with the entire cast (one exception, see below) The performances were not patronising in the slightest and therefore didn't assume we're all idiots. It's a 10 from me because I haven't once been rewarded like this whilst my expectations were as high. Not to end on a sour note but my only issue with this film is Matthew Brodrick's character. I hope I missed something there whilst taking a sip of tea but I could have done without him, especially considering the lack of follow-up. Otherwise, as perfect as my taste of film can get. Thank you all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,3/10,"I loved the trailer to this movie! I love a good drama with a great cast. This movie, however, is NOT its trailer. The actual film feels like an experiment gone wrong. It has bits of awkward/ineffective humor where it does not belong... Not good/witty bits like a Coen bros or Alex Payne movie, but more like a student film. The directorial and editorial choices seem like a movie that hasn't moved out of the assembly phase yet. And the score... oh man... The score feels like terrible temp drop-ins. I can't blame the script, because the script can ultimately be honed in by the director during shooting. This movie is just ineffective and way too long. I'm not exaggerating when I say this film's run time can be cut in half. The worst part about all of this is that you can see there is a very moving film buried in the contents somewhere. Very frustrated by this piece."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 June 2019,5/10,I didn't like it. I watched it though because of the hype for it on the internet. I don't know where's the problem exactly but I didn't catch up with it for almost 90 minutes of screenplay!
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 August 2020,8/10,"It's not a blockbuster movie, its not about great plot twists, action or grand moments in history. It's a moment in the life of people who have been through something very traumatic. So if your not in to that, its not for you. Otherwise this film is a must see. I would love to give it even a higher grade but for that I have to see if it stands the test of time and if its still a favourite of mine in a couple of years. It's beautifully acted and left me feeling all kind of things. And as Kidman put it so lovely: the film made me feel less alone. The ending is a little bit too sudden for my taste, but it makes sense and I wouldnt know how to end it differently."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 April 2017,6/10,Manchester by the sea should have been a good movie if the director have worked a little on the story and screenplay. Casey Affleck have given his all time good performance. But then the story doesn't have any strong points which can hold the audience back to their seat. At times the director tried to bring teary emotions to the characters but that seemed not to interest viewers. This is an ordinary movie with the writer trying to put tragedies in between to steam up emotions but that fail to capture audiences' heart. Other than the matured acting by Casey Affleck the movie doesn't have much good points to be proud of.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,9/10,"I love movies. Movies bring us joy and happiness. IN this case it doesn't. It brings us sadness and the fear of living a life where the past is what makes us who were are. Lee Chandler, a handyman in Boston, is suddenly brought back to his hometown where his brother, Joe Chandler, passes away and is named the legal guardian of his 16 yr old son, Patrick Chandler. Let me start off that Casey Affleck was absolutely amazing in this movie. His cheer emotion was so real. I wasn't watching Casey Affleck, I was watching a completely different character. In my opinion, his best performance to date. Lucus Hedges was also very good. Not as good as Affleck, but still one of the better performances of the movie. All in all, this movie is a must see. The only reason why it wouldn't get a 10/10 is because I feel like this movie has no re watchability. I don't think you can have the same emotion the second time around. But that's just what I feel. Highly recommend this movie to anybody."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 December 2016,3/10,"I was very disappointed in this movie. While I found it sometimes engaging and well-acted, the story was depressing and simply a slice of real life and not entertainment. I didn't see any real growth in the characters or any hope for the future. It almost felt like a documentary or reality show.The title made me expect that the movie had more to do with life in a quaint, sunny coastal town. While there were a couple of scenes in a boat, it didn't look like a place I would want to spend time.I found the music to be annoying and distracting. There were a few instances where I couldn't hear the dialogue because the music was too loud.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 October 2017,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is heavy on the heart. Kenneth Lonergan has my respect for directing Casey Affleck in such a way to unveil a genuine and emotional performance. Many times the silence in this film is the most effective dialogue as we try and dissect the character of Lee Chandler who has suffered immeasurable trauma in his life. The way he handles conversations in the beginning is comical until we start to get the impression this isn't just a grumpy, cynical man, but a seriously shaken and disturbed man. One thing worth mentioning is that our protagonist doesn't change; this can make a movie seem longer than it is. That is not to say Lee Chandler isn't put in pressured situations because he definitely is, but through everything he stays the same. I have to say that upset me a little bit, I was hoping to see something new from him at least. The most powerful lines in the film for me were ""There is nothing there"" & ""I can't beat it"" Both of these lines coming during arguments defining how Lee views his life and current situation. The cinematography is stunning, the acting is wonderful, an amazing move that had me emotional. Although I can't help but wonder if there was an opportunity to dive just a bit deeper and discover something else. Side bar: Part of me wondered how Patrick was able to handle his father's death so well."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 May 2021,10/10,"This is an outstanding film, brilliantly written and directed. Casey Affleck gives one of 'the' most amazing performances of a generation, better even than his his brother in law in Joker. Casey IMHO is probably the greatest actor of his generation bar none. You all have to watch him in Jesse James, or the disturbing The Killer inside me, to realise he is very special. In this he delivers the most understated yet powerful performance of a broken individual you will ever see. Spellbinding and brilliant. Watch this film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 December 2018,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is one of the rawest dramas in recent years, and it is not for everyone; however it is a thought provoking,moving film glowing with terrific performances.
Casey Affleck is remarkable as Lee Chandler, his emotional, troubled performance truly captures the effect of the tragedies in his life and his angry,melancholy personality that has been shaped by these events. He manages to incredibly portray the despondence and bleakness of Lee,making us feel like he really has immersed himself in the role, yet in the rare moments where he shows glimpses of happiness he is simply wonderful to watch.
Lucas Hodges and Affleck are great to watch; their chemistry is superb with the ability to truly shine together in the poignant, touching moments of the film,while still managing to achieve excellent humour in various stages of the movie.
Kenneth Lonergan has done a magnificent effort in creating the sombre,desolate mood for the film with the settings and characters. A beautiful watch,guaranteed to make u think deeply and sentimentally about life and your world."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 March 2021,9/10,"All my friends say that it's boring but i ABSOLUTELY love it! While i do find the ending quite frustrating it's realistic, has some great characters and tear jerking moments :D"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 August 2021,10/10,"I'll start by stating the obvious: both supporting actors (Williams and Hedges) give stunning performances, but ultimately Affleck's performance and Lonergan's direction is what makes this heart wrenching story feel so painfully real.The realism of Manchester by the Sea's depiction of loss is driven by subtlety. It's not about the dramatic death bed scene or over the top monologues. Many of the most emotionally raw moments are played in wide shot, our out-of-ear shot, in order to be defamiliarized to the audience and create the sense of alienation that comes with grief. We experience Lee's grief through the veil of fatigue that ultimately controls his life and makes it impossible for him to see the world beyond himself.The scene in which Randi and Lee come across each other on the street is one of the most beautifully written in film. Two people who have gone through the same tragedy, both desperately want to reconnect because they are the only two people who share the intimacy of fully understanding each other's brokenness. But they can't even make eye contact because they see their pain mirrored in each other. Randi (Williams) tells Lee (Affleck) ""you can't just die"". And this is where the brilliance of Lonergan's directing truly shines. Instead of the expected cliché over the top dialogue, Lonergan uses Lee's guarded posture and dismissive words, in order to convey the way in which he feels that he owes it to her and to his children to never let himself ""live"" again. Affleck's character will forever feel like he doesn't deserve that second chance at life no matter how bad she might want that for him.While most films about grief are driven by melodrama and manipulation, Manchester by the Sea is a perfect portrait of grief. In the sense that grief isn't about the big dramatic scenes, it's about the day to day moments. It's about the waves. It's about your body simply existing in the present but your mind living in the past. And that's why Lonergan's use of flashbacks is so flawless. Lonergan understands we don't need a time stamp or an explanation because these are simply the places Lee's mind travels back to during the empty life he's now burdened to live."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 November 2020,2/10,"Just drags along, drags along some more, then just ends. Affleck whines his way thru the flick...just annoying to no end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 May 2021,10/10,"Fantastic story with truly phenomenal performances from Casey Affleck, Michelle Williams & Lucas Hedges."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,10/10,"It's a story about how the main character Lee's (Casey Affleck) brother (Kyle Chandler) dies and leaves a 16 year old son Patrick (Lucas Hedges) behind. Lee didn't expect that, so how will he handle it?The film's main focus was the weirdness of the main character Lee. He was different and these questions rose all the time: is he OK, is he normal, what happened to him, why is he like that, does he have some mental disease (I really know someone who has in ""real life"" and they act exactly like Lee). The cinematography was very neat, clean, tidy and some camera angles were really interesting (the mother sleeping on the couch, for example). There were many flashbacks and sometimes it took me time to differentiate past from present.It portrayed the working-middle class environment (those red brick houses), small spaces, small congested rooms and it had that sense of normality and majority in it. As if the characters were very average normal people (the way the microwave is set in the kitchen with some ""Kellogg's"" on top)...And there was a little bit the sense of routine and boredom (for them, not for me watching).Then with the death stepping in everyone seemed to become rather dysfunctional...And the creators were especially focusing on ""the awkward stuff"", the taboo type of things...I cannot say I still understood Lee, his character and what really happened to him and why is he like this at the end of the film. However there were happy moments too and they were with Patrick - his nephew. I liked their relationship, their talks and how conditions made them be together and all that process...There were some really funny dialogues too.So the film had that mood of when somebody in the family dies, all the world around starts looking and behaving weird. It's that stage of adaptation to the new world (without that person who left) and redefining oneself again. That loss and awkwardness is felt everywhere and in everyone in the film. Of course the snow and naked branches in the background reinforce it even more...There was nothing brutal, it was the normality and casualty of death that was depicted (and how it affected the characters).Casey Affleck was that guy Lee so much, that it was hard to believe he was acting. His ""glassy"" eyes, his walk, posture and the way he spoke with all the pauses was very ""lethargic"" feeling, like that state of complete weariness and depression was getting to me...Patrick was like the complete opposite - young and lively, normal and logical. Lucas Hedges did a great job, he created a very interesting and likable teen character and the mood lightened up a bit when he was around. But the way he was not given the chance to mourn was absurd (and it's nobody's fault).Kyle Chandler (Joe, the dad) appeared for not so long, just in the flashbacks mainly and...as the dead body. He was the character of a great dad, well liked and caring who had a special bond with his son.So yes, I did like this movie, but it was not ""Wow, I'm inspired, let's go and dance!!""...It was a really sad film and it made me feel sorry for everyone, but ""this is life"". We will all have to deal with this sooner or later, so it unites us in a way. Perhaps it's just important to know how to appreciate what we have and things will fall into places..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 December 2016,3/10,"Why is a film with a plot no different from a Lifetime movie getting acclaim? Supposedly, the writing and acting are superior, making the simple story seem more weighty than it is. But, sadly, the screenplay's ""touching"" moments are self-conscious and precious. The pacing is slow and, at 137 minutes, way, way too long. The writer/director seems to have fallen in love with scenes that have nothing to do with moving the film forward. There is a great performance by an actor, but not by Casey Affleck, whose one-note performance is nowhere near Oscar caliber. Lucas Hedges is brilliant, almost bringing life to this moribund tale - but not quite. Lonergan takes us on a dreary journey with unlikeable characters, to a place not worth going to. To say this film is overrated would be an understatement."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 February 2017,10/10,"It may seem that the term ""subtle"" is what this movie is all about. It does not give you great plot-twists, or great revelations about how to deal with grief, or cliché slogans for ""moving forward"". It just gives you grief, as it is, no over-dramatization, no forced antagonism. On the other hand, it is so courageous, so bold in its execution and message that one can easily say it's provocative, especially in the face of ordinary Hollywood dramas.The movie really shows you what Sartre meant when he wrote ""hell is other people"". Nobody truly understands what you're going through, nobody can really make it up to you after you've lost everything. The movie is extremely bold, since it gives you no catharsis at all. What is also astonishing and daring is that the movie is respectful to the sorrow, certainly more than the characters on the screen. It keeps its distance to the main character, it understands, it doesn't interfere to give us a glimpse of hope or anything to make the us feel better about ourselves.What really gets you is the brief conversation between Affleck and Williams. This is a scene that will instantly become a classic, so full of unsaid words, yearnings, promises, apologies..The amount of emotion that went into that scene is simply overwhelming, there hasn't been an equivalent to that scene, at least not recently. Just go and watch this film and I can only promise you that you will feel the pain."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2016,7/10,"This movie was pretty jarring emotionally. Being the hard ass macho man that I am I did my best not to let the waterworks run. Not an easy task. Watching this as a father is like watching Old Yeller on steroids.However, as emotionally reserved as the main character was, I kept looking for a scene where he would just completely lose it; that I would finally be pushed over the edge and flood the theater with tears. Never got there. That may not be the case with everyone who sees this movie, but I was really holding it back and after two hours of gut wrenching drama I just needed to get it out.But unlike the teenage nephew who finally gets his rocks off with the girlfriend, this round of heavy petting never reached a climax. I felt like I was stuck on third base with the team's best hitter striking out. Of course, that's what happens when you think about baseball.I will have to see this movie again to truly evaluate it, but if you like sad sad movies, a new king has been anointed."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea shows you in a great detail how a life with PTSD may look like. But it is only partly about the traumatic past. The main focus is on present life challenges and how PTSD interferes with overcoming them. The main character, Lee, solves some of the present issues - the ones he has to, because there is really no choice, but his stress disorder prevents him from achieving much more and makes him loose multiple opportunities. His avoidance behaviour can be seen throughout the movie.There are outbursts of uncontrolled anger, moments of deep sadness and overwhelming symptoms of mental stress (and depression). What is not shown are some physical symptoms of PTSD.There is both support form the town community and some hidden hatred. Apart from Lee there are other characters who manage to cope (up to some degree) with the consequences of the same traumatic event.For those who struggle with their own stress disorders it might be relieving to watch Manchester by the Sea. For those who never experienced anything like that in their lives the movie might prepare them just in case by showing what kind of pitfalls await there, which are obvious from cinema chair perspective, but doesn't need to be in real life.Having said that, the technical aspects of the movie are great. The pace and the length of the movie are just right as well as intervening funny events. Shooting is great too and actor's play is amazing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 March 2017,9/10,"A beautifully tragic film. Emotions aren't stirred solely by story, this is a slow burner drama, crafted magnificently. The manly Massachusetts men heightened the story as well as the dark humour neatly laced throughout. I liked how the obviously touching scenes such as the boy finding out his old man had died and the funeral were shown but not spoken. The funeral scene was also accompanied by a deeply moving violin piece, other scenes where also improved by beautiful opera music. Cases Affleck(Lee) was perfect. His 'nothing there' character seemed an extension of his performance in Out of the Furnace. Lee had obviously been beaten by life but his heart and love shone through, particularly post beat down when he offers to buy his nephews burgers and then breaks down in tears and also when he sits by the kids bed. Everyone else was fantastic but Affleck was memorable. I think this is a family film. It shows how love can be all but dissipated but a wee ginger headed kid can get someone, somewhat, back on track. Humour is also integral to love and a lack of it, dinner with Broderick, is hell. Keep on fishing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 November 2019,9/10,"Funny, witty and oh so human. I discovered that I was laughing out loud several times through the movie. Well done!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 August 2017,9/10,"It is a calm film you can see it with facility, the resource of flashbacks is well employed in the movie, the acting of Casey Affleck seems to be rare at the beginning, but as you know the character you realize why is it like that. Very good acting, the photography also is awesome."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 November 2020,8/10,"It's just an amazing performance by Casey affleck.
The screenplay wasn't that good."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 August 2017,1/10,"I rarely write on here, but I'm so frustrated that I wasted 2+ hours of my time on this. How on EARTH did this get nominated for so awards. It started out and I really thought it was going to get interesting. Just a bunch of random horrible events happen to him, but the characters are so under developed that you couldn't really care less. All the scenes are long and drawn out, but they're not interesting or visually intriguing, so I found myself just waiting for them to be over. The characters were flat and even when they were emotional, I had no sympathy. Casey Affleck became guardian of his nephew, but the father never told him? Strange. Then the fire happens and kills all 3 of his kids, they seem to just glaze right over that. He doesn't cry or anything because he's 'a man'. The whole movie is this banter between him and his nephew like nothing happened, just banter and it's not funny or entertaining or thought provoking or anything!!I could go on, but don't want to waste any more time on this. The only way I could be more angry about this is if I paid to see it.This just proves how the all these award groups are a total waste -- it's all some marketing ploy that sensationalizes movies to get more people to watch it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 May 2017,1/10,"I was truly looking forward to seeing this movie. However, after watching the entire movie, I don't understand any of the positive hype. Perhaps Amazon's looming clout in the film industry influenced Academy Award voters to choose the male leading actor and screenplay. But in my view, the nomination of this movie for any award cheapens the critical review process. Once again, the public is likely to be misled by voters who have an entirely different agenda than selecting performances that will prove either worthy or enjoyable to everyday audiences. To be clear, I considered this a total waste of time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,10/10,"A truly refreshing title in the cinema industry. We enter the story of a middle age man facing serious existential questions, apparently with no emotions at all. If we can find the beginning of the movie quite lame, somehow it captivates us when we understand the very-well written plot. We discover Casey Affleck as an all-around actor we didn't know, showing us sides of despair and sides of joy, with unprecedent authenticity. I highly recommend this movie, not for being particularly entertaining, but to make the viewer pay attention to details, to emotions and the complexity of human relations. With this performance, I also think Casey Affleck joined the restricted group of the ""sharks of acting"": will it be enough for the Oscar? I don't know, but I believe he will get it, sooner or later."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2019,1/10,"There is no growth, no acceptance, no coming to terms, no NOTHING in this waste of time. It's just 2+ hours of Casey Affleck slouching and staring."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,8/10,"#Manchesterbythesea is a drama written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan. The movie tells the dramatic story of the Chandler family, following in particular the character of Lee (Casey Affleck), a Boston all-rounder who is forced to return to his native city to take care of his nephew (Lucas Hedges) after the death of his brother. The film for its entire duration proceeds through flashbacks that shed light on the past of Lee Chandler and moments of ""current events"" in which the uncle and nephew build an incredible relationship of friendship and mutual love. Without revealing the details of this incredible (sad) story I feel the need to tell you that even if this movie is difficult to deal with emotionally, it fully satisfied me for three main reasons: 1) The actors are fantastic (Affleck deserves the Oscar) and the screenplay is truly realistic, nothing seems out of place or overly dramatic / far-fetched. 2) The direction is brilliant and makes perfect use of the location, the desolate city on the sea perfectly frames the film. 3) This movie, for once, does not tell everything. It does not fully meet the spectator and doesn't deliver easy answers to his questions. The director through the silent protagonist invites the public to observe carefully leaving us completely free to interpret the dialogues and the various positions of the characters. Lee Chandler is in fact the protagonist, but he does not act like he is. Lee and the audience in this film are always together : together they receive the hard news, together they recall the past, and Lee never expresses something that the public has no way to grasp and understand. (A bit like in Paterson, we are the real protagonists). Score 8.5/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 December 2016,5/10,"Manchester By The Sea tells the story of Lee Chandler, an ordinary man who goes to work as a custodian and comes home from work. His pattern only deviates by a visit to a bar to down a few beers. He's a man who's drowning in grief and guilt that is only exacerbated by a call that his brother is in the hospital, only to get there and find out that he's passed away. Lee takes care of funeral arrangements and attends the reading of the will and is shocked by the revelation that he has been chosen as the guardian of his brother's son, Patrick.I want to preface this review by saying that I really liked Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count on Me and loved Margaret (the extended version). I thought both were excellent movies that showed ordinary characters dealing with ordinary life, some coming-of-age due to a trauma (Margaret), or two siblings still marred by the tragedy of childhood (You Can Count On Me) but this? This was horribly disappointing.There is no real arc or progression with the character of Lee. He changes slightly at the end, in a way that's understandable and realistic, but also wholly unsatisfying. It certainly doesn't justify the running time of almost two hours and twenty minutes. The movie starts as a series of scenes that establish Lee as a character and never really changes gears, nothing ever really builds, scenes just happen.A lot has been written about the performances here, but each and every performances is held back by the script. Michelle Williams, while very good, is relegated to maybe five to ten minutes of screen-time. The most talked about scene in the movie where she and Lee stumble upon each other in the street is the movie's best, but because the movie takes so long to get there, it dampens the impact the movie wants the audience to feel. Casey Affleck, who I consider a very good actor, doesn't have much to work with. He plays the character in the best possible way but it's not worth all the accolades that have been thrown his way. Lucas Hedges plays precocious and annoying well, I'll give him that. Some say the same about Anna Paquin in Lonergan's previous film, Margaret, but at least that movie gave us enough of a reason why. Here, Hedges' Patrick shows one moment of grief for his father, has one uncomfortable lunch with his mother, and spends the rest of the movie bickering with Lee or trying to have sex with one of his two girlfriends. His character feels more like a stereotype, and a plot device, rather than a fully realized character.There could've been a great movie made out of Manchester By The Sea. If the script had been shortened and extensively revised, taking out the repetitious bickering between Lee and Patrick, and the 'cutesy' character moments that were supposed to be humorous only to fall flat on its face. Somewhere within the movie, the elements exist for, at the very least, a good movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2016,2/10,"This is a potentially good story extremely poorly told. First of all, the pace of the dialogue reminds me of a poor college or high school production in which you can count ""1-2-3"" between each exchange of dialogue, meaning there is no flow or rhythm to the dialogue. I sat there saying, ""Who directed this film! Who edited it!""Second, the film is visually boring. Most scenes are filmed with a camera on a tripod, and the room in which they're taking place (living room, bedroom, tavern, car, etc.) are stage-sets. The camera is still, and people act in front of it as if they're on a stage--or in a TV sitcom or detective show. The camera rarely MOVES. This is a MOVIE; is not the camera supposed to MOVE?Third, I can't believe awards are being given to the director and to Casey Affleck. Affleck has a purely one-dimensional role except when he punches people in the face--they look like ""set-up scenes"" as the director says, ""OK, now go into a sudden rage."" His acting grew tiring very fast. (No, I don't care about rumors of his off-screen behavior in evaluating his performance anymore than I cared that Judy Garland was addicted to booze or pills.) I would have walked out, but I wanted to see the ending, based on the spoilers I've read in several reviews. What a contrast this movie is to ""Moonlight"". There the dialogue flows beautifully and is written stunningly. The camera work is amazing; it won't win any awards for cinematography, but it should--not a single shot is of a sunrise, moon rise, vast vistas, etc., but, seen on a big screen with excellent surround stereo, every scene is composed to perfect effect--as expertly done as Hitchcock used to compose every corner of the screen. And the acting is stunning. Night and day, the two films-- really, a mini-course is superb film making vs. inferior film making. One last comment: people shouldn't review films unless seen on the BIG screen, not on Iphones, Ipads, DVDs at home--in those formats all you get is plot. Only on the big screen do you get cinematography, which is part of going to the movies (vs. watching TV), after all."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2016,5/10,"I am having trouble understanding the hooplah of this film. I saw it at a film festival earlier this year, and while the acting is exceptional, the film itself is a story we've seen many times before. There is nothing new, innovative, or noteworthy other than the performances themselves. Yes, of course, the filmmaking is solid, I wouldn't expect anything less. But as a film, it falls flat.The bottom line is that the movie is terribly overwrought and its plot just shows issues that many families have to go through at some point, while offering us little insight into the human condition. There are just machinations but no actual understanding of the heart, heartbreak, and loss that is endured. You'll love the performances and cast, and I'm sure many will sympathize/empathize with the situation the characters are in, but there are many other films that do this kind of story justice."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 May 2021,10/10,"In my humble opinion, i believe this movie will teach us all to appreciate the blessings of having a family and growing to love them everyday. It's so sad and depressing, but I hope everyone who reads this comment, goes and watches this masterpiece! Watch and enjoy a beautiful and tragic movie with an outstanding performance by the leas actor, well worthy of an Oscar! Watch and appreciate being loved and surrounded with family! Watch and appreciate having your heart not broken and destroyed by unbearable pain and suffering as such trauma cannot be cured no matter how hard you try! I loved it so much even though it did make me cry!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 March 2017,9/10,"Excellent casting and depiction of survival and strength of family and friendships in lives torn apart by omission and mistakes. A hard-edged life of resilience and pain, with solace and grace measured out in unforgiving helpings. Second chances to correct the wrongs. A must see for serious film watchers."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 May 2017,2/10,"Truly did not care for this movie at all. It was depressing, moved extremely slowly and was completely full of foul language. I think the more times a movie has the F*** word in it, the more critics seem to like it. Ended with pretty much nothing much happening during the entire film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 October 2017,2/10,Why can't there be a good story told without using the F word in every sentence? Why was almost everyone in the story working with a hair-trigger temper? The least little thing set off a fight or argument. I didn't like a single character except Patrick. This is one of the most over rated movies I've ever seen.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,2/10,"Two and a half hours of pointless cinema. Total waste of resources and time. Affleck's performance is like a straight-line EKG. A remake of Dustin Hoffman playing Raymond in Rain man. This movie should be brought up on fraud charges for impersonating movie entertainment. No one can answer, ""What's the point!""."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 May 2020,6/10,"Heartfelt, honest and sad. But man, the editing left a lot to be desired. Maybe it was an attempt to make things out of control, but poorly executed. Maybe it was due to a lack of coverage in scenes, because I can tell they tried to stick with a minimalistic approach to angles. 2 at max per scene. But man, just let things play out. I suppose the movie just got too long.Other than that, the performances were okay, but the screenplay was brilliant. Really showed grief and disconnection from the world because of it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 September 2021,10/10,This film is so real and it's original idea of real life portrayal is quite mesmerising. The acting in this film is absolutely astonishing and quite frankly the best I've ever seen. It's worthy of my Top 10 films of all time based on the acting and the real life effect it has on me and millions of others.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 December 2016,1/10,"Very boring Had to walk out as tired of the constant swearing. If they would have taken the swearing out maybe we would have stayed a bit longer to see where it was going. Little story and little character development. With all of the hype this was an incredible disappointment. The most non-watchable cinema I have (started to) watch in a long time. Got 45 minutes into it and gave up Nothing to recommend it - not even scenery or music. Don't waste your time. At least the popcorn was good. when it was finished, so was I. Husband hated it too. and we lived in the area for 20 years! if only they had hired a director, some writers and some actors ... . stay home and watch anything on TCM or MGM instead. Happy Holidays to you and your family, and safe travels."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 December 2016,,"It is shocking to me that this film received rave reviews. I saw it Saturday at the DGA. I have gone to many screenings. This is the first time that half the audience left before Kenneth Lonergan, the director/writer arrived on stage. I actually felt sorry for him... people were leaving while he was speaking. Michelle Williams, Kyle Chandler, and Lucas Hedges were terrific but not Casey Affleck. I felt Kenneth Lonergan missed a beat in the development of his character and something about the performance of Casey Affleck flat-lined. The performance of Lucas Hedges was criticized regarding the freezer scene. I totally disagree. Pulsating reactions to grief emanate from triggers that are unique to the individual. The supporting cast was stellar. They maximized a wanting script."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 June 2018,10/10,"Manchester by the sea is a beautiful movie. This movie reflects a person, trying to adjust his life filled with misery and pain, suddenly gets an unwanted responsibility to deal with. and in that process of journey, we learn background glimpses of broken relationship, living burden of pain, abandonment of responsibilities, hope resembling re-establishment of relations, moving and living on with truth and reality.Casey was brilliant from the word get go. He let us feel the character deeply. Sublime performance from Lucas, as well, as patrick... It is a pure class hardcore slow drama that for sure would cover a particular class of viewers."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,6/10,"The movie is good, but is far from being a master peace. It is slow, but it never becomes dense, or tiresome. But I do feel, it could have been 30 minutes shorter without affecting the outcome. I like the photography, but didn't like the music score. I usually like Casey Affleck, and here he is good, but not Oscar good. Through out the movie he has the same ""nothing face"". I understand he has to transmit the emptiness in his soul, but it never got me. Even when they show you his flashbacks, it didn't strike me as 'oh, he was so happy and full of life, and now he is just void'. As to Lucas Hedges, I don't think he deserves the Oscar nomination, I've watch a lot of movies with better supporting performances (eg, Kevin Costner in Hidden Figures). On the other hand, I do think Michelle Williams deserves its nomination. I did see a change between his life prior to the faithful event, and after it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 December 2020,6/10,"This is not a bad movie per se and I can see why it get's such high ratings but for me the ship never stranded.
The acting is really well done and together with the setting and scenes the story comes over as real as it can get.
But for me the movie really started to drag along in the second half and eventually the movie in the end never truly delivered."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 December 2016,10/10,"Terrific movie! Great Acting! Casey Affleck was simply at his best with a performance that has to rank as one of the top performances of the year! All of that character's pain came straight through into the audience. It was amazing, but I really expected it after The Killer Inside Me (which was also a great movie with Affleck's overlooked performance as the psycho sheriff). Michelle Williams was terrific, as well. And for the first time, for me, Kyle Chandler really came through with a winning performance of his own. And while I'm at it, Lucas Hedge is an actor to watch out for. Pretty fine work all around. I really wanted to rave about the acting here, and not give away any key points of the plot. The movie itself is quite moving and ultimately very devastating. I loved it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2021,9/10,This is one of the best movies from the past decade. Kenneth Lonergan's script is just brilliant and the performances will take your breath away.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2017,1/10,Leave it to Hollywood to somehow get a movie about a drunken idiot father who did what he did to his children into theaters!! One of the stupidest movies I've seen in my life! Wanted to shoot myself listening to the score as well! It's unbelievable that Affleck got an award for this... for what... having that stupid look on his face the entire movie!! Seriously? Must of paid people to rate this movie any higher than 3!
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 January 2017,4/10,"This movie is deeply disturbing because it is believable. Horrible things happen to people through no particular fault of their own. This is the problem of evil. It poses the troubling and unanswerable question: why do bad things happen to good people? The movie's protagonist, Casey Affleck, is a decent person who has shut himself down to all feelings except anger. He lives alone in a small room in an apartment complex in which he works as a maintenance man. Occasionally his anger erupts and he punches someone out in a bar. During flashbacks you see him as the happy father of three children with a loving wife. There is the sense that something dreadful must have happened to him. He seeks no psychological support, but chooses to tough it out in survival mode, unable to forgive himself. There are three opportunities for him to break through to at least some feeling and break out of his self-imposed isolation: 1. his beloved brother dies and he views the dead body. Instead of feeling genuine sorrow, he simply kisses it; 2. he becomes the guardian of his 16 year old nephew. The boy loves him, but is unable to break through his shell. 3. the most powerful scene in the movie, his ex wife reaches out to him in a heartfelt effort at reconciliation, but he is unable to accept her forgiveness. In the end he is unable to beat it, and he knows it. He returns to his solitary existence and you are left with lingering feelings of hopelessness and, as a viewer, disappointment because there is no redemption, no resolution. The movies' biggest fault is the darkness of its brutal honesty."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 May 2017,4/10,"Many of the people commenting here are disparaging because MBS is not a comic book action film. One commenter actually suggested you see Star Wars instead. Just because an individual doesn't like the genre does not make this a bad film. But this is a bad film.To make a film like this work, the acting must be brilliant, compelling, overwhelming. None of that happened here and the fact that Casey Afflect won an award for this mess tells you just how much the MBA's have taken over Hollywood. For a brilliant sensitive film with nearly the same base plot watch Waterland with Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack. You will come away with a clear vision of two people stuck in a devastation they cannot escape. I would never consider the 90's the golden age of Hollywood but more and more it looks to be one of the last significant decades of salient filmmaking.In the hands of a more nuanced director, this film might have risen to good. Instead, it reads like an offish attempt to turn melodrama into significance. The music is appallingly inappropriate and heavy handed. It turns the pivotal moment in the film into a cast off from the Godfather and blunts the drama unfolding on the screen to yawn-worthy. Elsewhere, it brashly proclaims what we are supposed to think and feel as if what is on the screen is not enough.Others have commented on the scene where the chicken falls from the freezer. It's not funny. It's pitiful. But the young actor playing the role is so mediocre and the scene is so poorly directed we have no idea if what is happening is even genuine. Saying he doesn't like his father being frozen until spring is not the same as feeling it. And in this type of film, he must feel it or it doesn't work. Up to this point we've seen so little emotion from him, overt or subtle, about his father's death it almost seems like he doesn't care.The takeaway from this film is supposed to be a portrait of a man so lost he can't escape his trauma to even care for a beloved nephew. Try to find it. It's not there and that is in large part due to Mr. Afflect's performance. He turns his character into a stereotype of stupidity, alcohol, and loss that neither engages nor compels. When he is not staring dully ahead, he pounds people in bars for no apparent reason. You may ask why? Me too. I have no idea why because Mr. Affleck never lets us in on the reason. The cast largely seems to have escaped from a tacky 70's sitcom to find themselves in a real life they have never been written to fully understand. The film itself is filled with moments of non-significance repeated over and over for an imagined dull-witted viewer to make sure they get the point.Lastly, why was this film called Manchester by the Sea? The town, as the story was told, had absolutely nothing to do with the story. We didn't get any sort of feel for Manchester. It wasn't a character in the story. It didn't impact anything that happened so why name the film after it? This was a very sloppy heavy-handed attempt to create an Oscar worthy picture. If I didn't know better I'd think it was something software generated by a computer in a first attempt to see if the creation of films could be automated. Unless you're into how not to do this well, I'd skip it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,9/10,"The trailer was all short of the hype, the beauty even the reality that was attached to the movie.. I'm so much happy i went ahead to see the movie despite the spoilers and low ratings.. I wish i could find a word to qualify the actors, plot, the excellent directing and the beautiful filming. This is one of those movies which will live with me for a very long time. 9.10/10 for me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 February 2017,10/10,"As you can see from my summary this film floored me. Its the best movie I have seen so far in 2017, its incredible. Although this is a masterclass of film making and especially the acting, (Casey Affleck you well and truly earned that Oscar my friend), it is an emotional roller coaster and i am just forewarning you this is a hard movie to watch and not in a torture porn type of way but because of the performances, Casey Affleck delivers a performance so realistic, so subdued that you cant help but empathize with his character as a real human being. So when his life derails it hits and it hits hard right in the gut, I mean it was emotionally impactfull and when that happens you have achieved cinematic greatness, hats of to you Mr. Lonergan you made a truly great movie that will go down as one of the greats.Great, Great Movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2016,7/10,"Such a promising story, such a promising movie. Sigh.Casey Affleck is, as ever, a joy to behold. A perfect performance, worthy of Oscar nomination. But Michelle Williams, who I adore, couldn't bring a single tear to her biggest scene. Her dry-eyed performance reflects the hollowness of its too-highly crafted story. If she can't spare a tear for what she's gone through and how badly she treated Patrick, how can we? The scenes of the Massachusetts coastal towns and waters are beautiful and lyrical, which might have led to the movie's worst blunder-- the music. It sounds like it wants to a Jane Austen historical epic and is distractedly inappropriate for the story."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 May 2020,4/10,Finish the film! What's the point in telling us a story if you're not going to bother finishing it?having to sit through a deluge of horrific music throughout the film should have at least been rewarded with one loose end being tied up.Ending has absolutely ruined what had potential be an excellent film.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2019,10/10,"I will make it short and simple.If u dont love this movie, well, then you dont like movies..Period"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 March 2019,9/10,"I never thought that such a slow-moving, melancholic movie could captivate me like Manchester by the Sea did. Once I started watching it I could not stop; all of a sudden I was in the world of Lee Chandler as he is pushed outside of his comfort zone, and his limits tested.From the very start of the film we learn that Lee is quiet, not the shy type but rather the broken type. The story has us guessing what possibly could have happened... what made the man who he is? And instead of revealing the backstory all at once, we get snippets - bits and pieces from the past. Laced within these flashbacks, so to say, are huge amounts of subtext. This is something the screenwriters excelled in, that is leaving most of the premise of the movie unspoken, where silence speaks the loudest.I absolutely loved the cinematography as we see a lot of wide shots and simple landscape shots, and the bleak, blue visual tones that fit perfectly with the movie's theme. Some constants are snow, shots of boats bobbing up and down in the bay and quiet moments in dialogue.We remain interested until the very end as an unlikely relationship forms between Lee and his nephew Patrick, who's father as well as Lee's brother passed away, leaving guardian responsibilities to Lee. We watch as the two move from an at first destructive relationship to one much more accepting of each other, and in the end they work out how things are to go on.As the film closes we are reminded that despite the intensity of tragedy and the effect it has on people's lives, life must go on. The credits roll in and are accompanied by more wide shots of the bay, which I absolutely love.A hypnotizingly beautiful movie and a solid 9/10 for me. This movie is well deserving of its Metascore of 96."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 September 2018,5/10,"I love Michelle William's acting and she was glorious as ever in every moment that she was in this film. However, most of the rest of the actors were muttering their lines far too much - mutter mutter - it ruined for me what could have been a great film!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 January 2017,,"TRAUMATIC BUT ENTERTAININGLike a character that constantly fight and swear, it's easy to like Lee Chandler, played by Casey Affleck. He is rarely happy, has no objective or passion. He does not develop and say thanks to everything even if he does not mean it. He hardly changes facial expressions. It's a film that has a variable rate and many up and down sequences. Several times feels like to back the looks, was a bit random but sometimes suits them the story forward. The flashback is most often used to fill a gap in the story, as the present stage do nothing or nothing happens dramatically in a while and therefore uses the director of different back looks. Fulfill their function while but eventually, when they do not suit, it feels most as a distraction.Manchester by the sea have a specific class and attitude and will certainly be praised in the coming award ceremonies as Golden Globe. On the other hand, fails the script, when they could have your diary it more and gone deeper into the Lee as a character. He is sufficiently depressed for that he would be able to take the lives of itself. It takes place in our present but nothing that defines our present. It lacks an unprecedented and a conflict that drives the story forward, this would all characters need something that they all are fighting against, instead go Lee around in his car and say no to all the people who know or turn them. Lee do not fight against anything, even if there are consequences of what he is doing. The trauma of the death of his brother is constantly reminded even if his past led to his miserable life and that changed him as a character. It is a heavy drama movie filled again of uncomfortable scenes, violence, silence, and long ones. It is possibly a so a film should be given the estimated criticism this film has received and the credit they have received.The concept does work, even if the script would need to be corrected a few times, cutting had been looked up too. We do not need so many images in this film of water and lakes and boats. The music is unusually dramatically in some places which gives an inappropriate atmosphere where it is suddenly classical music and it is a comic scene or moment. How or why this acclaimed i do not understand. It is the strong role of interpretations and especially of the Casey Affleck which takes place and make a purpose of its name instead of his brother who has taken the water over the head when it comes to acting when he really should keep only to the helm. He is so much better than his brother, which I am pleased and should be assigned more similar roles for he grows as a person under the film, but not as a character. I like Michelle Williams, for she usually has strong roles that get her to grow but it felt like that she was not required. She was in principle in ten minutes of almost 2.5 hours of film. She has the talent and it is a pity that she had not more movie time. Kyle Chandler, plays the brother Joseph Chandler are mainly seen in all of flashbacks has stronger charisma and character and he is dead the greater part of the film.He had had the role of Casey Affleck had been certainly a more mediocre film and not as emotionally charged.I think it is certainly entertaining and are not up to their reputation, which makes me as audience disappointed and a little cursed the press paint a romantic image of how good and dramatically the film is. Casey Affleck, was good and fit into the role, Michelle Williams as wife Randi should have been given more time but was easy of Kyle Chandler by the deceased brother. But I think that it will get nominations but that it reaches right up to a winner of the Oscars is unlikely.//mackansfilm.com"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 February 2017,9/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a movie that was surrounded by a lot of buzz when I saw it. Affleck was said to be amazing and Williams was said to be even better. So when I went and saw it I was glad to see that for once people hadn't lied to me.This film follows Lee Chandler (Affleck) in his travel to Manchester as his brother has just died and his nephew (Hedges) is left alone. He then discovers that he's supposed to be the legal tutor to his nephew, much to his displeasure. We watch as Lee organizes his brother's funeral and tries to figure out what to do with his nephew and the belongings of his brother, while dealing with his past at the same time.Let's talk about the structure of the film. The script is truly great, the first part we don't understand Lee, we follow him thinking he's a bit of an ass. He is mean to people, he doesn't engage in conversations and most of all he never smiles. But then comes a point in the middle when we learn what happened in the past and we suddenly understand why he doesn't want to be in Manchester, why he doesn't want his nephew's tuition and why he is so damn moody all the time. Suddenly we feel for Lee on a really humane level, and all his actions, past and future, are understood. The film is really slow, to its credit, and the dialogues are extremely realistic. This movie is an emotional roller coaster, in the sense that you have this feeling of dread during the whole film and when you learn what happened you die on the inside. And you stay dead.The acting is amazing, I mean Casey (we're on a first name basis) is great and truly delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. . We get his performance and it's just an amazing one. It is so subtle, so layered and so real. A broken man, you see a broken man. He plays a man that has lived something from which he cannot recover, and if one performance was ever to portray that, it is this one. You just believe it, he's so gray, so sad, you just see it in his eyes. Lucas Hedges was also good, his chemistry with Casey felt real and he does what he has to do. Michelle Williams, for the five seconds she is on screen, is unbelievable. Her performance actually bothered me until I discovered that the reason for that was that she was just too real. She played it too well (which makes it believable I guess). The scene between her and Casey is incredibly heartbreaking, I challenge anyone not to tear up. Casey and her are on the same level, Williams might be a bit better but Casey carries the whole film.The last thing I want to say is the realism. This movie makes it a point to make it feel real. Everyday things like forgetting where you parked your car, are shown which feels weird but makes a good point. Struggling with machinery in the most dramatic scene in the film makes you feel so uneasy you want to look away. Many things like that seem cruel but are actually very common. Seeing Williams' stroller on screen when she's talking to Casey was just so painful (in a good way).The directing is very smart and I applaud Lonnergan for it, for its realism and uneasiness throughout. The score is also very beautiful, and underscores powerfully to really lodge that knife further in your heart.Its a slow burn, emotionally draining, devastating, real film with two of the best performances of the year. It is easily one of the top of 2016. 9"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 July 2017,9/10,"Kenneth Lonergan's tale of loss and regrets makes this heartbreaking story one of the greatest movies to watch and with performances like Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams makes this movie enticing, heartbreaking and unforgettable to watch. Casey Affleck's performance keeps the audience entertained and never let us go."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 November 2018,1/10,"Read the first plot description, the one sentence one. It implies more takes place than actually does take place. The movie was pointless, meaningless, aimless."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 February 2020,9/10,"Casey Affleck puts on a real show, entire duration of movie felt like watching a documentary of a heartbroken man, unable to overcome death, lost love. Entirity of the movie an example of how death and fatality of it is overwhelming and portrayed down to perfection. The plot is amazing and no puts a foot wrong. Manchester by the sea is journey of young losing is kids to fire he set to keep them, losing his wife, his brother, parenting his nephew and understanding the cruelity of how life can just put us in a place where we can never recover from and remain to live as vessel of no emotions and feeling"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 December 2018,2/10,"Wow, this is one of those movies that the critics love because that's what critics do. In reality, it was slow and the acting wooden. God awful... don't waste your time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 December 2020,3/10,I gave it three stars because it uses the word r*tard
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 December 2016,9/10,"After seeing ""Manchester by the Sea"", I have needed some time to let it digest. I was ultimately satisfied with every facet of this film. Originally pegged for Matt Damon to star and direct, it was likely best that his schedule was filled and had to pass. The writer of the screenplay, Kenneth Lonergan, ended up taking the director's chair, giving him complete creative control (and boy did that pay off).Every single actor in this film dove into their roles and made me forget that they were people in front a camera. Casey Affleck nails a very difficult role and is at his best. Lucas Hedges most definitely puts himself on Hollywood's radar with his performance as ""Patrick"" (who reminds me of a young and troubled smart ass Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"")I loved how the film was grounded in reality and wasn't trying too hard to be a tear-jerking drama (*cough ""Collateral Beauty"" cough*). There weren't moments of over the top sappiness layered with a dramatic score. It felt as though the characters are real people that reside in Manchester.One of the most pleasing things about this movie is the balance of different emotions and the lack of emotional clashing. The director did are fantastic job of having the audience know when to feel awkward, sad, happy, or upset while also wanting us craving for more.Kenneth Lonergan also did an amazing job with the script and his directing. The pacing was smooth and inter cut with flash backs that perfectly correlated to the events in the present day, giving the audience a chance to see the layers of each character as well as show shocking and unforeseen tragedies. The film is beautiful, filled with long emotional takes and shots of Manchester that demonstrate the harsh winter conditions. The only small criticism I have is simply from wanting more out of some characters. There were moments where I wanted ""Lee"" to burst and let out his bottled up anger and regret, giving the audience a better insight of his true feelings. This may also drag on a tad bit for the average movie goer that expects a high amount of action and resolution.All in all, this is one of the best dramas I have seen this year. It takes the audience for an emotional ride and isn't afraid to tread into some dark areas. It also isn't a conventional drama that wraps everything up with a bow on top. It's harsh, unforgiving, and relentless, just like the real world."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 December 2016,10/10,"Just heard about this film from a friend a few days ago. Being a long time fan of Casey Affleck, and hearing it was a life like family drama set in Manchester, Massachusetts, I thought it a nice way to spend a Saturday evening. Emotions ran high one minute with laughter, and with gut wrenching sadness the next. Character development was a treasure to behold. Some people do not like the use of flashbacks. However, I don't see this film working any other way. Had it been in chronological order, the overall impact would not have been the same. It could not have been more perfectly cast. Casey Affleck did not have to say a word in so many scenes and you could just FEEL what he was feeling, and thinking. Lucas Hedges was magnificent. And Michelle Williams, despite small screen time, was at her best. Truly a little gem that stays with you, and makes you grateful for all the good in your own life. After some time, I would love to re visit this film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2018,7/10,"It's the convincing performances by all the main actors in this movie that helps elevate this movie above the weepy schlock that it could easily have become. Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams in particular are brilliant.
However 2 flaws continually pull this movie down from the heights that some critics were elevating it to. The performances might have been potentially Oscar worthy but the film as a whole is not.
Firstly the music, particularly in the ""emotional"" scenes is far too melodramatic. It's overkill and the scenes are powerful enough to stand on their own (or with far more subtle music) without the director yelling at us to feel the characters pain. Sometimes the music drowns out the dialogue. Frankly the soundtrack choices are hamfisted and amateurish.
Secondly, the teenage boy who Casey Affleck becomes the guardian for is a very unsympathetic character, and the script handles his reactions to his father's death clumsily. The scene in which he breaks down after opening a freezer borders on schlock.
It's still a movie well worth watching, if only for the superb performanes, but don't expect it to be ""The best film of 2016"" as many critics were saying."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 December 2016,1/10,"I seriously don't understand all the hype about this movie. Oscar worthy?? Hardly! It's almost 2.5 hours of nothing but banal dialog. Nothing actually happens, there's no 'plot' per se and there's really no beginning, middle or end. It's just a snapshot of a period in one family's life. It's boring, depressing and pointless. Drab would be a good way to sum it up. I really don't get why it's being advertised as brilliant because personally I couldn't wait for the movie to end. There weren't that many people in the theater when I went but as we were walking out, I could hear everyone complaining about it. Nothing about it deserves an Oscar. Sorry Matt Damon, because I usually really enjoy your movies, but this just seems like a self-indulgent waste of time that the critics are pretending to like because they're worried they'll be looked down on if they give their true opinion."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 December 2020,10/10,Casey Affleck's role truly deserved his Oscar. Excelent depiction of what guilt looks and feels like. A must watch.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 October 2020,2/10,"This is absolutely a hidden movie. The purpose for making it, other than to give the actors some work, is hidden from the viewers with near perfection.
If it was intended to give a ""slice of life"" view of DownEaster rednoses with coprolalia, it succeeds admirably, I must admit, however. Honestly, after the credits roll, I stared at the screen expecting ""Yackety Sax"" on a kazoo.
Madcap, it ain't.
The acting was, for the most part, low-key to the point of somnambulism. With the exception of Patrick, the son of the dear departed brother, everyone in this film is numb, stunned, and lifeless as the late brother.
There's two hours of my life I'm never getting back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 May 2017,2/10,"This is critically acclaimed and I'm not sure if I watched the same movie others are raving about. I usually love melodramas and character studies. These characters do not evolve much and although I see where the movie was trying to portray and show, it fell short way short. I wish I had those 2 hours back. I even fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch so I even rewatched it from the beginning twice, trying to love it. Or even like it. Casey Afflecks character was OK. Very two dimensional most of the time. Even though he is extremely introverted I felt we could be shown more as an audience into his personal feelings . It wasn't touched upon much. He doesn't become real to me and feels like B movie acting. The banner advertising this movie on this site says ""Michelle Willams is stunning"". She had very little lines and screen time. 10 minutes maybe? I see where they were trying to go with this movie, but I feel like it could have been so much better."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2017,6/10,"I have seen a number of films this year. Some have been of very good standard like Nocturnal Animals, Silence, Hunt For The Wilderpeople, La La Land and A Monster Calls. My expectations were low going into this film. Heavily praised by the critics but mixed opinions among cinema goers. Manchester By The Sea is a watchable film. Beautifully filmed and well acted. However the story is pretty average and i never once felt any sympathy for the characters, so it was hard to feel involved in the outcome. Also found some of the more sentimental parts of the film to be ruined by loud classical music.Overall its worth watching once but i highly doubt you will want to watch again."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,1/10,Way overrated. Well acted. But they took a story maybe a paragraph long and stretched it for 90 minutes. I was waiting for the main character to get punched in the head. This movie let me down again. I need five lines of text to submit so I am going to stretch my review like the writers did that paragraph I previously mentioned.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,2/10,"The movie is named wrong it should be called ""A holes by the sea"". I kept thinking darn I paid money for this. The main character has about as much personality as a sea slug.. No I am being mean to sea slugs. I guess I was supposed to feel sorry for the guy, but you don't find out his problem until halfway thru. By then you could care less. Actually I felt no connection to any of the characters. I just wanted it to be over. Prime example why I should avoid movies nominated for an academy award."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 February 2017,1/10,"Judging from the many good reviews this movie has received, all I can think, is that they played a different movie at the theater I went too. I forced myself to endure this movie that lacked a story line, had no cohesion, was full of very poorly acted bad characters and had poorly directed scenes from the outset. I endured it for 45 minutes as I thought my wife was enjoying it due to her laughter at many of the scenes. Thankfully she asked me at this stage did I think that this was the worst movie we had ever seen and I said very close to it, and we left. At least we got to have a nice ice cream, but that was the only good part of this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 October 2017,9/10,"Before watching this film, I used to think ""Oh, its performed by Ben Afflecks' brother"", but now that has completely changed for me. Casey is no more behind his brothers'shadow. The Oscar he won was one the most unquestionable Oscars of the last years. His performance is so natural, so captive; the way he turns into a reserved and solitary person after the drama... The argument is so ""real"", so deep, its something that could happen in any moment (a family destroyed and a life that has to continue; I hope this wouldn't happen but it actually does). The relationship between Lee and his nephew is the base of the film; sometimes the attitude of the last annoys me, but then I remember what he is suffering (his well played role on the film) and that is how I would react to everything, maybe even worse. An aspect I didn't liked was Lee's lack of emotion while the drama. I know he is a quiet person, but he is human, and no human would stay flat in a situation like that... PD: I will definitely visit Manchester-by-the-sea after watching this film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 November 2017,10/10,"This is not a typical art-house movie. It is not a typical Oscar nominated film either. It looks like it, but it isn't. Just judging by the cover, you do have a general idea of what you are about to see . Slow pace, artistic cinematography and soundtrack, every-man characters living in small houses, Michelle Williams reprising yet another time her role, as a femme fatale with a flair for drama and a feminist twist, in Blue Valentine, the other, shorter, less muscular and low-profile Affleck brother, not The Ben Affleck, his not-so-talented at least as an actor but considerably wealthier and more famous brother, also a screenwriter and director but mostly a big name, a contemporary Hollywood star, known basically to the masses because he was engaged to JLo, he looks good on the red carpet and is currently BATMAN, and finally a polished production since Matt Damon, Ben's multimillionaire buddy and Amazon are behind it. You also know the location of the film. It's the title itself. :p So you are prepared to have a nice nap somewhere in the first half of the film. But you are not going to. The script is overly dramatic and so are the performances but they are also naturalistic. If you have panic attacks, suppressed anger or mild depression-who doesn't these days?- the films really gets to you and not in a good way as it progresses tapping on issues of death, Christianity, alcoholism, loss, phobia, depression, isolation and so forth. Is it a good film? Definitely yes, not as generic as one would judge by the cover. Strong performances and a story that feels real. Comparing it to LaLaland, feminist comedy, 2016 anti-tramp propaganda and product placement disguised as movies, and action films with super-powered comic book characters in it, you have to give it a 10. Did I have a good time watching it? No. Do I feel relaxed now after having watching it? No, I feel anxious. Can a fictional story influence your mood? Can you watch it from an emotional distance and appreciate it? You decide."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 November 2018,2/10,"I don't understand the high rating of this film. I do like Casey Affleck and other actors in it. They seemingly gave their parts their all. However the editing of the film is where it fell apart. Flashbacks were meaningless at times, such as the brief flash of Lee on the boat while he's driving to the hospital where his brother is. One would think you would be thinking of the person in the hospital at the time. There were several like this. Also, the musical score was strange and did not add to the film. The classical music stuck out like a sore thumb. Certainly did not add to the mood."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 December 2016,3/10,"I suspect there are aspects of this from a serious cinematography viewpoint that accounts for the excellent ratings, but I was bored to tears. I found the music mostly maudlin, the story depressing, the flashbacks annoying, the characters mostly unlikable, and the pace unacceptably slow; too many scenes where C. Affleck is in the car just driving...I get that everyday when I go to work. I will say the acting was excellent. There was also a sense of realism to this work, the problem being that I prefer a sense of escapism. I suspect people who loved Birdman, another movie that I just didn't get, will appreciate this movie. But for the rest of the theater going public that is looking for something that grabs their attention and/or uplifts them, spend your $12 to see Arrival or Fantastic Beasts."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2017,2/10,"Afer reading tons of good reviews for this movie, I was exited to watch it. All the reviews I read kept on telling me how good this movie was, how excellent the actors were and how good the story was. And boy did I get to be disappointed.For 2 hours and 16 minutes I got/had to watch Casey Affleck's stony dead-eyed face deliver lines in a lethargic and depressing manner. That man is absolutely incapable of showing any sort of emotion. His reaction to loosing his children in a fire is pretty much identical to his reaction when he learns that he has to take care of his nephew. Now, in my point of view, one of these incidents can be a good thing, but Casey obviously thinks they are equally tragic. Absolutely rubbish.To be fair though, there was one whole minute of real acting in this movie, but that was almost entirely Michelle Williams's doing.To be honest, i never would have written anything about this movie if it were'nt for all the hype its getting. There's a bunch of YouTube-channels, newspapers, film-sites and so on that keeps on claiming that this movie is one of 2016's treasures. Bullshit, stop claiming this movie is anything other than a waste of peoples time and I'll be happy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 February 2021,10/10,Casey Affleck was wonderful in this role. His portrayal of a man who has trouble adjusting to the challenges of his life is impeccable.I was appalled when Brie Larson ruined the best night of his career when she presented him with the Academy Award.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 October 2020,9/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a film where Casey Affleck plays a janitor(Lee Chandler)who's hatred for the world and anguish is very present. There are a series of flashbacks which show the contrast in the characters personality, which also suggests very early on in the film that something has happened which has led to his extreme unhappiness. After his brothers death, he is led back to 'Manchester by the Sea' where he is to look after his nephew, where his troubled memories await him. In this film, Casey Affleck gives a breathtaking performance where he captures the realism of how the depressed man would act on a daily basis, and was awarded an Oscar for his performance. The film also has strong subject matter, where grief,pain, and family are all highlighted throughout the film. The contrast between Lee Chandler in the present compared to the past works very well as it demonstrates the emotional pain and suffering he must have gone through. The only issue with the film that I could think of is that I wanted to find out more about a few characters, including Lee's ex wife, and also Elise, who played Lee's nephews mother. However, this only further shows that this is a gripping tale and one that I wanted to keep watching for longer even at its 2hour 20 minute runtime."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,6/10,"As I watched this pretty slow-moving drama, I began to get excited to read the book. A lot of the plot had interesting ideas, but was fleshed out so poorly that I was left wanting to hear the heart and soul behind the film. I actually saw a reviewer who mentioned the book...alas! There is no book! This was from an idea and written as a movie script. And yet, it feels like it should be a book! What I mean by that, as someone who wanted to love this film, is that the way the story unfolds didn't give me the empathy I think I could have had with a different trajectory. I felt the film was pretty flat throughout. Perhaps that is exactly how someone facing Lee Chandler's lot in life would seem, but this is a film! I needed more.As for Michelle Williams, her less-than-ten minutes on screen was great, but is that amount of screen time really worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination? Really? Disappointed, but I guess it's good so many people liked it more than me!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2021,3/10,"This could have been a very good psychological drama if not for several things, the most important of them being the lead actor- Casey Affleck. He delivers a one-note performance, wearing the same expression on his face throughout the film. His character is terribly boring, as well. The film should have been focused on Michelle Williams's character (in a great, if brief, performance) as she can actually act and her character has a personality.The other reasons mostly concern director Kenneth Lonergan. As usual with him, the drama feels oddly inauthentic, the cinematography is uninteresting and there is misplaced and clunky use of classical music.But usually, he can get the best out of actors. He can't with Affleck, but, in my opinion, that would be like getting blood out from a stone."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,4/10,"Perhaps It's me that I don't get impressed so much with movies anymore. Well I doubt so..... I believe the industry is so depleted of ideas that any flick that touches sensitive skins get awarded and rewarded. MBTS is just a boring, slow, a complete lack of interesting plot and not-so-original movie. Period. The movie puts your brain to sleep while trying to make you shed tears. Airing miserable life experiences is not enough to break viewer's feelings, or at least not in my case. Casey Affleck must have very good friends in Hollywood because his performance is just tedious. His steady face and lack of expression throughout the whole film is not good acting but just a lack of skills. Sorry boys. I don't buy it. If you one a good drama, go watch Moonlight and don't waste neither your money nor your time with this one."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2017,3/10,"Wow is all I can say when I see all these 5 star ratings for this movie. It makes me wonder about the sanity of this country. I kept looking at reviews until I found one that agreed with mine. It was a close call. Firstly, the acting was good, the directing was also good, and no glaring goofs, so what is there not to like? The reason for the movie, that's what. I can already hear everyone screaming at me. I guess it boils down to the reason I view movies. This movie was so real and so negative and nasty that it completely turned me off. Why would I want to waste 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life to watch a movie, which to me, has no redeeming qualities. It's a negative picture of life which is all around us, each and every day. I like to escape into a movie and I will admit that is getting more difficult every year. Also, I admit that I did not finish this movie. I made it through about 65% and I knew at that time that I had wasted enough of my time with it. That being said, I know that this review will not dissuade anyone from watching it, but you have been warned.And here is a PS.....If you want to watch a really good movie which you might have missed, watch this 2014 hand clapper and heart tugger: ""Chef"". It will neutralize all the negative junk of ""Manchester"""
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 April 2020,3/10,Why would you want to inflict upon your good self a painful depressing story in which the hero's family members die one after the other? Your empathy is tried yet you never shed a tear as the main character - who's only virtue is to oppose a stone poker face to all the worst events that one can fear from life - lives because he did not manage to shoot himself in the head.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 February 2017,1/10,"I usually split my scoring up into different departments, 1. Acting 2. Script. 3. Content. 4. Enjoyment.The acting in this movie was about average so I gave it a 5. The script was average but it was a jumble in places and a lot of the dialogue meaningless. That gets a 1 Content a heavy subject but for me did not raise any sympathy for the characters portrayed and could have been done so much better. A 1 for that. Enjoyment a 1. The whole thing was way to long and maybe if it had been shorter would have had more impact, Casey Affleck mumbled his way through this movie OK the guy was depressed and dwelling on his past but the audience deserves to hear what is said without straining on every word. A score of + 8 is an insult."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 December 2016,5/10,"I've very much enjoyed other Kenneth Lonergan films, and I've admired Casey Affleck's acting gifts for a long time. Because of the rave reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, the film went into production with a half-baked script. It probably needed another 5-6 rewrites to make the characterization more layered, develop the subplots more, and get to the pith of the central conflict, which was extremely weak.The story didn't really get off the ground until the last third of the film. It's a testament to Affleck's acting, not the story, that the film managed to sustain my interest. The only thing I'll say about the music is that the classical music was used in a very ham-handed fashion to manipulate the audience's emotion.Affleck plays a character named Lee, who has suffered a tragedy from which he can't recover. He does his best with an taciturn, undeveloped character whose aims are vague and is so caught in depression and grief that he displays little outward emotional expression. The other major character is Patrick, a teenage boy whose father, Affleck's brother, has died suddenly.One of the big wrongs in the screenplay is that we don't get any sense that Patrick is grieving or even in shock about his father's death until a contrived scene later in the movie about a refrigerator that is a weak, unconvincing attempt to show Patrick has feelings about his father.The relationship between Lee and Patrick is meandering and with mild conflict here and there. It's supposed to be the spine of the movie, but it's so flaccid that the film often lacks focus.I think this movie has something to say, but it's not fully articulated, because the film was shot before the script was fully ready for production."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 March 2017,,"Look it's not for everyone, you'll either love it or hate it. I effing loved it. After recently losing my own brother, I went into this film not knowing what to expect. Would I find it too depressing? Would I even enjoy it at all? I had no idea... I left the cinema completely blown away by the realness of this film, how realistically the grief was portrayed, the performances by the actors, and just the beauty of the story and how it is told. I bawled my absolute eyes out and I laughed my absolute head off. I've never had a more heart breaking and heart warming experience, all at the same time. I went back to the cinema 2 days later to watch it again. Then, a week later, I took my husband to watch it again. I can't get enough of it. This movie is just perfect in every way. Special credit to the actors' performances. Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams are just PHENOMENAL. Simply put, this film moved me. I am absolutely in love with it and it deserves all the accolades it can get."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 February 2017,10/10,"Manchester By The Sea is an outburst of reality without any artsy, pretentious or stilted moments carried along with great performances that are to portray the perplexity of life and the directness of how life itself unravels through the years and the incidents. This is a must watch for those who appreciate and understand the stories and the faces and the human moments that are depicted in a cinematic structure as unique and real as real life is. 10/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 March 2017,8/10,"Spoilers ahead!!! Its one of those films that requires no climax to deliver what it truly wants, something that doesn't sit well with a lot of moviegoers. Manchester by the Sea is the story about a man battling melancholic depression due to his negligence that takes the lives of his 3 innocent children.For those who see his character as not having any redeeming qualities to sympathize with, you should also learn to appreciate films where the lead role doesn't always walk into the sunset. This film hits a new level of realism that I truly appreciate as it sends out a message that people do not often have the power to ""beat it"" as in the lines of Lee himself. And if you still find it hard to digest, just for one second, try to picture yourself in this poor man's shoes. The tragedy that befalls him may quite simply happen to any one of us.Although some may find its pace a little too slow, I did not find the movie boring at all. If you are not okay with watching movies without Shyamalan twists let alone depressing ones without a climax, please go watch a re-run or something, you will be thoroughly disappointed."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2017,3/10,"Don't be fooled by the reviews - you will feel every minute of this very long and slow movie drag by.If you survive the first 60 minutes (where nothing at all happens) there are definitely sad moments to this story. However, just because most people can imagine the terrible tragedy that is occurring, thus feel some emotional pain, doesn't mean the actors should be allowed to sleepwalk from A to Z. I suppose some of the Oscar nominees enjoy the spot on acting of ""men will be men, and boys will be boys"", in the sense that men/boys are not in touch with their emotions. If you want to spent almost 3hrs of your life watching Casey Affleck not touch his emotions this movie is perfect for you!As for myself, I wanted it to end from start to finish. The story is quite good and realistic, but by gods this movie threatened to bore me to death. The movie had two moments that would have made me cry, if I had not been so throughoutly bored for such a long time before the moments appeared.The only good thing I have to say for this movie is that Michelle Williams did a great job! I felt her pain and loss, as I watched her struggle. Unfortunately she is not the main character in this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 March 2017,9/10,"Great Screenplay and performances! Even with such a thin plot it kept me glued throughout the runtime without causing any boredom or fatigue,The Characters are well developed and instantly likable. While looking at the IMDb page may give you impression that its depressing and gloomy, But it surprises with its light hearted attitude. Overall its one of the Gems i have come across in this genre and Rightly deserves the Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. This is the third Best Picture nominee I Liked after Lion and Hacksaw Ridge."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 November 2018,9/10,"I didn't watch this movie for over a year because of bad reviews of the movie being slow and dull. I found it to be quite the contrary. I was blown away! I admire the writers and actors choices. It was a raw and honest story! Anyone who has suffered a horrible loss, not to mention several losses, know that what comes after is sometimes difficult to look at. Their doesn't need to be any ""fluff"" in this story The cast was incredible in expressing how people deal with grief, some leave, some hide, some think they are not worthy of a second chance at life. It is a beautiful, but difficult story of a lost man who loses his brother, and years before that his 3 children. Each scene was well done & powerful. Every actor portraying their frame of mind very well, the dynamic of their relationship with each character, etc.
Affleck was amazing. Bravo!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 March 2017,7/10,"Good movie. It is entertaining, exciting, draws you in an keeps you, stirs your emotions, and leaves a positive message. Most other Hollywood movies are shallow and leave you exhausted and wanting for more substance. My time and money is too valuable to just be ""amused."" It was fun seeing so many people that I have not connected to in a long time. I would go to more movies, but the are very few that have any substance. ICasey Affleck's performance was not worth an Oscar, regardless of his personal problems, as while they are not the same as the unpleasant traits of his character in this film, his performance indicates depth and intelligence, and one needs that in order to redeem oneself."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 December 2016,1/10,"The honor Manchester by sea is not logic, actor role principal accusation aggression actress work punch the movie sorry , not credible film. Reality is best than fiction, but this problem is real , not a movie , my evaluation observer the problem actor in real life. The movie is not realistic and williams not great actress is horrible this movie is stupid and not like williams, and not like casey , first response accusation. Is ridiculous critics award this film , is terrible and bad idea, the best movie this year is silence Scorsese, arrival and 10 clover field lane and 13 soldier benghazi, critics not serious now, in the future people observer awards and nomination movies , user reviews is important and critics the system corrupt movies."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 January 2018,9/10,"It's good. The acting is overall good, the story is good. Casey Afflecks character Lee is written very well and is surpassed only by his acting. A grim, indifferent, dangerous semi alcoholic with a tragic past. I always get a nice tingling inside when a man's reckless behavior is justified with good cause like incomprehensive pain, that sort of character grips me and keep me in suspense the entire movie. 
Another thing I like to point out is how straight forward most of the dialogues are, and the subtle humor thrown in between. It leaves u with a comfortable feeling and often a smile.
It starts of good and keeps an even pace throughout. In terms of fulfillment or catharsis.. maybe not so much, but it still kicks ass."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2018,1/10,"This has to be one of the most boring films of all time !. Think Ben Affleck is bad at acting, well think again, his brother lowers the bar further. Wasted hour I'll never get back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 February 2017,1/10,"I hate to give a film such a low rating but there was nothing good about this film. After the first 30 minutes, I continued to watch it, hoping and praying it would get better. It didn't . For a film that is 2 hours too long, the story is uninteresting, with a boring main character and a story line that could've been told in half an hour. After watching 'Lion' on the same day, this film just doesn't compare, yet it has a higher rating because some people are blown away by this 'artsy' film. Whilst 'Lion' is emotional and breathtaking, with in touch characters and a story line that keeps you captivated for the whole time, this whole movie felt like a waste of 2 hours 17 minutes with no climax and absolutely nothing to run home about."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 January 2017,8/10,"""Manchester by the Sea"" is a movie which could easily be named in a top list of life drama movies. even though it lasts more than 2 hours it is not boring because the life of the main character is shown in such a realistic way that you even forget that you are watching a movie. ""Manchester by the Sea"" could be a story of anyone; It could have happened to any of us. all the misfortune lost and pain the main character goes through is so much what life is about. but what I didn't like about the movie is that the main character gets the life as it comes.there is no inner struggle, introspection and questions that I guess should be asked. and that's what the movies is missing there in a not development of the main character. He stays the same person he was before the tragedy. he became not worse neither better.that's why I give only 8 points. Nevertheless, the movie, in my opinion, is still great and deserves Oscar nomination at least."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 January 2019,9/10,"I was really impressed by the film, especially with CaseyAfflecks performance , and that the flashbacks to the time when his personal trauma happened, always managed to stay interesting and fresh. I cared about all the characters and wanted to know what happened to them ( obviously a necessity, due to the films length, as it could have easily started feeling tedious otherwise).If i have one criticism, it would be that i thought the film could have lost 10-20 minutes, so it could have perhaps come to a slightly swifter conclusion.All in all though, i thought it was a terrific peace of work, and most importantly: I WAS NEVER BORED, which can often happen with a film that takes its time"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 July 2018,4/10,"This movie is probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen. There are dead children, dead parents, divorces and movings against one's will. There are also so many flashbacks to different times in the past that it gets really hard to keep track of what's going on and, if this wasn't already enough, it is slow. Really, really slow. It is one of the few movies I couldn't watch in one sitting. I got so bored and depressed I had to stop and do something else for a while. I really don't understand where all the high ratings and important nominations came from. To me, it completely lacks the entertainment factor."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 March 2017,10/10,"This film was much better than I thought it would be. It hit me kind of hard in that I have 16 year old son and it made me wonder what he might be like if something happened to me. I highly recommend this movie. I wish it would have ended differently but that's just me. I think it should have won the Academy Award for best picture, actor and best supporting actor."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 July 2021,1/10,"No silver lining, no happy ending, just a waste of time and an experience in sadness. Don't watch this movie. I wish I hadn't."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 September 2017,9/10,"I would have given this fantastic and memorable film a 10 if it hadn't been for the intrusive and overly loud sound track. Several of us watching the film commented on this as it was happening. It's not that some don't like opera...it was overused. The other styles of music used were not integral to the film. The sing-songy voices in the beginning of the film went on too long and became grating. They would reappear throughout the film for no reason. This film did great and so who's going to listen to me, but I would remake just the music soundtrack to this and it would make a huge difference in the film. The actors carried it for us...we don't need so much music and so loud that you can't hear some of the dialog...even if that was the weird intent of the director. Music is important but I didn't want to watch a film where the music director takes over."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2016,10/10,"In many ways, Manchester By the Sea is a depressing look at one man's crushed outlook on the world: in its runtime, we follow Lee Chandler, a Boston apartment custodian played by Casey Affleck, that seems like just another garden variety jerk, addressing the residents of his building coldly and engaging in heavy bouts of drinking alone. This begins to change, however, when he receives a call regarding the passing of his older brother, Joe, portrayed via flashback by Kyle Chandler; from here, he drives up to his hometown of Manchester, Maine, and watches over his nephew, Lucas, while preparing for Joe's coming funeral. Lee's course then takes another turn when it's discovered that, upon reading Joe's will, he was outlined as Lucas's new guardian, and the rest of the film is spent delving into their relationship and plans for the foggy future lying ahead. As aforementioned, this is a truly heavy film, but it's not necessarily a five - course meal of lead: as it runs on, we do see the devastating events that lead into Lee becoming so emotionally stunted and closed off from the world, but the awkward, yet witty banter kept up among himself and the characters keeps this package tightly wrapped. It comes within inches of cheesy melodrama territory, but the pitch-perfect realism of its performances, especially in what is probably Affleck's best to date, help it truly strike a chord. It's less a drama about love and loss, and more a beautiful look into the impact and handling of such strong feelings in society today. At times it does feel a bit lengthy, but ultimately, I believe it is a lovingly-crafted expression of grief and slowly healing from its effects, as well as one of the best films of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 November 2021,10/10,"You can see the pain in lee's (casey affleck) face the whole movie, just a awesome performance! Great Story, depressing atmosphere. Probably Not for fast and furious fans."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 September 2018,2/10,I kept waiting for something positive to happen and it never did. I don't enjoy movies that start off tragic and end bad. Wish I never wasted 2 hours on this. The acting was top notch though.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 August 2017,9/10,"Knowing before watching this may be about a tough retrieval from trauma, I indeed felt a lot of empathy in it, especially after the reminiscence of the fire accident appears on the screen, which bears a painstaking resemblance to the tragedy happened recently in China. Also losing three young, adorable children during a horrible inferno, what differentiates Mr. Lin, the only survivor of the fire, is, even more heartbreaking, the decease of his great wife and the true culprit behind it. Even though not a screen that could have been lifted if not at the first place, but, not less dismaying, a long-trusted housemaid who intended to bilk some more money out of this poor family for loan of gambling. To be honest, Mr. Lee is a little more luckier in that he doesn't have to deal with wily real estate conglomerate. Still, pulling out an innocent police officer' gun in a attempt of suicide reminds me of a suspiciously similar event in Mr. Lee's case. Fortunately, both fell through, and it is my best wish to Mr. Lin that, please, like Lee Chandler, don't give in. Stand up and fight for what you believe is right. People will always be at your back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 September 2020,10/10,"I find the number of reviewers here who give this film 1/10 is depressing. I guess they have wandered away from superhero movies and can't recognise greatness when they see it. This is a tremendous, heartreaking film and you will never see finer acting than Afleck and Williams in a scene where they meet up towards the end of it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 July 2017,1/10,"Never in a movie have I wanted so much that all characters would tragically die in the end. There isn't a single likable character, and the plot is a complete drag. It takes the film a complete half-hour just to set the initial context to the story, and it doesn't develop much from there. It is not even a contemplative film, with landscape shots not much different from the ones you would shoot yourself on a day trip to the harbor. The drama is typical of a soap opera with the downside that there are no commercial breaks."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 March 2018,10/10,"Somehow, Manchester by the Sea is a feel-good movie and tear jerker at the same time. If you are looking to watch something fresh and original, this is the film for you.I've read some of the reviews, and some are frustrated that the main character is boring and can't hold it together. However that is exactly what this film is about; people struggling to find happiness and are hardly holding it together. This film was touching in a unique way. The use of awkward silences is one of my favorite parts about this movie. In real life, nobody responds to bad news right away. You take the time to process what happened and react accordingly, something this movie protrays perfectly. Also, the use of comedy in a depressing situation is so orginial, and I love that this movie captures the most accurate representation of grieving in real life."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2017,1/10,"Laborious and plodding plot choked by even heavier music. How can this possibly be considered a top contender for an award? I do have to say there are excellent actors in the film; however, their lines come across as forced--loaded with lots of lengthy pauses that go on forrr-evv-errrr. And lots of crying phlegm. The highlight of the film, which I would have rather seen the director/writer explore, is Matthew Broderick and Gretchen Mol's scene. Most of the characters are introduced but don't get more exploration. And there are a lot of pointless characters who don't add anything to the film. Filing my tax papers would be more interesting than this film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,2/10,"I paid good money to see this ""critically acclaimed movie"". I will not be able to get that hour and a half back.Hollywood must be running out of things to talk about besides Trump. This movie could have been a ""hallmark"" movie. Casey Affleck doesn't act, he just shows up. The only movie worth seeing with him in it is, Drowning Mona and again, he just shows up. So Hollywood/Amazon, give the paying public some credit and make decent movies and quit the hype."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2017,1/10,"I joined IMDb today so I could write this review.How this has been nominated for 6 Oscars is beyond belief.The Film starts slows and plods on to dreary end where nothing really happens, Casey Afflecks performance is wooden to the point where you cant sympathise with his character and the fact that he was using drugs and drinking when his house burnt down.The film jumps about from flashback to present in the early stages and early on its difficult to tell which is which, Lee doesn't look that happy prior to the fire , so you never really get a sense of comparison.This film may have benefited from just running through the course of events rather in order than flash backs, there is a sense that some big secret is about to be revealed - but nothing happens then it ends.Just a few specifics to comment on which added to the drudgery ;1. When his wife wants to go to lunch with him it sounds like there is a huge confession coming ie - it was me that took the guard off the fire - but No2. Much was made in the hospital of not having his brothers personal effects - nothing was mentioned again.3. The symoblism that was tried for in the frozen meat in the freezer because his dad was kept in a freezer at the undertakers was quite frankly ludicrous and in poor film was very badly acted.4. The son of the dead brother seemed really happy considering his dad had just died.5. The overuse of emotional classical music in scenes that were just not that emotional just didn't work.I didn't like it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 March 2017,8/10,"If you ever look for an exact portrayal of human feelings, if you look for a movie which gives you the feeling of watching an actual live camera roll of people's lives, if you think you need a movie which makes you forget you are actually watching a movie, you have to see Manchester by the Sea in which you will enjoy every minute of Casey Aflek's acting; he strongly proves himself as a truly professional actor in this movie. Although the plot cannot be clear to the audience through the first thirty minutes or so, the viewer is so enchanted by the minute details of human feeling, actions, interaction and the portrayal of a small town and the people in it, that once you understand what really is going on in the movie, you will be startled that you did not even try to find any plot in this movie! It can amuse you with it semi-documentary registration of every minute. Although the movie is a cliché of starting in the middle of a plot and then takes you back to the past memories, it is not short of anything in any sense."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 April 2020,8/10,"Rarely there is a film these days to come out of Hollywood that is so humane, realistic and straight to the point. Though it feels a little bit overdone at times, the performances and subtle writing made 'Manchester by the Sea' a drama of craftsmanship.While many don't like it because it doesn't 'hit home', I like it just for that reason, cause it does 'hit home' in a way. The story is told in a way that happens exclusively in the real world, without escaping to some universe all the time. It's a tale of mourning, loss and pain. It could just happen to you. See, that's what gives 'Manchester by the Sea' it's relatability and humanity."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 March 2017,8/10,"The problems happening such as with the wife or the young man with his mother are in a lack of sense to be taken seriously good because it is not well explained, it just shows the before and after crudely, also that end is a much bit of unlaced,anyway its okay because the plot is not a awe-thing. The filmography is fine, but again the plot lacked of something else happening."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 March 2017,3/10,"If anyone tries to drag you to see Manchester by the Sea, don't waste two hours and seventeen minutes of your time. The story is an attempt to share the agony and personal demons of a dysfunctional man. Casey Affleck is a very good actor (ten times the actor his brother Ben could ever hope to be), but that fact doesn't rescue the film. The first hour is wasted in the agonizing process of informing the audience of the reasons for this man's torment by a very circuitous route. The film does have some redeeming qualities (Great cinematography, good performances by the cast), but they aren't enough to overcome the crap you have to endure to make it to the end.Normally I get very engrossed in a film, but ninety minutes into this exercise in anguish I was checking my watch and thinking I would rather be in a dentist's chair."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 October 2016,10/10,"I was very pleased to snag a last minute returned, lone available ticket to the European premiere of this on Saturday as I'd heard a lot of great things about this film and it had been sold out.The premise is simple: when his brother Joe dies, Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck) is forced to take care of his teenage nephew in his hometown, from which he moved away years earlier to escape his demons from a trauma years earlier.It becomes clear early on that Lee had life figured out years earlier. The film jumps between the past and the present, revealing a time where Lee was married, spent a lot of time with his friends and family (especially his brother and his nephew) and was content with life. But while jumping between the two periods of time, the film travels along at a slow, tense pace, tentatively revealing facets of Lee's past and present personalities (which are remarkably different) before hitting the audience with the full force of what exactly what made him run from his hometown.Casey Affleck is astonishingly good and it's no wonder that there is a strong early buzz around his performance. He essentially plays two different characters, a man before trauma and a man after. The 'before' in flashbacks is fairly simple, a relatively friendly and happy-go-lucky guy who spends a lot of time with his friends and family, has a close relationship with his nephew, etc. But where he excels is in the quiet desperation of the present-day Lee Chandler. With this character there are only rare moments of outward emotion - but Affleck plays it so that it is painfully clear just how much hurt Lee is keeping inside. Best Actor Oscar nomination, and highly possible win, incoming.Despite the serious subject matter, there is a surprising warmth that permeates the film. This is a film primarily about a man forced to confront his demons, yes, but it is also a film about family and the ties that bind us to our hometown. There is a terrific chemistry between Affleck's Lee and Lucas Hedges, who plays his nephew Patrick. Make no mistake, despite its subject matter this film is often hilarious, with the dialogue between Lee and his nephew providing most of the frequent outbursts of laughter in the cinema. Owing to his detachment and fear, Lee is fairly useless as a caregiver to Patrick, who in turn pushes his limits in being allowed to do whatever he wants (mostly chasing girls - there are particularly hilarious scenes when he is trying to get laid).Affleck's Lee is also forced to confront his demons in the form of his now ex-wife Randi, played by the ever-brilliant Michelle Williams. It's actually a relatively small part, but a key one, with an especially important scene that is played beautifully by both Affleck and Williams. In the Q&A that took place before the film, Williams talked about how she had spent 15 years wanting to work with 'Kenny' Lonergan, the director, as he is such a beautiful writer, and so she jumped at the chance before she'd even really heard detail about the part. And it's clear to see why she would be so desperate to work with Kenneth Lonergan, whose writing and directing for this film is gentle, warm and heartbreaking in one package. It's bleak, but hints at hope. It's understated, but breaks out in small moments of agony without overdoing it (the middle of the film is particularly gut-wrenching). I would be very surprised not to see nominations in his direction also.Beautiful writing and directing from Kenneth Lonergan, and a stunning performance from Casey Affleck in particular. It's a beautiful, quiet picture encapsulating trauma, guilt, redemption and familial bonds."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 April 2017,6/10,"This is a serious story of a dysfunctional 30-something (played by Casey Affleck) whose brother has willed that Affleck's character take over raising the decedent's teen-aged son (played by Lucas Hedges). The parts of uncle and nephew are very well acted indeed.The biggest flaw, for me, is the number of flashbacks. One major early event must be kept hidden from us until the middle of the movie; I understand that. But the rest of the backing and forthing in time is gratuitous, and the demands that makes on the audience represent a touch of arrogance on the part of the director.A flaw that will not bother most people, but which I can't dismiss, is that the real Manchester by the Sea is an upper-class community on the fashionable North Shore outside Boston. You would not get one clue of that by watching this film, so I blame the writer of the book for setting the story there, and I blame the director for preserving the title. In the housing ""bust,"" the million-dollar median home sale price in Manchester dropped below $600K (but not below $500K), and in 2013-2014 rebounded to about $700K. In nearby Gloucester, it's $400K; that's a venue better suited to a story that portrays no graduates of Harvard or Tufts. Or how about Lynn ($300,000)? I can see the necessity of showing a contrast between the protagonist's home scene in urban squalor and the relatively clean, uncrowded environment of the shore, but to choose one of the rich people's playgrounds seems silly.Finally, the sheer quantity of the misfortune visited upon the main character is oppressive to the viewer. Bad things do happen to people, and the theme of a partial redemption through serving the needs of others is reasonable and rings true. But I simply could not ""buy into"" the main character's problems, and the disconnect between his apparent cleverness and his deficiency of common sense.So, I'm not sorry I bought the ticket and spent the time to see the film, but I do not approve of its screenplay Oscar. Go see it so that you, too, can complain about it!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 December 2020,8/10,"One mistake. And everything is ruined. If it is not, then we try to ruin it ourself. I loved the scene when he asked the police officer that can he really go back home? He wanted the officers to punish him. He accepted the abuses by his wife with open heart. In order to punish himself, he tried to live a non-existent life, with no desires, no goals to fulfill. Stayed away from women, no small chat, no sweet smile while greeting anyone.Then he felt alive again. When he was forcefully dragged into life responsibilities."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2018,10/10,"Haven't seen a drama so good since forever. Everything about this movie is so amazing, from simple life storytelling, amazing cinematography, music ... beautiful acting. Everything delivers so much emotions that you just have to feel and enjoy . 10/10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2018,8/10,"I am carried away by this drama so much, this film looks very real as our daily life. The backsound strengthen the film"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 June 2019,8/10,"First of all maybe this film will be boring for some people because of the slow storyline.
In this film you will witness the way the main actors lived after what happened in the past.
At the beginning of the story you might be confused, what really happened to the main character. but over time, you will understand.
I like a lot this film, especially with its realistic plot and cinematography, and the way Casey Affleck plays his character. Personal rating 8.0 / 10"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 June 2020,10/10,An extraordinary and moving performance by a great leading actor.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 August 2019,8/10,This movie will blow you away. It is one of the most intense character studies you will ever expierence. There is so much happening in between the lines. What Casey Affleck is doing is overwhelming. Someone trapped.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 December 2019,9/10,"Everyone who have watched this movie must understand what it's meant.
The best performance of Casey Affleck"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 May 2020,10/10,"It doesn't matter how hard we try or how long it takes, perhaps some people deal with their grief and give it a place in their minds for a peaceful life. But there are others, such as Lee Chandler, whose are in critical condition and are being held in a cold prison. No one can really feel the pain that you have experienced. Sometimes you can't explain this pain in words to others, and worse, sometimes our lips don't move at all to explain. ""Manchester by the sea"" is the ugly and bitter side of life that has its own beauty. It's about the normal part of human relationships in the real world.
""Manchester by the Sea"" tells the story of crisis and grief in real life, and sometimes people have been injured that they simply can't get back on their feet. Of course, people may gradually forget and turn to something happier again, but that never happens quickly. People may be stuck in one spot for a long time and forget to move. While the body is alive, the soul may be dead, so that it may not soon find a way to feel and live again. For Lee Chandler, life is a cold, endless winter in which he is imprisoned."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 April 2019,4/10,Man is sad. Nothing happens for two hours. Man is still sad. The end.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2021,3/10,"If your reason to see this movie is the desire to see a depressing movie there are certainly better, less boring options. If you like realism still much better options.
I don't generally think Casey Affleck has so much variety on his acting but here you can substitute him with a log of wood and the movie would be practically the same.
Avoid! Don't take the critics placebo, or the oscars. This movie without the promotion and the known actors would never have been shown in the pixels of your tv.
(1 min of silence for everyone that saw this cinema)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 November 2019,1/10,Couldn't even finish it. Was so bad I had to write a review. That's twice now that Casey Affleck has made one of the worst movies in film history. The first time was when he made Gerry which may be the worst and most pointless movie ever made.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 November 2021,3/10,"My criteria for a good movie are:does the story rise above the subject matter?do the characters show any personal growth during the course of the film?is the film entertaining?None of these are met in this film.I find it incomprehensible that so much energy, talent and money is wasted on telling the story of a low-life drug user / drinker / fighter who caused the death of his children."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a very unsettling movie. So unsettling that my mind couldn't stop wrestling when the credits started to roll, ""is that it? This can't be it."" I wanted to see more post-ending stories that could weave the movie to a taut conclusion. But my yearning was tossed aside. I had no choice but to leave the cinema.The movie tells the story of Lee Chandler—a custodian in Boston who unclogs toilets for a living, drops the f bomb in front of his customer without even once turning his tongue, and punches people who glance at him at the bar—who, due to an unfortunate incident, has to drive back to Manchester—a fishing town where he once resided. Only to discover, with bewilderment, that his brother chooses him to be the guardian of his nephew Patrick. And the rest of the movie explores the uncle- nephew relationship and how the two come to cope with the arrangement.Lee is a someone whom, after sharing a conversation with, you would wonder if there's something wrong with him. Why doesn't he engage in small talk? Why doesn't he smile? Why is he so aggressive? Kenneth Lonergan takes us to the Zen-like oceanic Manchester and cleverly unfolds tragic past that has been haunting Lee. The storytelling is character-driven through dialogues and reactions. Mr. Lonergan really understands people and successfully crafts out their essences. There is one scene that particularly struck me. Patrick opens the freezer and some meat packages fall down to his feet. He peers at the sight and suddenly has a mental breakdown. The seemingly absurd and comic scene is an explosive moment that bares Patrick's innermost anguish. That is a succinctly done-well character development. The screenplay is intelligent because it knows exactly the materials to awe the audience by slowly revealing bits and pieces of the characters without explicitly rushing to the point.What makes Manchester by the Sea a good movie to me depends largely on the acting and the fact that it is a Kenneth Lonergan's movie. Casey Affleck, with no objection, earns the spotlight. His portrayal of a disheartened man who doesn't want to deal with anything anymore is depressingly human. Lee doesn't care if he's being socially insensitive and does what he has got to do—drinks beer, works, and tries his best to be a father figure for Patrick. The rest of the cast—especially Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges who bear the burden to carry the movie forward—is also solidly heart-wrenching to watch. A mediocre performance even in one scene would definitely reduce the story's emotional and comedic impact. And I can't imagine anybody else directing this movie. As Matt Damon put it, ""this is a completely Kenny Lonergan movie."" The playwright understands his script the best. Every scene has its intention and another director might not have been able to do it justice.Leaving the empty cinema perplexed, I was contemplating intensely about the whole movie on the way back home. I realized something. The trip to Manchester was all about understanding why Lee Chandler is who he is. There's nothing more to demand more from him. Even though I, like all other supporting characters in the movie, long for Lee to recover and be responsible for his life and his nephew. But I had learned to be sympathetic. It seems like everyone in the movie is judgmental against Lee—like how people are in general— without considering what he has been through. The realism of Manchester by the Sea takes emotional pain seriously, like we all should."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,8/10,"Many people think that this movie is boring and slow and they are right, but there is a reason for it. The movie is slow to you can admire the great dialogues and the beautiful scenario . Casey Affleck became one of my favorite actors since "" Gone Baby Gone"" and was very satisfying to me , see him get this award. In terms of dialogues he is astonishing and I consider an actor very human witch is possible to all people compare their lives to his role. There is a very sad ambient around the movie but life is also sad sometimes and we all got difficult moments which we battle to get happiness and there is something that always happen a put you down. This is a proof that a simple story also can have a big impact and exist a lot of moments that push you to like this movie like : the hard work that Lee haves , the beer in the bar at night when you had a difficult day at work , the family problems , the death of someone important , the woman relations , etc . And this moments are very human and happen is all families in the world. The snow helps with the sad environment and is a very important element in the movie , the city is a old city and very British which can transmit some mystic and there is also another element which is the boat , the boat I think that means ""the direction"" that lee will give to his life. I loved the movie and I think people that like drama and people that are always sad because of their daily job and life should see this movie ."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 June 2017,1/10,"Yes, I too just wasted a couple of hours on this turkey. If this script came to me in my screen writing class, I'd certainly tell the student to rewrite until we had more believable characters, more real dramatic conflict and much less sentimentality (most of which was in the horribly chosen music).Endless self-pity gets awfully boring."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 December 2016,2/10,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The main point in the movie is a man dies and his brother (Casey Affleck) has to take charge of his nephew. The only character that sheds a tear in this movie is Michelle Williams (her performance is fantastic). But she is only on screen about three times in the movie and for about five minutes total. So, a very misleading movie poster. And Casey Affleck's character shows very little emotion throughout the entire movie and he never cries. Not even a single tear. Even when two other people very very close to him dies. Nothing. Also, back to the nephew....he doesn't cry or do anything when his father dies....or the other two people later in the movie. All he cares about is having sex with his two girlfriends. I thought this movie had a lot of potential in several places, but it was just dry, flat and extremely annoying. The writer and director I think tried to make it look like normal everyday life by making it slow and lethargic, but it fails. A little bit of that here and there is not bad, but not through the entire movie. Life is not like that. And the lack of emotion by all the characters except for one is completely unbelievable! I felt so irritated the entire movie. I wanted to walk out and leave, but went with a friend and couldn't leave."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 April 2019,10/10,"A fantastic (if you can use that word) study of grief and it's isolating, confusing, angry, and disorientating effects."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2017,9/10,"I've seen lots of movies to this day, about parent dying then some kid and and parent's sibling or best friend's troubles getting to know each other and stuff. that's so cliché.when I read the plot I thought it's one of those movies.but then I saw the high ratings and lots of nominations ,so I decided to give it a try. It had nothing to do with those cliché movies, it's so dramatic and realistic. Some people find it boring, but I never get bored with such a strong screenplay.and the actors play their roles so realistic, I really enjoyed Mr. Affleck's performance, it's outstanding.I highly recommend this movie"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 May 2017,10/10,Kenneth Lonergan creates another amazing story about Family. His writing is just so real that you actually feel for these characters. Manchester By The Sea tells the story of Lee Chandler a handyman needed to take care of his nephew after the boys father dies but Lee's nephew lives in Lee's old town where his past haunts him. Casey Affleck gives one of the best performances an actor can give he shows emotion in a subtle way that is so great. Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges give great performances along side Casey Affleck. This is a movie that everyone should see.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 April 2018,9/10,"Definitely an oscar-winning performance by Casey Afleck as the troubled Lee. Wonderfully understated with the plot developed in a current and flash back time lines, interwoven with minimalist dialogue.
As the film develops the central character's history becomes clearer, until a key scene makes sense of a lot of the proceeding narrative. 
There's no easy or trite answers here, as grief, guilt, change and redemption combine to a close where some although some resolution is achieved it's not all neatly packaged.
Wonderful scoring throughout and cinematography build a compelling atmosphere throughout. 
It won't be for everyone, that's for sure, but for me this is film-making as it should be - artistic, meaningful and moving, where the unspoken and the visual combine to create the overall narrative. Wonderful."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 February 2020,2/10,Totally overrated. I waited for 2hrs 17mnts for something to happen. but it ended like it started.Use your time wisely and skip this movie.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 September 2019,3/10,"The 3 stars are for the acting.
The reason I watched the movie was the trailer, it displayed 'warmth' but this movie is just flat dead. Meaning that it's completely miserable, it's not sad, it's depression manifested. And in that it has achieved its purpose. I tried to feel miserable for the guy but I couldn't. What got me through the movie (hardly) was the sense of hope that something good might happen.If you are a miserable person you will be able to relate to the misery. Or if you are a guy studying cinema you might like it for the technical stuff.I'm sure not majority of people are technical guys, and yet this movie is a hit!It's a long line of chalk drawn on an otherwise empty blackboard for 2 hours."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 May 2017,10/10,Easily the best movie of the year. I saw it on Amazon prime video and I could not believe how fantastic this film is. Everything about it just feels totally genuine. The acting is top notch from everyone. Casey Affleck is the lead character and he certainly delivers a superb performance but honestly everyone in this film deserves accolades. The story line is sad but beautiful and brought me to tears. I really appreciate the way this film explores how we are all flawed human beings haunted by our past. The musical score is top notch also.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 December 2020,10/10,"The most phenomenal performance by Casey Affleck makes this film worthy of a place in cinema history. A deep and brooding look at a life marred by tragedy, it nevertheless remains full of heart and quirkily comic. I cannot recommend this film highly enough."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 October 2017,1/10,"The trailer looked interesting, especially in light of this movie getting a few awards. The overall review average was excellent. However, I was sorely disappointed by this movie. There were so many opportunities for great story telling in this movie, topics to be explored, that were left lying on the table, or perhaps cutting room floor. Many reviewers, including ""professionals"", haves raved over the story and the acting, I just can't agree with them. The main character, Lee Chandler, walks around either depressed or angry for 99% of the movie. When he's angry I knew it was a matter of moments before he took a sucker punch at a stranger. The word said most often by the majority of the characters is the F- bomb. I felt sorry for Casey Affleck since most of his dialogue was 3-4 word sentences that he said multiple times. There is a heart-wrenching reason for Lee Chandler's depression, but it felt like it took forever to unveil this fact. The story could have explored his journey from the incident and his path to heal or deal with his grief, but that was another opportunity left to lie. Lee's relationship with his ex-wife was also a great opportunity to explore that was left to wilt away. Lee's relationship with his brother's friend, George, was also left unexplored. The strongest plot line was Lee's connection with his nephew, Patrick, and that, again, is an opportunity left lying. More than one character in this movie gave impressions of Lee, but not enough so that I wasn't left scratching my head. For example, Lee walks into a place, asks about a job, leaves and a woman comes out from the back and says, ""I don't want to see him here again!"" Why? That character's response is never explored. The cinematographic attempt to blend the current with flashbacks had me asking every time, ""What's happening? Is this now, or something from his past?"" At the end of the movie both my husband and I said, ""What was this about?"" The storyline rambled aimlessly and ended with no wrap up, no cliffhanger, nothing one would expect from any type of storytelling. So, beware the high rating of this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2016,3/10,"I'm from Manchester. The original. The UK Manchester. Some would say the real Manchester. Its famous for being grey and rainy - and not near Essex. But, despite the weather, we make the best of it. I love this city. It is vibrant, youthful, energetic and positive. It is everything this film isn't. When I go to see a film I want to feel something (other than boredom). I don't care if that's sadness, revulsion, fear, elation, etc - I just want to feel. Yes, the disconnected numbness felt when viewing MbtS could be analogous to Casey Affleck's withdrawn character, but, I'm sorry, that doesn't translate to an arresting cinema going experience.When a character movie has such dreary characters, the film fails. I couldn't engage with anyone. They're all so lazily written, monotonously acted and badly realised. Let's get one thing straight; a lack of emotion does not display Oscar-worthy range. It is not subtlety. It is not grounded. It is not to be applauded. A snotty, whiny apology with sadface is not good acting. Punching undeserving people in bars is not powerful drama. Driving an entitled teenager around a miserable town in a dull red truck is not entertainment. The lead is Affleck. He can't seem to keep away from tragedy, but he tries by avoiding conversation and drowning his sorrows in drink. A nuanced and original character he is not. The other main character is the orphaned teenage boy. Again, someone with very little emotional range. Other than the odd, unfunny wisecrack - despite a recently deceased father. Above I called him entitled. I fear I may be overselling him. He isn't interesting enough to earn the description. I saw this film only a few hours ago, but the only other characters I can recall are the brother that dies, a wife that used to drink, a few charred kids in a bodybag, fat Ferris Bueller and... that's it. Everyone else is forgettable window-dressing. They are there to drag out the almost non-existent plot. Ah, the 'plot'. Well, boring Afflek has to look after a boring 16 year old kid after his boring brother (the kid's father) dies. That's it. For 2 and a half hours. Come. Follow them on their wacky adventures!Or not. I'm afraid Depressing Afflek's character lost me the moment he started the first bar fight. Yes, 'first', as in there are more. He also fights a window. And loses. Normal people don't punch strangers for looking at them in a bar. That's psychotic behavior. That will get you arrested, no matter what your past tragedies. But in miserable-movie-world that's just a physical metaphor for his emotional plight. Sigh. From that point on I didn't care about him, his dull family, or their lazy dramas. And yes, ""its all your fault your kids are dead"" is about the laziest trope to give your character a tragic past.I think the thing that truly killed it was just how easy everyone had it. There were no stakes. They were all devoid of struggle. No one had any real-world problems - beyond the dead family members. The worm- food dad left the kid a huge paid-off house, a boat, and lots of cash to help Misery Afflek look after him, FFS. Their worst quandary was deciding what to do with the inherited boat. You see, it had an engine that really needed replacing, but the cash wasn't immediately available. Until it was. When they found the dad's presumably antique guns to sell.I say found. They were in a moodily lit display cabinet in the house all along.""But what about all the dead people."" I hear the menopausal MbtS fans shreik. You know, dying family members come up, but it doesn't seem to be all that relevant to the plot. No one seems all that affected by the deaths. They mourn in their own, boring, guarded ways - but so what? If they had to deal with that on top of financial troubles, or a criminal past, or anything else then that could have been interesting, but 'interesting' was notably absent from MbtS. I think the interview after the fire scene summed it up perfectly. Moaning Afflek is surprised that he can go free, despite killing three kids in an accident. That's it. A little suicidal emotional outburst is end-scene. Done. No need to revisit.Couldn't there have been maybe some suspicion of arson? Maybe the investigation was ongoing when he was forced to return to Manchester? Maybe the emotional weight of having to deal with dead children on top of the town's suspicious eyes would have given this film a layer of depth it cried out for?But no. That would have been skirting too close to the fires of plot. We've had enough of fire, thank you very much. So back to the grey, uneventful, bleak dullness of it all. Here's the thing; if I don't care about the characters, I don't care about their apparent hidden anguish in a plot-less film. When a disconnect like the first groansome bar fight, or Ferris Bueller's Day Off The Diet, rips you out of the movie - why care what's going through these character's minds? They become just that - characters. Actors playing make believe. The film fails when all I see is pretense through the mucus. I could go on, but - unlike this movie - I know when to stop."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 December 2018,8/10,"Not much to say here, it's just great drama and story telling. Tears would not stop."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 February 2019,5/10,"I watch this movie because it had a 7.8 rating, so I'm figuring this is going to be a really good movie. Boy was I mistaken! It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just that during the whole film I'm waiting on some what of a breakthrough which never happens. I wish I could have those two hours and 17 minutes back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,1/10,"do not, I repeat, do not waste your time, money, energy or sanity by going to see this abysmal excuse of a movie. of the two movies I have walked out of, in fifty years of going to the cinema, this would be by far the worst movie. It was a total disappointment in all areas, camera work, script, direction, set, editing, costumes, acting, characters and most of all the story, they were either poor, hopeless or non existent. the end product was two and a bit hours of total misery and unfulfilled expectation that something would improve, it never did. in fact that would be the only thing that shone through in this movie, its total dullness. if you have read this far, remember you have been warned, do not go to this total piece of garbage."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 March 2021,10/10,"My heart was broken. And I know yours was broken, too."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2017,7/10,"Good, but not great.Also, I have a problem with the contrived photograph that is so often used to market this film. That scene never happened. The actors where cut from a scene in an alley (very odd in the first place) and pasted over an ocean scene. Artistic interpretation or false advertising? ;)"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 March 2020,3/10,"I watched this with my wife and at the end we both concluded the movie was a bit pointless. There is some good acting and the scenes are picturesque but Casey Affleck was incredibly dull. Part of the reason for the low score was terrible audio; at numerous points it was difficult to hear the dialogue. Ironically, my wife chose the movie because the trailer looked ""uplifting"" but if you want to be depressed then watch this movie a couple of times and it will do the trick."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,2/10,"After 1 hour and a half of watching this drivel. It is painful to think I spent time with so many dull characters. I was constantly waiting for the next line. It was like the director passed out Valium to all the actors in the movie. If the premise of the movie was to let me get to know depression exists in America, this is the movie to watch. Dull characters. This movie moves too slow. I am sorry but there are other Best Actor performances than Casey Affleck. Denzel, Adam Driver from Patterson or Andrew Garfield of Hacksaw Ridge. I actually though for a more mundane but interesting character was Chris Pine in Hell or High Water. Don't waste your time"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,5/10,"First and foremost, this is a film about emotion and tragedy. It's slow, depressing, doesn't have a lot of action, and ends abruptly. Now, I'm not opposed to these qualities at all – in fact, one of my favorite books (The Road) could be described exactly like that – but unfortunately for ""Manchester by the Sea"", those qualities are woefully underdeveloped and left me utterly unsatisfied.On a narrative level, the film is a mess. It haphazardly jumps between present day and a series of flashbacks, and while some of these sequences make sense, others disrupt the flow of the movie and distract from important scenes. I appreciate the revealing of backstory through flashbacks, but they could have been implemented more gracefully. The pacing could be described as a slow burn, but an overabundance of filler shots and complete lack of character development result in an overly-long and aimless plot. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between Lee and Randi, but there are not enough scenes to really dig into their tragic story. Additionally, the chemistry between Lee and Patrick is great, but there is almost no development of this relationship over the course of the movie, ending in nearly the same way it started. For a film so focused on character dynamics, it does remarkably little with these relationships, and I can't help but wonder what the director could have done with a little more substance and less filler.About that filler... The film is packed with beautiful shots that establish the setting quite well, but they start to become overbearing by the end of the film, to the point where I felt they were only added to pad the length of the movie. There is simply not enough going on in the story to justify dragging it out so long. Shots of characters standing around aimlessly also lengthened what should be a very simple film. I also took issue with the soundtrack. While pleasant, it had a tendency to overwhelm certain scenes, and it felt out of place more than once. I certainly felt for the characters in this movie. It was very emotional, and the actors portrayed their feelings with great subtlety. That being said, I think the film was too reliant on tragedy as a means of expressing emotion. If you remove both of the tragedies from this movie, the characters don't stand on their own. I would have liked to see more events to shape the characters, and more range from the actors. Affleck was admirable, but I wouldn't say Oscar-worthy. I thought he nailed sadness and depression, but didn't bring the complexity I'd like to see in a role like this. Overall, I feel this is a movie of unrealized potential. It had the backstory, the acting, and the characters to become a truly unforgettable character drama. My biggest issue is that ""Manchester by the Sea"" doesn't really go anywhere. The characters and their relationships are left wholly under-developed, ending in virtually the same place they started. What little progress there is becomes lost in the lethargic plot and filler content. When the end credits rolled, I was left thinking ""this can't possibly be it, right?"" I wanted more, and not because I was so engrossed in the film, but because it felt so incomplete."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2019,7/10,"This movie was too raw for me, but Affleck's acting is seriously next level."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 December 2016,9/10,"Manchester By The Sea is definitely one of the best movies I have seen this year. The story itself is slow but beautiful, as an audience we always ask the question - Why do we care about the character? And a successful filmmaker knows how to make the audience relate and care. The part that touches me the most is the relationship between Lee and his brother's son Patrick. They care about each other even though they yell everyday saying ""I don't give a f***"". I think this is because of their characters, they are both in a way not good at expressing themselves. Neither of they showed any emotions after their brother/father just passed away. They are not cold blooded, they care, and I'd like to think that they cared too much, that they got into their own world -- until something or some one breaks it down. For Patrick it's Lee and the frozen chicken in the freezer, for Lee it's Randi and her new born kids. They are too much alike -- In a way that Lee can almost see himself in Patrick through those flashbacks to his early years with Randi. After watching this I truly believe that Lee can help Patrick become a better person, because he simply knows him better, Lee once was Patrick and Joe took care of him. Now it's his time to take care of Patrick. Vice versa, Patrick is also making Lee a better person. Lee has three kids, everybody in town blamed him for their death, and he blamed himself too, in fact he still does. He couldn't face Randi, he couldn't face Manchester. With Patrick, Lee get to pick up a sense of responsibility again, and he can start doing what he needed but failed to do as a father when his three children were still alive. Everyone is lost until someone shows up or something happens, he finds the man that he can rely on and he finds the man that he can find a purpose on, they make a perfect match. A match that can help both of them out of the darkness."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 January 2017,1/10,"Making a movie is hard. This movie illustrates all that can go wrong. The director focused greatly on the little things in a scene. When Tarantino focuses on the price of a milk shake and the scene is a hit, a director will think 'I could focus on little things'. The scenes were poorly cut and jolted along. Often the drawn out boring scenes had long drawn out focus on things like pushing an elevator button. Not interesting things, not things which further the story, and not things which further show emotion of the characters. Actually it was really just one character. Casey Affleck, a janitor who is sad. He mopes around the entire movie. No acting, no emotion, just walking around looking sad. Yes his acting was horrible, but I still have to think the director could have given him some direction along the way. But no, the story had no meaningful direction, so why would I expect the director to care about the acting any more than he cares about the editing, storyline, or even sound track. The supporting actors played no meaningful part in the movie, but for the short time they were on screen there were some solid performances.I think this movie is getting high reviews because it is being confused with a introspective artsy film. It is not. I think one star is extremely harsh for a movie, but this one earned it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 February 2017,2/10,"I very rarely write reviews. Usually because everything that needs to be said about a movie has already been said. But I'm reviewing Manchester by the Sea as a service to anyone who has not seen it yet. Don't bother. I have no idea why this film has such a high rating. Yes its picturesque, and the actors act well but that's not enough. It's boring, even for someone who likes long art movies. Not just slow or dull but actually boring as in wondering whether to leave the theatre boring. Melancholia is boring so you could argue that it is realistic - nah, there are plenty of good films that deal with depression in engaging ways - this isn't one of them. Seriously cut the movie down to about 1 hour and it might be a poignant vignette about loss and coping."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 March 2017,1/10,"if you are insomniac and can't sleep just watch this mega-boring moving you'll get asleep before the first half hour . i don't get how movies like this and Moonlight get popular and so overrated , do people like this kinf of movies or something ? Normally we watch movies to have fun even , but while watching a movie like that i wanna die. even if the end is go i don't lose 2 hours of my life just to see it can't be called ""movie"" that way ."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,10/10,"deep deep sorrows movie , wont make u cry , but your soul will. we don't see Lee crying out loud about his past, but the pain he suffered captured perfectly . personally this movie really touched my heart and soul, its described what happened when you already gave up your life but still alive, how u going to deal with it, the mistakes , the cost, the unstoppable nightmare that keep hunting you, how can u take care your nephew with all this ? But this move gave us a very good warm and realistic ending, taught us whatever happened , we should brave enough to get through of it. this movie will be more great when u see it multiple times, i really like it. thank you all the people that involved in making the ""Manchester by the Sea"". This is a life movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 June 2017,1/10,"This movie is so bad that i had to do this review. Worst movie of the year. Not interesting things, not things which further the story, and not things which further show emotion of the characters. Actually it was really just one character. Casey Affleck, a janitor who is sad. He mopes around the entire movie. No acting, no emotion, just walking around looking sad. Yes his acting was horrible. I'd love to give this film a 0, but I can't. I was really looking forward to seeing this and this has got to be the most boring movie and acting I have seen in years."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 December 2016,10/10,"This film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, and tough all at the same time. This film puts the viewer through the ringer but earns every single moment by the end.Casey Affleck gives one of the best performances I've seen in years. Career defining work. Michelle Williams doesn't have a lot of screen time in the film but is amazing. There is once scene in particular that these two share towards the end of the film, that is jaw-dropping. That scene alone merits both of these two actors Oscar nominations. It's been a few days since I've seen the film and it is still in the back of my mind. Best film I've seen in 2016. Exceptional."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 December 2016,5/10,"If the rating was based on a total of five stars, I would have given the movie two stars, for TOO long, TOO boring and TOO depressing. Since its a ten star rating system I gave it five stars because their were some good performances, notably Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. You can certainly see Matt Damon's influence in the film, as the nephews character seems an awful lot like Damon's character in Good Will Hunting with his rapid fire, wise ass responses to almost everything he's asked. Casey Affleck's character grew old after the first half hour and I kept hoping it would evolve. Instead I just kept looking at my watch wishing the time would go by faster. I honestly can't see what all the hype is about."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 December 2020,3/10,"Boys boats Boston. Great michelle williams in remake of 'perfect storm'. Way to go. Boats like that should stay in harbor or the gulf of mexico not north atlantic. Try a tugboat.
No. 1 responsibility of family is socialization of children, life after ping pong. Rockport s red barn notable as no.1 most painted in US. Boats are great movie's..may adolescence never end. Marry your childhood sweetheart, but give up drinking beer.
The End"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 December 2016,5/10,"This is one of those films that ends before you decide which moment to walk out on, since you hoped there would be some redemption that was worth waiting for. There isn't. Go to a different film that might be entertaining instead of frustrating. I don't get why other reviews are saying the main character is award worthy for expressing the full range of emotions. Most of it is a blank expression of a repressed personality in the title character. In the story, much of it is a flashback, the father played by Affleck killed his family in a moment of carelessness and in his remorse moves away from Gloucester Mass to a Boston suburb to work as a cute janitor oblivious to the come-ons of female tenants of the apartment complex. News comes of his brother passing away unexpectedly, and it turns out, the brother has set up Affleck to become guardian and mentor to his nephew, a job Affleck explores reluctantly. Then he is oblivious to the come-ons of single mothers of his nephew's friends. After much drama as to whether the character is going to ever come out of his shell, Affleck dishes off the responsibility to a relative, ditches his nephew, moves back to the city to become a janitor again. And presumably, ignore women lusting after him some more. Dude, your brother set you up with a house and a boat and trust fund money to do anything you wanted, and you can't handle that? What an idiot! I'm sorry, this is not a good movie, I wish I had read some reviews before going. Very frustrating to watch. If you're looking for a mature movie, does Woody Allen have something out? lol"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,5/10,"Denzel does more acting -- genuine art -- in the trailer for Fences than Affleck does in this movie. It's dull, banal, and without heart. I am bewildered by the Oscar nod given to the kid, not to mention the award given to Affleck. He is capable of giving a decent performance, but he is not a major talent."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 January 2017,10/10,"This is a truly great film. A story that just feels real in every sense of the word. At times it's heartbreakingly hard to watch, and for everyone with a heart or children for that matter it's truly heart wrenching, but it's also deeply uplifting in the way it tells the story of love and loss in the context of family. The performances are amazing across the board. I've loved Casey Affleck ever since I saw 'Gone Baby Gone' and I think he's turned in a lot of underrated performances, this is probably his best. Michelle Williams steals a couple scenes as well I one of my favorite actors Kyle Chandler is really good as the older brother told through flashback. Every part of this just feels like real life, there are no clichés or dumb monologues about how life is tough or what has happened. You just sit and watch it all unfold in such a unique and powerful way. I thought about it for days after and still do. Reminds me of really great dramas like 'Room' from last year or 'In America' from a number of years ago about authentic stories involving family, loss, and heartache. Really beautiful stuff."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,1/10,"Dead in the water best describes this movie. Boring from beginning to end. Spoiler Alert - I watched the whole movie hoping for something exciting to happen however, there is no apparent climax to the story - it just drones on and on to the end. That's it, the relief you feel having it end, is the climax.Michelle Williams nominated for Best Supporting Actress for about 5 minutes of screen time with little dialogue - not bad work if you can get it. Her real role in the movie was to provide her name to the list of credits. She is rather cute too so the movie has that going for it.In one of the rare scenes where Williams and Affleck appeared together, their engagement in a dialogue of half spoken sentences interrupting each other was lame and probably ad-libbed.Casey Affleck played the part of a severely depressed person well, but the role was not that challenging - Jim Carey could have performed it equally as well. I liked Casey in The Finest Hours where the role had more dialogue and the movie was far more exciting and entertaining."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 January 2017,10/10,"This was the first film I saw in 2017, and it's cemented itself as one of my favorites. The film is profoundly sad, and does it in a realistic and believable way by focusing on a believably flawed main character. It does not feel like a gratuitous weeper, and it does not take the Lifetime route of shoehorning in a happy ending. The director's choice to make the film focus on many side plots and characters adds a layer of depth to the story without making it a sprawling mess. The whole film feels real, organic, and alive.There are few films that can make me forget that I'm watching a movie. Usually there will be some scene that breaks the suspension of disbelief, or something that eventually bores me. I cannot think of a single point where I was taken out of the story for longer than a few seconds. Even when things felt odd or off – the child actor playing young Patrick comes to mind – they only lasted for a moment before I'd be immersed again.I loved this movie. It is a film that will make your soul hurt, but is one that is absolutely worth seeing."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 March 2017,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea is, in my opinion, an elegant film about grief, male bonding, and well, relationships (I needed a third thing, it seemed pretty logical).This is not a light movie. The 2 hour run time is heavily padded with cinematic shots (which I actually enjoyed) and drawn out conversations (which I also enjoyed). If you're a fan of water, large bodies of water, boats on water and sea-spray (this is actually, in essence, just water), then the scenery will make your pants drop.The film excels in its detailed characters and relationships; Casey Affleck (Lee) and Lucas Hedges (Patrick) do what I would call a fantastic job of portraying two complex human beings. Characters Lee and Patrick have a unique chemistry which is in constant flux; I found this to be one of the main draws of the film, along with the sarcastic (albeit sometimes disparaging) nature of their conversations. If you'll indulge me for a second, my favourite was probably:""What happened to your hand?"", ""I cut it"", ""Oh, thanks. For a minute there, I didn't know what happened.""After reading some reviews which say Manchester by the Sea is overrated and dry. From my point of view, the mundane and awkward conversations added to the spirit and tone of the movie; however, I can totally understand if you aren't into that.Also, this movie deals with heavy stuff, and if you aren't into that either, I can imagine it being a pretty long haul filled with trips to the snack bar and/or fridge.I give it 8/10 for having well rounded, nuanced characters, a plot which is driven by these characters, a reasonable amount of flashbacks, a score which was for all intents and purposes fine, and good-to-above-average cinematography. So is Manchester by the Sea all it's cracked up to be? I would watch it again, so let's go with yes."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,2/10,"I felt compelled to write a review after just finishing this movie. Can I say, I'd just like that two hours of my life back? I watch A LOT of movies. A LOT. I sometimes agree and sometimes disagree with the reviews of a movie; however, this one stumped me. I seriously, DO NOT understand what all the hype is over this movie. It was boring. I don't care who starred in it, directed it, wrote it, ANYTHING. I even rate bad movies better than a two star! This one, in my opinion, deserves nothing more than that though. I would hate to see the Oscar go to this movie when it's up against some actual GREAT movies like Lion or Hidden Figures (I haven't seen Hell or High Water or Hacksaw Ridge yet though to be honest). Save your money, wait until this finally makes it over to Netflix. You'll thank me later, I'm sure."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 December 2018,4/10,"While I thought the story was OK, and the performances of Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges were fantastic, I thought Casey Affleck was the weak point in the film that brought it all down. I kept waiting for his acting to impress me, but it never happened. In fact I thought it was rather poor. Maybe it would have been a better film with someone else in that role, like perhaps Matt Damon since he and Hedges are alike in many ways."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 April 2017,1/10,"~Contains spoilers~ in case you intend to watch this dreadful bore yourself So here we go, I literally just joined IMDb to write this comment, just seen one of the worst and boring movies from my entire life. This movie has no story line, no climax, you keep waiting for 2h for something to happen and then it ends abruptly. Casey Affleck, the male lead goes from janitor in 4 buildings, to janitor in 2 buildings BUT an extra room in case his womanizer 16 y old nephew decides to come visit, WOW! What an amazing, uninspired ending? How long I wonder it took the writers to come up with this wonderful idea? Not mentioning the clichés, dead people compared to frozen chicken, kids going back to school the next day you find out your parent and guardian dies and your only concerns is how to to sleep with your neighbour's daughter. Lucky for me I've seen the movie at home so can't complain like other people I've actually paid money to see this trash, but I would absolutely NOT recommend it to anyone, unless you want to waste 2 hours of your life you will not get back!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 May 2018,1/10,Watch something else or go outside for a walk. This film is not worth your time.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 March 2018,4/10,"I saw this movie everywhere and when I finally decided to see it was completely the worst. The few filma I have seen starring Casaey Affleck are often boring and, I feel, try really hard to keep it as ""human"" or ""normal"" as possible which is nothing but boring. There was not really a character development: Lee seems the same through ALL the movie (present, flashbacks is the same), the nephew seems too normal aftee the death of his father and there's only one moment where it seems he feels it but after a plain acting it's just feels weird and senseless to the viewer. I never felt a connection to anything, I doubt I will ever. I can't see how this movie may help or connect or teach or anything beyond anger anyone at all. A waste of time, simply the worst."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 November 2018,8/10,"Manchester by the Sea objectively has almost no flaws as a film. The acting, direction, and story are near perfectly executed & the overall film masters the art of subtlety & communicating emotion in a non-expositional, very realistic way. However, how completely spot-on Manchester by the Sea's portrayal of misery is is actually it's one flaw. The film is almost impossible to watch because it's too uncomfortable, too real. It's an art piece, and from a critic perspective I have to say it's a great movie. But I can't reccomend to a normal audience that they watch it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 July 2020,9/10,"I know some didn't like the ""realness"" of this film, saying if they wanted real life, they wouldn't need to watch a movie. But the realness is what made this so chilling. Lee Chandler (played by Casey Affleck) is a broken man that truly shows the pain of living with the brokenness. Many movies focus on the *breaking* of a man or woman. Manchester By the Sea focuses on the living as a broken man.Affleck was outstanding from beginning to end. He doesn't have many, if any, memorable lines (like ""my boy is wicked smart"") but he made memorable scenes. Michelle Williams the same. The script of her lunch invitation scene almost sounds like Lonergan observed such a conversation between two people and plagiarized it. There were no poetic lines or one-line quips full of wisdom. It was a lot of cutoff sentences, struggling to finish thoughts, and not knowing what to say... Just like it would be in real life.It's not a masterpiece, but there are scenes that are masterpieces. And it is a truly outstanding movie that I highly recommend."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 December 2016,8/10,"You know how you know that you are watching a play, film or show? Maybe 7 minutes out of this whole movie felt acty. The performances were so natural. That was the thing. We all know or are these people. Affleck was without affect. At first I thought his character was an aspie, but the subtly integrated flashbacks keep the revelations coming until you realize how fantastic one's perception of one's daytoday acquaintanceship may be. Williams was in it for about 10 -15 minutes, but she was a flawless diamond. She concentrated a week's worth of intensity into that quarter-hour.Blue collar grief, and a lead character whose PTSD doesn't let manners get in the way of common sense. A handyman finds out that his brother has died, so he must return to his hometown to make arrangements and figure out his nephew's welfare. Flashbacks from his former life, throughout the film, starting on the road to and in Manchester, explain his present life and alienation. The shock of finding himself with a strapping 16 year old orphan on his hands forces him to start coming to terms with his life and past actions. His struggles (wrangling a horny teen with 2 girlfriends, executing his bro's estate without a clue as to...) are totally believable, and the jokes are the funny moments we've all shared with friends, sober or stoned, mourning or rejoicing.Saw it tonight at the Director's Guild Theater. Lonergan spoke and answered questions afterwards."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 January 2019,10/10,"I loved this film. It really lets you live with the characters and to get to know them on a deeper level. Very well made and a justified oscar winning performance, even if his personal life might not be oscar worthy. I loved this."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 March 2017,2/10,"I have been using IMDb for years and have never felt the urge to write a movie review...until this one.... IT absolutely amazed me that Casey Affleck won best actor for his performance in this film, and best original screen play??!!! WOW>>> The only thing that made this movie memorable to me was how it DRAGGED on....with a very limited story-line... honestly that is two hours I will never get back. Affleck plays a dark brooding moody ex-alcoholic which he does convincingly on a one dimensional level...who is left custody of his nephew after his brother dies. Sad story? not really...he is emotionless, with weak mostly meaningless flashbacks. I felt a very limited connection or empathy with or for the character....and again the story itself was not very engaging. Hacksaw Ridge's lead, Andrew Garfield who to me is actually a nobody, deserved the Oscar, and outperformed Casey Afflect 3 to 1 in my estimation. Not to mention, that movie was an actual slice of history and was a wonderful story of bravery and heroism, and not some dark brooding show about a guy with a bad attitude and an irresponsible history. And not even seeing Denzel Washington or Viggo Mortensen's performances in the movies they were nominated for, I am sure they were more deserving, as both have had far superior performances in past movies that they were not properly recognized for...( eg.Viggo in History of Violence and Eastern Promises) I am not sure what Hollywood's attraction to dark somber characters is, but many of them are multi dimensional and we the viewers connect on some level, (love em, hate, want to be them.) But that is not the case here. This guy is not James Dean and this is not an Oscar worthy movie or performance in my estimation..See something else!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 September 2021,9/10,Beautifully portrayed how a small mistake just turns our life upside down. MC Lee portrays beautifully how a father becomes unresponsive after losing his children. Keep patient while watching the movie it's moving from past to present sometimes bugs but it really pays off in the end.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 January 2017,1/10,"Like that piece of crap movie I saw ""Manchester by the Sea"". It was torture to watch. I kept saying, it's got to get better, but it never did. How does a piece of amateur filth, where the dialogue of a 6th grader could write get and I guess nominated for best picture. Dialogue being f this, f that, f you and etc. Rated R for this unimaginative script from Kenneth Lonergan thanks for wasting my time. I think we all know why it's getting nominated because of who is behind the scenes of this pathetic school child film. At the end of the film, no redeeming qualities. Journalists, from FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver to New York Times and New York Magazine writer Angelica Jade and Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers, have called out Affleck on Twitter, as has actress Wu.Wu wrote, ""He's running for an award that honors a craft whose purpose is examining the dignity of the human experience & young women are deeply human"" and then went on to suggest that the clout of the Affleck family has kept some silent in Hollywood. (Actor Matt Damon produced Manchester by the Sea.) She tweeted, ""I've been counseled not to talk about this for career's sake. F my career then, I'm a woman & human first. That's what my craft is built on.""Meanwhile, the internet is coming to terms with multiple sexual-harassment lawsuits against Affleck, who has settled those cases out of court. The Daily Beast has a pretty definitive account of the charges, but you can also read the court filings from the two plaintiffs — producer Amanda White and cinematographer Magdalena Gorka. Affleck was accused of sexually inappropriate and emotionally abusive behavior toward White and Gorka over a period of many months while they were working on his 2010 documentary I'm Still Here. Among other things, White stated that Affleck frequently referred to women as ""cows,"" sent her threatening text messages after she refused to share a hotel room with him, and locked her out of her room so he and Joaquin Phoenix could have sex with two women in it. Gorka alleged similar behavior, including that Affleck often joked about how she should have sex with various members of the production team, and that she once woke up to find him in her bed. Eventually, both White and Gorka were forced to leave the project."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 June 2020,8/10,"This movie is not for everyone.. It creates a mood slowly, shows a man's strughle to confront his past and how he deals with it"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 December 2019,1/10,"This is my first ever review. The film is so slow and too long, and nothing ever really happens./"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 March 2020,2/10,So bad so boring i have just watched 30 minutes and it was very long
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 April 2020,8/10,"Sometimes you have to force yourself to write a thing. And ""Manchester by the Sea"" is one of those topics that just do not come so easily. And you're sort of left wondering, why. The experience was not as traumatic as what my friends went through, but it did leave a taste of marginal clearness. The kind that leaves you staring at the ceiling for three hours questionless, yet lost.If I had to name one thing that stood out to me most throughout the film, it would definitely be its cruel realism. It's uttered in a lot of different ways, one of them being the continuity of life, depicted, for instance, in the funeral scene. First, we hear the music and see quite a common picture: the family and the loved ones of the deceased person gathered around the coffin, mourning. Suddenly the baby starts crying and Randi takes measures to stop the interruption of grief. Isn't it, like, the most real-life thing that could possibly happen? A baby just starts crying. It doesn't care for the place or the people around, or the reason they're just standing in silence. It wants to cry, and it does.By the way, Randi's pregnancy is not only an established boundary that prevents any action between ex-lovers. It's also a metaphor in itself. One life got taken away, and when people come to express their grief, they see Randi pregnant, about to create a new life. And when Joe's body is lowered into a pit, as the last goodbye, the new human just screams out its condolences.The director Kenneth Lonergan teases us with grief but rarely permits to shed a tear as a sign of bonding with the characters. The scene, where Patrick finds out his dad passed away is inaudible, which allows the viewer to find his/her own words to explain the situation, making you an active part of the story, letting you feel involved. But then you see how concentrated the boy is on just keeping swimming - talking to both of his girlfriends, playing hockey, developing the band, - and you don't relate to his perception of grief because none of these ordinary activities is a subject of your focus. The tragic event and the pain behind it are.Kenneth Lonergan goes as far as using humor to kill off the tension you could have accumulated. I felt like crying seeing coroners taking the little bodies out of ashes. And then we see a group of sloppy paramedics struggling to load a stretcher with Randi's barely breathing body into the car. This lack of perfect cinematic shots, where everything goes as planned, catches you off guard, strikes you with the reality that exists outside the tragedy. Kids died, but early in the morning this paramedic skipped breakfast and felt too weak to lift the stretcher on the first try. These two things are in no way, shape or form comparable in their drama, yet, they exist next to each other and piece the story together. The same goes for the awkward wake talk, where one of Lee's friends offers him food, but fails to communicate with his wife across the room. All these little bits and pieces create the noise of life that never stops in reality as opposed to Hollywood drama.The scene that cracked me most was Lee's subtle and unexpected breakdown in the woman's hands. It signified the tragedy inside one's head and captured the feeling of being lost and falling apart slowly, which resulted in Lee crying out the last of him before entering complete emptiness. But Kenneth Lonergan would never let you two - the pure emotion and the viewer - spend too much time alone. He cuts it off quickly, giving you just enough to have a grasp of what's going on, taking away the luxury of compassion.But my favorite moment of the entire film is when Lee watches the microwave heat up the food, rather than leaving it to do the job. He can't go back in time, but he knows better now. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is frustrating, as grieving should be. And cruel, as the world is. Sometimes you have to force yourself to write a thing. But at the end of the day, you figure you were the one, who needed it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 April 2020,2/10,"Has this film won 2 oscars?! I cannot believe it, slow, very immature, for teenagers..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 June 2020,5/10,"This movie is one of those movies where you just watch the events unfolding many are sad some are good but, There is no end.. like the main character didn't fix the issues he was facing in life nor he was stuck with these issues..
you really never know what happened to his future. I feel the writer tried to make sure the movie is depicting real life where it's not always where you want it to go and he is basically telling you this is LIFE."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 September 2021,1/10,Sad sack alcoholic just wanders around? WTF is going on and why do people think this is a good film? It's one of the worst things I have ever seen. Ever.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 January 2021,1/10,I tried 4 times to watch it but I couldn't finish that. It is the boring film I've ever seen.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 April 2021,3/10,"It is really boring, it's not the worst movie in the world but it's also not at that level to get 2 Oscars 😐😐"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 April 2021,4/10,So much promise. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be. I left it feeling like I wasted my time. For three quarters of the film I thought I would leave feeling like I learned something...and I guess I did...some writers can't finish their work!
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 July 2021,10/10,"Manchester by the Sea the is a great movie. And it's the best movie ,ever I watched. It's honour to watch a movie like this."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 July 2021,2/10,"So that's about the only positive thing I have to say about thisI didn't know much about it before watching, and if I'd known a little more I probably wouldn't have bothered. Why is it that these dire works are always called masterpieces? We have a thoroughly unlikeable character, surrounded by many other unlikeable characters and after two hours we are in no different a place to where we started.I never understand why these type of films have characters behave in a way that nobody would actually behave in real life. The way they talk to one another, or interact with one another is so obnoxiously contrived. Nothing naturalistic about the dialogue or the way it is delivered.You could have easily cut out half an hour and it would have made no difference, other than bring about a swifter conclusionAnd the fact that Michelle Williams received an Oscar nomination for this? I can't even fathom why."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 May 2017,8/10,"I didn't read the other reviews before watching but half way through I did. I was shocked by some of the other comments. It is a very upsetting story and you want to strangle Affleck for not opening up. If you don't want to watch a thought provoking, depressing, touching, sad movie. Simple. Don't watch this. You have to be in the mood for it. It will not change your life. But it's extremely watchable and tear jerking. I just wish that Affleck opened up more."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 November 2021,1/10,"One of the most boring and time wasting experiences I've ever had. What did Casey Affleck deserve an Oscar for? For the ability to put someone to sleep? For me and my boyfriend, this movie has become an inside gag. Seeing a movie with an Oscar doesn't mean that it's a good movie ""... don't forget, after all, Machester by the sea has one too""."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 December 2016,3/10,"Went to see this movie with high expectations. Being from the area, and enjoying the local atmosphere for many previous movies, this seemed like a sure thing.I have not seen many Casey Affleck films, but if they are all like this, then I will not bother. His thoughtful ""pauses"" during most scenes go well beyond an actor attempting to portray thoughtfulness, depression, anxiety, or any emotion, and make me feel like wanting to yell out at the screen, ""get on with it!"".I give it a 3 for some of the beautiful scenery of the area, and for the scenes where Kyle Chandler is in with his acting abilities.Other than that, don't bother."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 May 2017,4/10,"This movie was decent throughout, slow but decent. Then it simply ended without resolving much of anything. Acting was fine and a few plot twists on the middle. Maybe with a decent or good ending I would have given it a 7, but instead it left me feeling extremely disappointed.Significantly overrated."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 February 2018,10/10,"The most heartbreaking film i've ever watched. The only movie that made me cry for real (the scene in police station). One of the most detailed scripts, thank God it was awarded by an Oscar."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 June 2017,5/10,"The story was very good, the acting better than okay, and the settings wonderful - HOWEVER - the soundtrack was a distraction and a huge detraction from the film. I ABHORED the music - repetitive and annoying it might have been okay about a boys' school in Britain in the early 1900's it was repetitive and (I thought) annoying and not particularly appropriate. Unchanging boys soprano chants, it was also so unbalanced that often I could NOT hear the dialogue no matter how much I fooled with the sound. then - some fifties ditties when the 'kids' got together - ick no effort at some sensitivity and/or attempt at modulation. ick. ick. ick! otherwise, I probably would have loved this. find someone else, next time, to do your soundtrack and audial engineering!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 July 2017,1/10,"My 92-year-old mother had mentioned this movie and that she had enjoyed it. Also, IMDb rated it at 7.9 so I had high hopes for this. Sadly, after an hour of waiting for it to get started, my wife and I looked at each other in disappointment. We took a break, did the dishes and then we decided to give it a bit more time to ""get going"". I don't know what was going on with the sound but a lot of the time when there was any dialogue, it was so quiet that I had to turn all of my audio equipment up to the max. Then for non-dialog parts, it would be super loud. The music was dreary and horrible - like funeral music. The main character was dreary, mopey and mumbled a lot. Other than one *thing* that happened, the rest of the movie just fizzled out - but took another hour and a half to do so. Now I know to never trust my mother's movie comments or IMDb's ratings. I cannot understand how this moving got such a high rating. I finally nodded off at the very end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 December 2016,1/10,"Don't believe the hype. This movie is bad. They just want Oscars. Ooh let's all do accents and play beautiful working class people and we'll get Oscars. Especially Affleck. He's the worst. Not believable at all. Terrible dialogue throughout. You can hear the writer cackling at the ""humorous"" parts, ""aw this is gonna be great."" And jeez all the dramatic gray shots of the sea and the town. So formulaic, the whole thing. Learn from my mistake, spare yourself this awful film. Fill your cheeks with sunflower seeds, find a tall cliff, and slowly spit them off the top for a couple hours. You will have a much better time than if you go see this film."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2020,7/10,"A movie is full of drama but very sad.
Actor Casey Affleck performed super cool."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 May 2017,3/10,"We tried, I swear we did, to get emotionally invested in this film, but there is no soul in the main character. His earlier life scarred him. His detachment from humanity isolates him. His rejection of human companionship dehumanizes him. The film bears the name of a town where his family put down roots, but it is not about a town. The film should have been named Life Sucks, Then People Die, and One Day You Will Too."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 December 2016,7/10,"Manchester by the Sea is a low-budget production. I've heard rumors that Matt Damon financed it with change he dug out from his couch cushions. Besides driving ordinary cars from this old house to that old house, the only exciting action was a short cruise around the harbor in an old fishing boat with an engine ready to give out at any moment. I don't even recall seeing any fish. Well, if you've been to a fish market lately, you know that seafood prices have really gone up. That wasn't the problem, though. You can tell a great story without Aston-Martins tumbling through the air and exploding and without the leading actress wearing a different designer outfit for every scene.They apparently couldn't afford a makeup artist either, so it was difficult to keep track of whether we had just flashed-back to the the time period of the disaster or flashed-forward to the time when, in a less creative movie, the main character's suffering would be redeemed. I credit this problem to the over-editing that director and writer Kenneth Lonergan is known to have a propensity for. After you've written and made a movie and then spent months editing it, I imagine it can be easy to forget that the audience doesn't know who all these characters from the past are that you've just introduced. Anyway, we do get to see a clever plot device as Lee Chandler, played by Casey Affleck, punches out a glass pane so that we, the audience, can make the connection – Lee with bandage – present – Lee without bandage – past. This is only a minor issue that, it seems to me, actually underscores how well put together the movie really is.The premise of the story is brilliant. Inspirational stories and movies where people fight for years or decades to rise above what they've done in the past are ever popular and commonplace. But we all know people who never do. They never learn. They never grow. Their suffering is never redeemed. This minority reporter is here to claim that, despite the clamor that Casey Affleck's acting deserves the Oscar this year, the weakness in this movie is his acting. He plays the role too nice, too polite and too restrained.I know when I see a violent, deeply disturbed person. I can see it in their eyes. I can see it in the unexplained jerky motions that lead to nothing and the sudden invasions of my personal space. When their rage finally bursts out, the time and place might be a surprise, but its inevitability is not. With Affleck it's the other way around. Sure, he gets drunk in a seedy bar, someone bumps him and he strikes out. That's where I would expect it to happen. But that his explosions of insults and brawling would happen at all does come as a complete surprise. And it shouldn't. It's not bird poop that fell from the sky and landed on him. After all the years that have passed, his guilt and anger has become part of his nature and he should wear it like a hand-tailored suit.I would love to see a young Marlon Brando play this role and watch the demons seething behind his eyes. Johnny Depp could play it, too. Remember his role just last year in Black Mass as Whitey Bulger? He could be so calm and polite, but you knew he was going to kill someone.The movie ran too long and spent too much time in exposition of the ordinary. This needn't have been an issue, but it needed more oomph, more bite in the dialogue and the acting to avoid becoming, well, boring. For a movie that was mostly about feelings, it was entirely too cerebral. Patrick, Lee's nephew, lost his mother to alcoholism, his father just dropped dead and now Lee is trying to weasel out of becoming his guardian. The boy must have been crushed. Lucas Hedges, playing Patrick, did all right with what he was given. But what was he given? He board checked his buddy and then had an inconsequential kerfuffle on the ice rink. He accused Lee of not wanting to be his guardian. Being the smart ass that he was, I waited for some sharp accusatory dialogue, but there wasn't any.I rate Manchester as Flawed but Brilliant. See this movie that for a change doesn't set out to prove that everything works out well in the end. See a movie without an audience-tested ending. See it for the extraordinary scene between Lee and his ex-wife (Michelle Williams) where Affleck for once shows you the pain and guilt and vulnerability that a person who has experienced what Lee Chandler has must feel. None of the words in this sequence really made much sense. They didn't need to. This scene worked so well because it was about raw, naked emotion. And that's what this movie needed more of."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 March 2017,5/10,"The story line deserves about a 3/10. It just all seems a bit pointless. The saving grace is Casey Affleck's acting. He plays someone that can only be described as soul destroyed, which given the events in the film makes sense. He is incredibly believably in the role, as someone who just struggles to care about anything in life any more.He seems to lack focus or direction and sadly it feels like even a change in his life course doesn't really change this, which is what makes the film pointless. What is the film trying to achieve. It's a lot of film to buy into the characters, albeit there are times their emotions don't seem to tie up to the events in the film.This all being said, maybe I'm missing the subtlety of trauma and the need for escapism. Maybe it does make sense and maybe this makes the film less pointless, but again this only really applies to Casey, because Lucas Hedges whilst also acting well seems to in no way reflect the main event in the film.It's hard to recommend this film, but I can understand how some would give it higher ratings for elements of the acting. For me an 8/10 average on IMDb would suggest one of the most engaging, interesting and walk away stand out movies. It simply is not! The film doesn't deserve less than a 4/10 because of the quality of Caseys performance, but it also doesn't deserve more than a 6/10 for what it lacks in energy and direction.I think the key question for watching this film has to be why? Why put yourself through a relatively low mood film that does nothing to correct this? and in many ways for all of the length of the film it just seems to fail at patching the story together in a cohesive way. There are better choices out there, so choose wisely before committing to watching this."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,5/10,"Cinematography work was excellent...Music was totally out of place and weird. We are talking... it is so noticeable that is detracts your attention to the movie at times.Acting was fine... there is content that can pull at your heart strings (or should) BUT... nothing pulls it together into an an engaging story that keeps you interested. The movie is based on awkwardness and tragedy. It is that is supposed to grip you emotionally but I feel it fails... not sure why but it is a whole bunch of settings and scenes that are joined together leaving you feeling like something art or production-wise is missing.I have not even bothered to mention an ending that bites.THIS MOVIE IS BORING! We are talking waste of time, wish I hadn't of bothered with watching it. If it got 6 nominations... it must be a real bad year for movies."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 March 2017,8/10,"Another sad story about how life goes, one of many scenarios. It keeps you thinking about life true values, how much we really have despite we are rich or not. The movie is actually good enough to take you to these thoughts and if you want to experience such emotions I recommend you this movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 May 2017,3/10,"Turgid, sloooooow, glacier-like pace. Not helped by the limited emotional range of Afleck which ranges from la belle indifference to overwhelming rage in a heartbeat. Although in color, the location , season, and costumes make this a virtually black and white film. Not-so-pregnant pauses riddle the film in homage to European tradition and contributing to boredom squared. If I had to pay for this at a theater I would have demanded my money back. I should ask Amazon Prime to compensate me for the wasted two hours that I could have spent more productively."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 March 2017,10/10,"First off, being a father, this movie will strike cords of emotions in you that you didn't think could be struck. Great acting, very real feeling, and simple story. Casey Affleck is absolutely amazing in this film and deserves the best actor win. That being said this movie should have won best picture way over Moonlight.What I notice from the other reviewers that give it a bad name is that they focus on small things in the movie that may not appeal to them. This is a motion picture not a clip. When you take the movie as a whole, while yes it is depressing at times, it gives you many comic reliefs. You can jump from crying your eyes out to laughing hysterically and that is what movies should do. They should dig deep inside and play with your emotions and this movie does just that. Great job and would love to even watch it again."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 February 2017,10/10,"I am indeed quite surprised to read all these negative reviews! Really? 1 out of 10 for this movie? Come on guys...just think. I can understand a score of 5 out of 10 but nothing below this. The movie is excellent in every aspect, however, the most interesting bit of it is to see and enjoy the subtle expressions and the way Casey Affleck is performing. I am not an actor or anything near it, but I have the feeling that this performance should be studied by a lot of new actors out there. He cannot lose the Oscar for this one. The story is magnificent, original and yes it is depressing but it just comes natural without someone forcing you to get sad. Go and see it you will definitely won't regret it"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 December 2016,3/10,"The scenery is great but can't carry the entire movie. The plot is VERY slow and boring. I kept checking the time to see HOW much longer I was going to have to sit through this SLOW, BORING movie...ugh. If I had not been with a friend, I would have left after the first fifteen minutes. The characters are nothing more than a bunch of dysfunctional people being dysfunctional with no hope for any of them getting much needed help. The actors do a good job of playing the characters. However, they can't make up for the slow pace and boring plot. The movie FINALLY ends with little, if anything, being resolved...more scenery shots...credits...ugh."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,10/10,"I've enjoyed every film Kenneth Lonergan has made and ""Manchester by the Sea"" is certainly his masterpiece so far. The way that ""Margaret"" got lost in its own side plots and resulting subtext, ""Manchester by the Sea"" utilizes to a devastating effect. This is what a great writer / filmmaker can do when given access to all the tools they need to tell a story. At times, the simple tale of a man torn between tragedy and family is excruciating to watch, but in a way that is all too human. Forgiveness comes at a price that transcends human tragedy. If you want to see a movie that cuts no corners and dissects human grief in a way that is mature and made for adults, then this is the film. It is expertly written and hyper-specific in the way it casts emotion into the frame. I haven't seen an American film quite like it in many years, maybe since ""Affliction"". At times, it pushes into territories that only Tarkovsky or VonTrier ever achieved interweaving fantasy into their visual design, but Lonergan doesn't need to do and remains uncompromising in storytelling technique and plot. Maybe there are better movies this year, but films about families experiencing an unspeakable crisis stand out to me above everything else. These are the stories I see as most universal."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 March 2017,1/10,"I don't know what the Academy was thinking. Best Actor? Best Supporting Actress Nomination? Best Movie Nomination? Blah!! Other movies must have been much worse because the directing of this movie to intertwine past and present was horrendous. Casey Affleck was in mourning the whole film which brought the movie down to un-watchable. Michelle Williams didn't appear enough in the movie to be nominated and it was dark, grey and sullen throughout the movie. I can't get my 2 hours back ever again. :-( If you want a good nap this is the movie for you."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,2/10,"This is just a classic case of critics getting an extra shot of dopamine from seeing something that wasn't exactly what they expected. The problem is that people who pay to see movies expect something more than people who get paid to see movies.Listen, I watch a lot of movies and you probably do too, let's just be honest here. This is a meandering, emotional film. It's got a few people in there that really know what they're doing. They're pros, after all. Still, it's hard to see the value of this work. Why anyone would read this script with pros or amateurs and decide it's the real deal and MUST be made is beyond my understanding. They made a boatload of money on the hype, but really this is a case of the more people that see this movie, the worse the ratings will get.There are plenty of meandering films with rock-like leads. It's hard not to run into one every now and then. If you're alright watching a movie where a character consistently resorts to base instincts and reactions while never actually overcoming anything, then this is a 10 for you. Simple movies are fine and so are complex ones, this one is neither. It will remind you of a time when you've had to be with someone that you don't really know or have a rapport with and it was awkward most of the time.I love subtle bits put into scripts, but subtle scripts give me fits. There comes a time when you need to come out and say something. If you aren't going to do that, then you're basically shrugging your shoulders and thinking, ""ehh somebody will be cool with it like this."" There's movies with nice, modest climaxes and endings that you can grin at, this isn't one of them. Say what you will about seeing real folks talk about real things unadulterated, nobody needs to see a movie that reminds you of speaking to a mechanic, let's say, about the dull frustrations of everyday things.A lot of the dialogue is really just a writer making a character voice the writer's opinion, but rest assured none of it is political or thought-provoking. This film likely would've been more watchable had they tried to make it poorly. Instead, they convinced themselves they were making a masterpiece that would explain itself once they got it on camera and, I guess, edited it with some effort."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 May 2017,2/10,"You will need:i) a plain postcard;ii) a small tin of gloss paint - any colour; iii) a paint brushInstructions:1) Apply the paint to the postcard; 2) Start watching the film; 3) Whenever you find your attention in the film faltering, switch to watching the paint on the postcard drying; 4) When you start to tire of paint observation, switch back to watching the film; 5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the end credits roll.You will, in fact, not see the end credits as you will find looking at the postcard infinitely more absorbing than witnessing Casey Affleck display the emotional range from glum to angry and back to glum gain."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 April 2017,10/10,"It's been a while since I went to a cinema to watch a movie twice. Manchester by the sea was my latest addition to that list. While at first I had my doubts about the whole thing (because it was a ""drama"" and I have stopped watching dramas long ago, and because of Casey Affleck himself) I finally watched it and to my surprise it was refreshingly funny, considering the issues that the film deals with.The way in which Lonergan shows everyday life after tragic loss is, I think, the only one that works and that could have worked to keep the viewers committed to the movie. I had read a couple of short reviews and knew the basics of the story, but the tempo of the movie, the stunning photography and the haunting performance of Casey Affleck plus the perfect ensemble of all the actors involved just took me by surprise. I had never expected such a flawless result, with lines and scenes that remain with you long after you left the dark room. It remained so strongly in me that I had to go see it twice, to confirm if the feelings and emotions of the first time that I watched it were still there, and the effect that second time was the same, despite already knowing the whole story. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to the ""drama"" label and went to watch it with an open heart. To watch the emptiness that remains after all that we held dear is gone forever being filmed so beautifully is a privilege that doesn't come often and I tasted with delight."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 December 2017,1/10,"I didn't think anyone could be a worse actor than Ben Affleck, but alas, Casey's effort in this dismal film was. Oscar my foot.
I should have turned it off after the first half hour like I usually do with films of this calibre."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 January 2019,3/10,"Good lord. Is there anything more annoying than a Boston accent? Oh... Yes, multiple screaming at each other. Almost all the way thru this movie and I don't get it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2020,10/10,"This movie's excellence is definitely in its script and lead actor. As very appropriately rewarded. The movie as a whole is a must to watch and probably should have won the Oscar for best picture. Nevertheless the script is so well done. From first scene to last. Every piece of dialogue, and silence right on point. It could be an example for how a perfect script should look like in textbooks. The story behind the creation is very interesting and you could be sure that the writer is a hardworking genius. One of the best movies I have ever seen!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2016,8/10,"I think your enjoyment of this movie will be determined by what you expect from your movie- going experience. Do you expect to be on the edge of your seat, or do expect to relax and think about life? Do you want to be challenged, or be touched emotionally? These are things you should figure out before heading into the theater to see this movie because it's not to be taken lightly. The Good: This movie is all about Casey Affleck and he does a good job. He conveys the range and depth of emotion that is critical to a drama of this nature. Without Casey Affleck, there is no movie. Lucas Hedges' performance effectively compliments that of Casey Affleck, allowing a unique sense of bonding between their characters to develop. The Bad: Some scenes are slow and stagnant and I found myself becoming impatient on a few occasions. Comedy is incorporated into many scenes to relieve dramatic stress, but these instances don't always fulfill their purpose and can become awkward. Things To Consider: Gentlemen, if you decide to see this movie with your significant other, prepare for tears. In fact, you might want to prepare for some tears on your end as well. It's hard to watch at times but is worth your time and money."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,15 February 2017,7/10,"PositivesI loved the long character buildups. Especially the leading and supporting roles. I feel like most of the movies skip the character analysis and focus on the action and drama. You get to know new people throughout the movie and it suits my personal taste.Even though it was a long and monotonous movie the flashbacks and character ""what the hell"" moments kept me energized. Honestly, I would not hang out with any of the characters in real life, their attitudes were so bland and boring, maybe that's why many are bored during the movie. Anyways, monotonous lives with ordinary conflicts are the point of the whole movie. The scenario is really rich. We have all seen child deaths, bad divorces, alcoholic characters before but the flashbacks, overall melancholic setting and the weird dialogues (the only thing that smells like Hollywood) kept the audience (above the intellectual average) motivated. Acting was amazing and I felt everything through out the movie. It was not a movie of crying. I do not think that it will be anyone's favorite. Being far from extreme in terms of characters, audience reflection and scenario probably make this movie a masterpiece. Oscar for the best scenario, I guess.NegativesSound production was really lame. Classical music does not fit any part of this movie. Just a small town in New Hampshire ( I guess). The well written scenario with the message of ordinary lives+ strong strings and opera was really contradictory and pretentious. Irritating!I do not know why but I feel like the overall production is a bit rushed for the Oscars. I felt like watching a draft. To give some examples on this, I should give a re-watch though."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 December 2016,3/10,"Based on seeing Manchester by the Sea, in 2017 I resolve to avoid movies that feature:1. Casey Affleck. 2. Working class Bostonians dropping the F-bomb every 2 minutes. 3. Working class Bostonians 4. Movies based in Quincy, Watertown, Charlestown, Southie, North End, etc. 5. Bar fights (more than one, and it has to come early in the movie. 6. Fistfights that last longer that five seconds. 7. Major depression as a plot driver. 8. Death of a child or children. 9. Comedy riff on sixteen year olds trying to lose their virginity under their parents' noses. 10. Casey Affleck (mentioned twice, in case I get him confused with his brother)."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 October 2019,9/10,"This an incredibly well told study in personal loss and whether it's possible to ultimately overcome that. You won't find that out until the end and it's hard to write a review for this magnificent film without giving something away which I won't do. But suffice to say this is a film that should resonate with you for years to come. Affleck and Williams are amazing, especially Affleck as he's in almost every scene indicating the massive amount of hard work he put into the portrayal of his flawed character. Tragic and realistic but beautifully shot and brilliantly written."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 April 2017,6/10,"I managed to get through this one, but it was very hard. It's a raw, very depressing story. Lee is an obviously depressed, unhappy man working as a janitor and apparently drinking and fighting in his free time. He gets a call about his brother, who just passed away after an illness. The flashbacks show what happened in his past throughout the film, frequently going back and forth from present to past without warning. He wasn't always like he is now..but that's from flashbacks that the audience sees that. Most of the acting is really good in this. Still, you tend to wish Lee were just a bit more...redeemable, more willing to take chances and get over what he's determined not to get over. When he goes back home and finds out he's expected to take charge, not only of funeral arrangements, but to be guardian of his teenage nephew, he doesn't want to do it. And you wonder why his brother expected so much of him, even knowing that Lee was determined to not get over his past. How could he possibly get his nephew through such a difficult part of his life when Lee was still stuck, emotionally, in the past? Every scene in the present pretty much seems awkward and strained. The horrific elephant of the past in the rooms are pretty much not not mentioned in the present, except for one scene with his ex-wife, who somehow seems to have moved on with her own life. And Lee really didn't want that conversation! Don't expect too much of the main character in this movie and you won't be disappointed. The end couldn't come too soon for me. BTW, the music, while it may be good music, is just too much, too loud...I assume to make up for what just can't be changed in this story. But it's distracting and intrusive."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 November 2017,2/10,"This film wasn't completely without it's moments but I kept waiting for it to get better and it never happened. The characters were never ones that I could relate to, or empathize with, and there was very little chemistry. The main character, Lee, has experienced some traumatic events and now goes through life like a robot, unable to interact with anyone. It's sad but neither interesting nor entertaining. If watching a movie about a robot trying to act like a human sounds interesting, then this film is for you. Lee is a 'nice' guy who makes no attempt at anything that could help his life improve. Lee's nephew, Patrick, is even less likable as a self-indulged 15 year old. There is zero depth in his character. I typically enjoy films that don't have storybook endings because life's stories don't always end up happily ever after. This film steered clear of a predictably happy ending but left nothing resolved, other than the fate of a boat. At 2 hrs and 17 min in length, it's a longer movie. If you choose to watch, stop the film at 17 minutes and ask yourself, ""Do I like the characters in this movie?"" If the answer is no, don't waste another 2 hrs watching it because that's as good as it gets."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 February 2017,10/10,This is a really good movie. In the events of an apocalypse I would definitely save this movie for the future generation.This movie is beautifully crafted. It shows how a man deals with grief without making the movie overly sad. Most of the times flashbacks become annoying and takes away more from the movie than add to it. But this one got it right. I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time.Also I really loved how it portrayed the relationship between the uncle and the nephew at two different times (when he was a kid and when he was a teenager).Also loved the shark jokes.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 March 2017,4/10,"This is one of those indie movies that wins a bunch of awards and mainstream viewer hate. Casey Affleck was perfect for the role, depressing and disappointing. Reminds me of a country song where the guy's wife leaves him, pickup dies, and the dog likes the neighbor better."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2017,6/10,"The movie is a sad dramatic story about a self-destructed depressed father and uncle (Lee) who tries to cope with being a guardian for his nephew. It's a plain drama, no surprises, no action but might be a little funny at certain moments. Nevertheless, I don't see anything special about the movie except that it does attract the humanity feeling towards parenthood and loss of the loved ones. On the other hand, the movie wasn't a disappointment as much as the ""Oscar performance"" done by Casey Affleck. Seriously, do you see this guy as worthy of an Oscar!!! All what he did is just keeping quiet and looking in the ground! I was expecting the guy to cry or at least make me cry. He couldn't drop a single tear and he wins an Oscar while Denzel is nominated too. It's just a disgrace that such dull performance is awarded."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2019,9/10,"Refreshing and raw, but with moments of humour to make it a really enjoyable film"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,1/10,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie and spent the entire time wondering how long the movie had to go. This movie is pure garbage. The acting from some of the peripheral actors is appalling (mainly the actors playing the tenants), the movie itself is slow and the music is depressing. The dialogue sometimes just doesn't make sense, people just don't talk to each other that way. Some of the flashback scenes don't make sense, one in particular lasted about 5 seconds and just confused me. Overall I spent the last half-an-hour of the movie wishing that I had have walked out an hour earlier. Would recommend this movie on DVD for someone suffering insomnia."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 August 2017,8/10,"The best part about this movie is the emotional connection it establishes with the protagonist. You could actually feel for Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck in a truly Oscar worthy performance) when he tries to cope up with the tragedy that has destroyed him as a person. He is an emotionally distraught person yet he realizes the fact that he must continue to live, continue to take responsibility that he despises the most because of the tragedy that he has faced in his life, fighting his inner daemons to be a nice guardian to his nephew.Lee is a janitor working in Boston when he gets to know about the sudden death of his brother due to heart attack in Manchester which is also the place where Lee belongs. As per his brother's will Lee has to be the guardian of his 16 year old son. Lee is much reluctant to accept this responsibility despite the fact that he loves his nephew very much. How he accept the responsibility and finally gives in to every wish of his nephew, which includes moving to Manchester, a place he so despises due to the personal tragedy he has suffered forms the crux of the story. Initially it is hard to understand the erratic and reserved behavior of Lee considering his jovial nature from the pre-tragedy flashbacks but as soon as you get to know of the tragedy you completely change your thinking about Lee and your heart reaches out to him. The reason for this change is the way Lee is played by Casey Affleck. He makes the character his own and not once you feel like he is acting..no melodrama. Such a restrained performance yet conveying the frustration of the character beautifully to viewers is something not many actors can achieve. Full credits to him for such a brilliant portrayal. We get to hear a lot of stories about someone's struggle to achieve his or her dream by facing all difficulties, hardships and those stories then becomes a source of inspiration to those having similar dreams but are yet to achieve the same. But what about those who have no dreams or rather have lost the ability to dream, those whose past haunts them so much that a dream has no meaning in their life. All they have are nightmares. Clearly such stories does not inspire them. Then what is it that keeps them going? What are their struggles? Even if they hope to be caring to their loved ones, even if they live and survive for their well being, they must fight the past and it is this struggle which makes for a compelling viewing. These stories should also be a source of inspiration to those depressed souls with similar traumatic pasts and that is what this movie does brilliantly. In a way this movie reminded me of 'The pursuit of happiness' in terms of a man's struggle to survive and care for one's loved ones. But in this case it is not the outside world they are fighting but the world inside them."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 October 2020,2/10,I'll never get that 2+ hours back. I would have given it 1 star except for one transaction near the end. If I wanted to be that depressed I would have sat in a dark room listening to Gloomy Sunday. No redemption for anyone.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,10/10,"The work in points: 1- Human 2- Anti depressing presented in a depressing way 3- Shows brotherhood, adulthood, anger, forgiveness, self- torturing, affection, and hope. 4-Dialogue is straight to the point without going around the meaning; sometimes it was amazingly blunt and rude."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 May 2017,1/10,"Completely depressing and a complete waste of time. Affleck gets an Academy Award for being pathetic. End of story. Every time there could have been an emotional 'good thing', the story fell flat. No drama. No nothing. Michelle William's role should have been much bigger. Too much time wasted on the kid and his girlfriends."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 August 2017,3/10,"What a waste of time. Pointless plot. Sure I understand that main character goes through so much pain and turmoil but is that it? Waste of my time. I cannot believe this movie was so highly rated. Maybe the reviewers were high. Is this what is considered good in Hollywood now? Sure, they all cannot be Forrest Gump, Shawshank Redemption etc."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 December 2016,1/10,"If you want to see Casey Affleck stare silently for two hours, this movie is for you--if not, then go see Rogue One. This is a slow moving, terrible movie. I don't see how it ever got produced. The dialog is thin and would never fly in a novel. The editors would reject it immediately. I can't believe it's been nominated for anything. It's a snooze. Lots of long scenes with no dialog...at first I thought the camera had frozen. It starts slow, has no real middle part, and a bad ending. This movie should never have been made. If you take out all the silence and staring, you'd have a 30 minute movie at most. I don't usually pan a movie this severely, but it's just bad. The fact that it's ""critically acclaimed"" has no effect on my opinion. To me, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's obvious they shot it on digital media, because no one would waste this much actual film. 1 star is a gift on this one. Pass it by."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,2/10,"This movie is a slice-of-sugar-free cake made with sawdust. I was inclined to watch this movie because of the positive reviews it was getting. However, it is apparent that these reviews are either coming from Amazon Bots or people who like digging through trash for treasure.I tried to convince myself to like this movie. I told myself that the horrible acting, crawling pace, and amateur direction was actually my feeble mind not being able to understand its complexity. This movie actually makes you hate yourself, and by the time you realize it, you're 1 hour and 45 minutes in. You decide to finish it, only to realize that nothing happens, and that time could have been better spent organizing your sock drawer."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 February 2017,1/10,"I expected all these (paid?) hyped ratings. I like the freshness of the story and some of its images. What I hated was the language, script, music and camera set-ups. Since some of the camera angles came from a point of views an ordinary viewer would never see it does not fit or enhance the story. Manchsetsr by the Sea is not a Science Fiction Movie. I did not like any of the characters, who were constantly screaming and yelling at each other and cursing obscenities. One guy kicks in a door and wants to take someone to see a shrink - I thought to myself: Great - the entire cast deserves to be taken into an asylum.I especially hated the extended scene when Adaigo Per Archi E Organo is blared with such intensity that the conversation (in the background) gets lost. It was distracting and annoying. Some reviewer mentioned ..""the sheer emotion in this scene was just heartbreaking""..... - there was no emotion in those extended scenes. Classical Music works if there is emotion or no conversation and the in the background. I think someone wanted to re-create the movements of ""2001 - A Space Odysee"" where there was no conversation, just visuals.Overall, I can see a lot of Hipsters liking that movie, which will no doubt win tons of Awards which is the reason why I will no longer see any Award Shows. These days companies like Amazon throw so much money into the pot that real good movies don't have a chance for an audience."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,30 December 2016,1/10,"Run don't walk away from this movie! Slow, morbid, uninteresting, and terrible music score. So much potential missed on many fronts. Poor character development, trite character interaction, disappointing climax. A waste of acting ability; i think. Never saw Casey Afleck before but from this roll don't really know if he can act or not. Maybe willing to give him another chance down the road. No dramatic resolution to a blistering heart breaking event that no one could put themselves in the place of. So what was the purpose of this move? To try to make everyone as paralyzed with boredom as the lead character was paralyzed by his tragedy. The music was so inappropriate for almost every scene. Kept waiting and waiting for this movie to take off but it disappointingly taxied back to the jet way; like they didn't even know how to end it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2019,10/10,"Beautiful!!
A brilliant drama played by brilliant actors..
Teared me up"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 February 2017,9/10,"I loved it. In a way it just feels like...home, you know? Because it talks about all the things all humans feel the most deeply - sadness, anger, guilt, lost, love for our family. Stupid laughs in the most inappropriate of situations. But the real magic is in the way all of this is told - all the scenes and all the story just feel so organic and natural, so like... human. Real. And the actors - Jesus, I really think it is the only film I have ever watched in which no one is a bad/mediocre actor. EVERYONE is brilliant in here - but of course, Casey and Lucas stand out, and in what a way. What a freaking way. You get to feel like they could just live next door, you know? They totally deserve the nominations (and this said by someone who really doesn't give a f*** about the Oscars).This is one of those movies I really feel that I will remember later, even if I don't see it in a while. You always remember the things that give the warm feeling a movie like this gives you. The characters grow in you - you feel like you got to know them, and so you don't really forget it. I'm still laughing and crying about it inside. And I think I always will."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 December 2016,1/10,"This dismal, boring, confusing waste of a movie has to be the worst movie ever. Casey Afleck seemed like he was wandering around in the wrong movie. One depressing event after another. Story kept jumping in and out of time lines that made no sense. I brought my son to it for his 34th Birthday. He wanted to leave after 5 minutes. I cannot believe this was given a good review by anyone except maybe some Manchester locals who could put up with the bad accents. If anyone asks you to see this movie tell them you have the flu. Better yet, tell them you need help moving. This was more like a made for TV movie. Even the music seemed ancient and out of place. Like a score from the 70's that was for a different movie."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 May 2017,3/10,"Like most seaside communities in Massachusetts, Manchester was a picturesque seaside town with a beach mostly just frequented by locals. Then the parvenus ""discovered"" it. I pretty much avoid the place now if possible; especially in the summer. Kudos to anyone ""smaht"" enough to buy real-estate there in the late 80's. My reason for mentioning this is that I applaud this movie for presenting Manchester as a mostly blue-collar working man's community which is consistent with its history. I gave it 3 stars for the thought of the new-money wannabe's losing sleep over the potential stain this might bring to their burgeoning pedigree. Don't worry Bitsy, your duck-tape ""repair"" of your Patagonia still screams ""authentic"".That said, I thought the acting, scenery and music were wasted on a plot that was never fully developed. The apology seemed to be where things were resolved, but we were ultimately left hanging with regard to his nephew who was a highly developed and central figure."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 May 2017,10/10,"Wow. Just... wow. I truly can't remember the last time I was this affected by one movie. The only movie I can think of is Michael Haneke's Amour. The basic plot is Casey Affleck plays Lee Chandler, a broken and lonely handyman in Quincy, Massachusetts. One day he receives a call from family friend George that his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has suffered from a cardiac arrest. He quickly drives back to his home town of Manchester-by- the-Sea, MA. By the time he gets to the hospital his brother has passed. Lee insists to tell Joes teenage son Patrick (Newcomer Lucas Hedges) that his father has died. After spending the night at Joes house, Lee is shocked that Joe has named him Patrick's Guardian, but based on Lee's past, including a horrible tragedy from his past, he isn't sure if he can do it. We see through flashbacks his tragic past and what caused him to abandon the town in the first place, his ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams), and when he was once happy. First, the acting. It's flawless. Casey Affleck gives his best performance to date, as does Michelle Williams. Kyle Chandler, although he has very limited screen time is fantastic, and Lucas Hedges gives one of the best young newcomer performances in recent memory. The screenplay, written by director Kenneth Lonergan, is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. His direction is amazing to, he does a great job making a blue-collar neighbourhood feel to it all. The film, as depressing as it is, is also life affirming in a special kind of way. It paints several soul-draining themes, but they make you appreciate your own life more. I've seen the film five times now, and I cry by the end. A few highlights for me were Lee and Randi connecting for the first time in years, the scene where we realise why Lee is the way he is, Patrick having dinner with his estranged mother (Potrayed by Gretchen Mol), and the final dinner scene between Lee and Patrick. The film is not for general audiences, and it may seem to sad for some, but give it a chance, and find yourself a different person by the end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,5/10,"I really liked this movie...for the first 75 minutes or so. It made me want to know what happened to make the main character so pulled back and short fused, and also how the relationships between the characters would work out to be. Affleck really gives a great performance of a man struck by tragic events. However, sitting through the movie a lot of things started to annoy. I know Patrick is an adolescent, but from a 17 year old I would expect at least a bit of grief, apart from the silly frozen chicken scene. It is too far a reach to think he fled into his old life. And the discussions were sometimes awful: people blabbing at the same time without listening....very unconvincing, very annoying to watch. The last 45 minutes were...well, nothing. All that you need to know to explain the situations and characters has been told, Lee figures out he isn't up to it, and life continues like it was for most characters, all told at turtle speed. It made all that came before feel completely useless. It felt like a movie made to make a movie, to enable actors to act (very well), to give a director, cameraman, sound guy a job. The audience's interest seem to have gotten lower priority. So, walking out after 2 hours and 15 minutes, I felt regret because I could have done something useful, like doing the dishes or combing my pet rabbit (she's a longhair)."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,1/10,"I do not understand how the h*** this piece of c*** got score of 8.1 on IMDb.For anybody who intend to watch this s***, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.It doesn't have any story, any flow of the events, no character representation nothing. You will simply wait for something to happen and there will be zero events throughout the film.It is totally amateur and third class movie of our time. It is unfathomable that such low-grade movie got such a high score on IMDb. Simply disgusting."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 March 2017,1/10,"Let me guess what the nominations were for: 1. Most boring. 2. Most devoid of meaningful dialog. 3. Most pointless. 4. Best argument for the old saying ""Life's a bitch, then you die."" 5. Most likely to make you want to cut yourself. 6. Best argument that Hollywood has lost its frigging mind."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 December 2016,1/10,"How is it that Rotten Tomatoes gives this a 94%? No depth, no emotion, nothing to grab you, story lacked cohesion. It was so bad. How can anyone be thinking of any awards going to anyone connected to this horrible movie. What a political joke Hollywood has become. I stopped watching the academy awards decades ago. But now I probably. End to stop looking at critics and find actual viewers. I haven't seen a worse movie in years. The movie was not directed well. The editing was non existent. What was 2 hours and almost 20 minutes could have been a small decent story, if other actors had been used if the movie was cut to 90 minutes or less. How does something like this get funded, and backing and even get made when then are so many great movies and stories out there that never make it to the screen. Was this a favor owed to someone? I have seen so many movies over the years and consider myself to be very selective of what I see and I went to see this movie with a friend who wanted to see it. I kept looking at my watch and absolutely nothing happened in the entire first hour. Caseys monotone voice almost put me to sleep. If I hadn't been with a friend I would have left early. Hope I don't have to sit through anything like that again for a very long time!!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 October 2018,8/10,Increíble de principio a final con un Casey Affleck increíble. Muy muy recomendable.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,1/10,"I was really looking forward to seeing this and this has got to be the most boring movie and acting I have seen in years! What is it with people who think this movie, or La La Land (the worst musical of all time with people singing totally off key)are Oscar material?? I really thought this movie was 3 hours long until I checked it out after watching. Stupid resolution. ***May be a spoiler here, I don't think so but just in case*** Kind of a ""yeah, we do like each other and as depressing as our whole lives have been, we will just keep up with each other, but very low key. We won't want to say anything that isn't monotone!"" Seriously, this was a bad movie. Hidden Figures and Hacksaw Ridge are tremendously better movies. I will say this, if you liked ""Boy"", where you just follow someone's boring life until the director or producer says, OK just end it here, then you will like this one."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,5/10,"Movie has great cinematography, however the Director probably blew this not having enough pre-depression scenes. Casey plays it the same throughout and does not deserve acting praise. Kevin Costner or Arnold Schwarzenegger could have played as this was directed. Key is that he should have been different personality. Two better flashbacks and this would be a good movie. After seeing flashbacks I felt it was a waste of time. Maybe there is a directors cut that shows change..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 July 2019,1/10,"Worst movie I have ever seen. Horrendous
Depressing, sad not even one shred of hope...."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 September 2020,10/10,"That's all there is to say. Really, that's all there is to say."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 March 2017,8/10,"My 7-year-old daughter asked me curiously what the movie was about after I returned home from the cinema. I told her that it's about a man having lost his 3 kids in a home fire due to his inadvertence and more recently his elder brother due to his heart problem all of a sudden. ""That's it? There is no ending?"" she asked perplexedly.There is no ending indeed, both to the movie and the pain that the man is suffering. There is not necessarily a conclusion to every situation in real life, unlike most Hollywood movies.Whenever I anticipated something positive popping up to cheer the man up, I was disappointed. For this reason, you may either like the movie a lot or find it a monumental bore. To me it's a very touching film without being a tear-jerker. Hats off to the director for the restraint.On acting, Casey did an amazing job. His reactions with the police during interrogation and to his ex-wife when she spilled her guts to him in the street were inch-perfect. He was devastated by his mishaps. He does deserve Oscar!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 December 2016,8/10,"I read too many positive reviews before seeing the film. As a result, my expectations were too high for what is, without a doubt, a very good film with excellent performances by the actors. Casey Affleck is brilliant as Lee and should be a top contender for the major acting awards. Though a minor role, Michelle Williams shines. The best moments of the film are the scenes with Affleck and Williams. We believe that they have experienced the tragedy at the center of the film. Unfortunately, at times, the music is intrusive. It distracts from the raw emotion the actors are conveying. And, the choice to have Albinoni or Handel swelling when the emotional intensity is heightened felt wildly manipulative. The content is compelling without a score screaming at us that this is an important moment."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 December 2020,8/10,Amazing movie with perfect acting casey affleck in my opinion the film environment was chosen in the best possible way
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 May 2017,10/10,"No Plot summary - but a ""who this will work for"".There are dramatic and memorable scenes that will stay with you should you experience certain things, or if you're reflecting on your own losses.Were you every married and feeling like you had everything? Enjoying your life as if it were a playground, as a father of young children, an attractive wife with a sense of humor, friends that would come over and drink with you til 2AM, joking around, giving each other crap in a jocular way?And did your/their world get shattered?Did your brother die early? Do you wonder what you'll say? How you'll handle the hospital and arrangements? Will you joke about serious things or play it straight?Do you have a sister-in-law or someone close in recovery who is sober, and ostensibly has regained a nice life but only half way there? You get to see this distance in one part of the movie.Is the awkwardness of meeting a new spouse of someone you loved a poignant moment? Where there is a moat of water under the bridge but so much shared history in prime stage of life?If these things seem good to relate to, the movie might mean a lot to you.You see life in a raw way. You see awkward reconciliations and people handling the life's practical details at difficult times. You get a glimpse at single parenting of a man to a teen son.What is life like when after that high of losing everything, that you can't really live with yourself or the world, so you just go through the motions for 10 years? If you know you can't get back what you had back, and are so haunted you can't reinvent yourself?Is depression engrossing? Can you laugh and cry at the same time at someone who refuses or is unable to make small talk?If you find it interesting how different people want to deal with a dead body at a hospital morgue this movie can be memorable. Do you want to say your regrets and kiss the body of your brother, or do you walk out at the glance?If you have a sort of ""catholic"" perspective of family being about blood, and notions of loyalty to mates, the film might be easier to grok...but not required.If you like to see life and insides of homes of people far from LA, Hollywood, sitcom sets, this film will be genuine in a refreshing way.If watching all these sorts of things in a well acted and believable way; believable for someone with a less than modern, less than college educated metropolitan view of things, this film will be especially rewarding for you.If that all sounds tedious... skip it, you probably won't even ""get"" it, or be turned off by it, and at least be simply bored to tears."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 April 2017,6/10,"When Rotten Tomatoes gives a 96% and Roger Ebert 4 stars to a movie, your anticipation takes a sharp upswing. That's what came upon me as I sat down expecting a cinematic epic in this Casey Affleck flick. I was not impressed on any count, alas.The one thing you come prepared for since you first got to know about Manchester By The Sea is that this is Affleck's prizewinning performance. That he brings to screen his interpretation of a heartbroken loner in a way no one done before. That part was highlighted and underlined by the movie's publicity machinery.What Casey Affleck does through the movie is put on a strained expression for most of it. He just doesn't come alive once, not even in the flashbacks. There's a flashback of him and his friends playing table tennis, drinking beer, and hollering nonsense. And he sleepwalks through that. That was his best chance to come alive, but oddly he doesn't. If his Lee Chandler, the depressed, disturbed loner, has to hurt himself, why doesn't he do it with all his heart?For example, there are mountains of snow that he keeps shoveling around, and yet he doesn't sit down in that subzero muck once to ruminate his present or past. All he does is go the local pub and get into random fights with people who come in equal sizes, carefully avoiding the hulks. And if he's a heavy drinker, then why doesn't he get sozzled and sleep through an icy night fallen on the floor, to wake up with a swollen face and burning fever?With a ghastly backstory as that (no spoilers here; you must watch the movie for that), you often wonder if it was Lee who had a secret hand in that devastating accident. One wonders, how does a despondent soul as him goes on living after that without any attempt at a violent suicide before he finds a reason to live as a guardian to his nephew?And, for God's sake, why do the players in the ice hockey team whisper about Lee? Was he a hockey star in his earlier life? We're never told. I strongly believe Nicholas Cage has done that whole drinking, self- hurting loner thing way much better. Go watch Leaving Las Vegas. You'll come off with a fine lesson in acting, even if you're no actor.The best thing about the Manchester was the bonding between the uncle and the teen. By the looks of it, however, you know that Patrick kid is going to grow into a problematic person, with a blurred sense of self- worth. That's okay. Kids with uncles and parents like that don't get it smooth in grownup lives. But still, that part was the soul of the movie. This is a movie steeped in sadness up to its neck. And even that part above the neck doesn't look any bright. Blame it on Kenneth Lonergan, who set out to make a movie on forgiveness where every character was broken in some sort of way. But he lost his sights somewhere in that script.What Lonergan succeeds in is infusing every scene with Lee/Casey. No other character is given a fulsome treatment in this single-minded characterization of an actor who seems to have survived the industry long enough to deliver a breakthrough performance. This is what stops the movie from becoming the saga it yearned to be. And if you were watching close, this movie deals a shoddy hand to the wives of these men. The two women are portrayed so wrong that I wonder if there is a wife-hater inside Lonergan clawing to come out as art expression.Frankly, Casey was at his finest in The Killer Inside Me and The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford. Those two movies showed us what he's really capable of, and can manage to do what no one else can — play a disturbed killer with sparks of self-doubt and self- pathos.Well, the movie is nearly as dark as they come. How dark? I will leave you to decide as I recount the 'second most' macabre thing in the movie. When Lee's caring brother Joe dies of an incurable illness, he is kept stored in a funeral parlor freezer all through the months of the winter, and buried only when the hard snow thaws. I wonder if that was a hat-tip to Stephen King.I wrote this review in a Medium post: 'Manchester By The Sea' - A Movie Killed By Overhype."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 January 2017,1/10,"This movie is so bad that i had to do this review. worst movie of the year need i say more? normally i don't do review Often the drawn out boring scenes had long drawn out focus on things like pushing an elevator button. Not interesting things, not things which further the story, and not things which further show emotion of the characters. Actually it was really just one character. Casey Affleck, a janitor who is sad. He mopes around the entire movie. No acting, no emotion, just walking around looking sad. Yes his acting was horrible, but I still have to think the director could have given him some direction along the way. But no, the story had no meaningful direction, so why would I expect the director to care about the acting any more than he cares about the editing, storyline, or even sound track. The supporting actors played no meaningful part in the movie, but for the short time they were on screen there were some solid performances."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2017,1/10,"This ruined my day. I suppose I should have checked before going , and then I would have avoided seeing dead children , dying and dead young father, everyone choking back tears all through the film , flat, slow, tedious script.An unremitting wallow in misery and bereavement. I observed 2 moments when the woman next to me chuckled: one was when a 16yo boy whose father is in a freezer at the undertakers gets acutely upset when he finds a frozen chicken in the fridge. She must have one dark sense of humour.Very good acting and production , but who would have anything to do with a script like this? I spent the last 90mins praying for it to stop. I suppose this might make a good training film for bereavement counsellors"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 February 2017,3/10,"I give it 3 stars only because the actors portrayed their characters very well. However, 30 minutes into the movie, I was already wishing the end to come quickly. All through the movie, I was waiting for that magic moment when things would gradually turn around and would be uplifting by the time the movie ended. But, alas, that never happens. Extremely depressing from start to end. I'm sure there are people out there in real life that have lives that are bad from start to finish but, as a movie viewer, I would rather see something that shows, at least, some positive promise for their futures. This movie just didn't work for me."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2018,1/10,"One of the worst films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot really. I cannot believe this is an Oscar winning film. Seriously, Tommy Wiseau is a better actor than Affleck in this 137 minutes of misery where nothing happens. I mean yes, it is tragic story but really badly told. It p****s me off because it's not a drama, it's fake drama with ridiculous music. ""oh, we want the audience to know, this is a serious part, let's put very loud, sad violin music here because our actors suck""."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 February 2017,10/10,"The movie was captivating. It beautifully captured the daily life struggles. Although I am from a different part of the world where these decisions are not taken legally, but through consensus between family members, I could feel the problems were real and pertinent in our part of the world as well. I was skeptical of how good is it going to be. My mind was blown by the performances of the actors and I silently appreciated the writer for creating it. To my students, this movie could easily cover one of my sociology lectures. The way things worked for the Chandler family and family dynamics were remarkably portrayed. Watched it. Adored it. Re-watching it. Cassey did a very good job playing Lee Chandler, a grieving man who finds it challenging to take up the responsibility of a kid. The guilt and blame he layered his soul with was apparent not through his words but by how he looked and absorbed situations. Well done."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 March 2017,3/10,"I was excited to see after all the hype, but its so slow and boring. The end I felt like I had wasted my life watching it. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood. Casey Affleck wasn't anything special to me, best part/most exciting was seeing why he's an asshole. I watched all but the last 30 min. So maybe something special happens but I doubt it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 December 2016,6/10,"Good acting, but not much else. Dreary tale of dreary, ineffectual people in gray New England. It is fairly good, and I utterly cannot understand the rave reviews. None of the cast shows any range of emotion.None show development. They are just glum, miserable people who go around being glum and miserable. Sadness upon sadness, emotional constipation upon emotional constipation, except for occasional violent rage. Tawdry sex, no love. Sad and depressing, both plot and characterization. Hardly any human communication in the film. And too long - mpore than two houra.! It may be worth seeing if there's nothing good on TV."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 December 2016,8/10,"Yes, Affleck does a fine job of demonstrating ""man with grief."" But what really struck me about the film was its devastating indictment of male privilege and the havoc this brings to not only women and children but men too. The lead character is an emotionally stunted, alcoholic, irresponsible young father who kills his (and wife's) 3 children thru drunken negligence; the kids burn to death in a house fire he starts. The police immediately let him off saying ""everyone makes mistakes."" He and his wife split, and a few years later they run into one another, and she apologies to him for ""saying terrible things"" to him after he killed their kids (well, yeah!) She also tells him she still loves him. (Why do women do this?) A few years after he kills his children, he's still drinking, prone to assaulting people, has made no effort to deal with his stuff, and yet (incredibly!) his brother -- who dies young -- names him as guardian of his nephew. The nephew has an absent mother who wants to return to the boy's life, but Affleck's character doesn't want the boy with the mom because she's a ""crazy, alcoholic,"" though she is portrayed as having at least partially stabilized her life. I guess he and his brother both feel that the boy is better off with a homicidal crazy drunk than with the mother, who is merely a crazy (former?) drunk. Again, the authorities don't step in to suggest that the boy shouldn't be with the uncle. No surprise, Affleck's character emotionally abuses the boy (or at least offers no emotional support to the boy, whose father has just died) and ultimately Affleck's character abandons the boy to be cared for by others. Grand total: 2 mothers deprived of their children, 3 dead kids, 1 abandoned kid, and several people violently assaulted. Yet, the entire point of the movie is that we are supposed to see and empathize with this man's grief and his guilt over killing his kids. In the film, other characters walk on egg shells around him, ""understanding his pain,"" and no one ever mentions his drinking problem to him. One wonders: if he had ever been held accountable, would he actually have been better able to deal with his grief, his guilt, his drinking? But we won't know. As in real life, the man is allowed to do as he pleases, everyone walking on egg shells hoping to avoid his violence, everyone ""respecting"" his...what?...privacy?, with his drinking and emotional problems unaddressed. The toll on bystanders, children, partners, and himself is staggering. So sad, but so true."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 December 2016,2/10,"While, maybe it's just me, the movie is very depressing! I was prepared for the topic, but I assumed it might reveal some very deep meanings of life in the end. Yet, I was wrong! It is just telling us that life is simple yet tragic! There is nothing you can do about it! You can only go fishing in the cold wind or pick on fights in a bar to get over with it! Yeah, that's the solution to everything! And it's so slow!!! You have to sit in the theater and watch him driving!!! Passing all the red lights!!! Yea!!! One by one! Until he's angry in the car and you're angry in the theater! If anyone has two long free hours, you might rather watch animals migrate from one to the other side of the continent. Yes, it can be a documentary if the director puts all the scenes in a chronological order.Am I too bitter on the comments? Sorry if I make anyone uncomfortable. Just not a big fan of topic like this. I mean after a long working day, I'd rather watch something positive and encouraging. We all have things to deal with in our lives, we don't want tragedy, we want solutions or at least hope!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 December 2016,9/10,"It's been a while since I've hit a show at the theaters, but two things drew me to that experience - the trailer, which in and of itself is remarkable, and Casey Affleck, who earlier caught my attention in Good Will Hunting. I just had an inkling then of the makings of a good actor. And this film sure didn't disappoint me in any way.It's a great story (well written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan) that plots the journey of a man's painful experiences through life as brother, uncle, (ex) husband, and father. He's internalized his pain and struggle, and withdrawn into self-isolation, other than working as a handy-man, a rather handsome one who's hit on by his female clients. He silently ignores. Or cusses them off. Apart from such outbursts (and bar brawls), he's a silent loner.He's forced out of his isolation by a call from his hometown hospital, and thereby forced to face up to his avoided past and the other actors in his life – now dead brother, nephew, (ex) wife, and the circumspect members of his hometown community. The movie traces his painful journey through a brilliant, yet never over-dramatic interweaving of past and present. And to be honest, some bone in you will occasionally scream for a dramatic moment, but the movie never strays from its subtle narrative, set against the backdrop of a blistering cold Manchester. Added to the mix is a never over-done Boston accent, though an otherwise brilliant Michelle Williams strains at it, sometimes. Your memory may occasionally jog down to Good Will Hunting (well at least, mine did).You may seek a redeeming resolution to the film's narrative, and you may be disappointed at first. But if you think through the resolution, it's a very honest, selfless confession of Affleck's character at the end: ""I can't beat it"", as he moves on to his future.If I haven't said enough about Casey Affleck, here it is. His is a masterpiece showcase of how to play the anguish of a man through his tragedies in life, never pitiable, yet demonstrating a quiet, silent strength that ironically has its bearing in his repressed pain (he breaks down just once in the movie).All the other actors etch their places in his life through their known caliber - Kyle Chandler (brother) and Michelle Williams, as (ex) wife. Never heard of Lucas Hedges (nephew), but he's just as good, through his banter with his uncle in, as expected, colorful English language. And there's some subtly delivered comical moments too.This one goes into my DVD collection, and did I hear an Oscar?"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,1/10,"have these reviews seen the same film? shocked if so,, leads me to think,are they 'paid' to review? the film is a mess, acting by afflek his usual mumbling thru terrible speech the films construction is poor to say the least if a better director/editor would have been very different. why do these people who wright,think they can direct?? YOU CANNOT. see this lots recently. basically left and still not sure what the story was really about? no real conclusions drawn. shame really as there was a smell of quality there, drowned out buy the constant rubbish mixed in there!save 2 hours of your life, and more so confusion."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,13 December 2016,10/10,"You can't miss this one! Manchester By the Sea it's a little gem. It has a great screenplay, great cast, great everything! Kenneth Lonergan is a fantastic director, Michelle Williams does not have so many scenes, but she's great. Casey Affleck gives the performance of his life in the leading role, in such a beautiful way. And i think he may win the Oscar, at least i'm sure he's gonna be nominated. Lucas Hedges it's also great.The story is very touching. The actors feel real in their roles. I loved this movie and everyone should watch it. It's a 10/10 for me. Everything it's so real about this movie, and it makes you want more and more of it, more of the characters and more of the story."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,19 December 2016,2/10,"The previews for this movie drew me in, but after spending 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back I wish I had not bought into it. It was painfully boring, stupid, pointless, and had no plot. At times I found myself laughing at the awkwardness of the movie. I felt so bad for telling the only other 2 people in the theater to shut up because they wouldn't stop talking, their immature conversation was more interesting than this movie.I was totally expecting the story line to pick up at some point but it never did; I just don't understand what the hype was all about. Some of the characters literally had two lines in the whole movie. GEEZ this movie sucked."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,18 August 2021,7/10,Was anyone under the impression that Lee was Patrick's real father?
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,24 December 2016,2/10,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!....I have no idea why this movie got good ratings, we were so disappointed for all the rave reviews on the film poster and from film critics...we walked out of it about an hour into it....we kept waiting for it to get better *yawn* and it never did...it was so slow and boring, no real story line, just the same old same old....a lot of useless F words that didn't need to be in there, the actors including Casey Affleck were overrated ..the best thing about the movie is where it was filmed... was The New England town of Manchester has very pretty scenery even though it is the dead of winter.....truthfully, just save your money and wait until Netflix has it out if you must see it..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,31 December 2016,10/10,"This is a ""breakout"" role for Casey Affleck as a brooding man struggling with past tragedy. The pauses in Affeck's line deliveries and his pensive countenance demonstrated a ""Brando-ish"" inner turmoil and was deeply effective. The film was brilliantly directed by Lonergan as he used seemingly simple scenes and words to demonstrate complex feelings and information for the viewer. One highlight was Michelle Williams' so deeply emotional interaction with Casey Affleck after seeing each other after many years-a scene sure to affect everyone watching this brilliant performance! This film refreshingly brings viewers back to earlier days of movie production where character development and careful crafting of scenes was paramount. It makes me want to go see more movies and Amazon's participation in the production is an optimistic turn of events. After this movie--I am most hopeful!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2017,1/10,"Come on; step back from the ""Affleck"" moniker and you will realize this film is a waste of time while waiting for something to happen--it doesn't. ""Affleck"", the younger and more talented, cannot salvage this mishap. I guess I am just not ""cool"" enough to climb aboard this very slow boat to no where. You can continue to burp each other while suggesting this is art. We actually did not pay anything to see the film and I still think I was overcharged. I like to think my time is worth something, but MANCHESTER BY THE SEA brought me back to reality; my time is actually worth very little. Cull out the limp story line, and Affleck & Hedges did a credible job. Such a waste of talent!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,2 January 2017,3/10,"Wow, did this ever suck. I just blew two hours in a movie theater watching a subdued, mostly well acted yet nonsensical story. My wife said she almost poked me in the ribs to walk out. I wish she had. This story line might make sense to New Englanders but most other folks would like some direction and substance in the plot.So, where to begin? Start with the basic premise that the main characters are taken through incredible levels of loss with no relief for them or the audience. Insights into the characters are gradually peeled back but for each layer that is revealed, little additional substance is added to flesh out the characters and even worse, to make them more likable. Sad to say, that is where the director and writers leave us. No appreciable difference between where we began or at the point of departure. Save your money. It will be available online really soon."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 April 2017,6/10,"I found this film rather disappointing. I frankly expected something more from Casey Afflect, taking into account the fact, that he was awarded an Oscar for this performance. I don't understand why. His acting was quite common and ordinary - nothing special. Besides, the film is predictable, not very original and the director has probably some hidden incomprehensible pathetic reason to copy classical music ... It's an internal confession of broken man, I'm not saying it's complete rubbish, but I an imagine spending those 2 hours of my life in more productive way..."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,16 January 2017,1/10,"Caution: Contains SpoilerCharacterization: -5/5 Script: -5/5 Direction: 0/5 Acting: -5/5 Overall Rating= (-)0 Notes to Director: Please don't make a movie again.I have watched at least 1 movie a day for past 17 years, and some 2000 movies before that but I must admit that this is the only movie I won't be able to forget or recommend to anyone, not even to an enemy. Sadly I have found the first movie that I hate!Unnecessarily depressing script, writer had no idea about human emotions & psychology. After watching this movie I had to watch 2 more movies to get over this crap.This film is special in a way that some scenes were just filmed but nobody actually directed those scene (scenes in hospital towards the beginning) Worst acting ever in any of the Hollywood movie! Whole scene was badly performed & poorly written. Asian doctor looked more embarrassed but not worried at all, like it was all her fault that patient has got a heart disease?When Casey saw the doctor in hospital he was supposed to ask him if his brother was okay, not if he is dead. ""Which brother can ask a doctor ""hey doc is my brother dead?"" & then tell his nephew I don't know why did I see your dad's dead-body in the morgue & I don't know if you should see it yourself or not?Patrick being the only kid, specially in absence of his mum, was supposed to be more attached to his dad & not F@@@ing neighbour's's daughter the very night his dad passes away.Just to make it more depressing writer burnt Casey's home & 2 toddlers in this movie & Casey watched it all holding milk in his hands the whole night. No Father would do that.Comparing Frozen chicken to a human Deadbody was disgusting!Could someone please ask the writers to read the script and find a single realistic conversation? Even there were repeated dialogues in the movie!To be honest It costs me 50p to watch a movie in cinema, but today I felt like I have wasted 50p on this crap.AVOID AT ANY COST"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 January 2017,3/10,"This film has noble intentions and sets out to deal with some very difficult emotional journeys for its main protagonist and, to a lesser extent, his nephew. However it fails miserably. Some of the blame for that has to fall on the poor script, but it is mostly down to the absolutely abysmal performances from the actors involved.The only actor who comes away from this movie with any credibility is Michelle Williams who delivers an impeccable performance with what little she is asked to do. However Casey Affleck is dreadful. The complete lack of nuance takes his attempt at an understated performance and turns it into a vacuous waste.I give credit to all involved for trying to do something great, however they have come up very short indeed."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 January 2017,10/10,"This could be the greatest I have ever seen. It is certainly top 5 in my opinion. I have never previously seen great acting performances from either Affleck, but in the hands of Kenneth Lonergan Cassey was totally convincing, while Michelle Williams has become the go too girl for handling complex and distressing relationships, she is wonderful. Too much detail about the film would risk spoilers, and even the trailers should be avoided if possible What I would say is that if you do not yet have children, of your own, that you love (and I understand their may be some people that don't) and have not yet experienced a loving and deep long term relationship, this may not be the film for you. I am a 58 year old man, with enough life experience to appreciate the staggering depth, and exceptional story telling behind this harrowing tale."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 January 2017,9/10,"Best miserable movie i have ever seen in 2017this movie has a lot of painful despite of what lee's live he tried to take care of Patrick it touched my heart i advice all to see this movie although there is a lot of pain in this movie but it encourage a lot of people to go on! , there is away to stand in this life as much as you can by taking care of people you love even if you don't know them.god only know how much you can live , stand. fear of remembering how much you suffered but finally life's go on! a lot of words motivate us to continue our life, how we could live,but god test us to believe on him and get much better"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,29 January 2017,2/10,"I cannot believe I spent 2 hours and 5 minutes of my short life that I will never get back again no matter what. The story line was mundane, the acting was rote, and the music- OH THE HORROR! It was too loud and overbearing and went on too long in almost every scene.The story line was muddled and really fit the characters into our preconceived notions of all of the things you see hear and read about Bostononians and New England- including the swearing, the beautiful scenery, the drinking, the fighting and the arguing.I should have shut it off but it was kind of like watching a train wreck- I couldn't believe what I was watching had actually been given critical praise.All I can say I let the viewer beware!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 February 2017,1/10,"Snooze-fest: The film was so boring I fell asleep 4 times. How this made it to being nominated is a reminder to all that the judges, like magic mushrooms. I see the reason but really BFD. We live in tragedy every day of our lives and we get no awards, and neither should this poorly written, poorly acted, dare I call it a film. I would like to get those hours back that I spent wishing to see this. I had such high hopes as it was supposed to be good by the number of nominations that the film had acquired. I felt that I was dragged through the life of a moron as portrayed by national geographic. I am not so sure this shouldn't be classified as a documentary rather than a drama. It was bad to non-existent acting with nice scenery."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,5 February 2017,1/10,"Horribly boring, pointless, with absolutely no plot. I can't believe this movie is nominated for ANYTHING...except maybe a Razzie for worst movie. Affleck and the rest of the actors did a good job preforming but there is literally no story line. Many of the lines are, ""Can I get you a Coke?"" or ""I can't remember where I parked."" It's unbelievable that this movie was every produced. Hollywood does have a tendency to drool all over themselves with self indulgent movies like this (I know I live in LA). Don't waste your time or money. It's a long movie with no payoff at the end. I truly wished we had walked out and asked for our money back. Sadly, we sat though the entire thing waiting for the story to ""start"" and it never did."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 January 2018,9/10,"Ostensibly this file is about a man ""inheriting"" his nephew when his brother dies unexpectedly and how he copes with the responsibility and the prospect of returning to his home town in order to fulfil it.
What it is really concerned with is how a man shell-shocked by grief and past trauma is trying and generally failing to come to terms with living from day to day.The reasons for his condition become clear as his back story is revealed
We are lead to believe that the new challenge of taking care of his nephew will re-awaken his emotional self and there are signs that this might indeed happen.
If you are a person of sensitivity with an empathy for the human condition you will, no doubt, find this film harrowing. I would like to watch it again soon because the acting, writing direction etc. are all excellent but I will have to wait sometime before I am ready emotionally.
This is a film that stays with you and leaves a feeling of slight but somehow not unpleasant depression . You also feel grateful for having witnessed what is an adult, complex and deeply emotional work of cinema at its best. It is uplifting to see that films of this quality are still being made.
As you may have guessed this is one of my favourite films of 2016."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,23 February 2017,1/10,"***Warning spoilers ahead*** The protagonist suffers a monumental misfortune that he generates with his irresponsible behavior, because of this throughout the film he looks like a stone face, contained emotions say movie critics OK, the film is boring, and in the end he is the cause of what happened, so........., Michelle Williams is by far better than Affleck,he will receive the Oscar and she is not,lobby."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 February 2017,9/10,"There's real depth in Manchester by the Sea, but to connect with it, one needs empathy and maturity--this is not two hours of following shiny objects. Like Ordinary People or Brokeback Mountain this is a work of cinema, that seeks to shine a bit of light into the dark places where a human heart can get stuck; into simple mistakes, boozy hazes, American masculinity, random disease, responsibility, love, youth, lust, money, and crushing regret.It's also an accurate portrait of the blue-collar life in North East, in 2015, and I expect it will grow more poignant as time passes. This film is a quiet, moving masterpiece. It's well-worth one's time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 February 2017,8/10,"Great low-key family drama with well-written characters, subdued performances and nice natural flow to it. The story about introverted janitor with tragic past, who has to take care about his orphaned nephew, has high dramatic potential but it successfully keeps its civility and simple life-goes-on feel. A rare example of an honest film-making that shows the big Hollywood studios that you can make a high-quality 2-hour-plus movie on a budget of one Marvell action scene. Seeing from the European perspective Manchester by the Sea is nothing extraordinary, there are lots of good character-driven British and Scandinavian dramas for example, but it's 6 Oscar nominations send quite a signal to Hollywood that a successful adult movie doesn't have to be just biopics (or porn)."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,9 February 2017,3/10,"I read the hype and I ignored it as I usually do with hype. I don't raise my expectations nor do I switch to hater mode looking for flaws. I heard of the hype (it's hard to miss), but I also checked out some of the bad reviews thinking it was going to give me a healthy balance. It's as healthy as eating nothing but ice- cream and broccoli without nothing in the middle. The truth is in the middle. Not 5, but closer to three.No really. I thought of checking the spoiler box, but how can I spoil this film? What is the story exactly?My friend left the room and came back. He asked ""what did I miss?"" I said nothing. Granted, it was during band practice so he didn't really miss anything. But at the end he said ""no, that doesn't make sense. I'm sure I missed something"" so he rewinded to the part that he missed. There was nothing there. He didn't miss anything and if you don't watch this film you will miss nothing.The cinematography is good. The acting, I'm not sure. I can't say if it's good or bad - are they acing lines from a terrible script or are they destroying lines from a great script? I'd say the script is terrible.I don't feel anything for the actors whatsoever. The movie did not feel sad one bit. It's not depressing, it's just depressed. You know? I feel like I'm watching someone brooding. It doesn't make me feel sad, I just feel sorry for them. It's pity, not empathy. I would feel sad and even cry if the film did a good job. Usually you start with normal characters that you relate to and then bad things happen to them and you put yourself in their shoes or see them as your friends. Here, there are none of those highs and lows. Really, no lows either. It's just consistently low the whole time. No ups, no downs. The music is really bad. It's so forced. It's like saying ""please cry here, this is where you cry, come on, cry. This is the part. Don't you hear the music? Come on.""It's all so forced.It's a melodrama for people that don't have the time or patience for melodrama. Good dramas are all about subtlety and finesse and you can build on it or escalate. A woman suspects her husband of cheating. Someone got a potentially scary medical result. A misunderstanding. A misspoken word. A missed call. Arguments escalating over small things, you know, like ""you forgot the gas on, you could've burned the house down"" or ""don't smoke indoors"" or any of these small things that can escalate. I don't need to tell you, normal life is like that and it's filled with drama. Civil wars have started over Thanksgiving dinners.But this film doesn't do subtlety. It's death. Boom. Congestive heart failure - you have five years to live. Boom. You have to adopt this teenage boy. Boom. He has two girlfriends, a band, a part time job, he's in the hockey team and in the basketball team and has a lot of friends. Boom. Your house burns down. Boom. Wife leaves you. Boom. The boy's mom? Dangerous alcoholic. Boom. Now hard-core Christian. Boom. All the problems are cranked up to 10 and they all happen at the same time. No escalation. You're not getting a teen who starts acting out and starts cheating on his girlfriend. You get a ready-made polyamorist. You don't get a teen who starts putting his mind in distractions, you get one that's on 2 sports teams (what?) and a band. You don't start to have marital problems because of the boy and then the problems escalate, nopes, you get an instant fire that burns down everything and your wife leaves. Attempt suicide at the police station because that's a great place to commit a crime. It's the equivalent of someone saying ""don't stop me, let me get him, don't stop me"" (from a fight) while keeping your own hands back and running backwards at the people who are trying to stop you.""There's nothing there."" You said it yourself."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,14 February 2017,1/10,"This is my first review of an IMDb movie and I signed up just because I was never that disappointed by a movie rated so high in IMDb. I simply had to vote on this.The last 2 hours of my live watching this movie felt wasted. It was just so drawn-out and simply boring the whole time. You wait the first half for something interesting to happen. During the second part you slowly realize nothing will be happening. It stays sad, depressing and boring till the end and even though the story is packed with emotional moments, the movie fully failed to touch me in basically all of them.Additionally the film is packed with flashbacks that are very hard to be recognized as flashbacks and you keep wondering or guessing for minutes, if that was a flashback and what that scene was supposed to mean.Finally the movie wasn't at all like I expected from the name, poster and first picture of the trailer (the man and the kid on the ship). Though this usually wouldn't bother me that much, in this case combined with the awful experience it is also a negative point. I usually do not watch trailers to avoid getting spoiled the best moments, but in this case it would've been kind of necessary as the other information suggested this movie is about sailors out in the sea, probably in UK Manchester. Actually though it is about a small village called ""Manchester-by-the-Sea"" in US Massachusets, while the sea and boat only play a minor role in the story."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 February 2021,10/10,"Every time I watch this movie I cry because affleck perfeclty shows us how miserable and helpless a guy who lost his kids. Excllent movie, it definetly take solid place in my life."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,20 February 2017,,"I am just an average guy and think i am not a harsh judge of movies but this was a total waste of my time. I heard so much about it we actually bought it on demand. watched it with my wife and two kids 26 and 34 years old not one of us enjoyed it. It was slow, boring , and i heard so much about the acting that i was shocked when i watched it. I have never written a review before but felt so strongly about this that i had to. Sorry!!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 February 2017,1/10,"like this movie. I am sad that a movie with dialogue that includes the f- word in every other sentence is up for awards. There is absolutely no reason for it. It totally ruins a movie for me. I may have been able to overlook this fact but there were no other redeeming qualities to this movie. Not the script, not the acting, not the music. Oh must I go on? I hated it. I can't believe that deadpan Casey Affleck is up for the best actor award. When I compare this movie to a movie like ""Fences"" with Denzel Washington it is mind boggling and just plain incomprehensible how anything about this movie could be Oscar worthy."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 February 2017,5/10,The film is long and slow but just about gets away with it. I did not realise that death was such a major part of this film. My partner died 3 months ago so I can relate to a bereavement situation now - previously it wouldn't have had anything like the same impact. I found the movie had a depressing effect. I guess there are a real lot of twilight zombie people out there only just holding it together.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,1/10,"Too bad you can't vote with negative numbers. This has to be the worst movie I've ever endured in my life. This is in no way a comment on the actors or acting , but the story line is horrible. I would have thought we produce film to entertain, enlighten, teach or touch hearts. All this movie does is invite you to feel horribly depressed and then it gives you an ending not unlike ""No country for old men"" . NO ENDING.Given the choice of watching this film or a poke in the eye with a sharp stick....I'd take the stick."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 February 2017,1/10,"I do not get the high scores. This movie was painful, slow moving and the characters were boring and showed no growth throughout the film. Rule #1 in telling a story - the protagonist needs to evolve. I was expecting so much more from a movie with an ""8"" rating. Thoroughly disappointing and I would rather have been working than watching that for 2 hours. I feel like I wasted my time."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 February 2017,9/10,"I think Casey Affleck does a great job portraying a father who lost his children. If you have never gone through the unbearable pain of losing a child, the guilt and doubt you live for the rest of your life, you probably won't understand this movie to it's full extent. You may find it ""boring"" and/or ""depressing"" as most reviewers have said. There is no ""happy ending"", nor should there be. If you have lost a child, as I have, my prayers go out to you, you will be able to identify with the struggles grieving parents go through. If you are looking for the realism of losing a child this movie makes it's point."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,8/10,"It's a slow movie, made me almost fell asleep for the first 30mins with quite a negative impression about the main character, Lee (Casey). But then it turned out it's the director's motive to let us digest the narration about an emotionally-f*****-up uncle Lee. He had such a tremendous pain and grief in the past that made he immune to the society and whatever happened in it. It was slow enough for us to seep such a question within ourselves: -How would you feel if one day, the whole world collapse in front of you? Would you be emotionless like Lee? It was a state of art of storytelling. Throughout the movie, Lee hopped from places to places without a direction. It was necessary to understand from the movie that certainly we would be there at some points in life: emotionless is the result of having too much emotions."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,9/10,"Incredible film from start to finish... Casey Afleck with a well deserved Oscar win. The trailer does not do the movie justice. The range of emotions and flashback story lines are what really make this movie great. A great cast combined with Afleck""s performance make this a must watch... reminded me a bit of good will hunting."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,3 March 2017,2/10,"The critic ratings are ridiculous just like most of the Oscar nominated movies that most normal people don't know or care about. ""Michelle Williams is amazing"" or whatever the Los Angeles Times quotes is nonsense. She was barely in this movie, and when she was you wanted her off your screen. Weak performance from an unliked character. About that, most of the characters were so unlikeable. The main character Lee played by Casey Affleck was such a douchebag, you wanted more bad things to happen to him. I was hoping the gun went off in that scene to save me from the rest of the boredom. The son spent his whole time after his father's death just trying to bang girls. The only person I felt bad for was the father who seemed like a great guy who had to deal with a terrible wife and a scumbag brother. The whole time you're just hoping that the movie builds up to this big climactic finish until the credits just roll with so many unanswered questions. How it was at the beginning of the movie is how it's going to be in the end. There were a few funny moments from Casey but not nearly enough to save this movie. I really wanted to like him but he never gave you a chance. If you don't like the characters, the movie is going to suck. It did."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,2/10,I watch this movie for 30 minutes and I had to stop. Boring and so slow. The dialogue was simple. Pass on this one. I kept waiting to get better and better but I never happen. I have no idea how this won any awards. The stars seem so one sided and lots of unnecessary cursing. Plus all the characters seem one dimensional and just fake. I was counting the minutes until it was over.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 March 2017,1/10,I joined IMDb after using it for so many years just to review this movie. I can't believe someone can get an Oscar for this kind of acting. A potato can act better than this. I feel like I have got a strong dose of anaesthesia after watching this movie.Can we have capital punishment for the makers of this movie?
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2017,7/10,"If you have not suffered from depression, then this Movie will certainly do it to you. There are great scenes advertising the natural urban beauty of winter in the States,but logic in keeping a body in the freezer for three months waiting for the earth to thaw beats me up, when you can simply cremate the body. Would have given a greater impact to the central theme of Janitor Lee's suffering and depression. Only picked up on one continuity misfire. When Lee suffered a spilled beer over his wardrobe at the bar, the glass was still full. If you ever wanted to learn the results of living a full life with its intricacies of growing up in America, then this movie will deliver a two hour advert for you to learn from. I can only say make sure your smoke alarm is working. There is no room for drinking, taking drugs, or playing table tennis in a small basement flat. Where were the pharmaceuticals to help sell this movie ? Oh thats right I forgot the popcorn. On a positive note ( putting aside the heavy emotional music overtures) Affleck's acting was superb,with the questioning of his existence, keeping the audience in their seats till the end."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 March 2017,1/10,"I went to see this movie with a friend without knowing much about it, except that he'd heard it was very sad. After I've checked the score (8/10) and read the storyline here, I was reassured that it should be good.What a horrendous experience! It's the worst and most boring I remember seeing since ""Gerry"", with Casey Affleck and Matt Damon - coincidence?I don't know where to start because everything is so wrong and other people have done a great job at describing how painful to watch this movie is. But I feel I need to contribute to the list to prevent other people from going through this torture.It seems that characters were written by a sociopath who doesn't have any kind of empathy and doesn't know what it's like to actually feel something. So he has observed other people displaying emotions in various situations and attempted to reproduce what he's observed, but... consistently at the wrong times and places. Characters' reactions and the way they talk to each other do not make any kind of sense. It's all so misplaced that you can't feel any kind of sympathy for them despite the horrible events that they've lived. I've seen some reviews praising the realism of this movie. No, it is not realistic at all. It doesn't show any kind of behaviour real people have. For instance, coming back home the day his father died, the teenager is all cheerful and casually asking his uncle to order pizza, while making plans to shag his girlfriend. Another example is when a mother goes to her daughter, who's busy having/trying to have intercourse with the teenager (which the mother knows about), asking her to help her because she's unable to have a conversation with the young man's uncle while they are waiting for them to ""finish their homework"". What? I ended up wishing that the main characters would be hit by a truck or something in a scene where the one driving kept looking at his phone and talking to his passenger instead of looking at the road. That would have made the pain shorter to endure.And then the sexism. All the women in this movie are depicted as complete idiots (for instance the two running/waving at the teenager in the car) or sexual objects/predators (the tenant in one of the first scene, getting her bathroom fixed in her nightgown, or the woman spilling her beer on Lee). In one of the flashbacks, the director tries to show us how happy Lee was with his wife before the tragedy. And how does he do that? By showing him trying to force her to have sex with him, and groping her insistently, while she's sick in bed. The only way she eventually gets rid of him is by throwing him on the floor. That's probably what love looks like, in a very misogynistic mind. And by the way the movie fails the Bechdel test.In passing, people praise the acting in the movie, but I find there was barely any acting from the main character, and that the other ones were pretty bad, especially all the teenagers.And then there's the 2 dollars folk psychology injected in the movie. The scene where the teenager freaks out because of frozen meat falling of the fridge that reminds him of his father's corpse waiting to be buried is just plain ridiculous. I saw it coming, and was thinking ""Really?!?"". But then the director feels that he needs to explain the subtle dramatic moment in case we didn't get it, by having the uncle clicking only a few minutes later ""Ooooh, okay, you freaked out because it's frozen like your dad, yeah, I don't like that he's in a fridge either"".... And after a 30 seconds bonding moment, they start insulting each other again - because that's what they do most of the movie.There are also failed attempt at bringing humorous moments. Probably the director learned at cinema school that it is good to mix sad and happy moments to make a memorable movie. So he has included some supposedly funny moments of the type you would see in American Pie. Like when the teenagers are trying to have sex in the young woman's room, but then the guy hurt his toe on the doll's house causing a racket that gets their parents downstairs wondering what's going on. They young people argue about it for a minute and then she invites him to f@@k her... all is well that ends well!But because these moments are also misplaced, and we don't care for the characters anyway, they just make for more awkwardness and face-palm.I normally don't notice the music in movies, but in this case I did. Because the characters and situations are so poor at producing any kind of emotion, an overly cheesy and sentimental music is thrown at you, super loudly, sometimes overriding the ""dialogues"" in an ultimate attempt to extract a tear from your eyes. But nope, sorry, that didn't work either.I may have started to focus on details because I was so bored at this point, but I was also annoyed to see that Casey Affleck was a walking advertisement for this skater clothing brand. The logo was constantly visible on at least one of his clothes during the whole movie... Is it them who contributed to finance this piece of crap?I'll finish with the sloppy camera work in places. If you're easily motion sickened, don't watch the wake scene. It's just camera shaking all over the place.But my overall recommendation would be to avoid the whole movie and find a better way to use your time. Unless you're studying cinema and want a textbook case on how not to make a movie. If I'd been by myself, I'd have walked out the theatre."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,4 April 2017,9/10,"Jesus Christ. What can I say about this movie? This, followed by The Lobster, are my favorite movies of 2016. This movie continued to break my heart the further it went on. I saw it twice. Once in theaters, with my parents, and just now on the internet. I had read about this movie online, and I had been looking for a good movie that seemed to lean towards the darker side. I read that it was a man who needs to care for his nephew after his father dies. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS FILM IS ABOUT. This is about a man struggling with depression. I mean, sure, the plot is about some guy needing to take car of some kid, but it's so much more than that. This movie is heartbreaking. You know after about 30 minutes into the movie, that it is not about a man and his nephew. The pacing of this movie is slow. It's intentional, though. The pacing fits the story. It makes sense. A lot of people will say this movie is boring, though, because of the pacing. I recommended this movie to a family friend and she said she didn't wanna see it because she didn't wanna cry. This movie doesn't LET you cry, though. You want to cry, but you can't. It's a feeling a movie has never given me before. Your heart just sinks. I keep talking about how upsetting it is, but there's a lot of good, sarcastic comedy in this movie too. I genuinely laughed several times. The cinematography is beautiful and the location where they filmed the movie makes it so much better. This movie will always be a favorite of mine. I urge you to go see it. It puts you in the shoes of a person with depression. It is an emotional roller coaster. It is a work of art. I can't beat it."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,12 April 2017,1/10,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so slow, and you kept thinking something was going to happen, but sadly, nothing ever did. It plodded along, telling the story, but you couldn't even feel sorry for the character, as he was so darn boring. I have no idea why Casey Affleck received an Oscar for this role, all he did was drink and get in fights. Ridiculous."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 May 2017,9/10,"This film just completely devastated me. I didn't know what it was about before viewing- just that it had received a lot of critical acclaim and a best actor award. I was in the mood for a contemporary drama in a beautiful setting but had no idea what I was signing up for. It was lovely, impactful and raw. It reminded me of my own family and was emotionally draining to watch but at the same time incredibly beautiful. The moment you realize the depth and complexity of Lee's burden (masterfully revealed from is perspective), it goes from drama to horror - a film moment, for me, comparable to how I felt watching Sofie's Choice. Very few films have been as cathartic."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 May 2017,1/10,"First, the pros: Casey was awesomeCons: Long times between dialog Sad beginning Super sad middle Depressing end Not one smile, laugh or uplifting moment in the whole movieSo darn....depressing. I didn't leave feeling good but, depressed myself. Ugh."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 May 2018,10/10,"I wasn't expecting much from this film, but little did I know that I was about to witness the most authentic story, acting, screenplay and writing I have ever seen in a film to date. Main character Lee is set out as a mysterious man with a disturbed past and this is portrayed amazingly through Casey Affleck's performance. THIS IS A MUST SEE!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 May 2017,3/10,"This movie was slow and depressing!!! I love the people that were involved however, this movie was not an academy award winning movie!! All the big stars get on the band wagon and they decide this is an award winning movie and it truly isn't!!!! There was not real emotion besides fighting and a few moments of sadness!!! Very disappointed and glad I didn't pay $10.00 to see it, thank God for Netflix!!!"
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,22 May 2017,9/10,"A truly wonderful movie, so powerfully affecting: I have never before cried so deeply in a theater - and for long after. It portrays unresolved and unresolvable grief and is heart-wrenching both in the superb quality of the production and acting, but also because it reaches deep within us, speaking to the primal fear we all carry of a fate-awaiting loss that can tear asunder our life and all possibility for happiness."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 May 2017,4/10,I struggled between 3 and 4 stars. This movie went nowhere. The soundtrack was the most awful thing constant choir 'aahs' and 'oohs' which totally detracted from the movie content as weak as it was. There was no resolution to the issue presented in this movie. What a waste of 2 hours.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,27 May 2017,2/10,"Slow tedium, attempting to portray facets of grief, a little too realistic, lacking drama or plot line. Casey Affleck is good but the role was terribly undemanding and with a better writer could have been rich pickings for the good actor. The dialogue was quite awful, wandering nowhere and finding no point. Many scenes with no value should have been cut but we're not. The musical score was poorly chosen excepting to enhance the sense of boredom of actors and viewers alike. After more than two hours of slog the end rushes upon the viewer with no redemption of any worth and many viewers will wake at the television falling silent, then trudge off to bed wondering if they couldn't have done something else with the evening. This movie will be loved by viewers who confuse tedium with subtlety. Please, you will never get the two hours of your life back, choose something else."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,26 June 2017,10/10,"Had no clue what I was getting into when I started watching the movie, didn't know about the Oscar. The movie is super low key and totally none Hollywood. As the movie progresses Casey's phenomenal performance draws you in until the story comes alive right in front of your eyes. I loved everything about this movie, every member of the cast gave a believable and an exceptional performance. This movie feels 100% real. A masterpiece."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,1 August 2017,10/10,"In Manchester by the Sea (2016) writer and director Kenneth Lonergan movingly depicts both the savagery of the superego and efforts on the part of conscience to counteract it. After his wife has called an end to a raucous, alcohol and cocaine enhanced party with his buddies, Lee puts a log on the fire, then walks out to buy more beer, apparently neglecting to replace the fire screen. He returns to find the house in flames. While his wife survives his three children are burned to death. Lee is blamed both by himself and his wife. Astonished that upon investigation the police are not charging him (one officer even kindly pointing out that, like millions of other people, he has made a tragic mistake), Lee seizes one of their weapons in a thwarted attempt to kill himself. His subsequent existence is one of barely contained, mostly self-directed rage, depression and self-punishment. His ex-wife has managed, to some extent at least, to move on. But haunted by guilt over the savagery of her past judgment and cruel reproach of Lee and by conscientious concern about the damage she sees him doing to himself, Randi finally confronts and tries to reach him with love and forgiveness. But he can't accept it, later explaining to the bereaved nephew he feels unable to parent: ""I just can't beat it!""--that is, the life sentence inflicted by the savage superego. Fortunately, with the help of conscience and those who, like Randi and the concerned police officer, are capable of compassion and forgiveness, some of us, sometimes, can. From ""Psychoanalytic Thinking: Essays in Critique"" forthcoming (2018) from Routledge."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,10 February 2020,10/10,"This movie is so incredibly well done and such a precise and detailed work that for me it's one of the best movies ever made.
It's a movie about the society that we live in and how we cope with mistakes of ourselves and of others. All this is put in a metaphorically cold winter scenery. The dialogues are so well written and so touching that in some scenes it's almost impossible not to cry.
I think that most of the staff was so much involved into the emotions of the movie that they seem even depressed talking about the movie in interviews. And when you watch the movie, you feel that everyone here really dedicated his heart and soul.
The soundtrack takes the atmosphere to the highest possible level.
I also loved ""You can count on me"" and liked ""Margaret"" but Manchester from the Sea is from another planet. I think Kenneth Lonergan has reached the pinnacle of his genius with this work of art."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,28 September 2017,1/10,I agree with reviewer Borisacat. It was a miserable slog of a film -- all shade and no light. Wooden acting and unlikeable characters. If it was a song you would call it a dirge. And why did the bereaved family members have all the important private conversations with the medical staff IN THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR!! This would surely never happen. Very over rated movie.
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,25 August 2019,9/10,"This film is completely one of a kind. Each time I watch it I find myself focusing on a different aspect: the first time was the story, the second the humor, the third the music and sound. Every single part was executed to the highest ability. Affleck's performance is what sells Lee Chandler; with anyone else I'm not sure this film would've worked as well. I also really enjoy the nonlinear structure; the flashbacks bring you closer to Lee and allow you to understand why he is the way he is while also allowing you to see how the rest of the world sees him in the beginning. You see people whispering about him once he gets back to Manchester and it's still unclear why he's so infamous until he goes in to see the will, which is when his entire history is shown. The small dash of humor every once in a while eases the tension that the rest of the film has, usually originating in Patrick and Lee interacting (think Lee punching the window and Patrick asking about the cut). I even enjoy the end--leaving it open allows the hope that Lee will get better and that both he and Patrick will end up happy. The single complaint I have about it is Patrick's relationships. I think that detailing how he's dating two girls is unnecessary, but it still helps round out his character and breathe more life into the film, so I understand why it is included. Overall, certainly one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, but the heart it has keeps bringing me back."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,7 January 2019,1/10,"Sorry, I took that title from a review on Rotten Tomatoes, but it really hits the nail on the head.I saw the big tragedy reveal coming from a mile away. And as stated above, the scene and everything leading up to it was 'dreary when it should be devastating"". Once I saw where the story was going, I was expecting to be crying my eyes out since I have a daughter and couldn't even imagine what I would do in his situation. Probably get counseling, not let my life slip into dreary oblivion.This is a movie about 2 irresponsible, selfish people who suffer a tragedy due to being selfish and irresponsible. I mean really, she doesn't want to turn the central heat on because it dries out her sinuses? Nope, just let the kids freeze. And he won't turn back because he has to go buy beer? Sorry, it's really sad and all, but totally avoidable. The rest of the movie depicts the main character's grief and guilt, but does he do anything to grow and change? No, he is just as self absorbed as he was before the tragedy. Just because he stops partying does not mean he grew from the experience. Instead he drinks and beats people up for no reason other than to briefly relieve some of his pain and guilt. Even the kid was a selfish, arrogant womanizer, and the uncle encouraged that. The kid only had one short scene showing that he had any emotion about the death of his father.The writer also failed to establish enough of a relationship with the main character and his kids to make you feel like he should be that devastated. In both the flashbacks and the ending, it almost seemed like he loved the nephew more than his own kids. It seems like his depression stems more from guilt, not the actual love he had for his kids."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,17 December 2017,2/10,"The story line is nothing new, Hollywood has recycled the same story again and again: A man who has had a tragedy of his own ends up becoming a guardian of his late brother's son. The movie is about personal challenges he has to go through life with this new unwanted situation.
Movie is slow, dark and what makes this movie mediocre is acting by Casey Affleck, just like his famous cousin Ben, Casey is terrible actor!! A better actor and sharper writing might have made the movie a bit more interesting to watch."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 May 2017,2/10,"I can't believe anyone found this moving interesting or entertaining. It is a depressing movie not so much because of its plot (which is depressing and seems to just roll down hill from there) but because none of the characters have any redeeming qualities. I was told this was a tearjerker, but I didn't cry in the movie because I didn't care for any of the characters. There was absolutely no emotional closure for any of its characters. There was no resolution of any subplot. No one was happy. Everyone's life was a disaster. Why would I care for these people? Why create this movie?Be warned that there is more swearing and F-bombs in this movie than your typical crime drama. The 16 year old boy was sleeping with more than one girl and didn't care that his dad died. Passersby on the sidewalk even cursed at the characters! What was the point? Nothing in this movie was beautiful or uplifting.The worst part was how the story was told. You are left guessing which scene was a flashback and which was present day. I cannot believe this was nominated for Best Picture. It wasn't worth the $1.63 I paid to Redbox."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,21 January 2019,5/10,"Real life is something we all have access to by waking up, opening our eyes, stepping out of bed and carrying on with our day, however many choices we make, avoid, nail, and screw up. I do not need a film to display a fictional story like it is real life. I look for a story or movie to teach, inspire or entertain. This did neither of those. This film was an illustration of a man suffering from an overwhelmingy tragedy, his character is sensitively exposed throughout the film, however there is very little character growth. It's ending is dry and hopeless."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 January 2018,,"This movie was not for me. I felt it instantly, but I forced myself to stay and watch it to the end. At least, it sadly confirmed that there is no way out of trauma without the love of God. Personally I am not afraid of pain and loss and tragedy. I had a lot of losses and guilt in my own life. It is a question how to deal with it. And there is a way of forgiveness, hope and love for all of us, if we only accept and take it in freedom.If not, you can see the result in this movie. He was not a sinner, because he unfortunately set up the fire. His true guilt and the true problem of the movie is the unloving, chaotic way of life of the families, which is presented, as if it were normal and good. It is not, that is the real problem. So, as far as the content is concerned I totally disagree with the ""Message"" of the movie. Apart from this, the actors are great, no question. But we need movies to show and share the truth and grace of life...not the disaster of trying to fix it all by own efforts. It is impossible. God bless.

MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,11 March 2018,8/10,"Let me tell you how odd the movie is. In one of its scenes, a black woman falls in love with a white man, who does ""gross"" job, yet very necessary, that repairs her toilet. When was the last time you tipped someone, who cleared your clogged toilet? She did. But she still failed to get him, as did many white women before and after her. The story of ""Manchester by the sea"" is not pretentious. it is as plain and obvious as the rising of the morning sun. Yet it is supremely shocking. 
 
What small towns and cities people are endowed with is luxurious time, much of which they invest on one another, which big city people do not and cannot because they are runners in a rat race that never ends. Cassey Affleck carries a lot of weight in the story and shoulders the burden of the movie's success. And he does it with flying colors. His acting is effortless, measured and on target. Here is a movie that cost $8M and sold worldwide for 8X its cost thus far. I am sure more is to come. Highly recommended."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,6 October 2020,,"Tragedies happen, they are a part of life, but when you feel responsible for them, especially when those who we love the most are involved, the guilt and pain you experience are of a different dimension. Two destructive sensations, acting slowly and stretching in time, strike rhythmically, until your whole world is intertwined in just a vortex of guilt and pain. Over time, grief, despair, anger, and anxiety join in, and together they begin to invade the whole being and become fossilized there forever. It seems like even if everyone were looking at you, no one would see you. Even if your whole being would shout and scream, no one would hear you, at least not if life didn't spit bitterness and poison on them, just as it did on you.A film that defines the expression, 'time heals every wound', only as an illusion, since in certain ocasions, the wound not only does not heal, but the more time passes, the more it expands. An aggravated condition from which solitary behavior begins. You go full silence, you start distancing yourself from others. The passions of the past begin to seem absurd and pointless, and so, consciously or unconsciously, more and more, you tear peices from yourself, until one day you become a shadow. However, it's not weakness, nay it's completely normal, if nothing intrigues you anymore, and that you decide to surrender in front of fate and to crouch under its shelter. It's understandable if life resembles to you like a labyrinth, to which there is no way out, and in which you only come in circles to always end at the same starting point.Some things are easier to overcome, others maybe we never will. We'll win some battles, but we'll lose many others. But unfornately it happens that one of them will leave a huge void in us, which we'll never be able to fulfill it again. In such circumstances, a person has no other choice but to learn to live with the unimaginable emptiness, and to accept pain and suffering as an inseparable part of it, yet to try to dare and hope again, that one day life can be generous again and maybe one day pain and suffering will be replaced by happiness and joy.Manchester by the Sea, explores a sensitive, and a extremely delicate topic, and navigates through all the sensations and qualities that define humans during the processing of a tragedy. Grief, sadness, anger, self-loathing, and forgiveness are explored and unfolded with special care in front of the audience. Forgiveness is one of the most pronounced, and complex traits in the film's narrative. Even more complicated self-forgiveness, because forgiving yourself requires much more courage and dedication than any other act.However, if we could forgive ourselves, and if we could understand and accept that mistakes and faults are parts of being human, and they are part of our nature, perhaps the burden of guilt and pain would not weigh as much as it does in some situations, and who knows, maybe we wouldn't be so harsh with ourselves regardless of the events that are imposed on us.The film, more than anything else, reflects the breaking of a human being. Some of the movie quotes seal the fact of our fragility and helplessness when we face the evil and cruel traps of life. By nature we are complex creatures, and we are far from perfect, we're not omnipotent, many things do not depend on us, and they are not under our control, and unfortunately we don't have enough power to change them. I guess, this must be the most difficult challenge of being human."
MANCHESTER BY THE SEA,8 February 2021,10/10,"This movie carries so much emotion and is so real. Performances are awesome. I read somewhere that it's depressing, I disagree. I find movies with no ""good"" emotions depressing and this one has it all. It's extremely touching. Just amazing..."
