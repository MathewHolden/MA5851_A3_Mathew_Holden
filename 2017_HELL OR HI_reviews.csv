HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 September 2017,10/10,"One of the most critically acclaimed films of 2016 and nominated for four Oscars, 'Hell or High Water' also had an intriguing idea, a talented cast with Jeff Bridges being a particular attraction and a script by ace writer Taylor Sheridan (writer for the brilliant 'Sicario', and went on to direct one of the most promising directorial debuts of 2017 with the recent 'Wind River').'High or High Water' was not a let down in any way. One of the finest films of 2016 and to me all its four Oscar nominations were among the year's most deserving (Bridges' nomination for Best Supporting Actor should have been a strong contender for winning). It is not the most original of stories sure, but that did not matter at all because it executed all its components impeccably and still had its share of surprises. It does have a slow start somewhat but not in any way a want-to-switch-it-off way.Along with 'La La Land' (it has become popular to hate that film, loved it personally), 'Hell or High Water' was one of the year's best-looking films. It has a rustic Western look in terms of setting that is very effectively evoked and it is stunningly shot. It should have been a contender for Best Cinematography, but at least got some recognition for the concise editing.The rip-roaring, at times hauntingly elegiac and at other times rousing, soundtrack enhances everything going on on screen. That one of the best scores that year was not even nominated and the pretty awful score for 'Jackie' (one of the worst things about a disappointing film) was even to a very subjective reviewer, who absolutely despises the ""I don't understand..."" and all its various other just as clich√©d, overused and abused variations, is not easy to fathom.Best Original Screenplay was very much deserving, with Sheridan once again striking gold with a snappy, smart and tightly structured script. While meditative in pacing, the story is nonetheless absorbing and surprisingly rich in its complexity. It's also intricately told and with a mix of the hard-edged and the elegiac.David Mackenzie does a remarkable job directing, getting the most out of the story and atmosphere and bringing out the best of his cast. Chris Pine's lead performance is one of his best, but it's the supporting cast that shine more.Ben Foster, in a role that is the polar opposite to Pine's and perhaps the slightly more interesting, is a revelation, even more is an astounding Jeff Bridges who completely disappears into his role to unforgettable effect. One must also single out Gil Birmingham, who really wrenched the heart in this year's 'Wind River' and gives a different but every bit as wonderful turn here.In conclusion, wonderful film and a 2016 highlight. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 August 2017,8/10,"If Hell On High Water does nothing else you will throw stones or whatever else is handy at the television the next time you see Tom Selleck or Henry Winkler or any of those other folksy actors from back in the day hawk the virtues of the reverse mortgage. It should be called the reverts mortgage because it reverts to your heirs upon your demise. I can certainly sympathize with the Howard brothers here. When my mother passed away and left my brother and I with the bought and paid for completely debt free family home we both salvaged a considerable estate. Not like Chris Pine and Ben Foster have. Their little patch of land with the house on it is owed to the Texas Midland Bank and they have to cough up the full amount or be kicked off. Pine with wife and family there the situation is a crisis. Fortunately Foster is an experienced criminal who has an expertise in robbing banks. Even with some mistakes these two get away with a lot.That includes fooling the Texas Rangers on their case who are Jeff Bridges who is days from retirement and Gil Birmingham a full blooded Comanche Indian. They have an interesting relationship and Bridges isn't exactly the most politically correct person out there.Hell On High Water got a nomination for Best Picture in 2016 and Bridges was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Let's just say goals are accomplished, not without loss on both sides. The brothers Pine and Foster have a nice tandem chemistry the same as Bridges and Birmingham.The film this seems to best compare to is Clint Eastwood's classic A Perfect World. Watch and see if you agree."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 February 2017,,"Hell or High Water (2016) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Ben Foster) rob three banks in one day with plans on hitting more the following day. Pretty soon Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his partner are on their trail.Director David Mackenzie's HELL OR HIGH WATER is a throwback to a previous era's Western where you've got good guys, bad guys and guys that are somewhere in between. A lot of praise was aimed at the film and it's easy to understand why because it's a very laid back picture that takes its time getting to why the brothers are doing the crime and it also takes its time in explaining why the Ranger is so interested in it.What impressed me most about the film was the fact that it was so laid back. The quiet nature of the Texas small towns are certainly on display and I liked the fact that the director didn't mind keeping things at a slow burn leading up to the climax. I'm certainly not going to spoil the ending but it perfectly sums up everything that we had seen leading up to it. I can see how some might be disappointed that this film wasn't louder and feature stronger stuff but the atmosphere and setting were perfectly handled.Another major plus are obviously the performances but would you expect anything less from the three leads? Pine is certainly coming into his own and delivering one fine performance after another. His character is the one that is most haunted by his actions and I really liked the depth that Pine brought to the role. Bridges, who picked up an Oscar-nomination, is also quite good playing the Ranger who (no shock) is about to retire. For my money it was Foster who stole the film playing the more psychotic brother. I really thought the actor did a fantastic job at playing this crazy person who also had a great love for his younger brother.The cinematography, the editing and all the other technical aspects are excellent. I did have a few problems with the picture including some of the scenes that had songs playing over them. The country music selections were fine songs but at times I thought they weren't needed in a few of the scenes. Still, HELL OR HIGH WATER is a current day Western and a darn good one at that."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 June 2017,6/10,"HELL OR HIGH WATER is an appropriately gritty bank heist thriller that manages to breathe some freshness into an overworked genre. The film has a sweaty desert setting and casts Ben Foster and Chris Pine as a pair of brothers cast into a world of crime due to economic difficulties. Pine has the lesser role of the two, basically all square-jawed niceness, while Foster, who has been an interesting presence in Hollywood ever since THE PUNISHER, adds another deranged role to his repertoire.Pitted against these siblings are the local police force, spearheaded by a typically laconic Jeff Bridges. The plot as it plays out is quite predictable, but the direction is far above average and the action sequences almost hum with electricity. The bank heist scenes are as tense as you'd expect, but a HEAT-style shoot-out and car chase are both very well achieved and some climactic moments are also nicely portrayed. It's not a film I'd consider a masterpiece, but it does the job well enough and the realism never drops for a second."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 March 2017,8/10,"Toby Howard (Chris Pine) is divorced and older brother Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) is a recently released bank robber. Their mother recently died after a long illness. Together, they go on a spree robbing branches of Texas Midlands Bank. Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is investigating. He thinks that they're on a mission to gather a set amount from the small quick robberies.This movie takes all the old western concepts and brings them out to the modern time. They even have cowboys driving cattle on the run from a fire. Each one of these people realizes that times have passed them by and the world is changing. The acting is more than solid. Pine and Foster have great sibling chemistry. Jeff Bridges is comfortably acting within his range. The best character is the old cranky waitress. Her scene is hilarious. There is a tension and a sadness with these characters. It's a really compelling world."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 February 2017,6/10,"""Hell or High Water"" is an American movie from 2016. It is probably the most known work by Scottish director David Mackenzie so far and the script comes from Taylor Sheridan, a successful actor as well. This is Sheridan's second screenplay only and after ""Sicario"" was also already pretty good, this one here is at least on par, especially because Sheridan shows that he is also really great in terms of comedy. Two thirds of this film are relatively light and the movie lives through the cool/badass dialogues by the two cops as a vital ingredient. The movie runs for 100 minutes and scored several Academy Award nominations, one of them for Sheridan's script, another for Jeff Bridges' supporting performance (is he really supporting?) and it also got in for Editing besides the crucial Best Picture nomination. The film is basically two duos of people from start to finish: the bad guys and the cops, even if you could say that at least one of the bad guys is not entirely bad as his motivation behind these bank robberies is somewhat honorable and we are also reminded at the very end that he never killed a person in his life.It is a genuinely entertaining film and a lot of this is thanks to Bridges. I am okay with his Oscar nomination, even if a lot of his great performance is thanks to the dialogues written for his character. More serious mentions like the one about his dead wife are not elaborated on enough for Bridges to really make a dramatic impact, but the second half of the film, basically everything after his colleague gets killed, is pure Oscar bait and I am not surprised he is nominated again, the second time after his win and no less than 45 years after his very first Oscar nomination. He has pretty great chemistry with Gil Birmingham and even if the latter is not getting any recognition awards-wise, I still hope it can boost his career. Now about the bad guys: Who would have thought that Chris Pine can make this character work as honestly I always saw him as a bit of a mediocre (in terms of range) Hollywood beau. But he did what he had to do here in order to make the film even better. He reminded me of the main character from ""Justified"" at times, only that he was one of the bad guys of course. And Ben Foster confirmed what realistic movie buffs have known for over a decade now, namely that he is incredibly underappreciated in Hollywood and maybe the one actor in Hollywood right now without an Oscar nomination who is most deserving to get one. For this film, it did not work out yet, but I hope it will soon in the future.Overall, this is a good example of a modern western. It plays right now, i.e. in the 21st century and offers pretty good performances from start to finish. It is also genuinely funny on so many occasions. One example would be the old waitress who almost stole the movie with her one-scene performance. Hilarious stuff there and she was on par with Bridges and Alberto Parker. Surprised that Parker is that old already, he looked great for his age. But that is just a side note. Now I said that this film is pretty funny, but it is also dramatically relevant and edge-of-seat stuff on some occasions, especially in the last 40 minutes. I myself would not say that this is one of the best films of the year, but western fans like myself (and fans of the previously mentioned television show) will still enjoy it and some of the scenes are certainly contenders for some of the best 10 or 20 (in terms of both comedy and drama) moments of the cinema year 2016. One final thumbs-up for the music in here. The songs used fit very well in terms of tone and atmosphere."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 December 2016,7/10,"Modern urban crime westerns tend to be ponderous slow burners and must have Tommy Lee Jones in the cast.British director David Mackenzie brings an outsider's perspective to Hell or High Water and keeps the pace moving even adding some humour. Mr Tommy Lee Jones is replaced with Mr Jeff Bridges.Two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) who is more thoughtful and sensible and Tanner (Ben Foster) who is more reckless as well as being an ex-con. Both rob remote branches of the Texas Midland bank. They take loose bills from the cash registers, not all the robberies go smoothly but the boys have an ultimate motive.They are robbing the bank that plans to foreclose on Toby's ranch which may contain oil. The boys are basically taking the bank's money, laundering it and repaying back the same bank.Bridges plays veteran US Marshall Marcus Hamilton on the verge of retirement who takes more of an interest in the robberies than the rest of the police as these are not big money crimes and no one has got seriously hurt so far.With his half Indian partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) they develop a theory of what they might be going next as well having some admiration for the robbers.In a of these types of movies, the robbers keep robbing until they fall out and the police get on to them. If there is an endgame to their scheme it is an inept one. The characters here at least have put some thought here although flawed and Tanner is always going to be a liability.We still know we are going to get an almighty shootout at the end andwe also get a more surprising and personal showdown between the Marshall and Toby. It does not work for me which lets the film down as a character's wounds would leave him open to a smart lawman.Yet in the main this is an intelligent, thoughtful and well acted film, it has his moments of slow burn but it is pacy enough. You have some humour such as the waitress who got a big tip refusing to part with the money as the tip was proceeds from a bank robbery or Alberto wistfully telling the Marshall that once the white man took the land from the natives and now they are losing the same land to the banks."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2016,7/10,"In Texas, after the death of his mother, the unemployed oil and gas worker Toby Howard (Chris Pine) is losing her ranch to the Texas Midlands Bank. Toby is divorced from his wife that lives with their two sons. When his brother Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) is released from the prison, they team-up to rob agencies of the Texas Midlands Bank to raise money to pay the loan so that Toby may leave the real estate to his sons. Meanwhile the racist Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) that is near retirement and his Indian descendant partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) try to anticipate the next movement of the thieves.""Hell or High Water"" is an original heist film where the ""bad guy"" is indeed the bank. The characters are well-developed and the screenplay has witty dialogues, mostly from Jeff Bridges' character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 July 2017,,"With all the 'film of the year' mentions and other such praise, I was not sure what to expect from this film; I am sort of accustomed to finding such films are ""worthy"" but not much good. In this case though I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a solid and straightforward thriller, that puts a lot of stead on character, atmosphere, and creating a convincing and engaging world.This it mostly does very well. The narrative sees two brothers robbing banks for small amounts, with a specific target to reach to be able to buy back their family's land from the bank; meanwhile a lawman on the cusp of retirement tries to stop them. It sounds a little clich√©d, but what the film does is set the tone just right. The Texan heat is tangible, but so is the sense of a populace under pressure day-to- day. Such things are not in the main scenes, or main characters, but are evenly distributed across the whole film in such a way that it produces a world that is convincing, and people who are engaging and convincing.Within this, the pace of the film allows for the characters to breath, which means we invest in all of them. As a result the robberies are tense affairs, even if they are simple too ‚Äì it is not a film that needs big set-pieces per se. That said, there are plot developments and details later in the film which do seem to be either holes or convenient writing ‚Äì but by that point I was on board and willing to go with it. The performances do a lot to help with this, and there is a lot of quality in here. Foster and Bridges are known quality and do well, but I had some surprises with Pine, Mixon, Birmingham, and some others.The film is not as perfect as some suggest, but it is an engaging and convincing affair which has good pace, atmosphere, characters, and performances."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 September 2017,5/10,"Tanner (Ben Foster) gets out of prison, serving time for robbing banks. He teams up with his straight brother Toby (Chris Pine) for a series of bank robberies to pay off various liens against the ranch owned by their recently deceased mother. They wash the money at an Oklahoma casino. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) plays a sheriff nearing retirement who is after them. Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) is his ""half-breed"" partner one of the many inappropriate slurs used in the film.Chris Pine was rather plain and subdued during the film, just being dutiful to a family that prefers to live without him. Jeff Bridges was a bore. Ben Foster was the only real animated character. He was reckless.The acting was okay. The dialogue a bit dry, except when then were bad mouthing Native Americans and Mexicans and even then it wasn't impressive. I imagine the film's popularity is due to the populist appeal of banks being inherently evil, and the common man can get back at them...this and the bank robbery scene where everyone in the bank has a gun.Guide: F-word. Sex. Blurred nudity. Disparaging language. Being a fan of Illuminati bankers, I didn't like it as much as my fellow reviewers."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 September 2018,8/10,"And also what to find? How to deal with the past? And not just the past that is building up in the movie. But the past way beyond the start of the movie. There is quite some character work and there is quite some good acting overall. There is action and it starts off quite unual (maybe), with a sort of quiet scene, that turns violent quickly.But it is there and the performances show it. We have literal brothers and brothers in arms sort of. There is a bond, even when it is not shown all the time. It's really well done, something that I was expecting, the pacing is good, although I expect some may feel it moving too slow. Just be aware of what it is you are watching. Then enjoy this really good movie, with an amazing ending, that frankly couldn't be better ..."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 August 2016,9/10,"The comparisons to 2007's ""No Country For Old Men"" are probably inevitable. Both films feature aging Texas lawmen near the end of their careers, who contemplate the passing of a more rational era in which they came up through the ranks. There's also the principal villains, but whereas Anton Chigurh was a Terminator-like, unrelenting and vicious assassin, his counterpart here, Tanner Howard is just plain old Texas locoweed crazy. You have to credit Ben Foster in the role of older brother Tanner to Chris Pine's Toby, his characterization is just off the wall insane.As for Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, Jeff Bridges is simply astounding in his portrayal. One thing you have to give him credit for, now that he knows his matin√©e idol days are long gone and over with, he has no qualms about letting it all hang out. I'm thinking about that scene in the hotel room when he took off his shirt and his big old gut is just hanging out there like a poster child for obesity research. Just when you think he can't get any better as an actor after ""Crazy Heart"" and ""True Grit"", he nails it once again and it's a wonder to behold. I wonder if he had marbles in his mouth when he spoke, his dialog was especially Texas drawl effective.The story itself puts the film in action/adventure territory with more than a hint of crime drama, so one's classification of the picture with the Western genre is probably more so by association with it's West Texas and Oklahoma locations than the cowboy roots of the principals. The same could be said of ""No Country For Old Men"", so there's another likely comparison.And finally there's the way the picture ended, leaving open the question of whether Toby Howard would ever be brought to justice. Leaving things off that way left a lot more question marks than the showdown that never was between Marcus and Tanner Howard. But at least it was a more satisfying conclusion than having Anton Chigurh wandering around with a bone sticking out of his arm and no resolution to his fate. But then again, life can be just like that sometimes."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 January 2017,8/10,"A divorced father (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother (Ben Foster) resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas.Although this is only the first (of nine) Best Picture nominees I have watched, I feel it may hold the distinction of being the most exciting. The typical winners are heavy on drama, or perhaps are socially conscious. This nominee defies that. And while I don't expect it to win, I am glad it will get a little extra attention.Best Supporting Actor Jeff Bridges? I love Jeff Bridges. Everyone loves Jeff Bridges. The Academy loves him, too. It's too early to say, but I don't see this as being a win for him. He is great as the old, crotchety, semi-racist Texas ranger... but it's not one of those mind-blowing roles that really get noticed. There was no special makeup or voice alteration required. I would love to see Bridges be honored, but I doubt it.Best Screenplay? This would also be great to see. Although the basic plot is simple -- brothers robbing banks to purchase the family farm -- the intricacies are wonderful, such as why certain banks are targeted, and the way the brothers ""launder"" the money. I was not a fan of some of the heavy-handed messaging. The idea that the American military stole from the Indians, and now the banks stole from the American people. The message itself is fine, but the way they were so blunt about it by having Alberto express the exact sentiment... it sort of dumbed everything down.Best Editing? It is my opinion that editing is very hard to judge. Unless you are an editor, you may not know what goes into the job. Also, the best editing should be flawless, and not obvious in a film. For this second reason, I would gladly hand over the best editing award to this film, because the editing was indeed very smooth, and the pace was excellent. Some movies drag at 90 minutes. This one, with its pace, could have been three hours and still enjoyable. Surely the editing is at least partially to thank."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2016,9/10,"The western was a staple of US cinema for decades, but had mostly disappeared by the late 1990s. The 21st century has seen a diverse set of westerns released. Kelly Reichardt directed the minimalist ""Meek's Cutoff"", while Seth MacFarlane gave us the slapstick comedy ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". David Mackenzie's ""Hell or High Water"" is not that easy to pigeonhole. Set in the present day, it focuses on a pair of brothers robbing banks in west Texas, while a Ranger looks for them.The cast members play roles very different from their most famous ones. Jeff Bridges (generally known for playing people disaffected with the modern way of life) plays the mildly racist Texas Ranger, doing what he feels that he has to in order to find the robbers. Chris Pine and Ben Foster show the robbers' desperation, complete with unnecessary risks. I thought that Gil Birmingham's character was a little underdeveloped, though.Overall, it's a fine look at the lengths to which people will go in desperate scenarios. I haven't seen any of Mackenzie's movies before, but I'm eager to see more of them. I recommend it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 September 2016,7/10,"I saw the trailer for this film only two days before it was released, the three leading actors in it certainly appealed to me, but it did also look like a good thrilling film, directed by David Mackenzie (Young Adam). Basically in West Texas, divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Contraband's Ben Foster) rob two banks early in the morning, they have a plan to commit several small-scale bank robberies over the course of a few days. Their robberies are well-planned, but Tanner's wild nature and unnecessary risk taking is frustrating Toby, it is revealed their mother died recently, due to a reverse mortgage their ranch has been left in debt, if not paid in a few days there will be a foreclosure on the property. Toby is determined to pay the mortgage off, and oil has recently been discovered on the land, he plans to sell the oil rights to pay for his estranged sons to have a comfortable life, it is also revealed Tanner went to prison for killing their abusive father. Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Twilight's Gil Birmingham), are assigned to catch the robbers, Hamilton is close to retirement, but determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile Tanner robs a bank while Toby is unaware and waiting at a nearby diner, they escape and take the stolen money to be laundered at an Oklahoma Indian casino, the money is exchanged for chips, and Tanner gets more playing poker, they are converted to checks that make the funds untraceable and the gambling covers up how they acquired the money. The Rangers set up surveillance outside a small town bank they believe will be hit next, the brothers do not show up, but Hamilton deduces their pattern and determines their final target, the robbery does indeed occur, Tanner continues with it despite customers holding weapons, a shoot-out ensues, a guard and an armed customer are killed, but the brothers escape. Several of the armed townspeople pursue Tanner and Toby as they race out of town, gaining some distance Tanner stops and fires an automatic weapon rifle at the ""posse"", they turn back, the brothers then split with two cars, Toby takes the money, while Tanner turns back to confront the Texas Rangers and local law enforcement. To give his brother more time to escape, Tanner draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge, firing at them with a sniper rifle, he kills Parker, Hamilton is furious and calls for a SWAT team, then uses a local resident to help him find a way behind Tanner, Hamilton borrows the local's rifle and takes out Tanner with a single long- range shot. Toby manages to pass through a law-enforcement checkpoint without suspicion, he makes it to the casino and is able to launder the rest of the stolen cash, he sees the news about his brother's death, but he is able to make it to the bank and deliver the checks in time to prevent the ranch's foreclosure. Some time later, Hamilton has retired, he learns that the Rangers and banks have cleared Toby as a suspect, as he has no record and the oil wells earn him more in a month than robberies, Hamilton confronts Toby at the ranch, he makes it clear he knows the brothers were responsible for the robberies. He does not explicitly admit his culpability, but Toby explains his motivations for wanting his sons to have a better life, both men have weapons, but the tension is broken when Toby's former wife and sons arrive, Hamilton realises Toby gave his family the farm and all its profits, Hamilton departs, but Toby suggests they may meet again, implying they will try and kill each other when the time comes. Also starring Katy Mixon as Jenny Ann, Winter's Bone's Dale Dickey as Elsie, Kevin Rankin as Billy Rayburn and William Sterchi as Mr. Clauson. Foster is great as the more rebellious and aggressive brother, Pine is good great as the more calm but equally determined brother, and Bridges is terrific as the Texas Ranger near retirement but prepared to catch the crooks. It is a good simple story, a pair of desperate redneck brothers being careful to cover their tracks, and the law enforcement officers on their trail, the robbery sequences are exciting, the chase and shoot-up sequences are thrilling, and the script is snappy, overall it is a most worthwhile heist crime film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 November 2017,8/10,"Two rambunctious young fellows decide to rob the Midlands Bank of Texas that's threatening to foreclose on their pitiful and unproductive little cattle ranch. One of the boys (Chris Pine) is notably less rambunctious than his older brother (Ben Foster), who has just left the slams after a six-year vacation there. Foster is thrilled with the banditry, whoops with delight as they zigzag away from the banks, leaving a cloud of dust. Pine loves his brother but believes him to be a little nuts. Pine has spent the last year or so caring at home for their dying mother. ""This the bed she was in?"" asks Foster, on seeing the empty bed for the first time. ""Well, Eff it. She didn't care much for me anyhow."" (A pragmatist.) As the two reckless boys set about their task, usually planned, but one entirely spontaneous, we meet the other side of the law -- Jeff Bridges as a casual old Texas Ranger on the brink of retirement, and his Comanche deputy and sidekick, Gil Birmingham, whom Bridges is always teasing about his Indianness -- catching the robbers with voodoo, eating pemmican, and the like.In contrast to the robbers, Bridges kind of slouches around, takes his time to think things over, and exercises his fulgurating intuition to anticipate their next move.I don't want to get into the plot in any more detail. It's a good movie. It rings true. The location shooting in New Mexico is evocative. The characters -- even the most minor -- are colorful. The story itself is credible, with moments comedy alternating with those carrying the tension of a coiled spring. It certainly seems right as a picture of small-town Texas. It owes a lot, I suspect, to the wildly successful ""Fargo"" that preceded it by a few years but I don't care. If all imitations were this good I'd start drinking almond flavored soy milk instead of the real thing."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 November 2018,9/10,"Following the death of Toby Howard's mother it looks as though the Texas Midland Bank will foreclose on the family ranch. To raise the money required he decides to take it from Texas Midland Bank with the help of Tanner, his criminal brother. They quickly rob two branches and soon Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker, a pair of Texas Rangers are trying to find them. Toby has planned things well but Tanner is far more reckless; as an example he robs another bank while Toby is eating in a diner. After their final robbery doesn't go according to plan a confrontation with the law seems inevitable.This film may be set in the present but it feels very much like a western... and not just because of the Texas setting and presence of men in cowboy hats. The plot too feels like a western with our two protagonists fighting back against those trying to force them off their family land and the two Rangers after them. The story is well told and even though the Howard brothers are clearly breaking the law it is hard not to feel some sympathy for them; especially as we are constantly reminded that the recession is biting hard in this part of Texas. The cast does a really fine job; most notable Chris Pine who is great as Toby; if I hadn't seen his name on the credits I'd never have guessed that this was the 'new' Captain Kirk I was watching! Ben Foster is solid as Tanner. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham are a lot of fun as bickering Rangers Hamilton and Parker. While the story isn't 'action packed' it does have some good moments of action; these provide some shocks and believable violence. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to fans of crime drama looking for something a little different."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 November 2016,,"We saw this on DVD from a Redbox rental. It is set entirely in west Texas, Midland and surrounding areas but is filmed entirely in various New Mexico locations.The story here is that a bank has ""helped"" an elderly woman keep her ranch but in the process has accumulated a big debt to the bank. When she died the bank was prepared to foreclose and take the property for themselves. In her will she left the ranch to her grandsons, and its value plus the oil well royalties would set them for life. But it appeared that they would in fact get nothing.Their uncle is Ben Foster as Tanner Howard, he has been in and out of trouble many times, including 10 years in the pen. He devises a plan, they would rob a number of branches of the bank, then use the bank's own money to pay off the lien. He would be helped by his brother, the dad of the grandsons, Chris Pine as Toby Howard, who had never been in any kind of trouble. They would just steal money from the loose bills in drawers, only $20 bills and lower, and avoid money bundles that would have dye packs or tracking devices. Then they would go to a casino, convert the cash to gambling chips, drink a bit, then convert the chips back to money, ultimately into checks written to the same bank they robbed. Their plan is in danger of being foiled by career lawman, Jeff Bridges as Marcus Hamilton, about to retire. So this is a very interesting story and to get the full enjoyment you need to be able to root for a bank robber because the bank itself is more evil. If you can do that then it is a good movie.SPOILERS: In the end, right after the two brothers have accumulated enough money to pay back the bank, in their last robbery a number of customers have concealed handguns and follow them outside and begin shooting. The brothers get away and Toby gets to his escape car but Tanner takes the getaway truck into the hills, followed by lawmen. He gets killed but Toby gets to safety and with the help of a lawyer friend makes thing right with the bank. As the movie ends old Marcus has retired but he visits Toby, says he knows what they did just can't prove it. It appears the grandsons will be set for life."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 February 2017,7/10,"For all of the terrific acting, and there is quite a lot (and notably Jeff Bridges' scene partner Gil Birmingham needs to be in like half the movies made for the next few years), Hell or High Water is sometimes a little too on the nose and I think I'm just a little tired of seeing Ben Foster, masterful and compelling and Foster-y as he is, playing sociopathic criminals (sure, he's good at it, but after a certain point maybe they could stretch - and Warcraft doesn't count). But it also has the perspective and approach that would have worked just as well if it was a Western set in the 1950's (though the Hayes code certainly would've changed things - only a little), as the plains of Texas and the honorable(ish) bank robbers and old-time ranger-sheriff face off against one another in a cat-and-mouse chase. As a quasi-Cormac McCarthy-lite thing, it's fine, and sometimes more than fine. There's even a half-Indian-half-Mexican in the other cop (again, see it for Birmingham), and while Jeff Bridges is his usual awesome Chris Pine is the one who really delivers the goods. It's execution is solid, if standard. It has vision but could've used more-ish.It's the kind of movie I thought was just 'alright' walking out, but thinking a little more about it (and stepping away from Sheridan's more on-the-nose commentary on the destabilization of the working class in rural America), it works. Or maybe it's just nice to see a wide release thriller, near the end of summer no less, that's more about characters and basic conflicts even if, well, we've seen some of this before (i.e. the 'old man just about to retire doing x-y-z as his last thing')"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 August 2017,4/10,"You just cannot understand the garbled speech of the two Texas Rangers in hot pursuit of two brothers who go around robbing banks so that they can use the loot to pay off a farm mortgage. Ironically, they're robbing from the banks that control the mortgage.One brother has just been released from prison and the other is paying off alimony to an embittered wife and they have two rather estranged children from their father.The ending is quite awkward. The two guys run off from each bank in the fashion of ""Bonnie & Clyde."" We're really dealing with two losers here who have left life pass them by."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 December 2016,,"This film tells the story of two brothers who rob many banks in a short period of time, for a good reason. They soon have two sheriffs hot on their tails, and an intense cat and mouse chase ensues.""Hell or High Water"" is quite interesting as it doesn't tell you why there brothers have to rob a bank until half way into the story. The two brothers are likable even though they are villains, and I feel rather sorry for the ending they face. They Have starkly different behaviour and personality, making the story more interesting. I also am rather surprised by how prepared Ben Foster's character is for armed showdown with the police!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 January 2017,6/10,"I thought this might have been very similar to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN by the Coen brothers , a feeling reinforced by it picking three Golden Globe nominations . After seeing it I'm slightly puzzled why it has been touched by such acclaim . Giving it some thought I did conclude the screenplay was written by Taylor Sheridan whose main career in Hollywood is as an actor and actors do get overly praised if they either write or direct a production while it's impossible not to like Jeff Bridges and there's always an element of recognising a film at award voting that has traditional commercial appeal . Don't get me wrong because this film is a competent character driven thriller but probably no more than that My main gripe is that it does try and sugar coat the Howard brothers just a little too much . They're driven in to becoming bank robbers due to debts . Hmmm . Let me think now . Would it be too simplistic to have a couple of characters rob banks simply because they're a pair of greedy dumbasses ? Do I detect an element of post modernist morality where no one is responsible for their negative actions ? I much preferred the post modernism of New Hollywood where if someone robs a bank it's an act of nihilistic amorality or just simple greed One aspect of this film that is interesting is that it was directed by a Scotsman David MacKenzie and it shows in a some what clich√©d outsider of America in general and Texas in particular . We see vast grasslands interrupted by oil drilling , cowboys and Indians still exist and it's a state where gun possession is almost universal which possibly makes an unintentional point that if you're a dumbass intent on committing armed bank robbery do it somewhere that doesn't have armed citizens"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 December 2018,8/10,"Chris Pine is quite good in the role of Toby Howard, a divorced young man who, after the death of his mother, knows that the Texas Midlands Bank is going to take possession of his family's land. Rather than let that happen (and feeling that he has no other option), he hooks up with his reckless ex-con older brother Tanner (a typically excellent Ben Foster), and they set out to rob the various branches of the bank. Picking up their trail is a weary old Texas Ranger named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, in fine form), who's set to retire, and his partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).""Hell or High Water"" starts out serious but still fairly light, turning darker and more serious as the story progresses and blood starts getting spilled. While we may be rooting for our protagonists, we can't help but feel that they can't stay ahead of the law forever, and wait for the inevitable. There is a sombre quality to the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (writer of ""Sicario"", who also has a cameo as a cowboy), underscored by a haunting, melancholy soundtrack by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis. Commendably, it treats its characters as real and flawed human beings (including Tanner), and is largely believable, only turning more formulaic towards the end.Until then we get many pretty widescreen shots of New Mexico, some brief bursts of action & violence, a colourful assortment of supporting and background players, and engaging performances by the main four players. Bridges is admittedly once again essaying one of the ""mumbling Southerner"" characters that he seems to have grown fond of playing, but he brings a certain gravitas to the role and the scenario. He also supplies a heavy dose of sardonic humour as he teases his more straight-laced partner Birmingham. And speaking of Birmingham, he contributes such a natural, winning presence, that one hopes that this performance will help his career go even further. And Pine & Foster do well as the contrasting siblings, acting in a plot where the greed-heads at the banks are treated as the real villains.Overall, this is a fine film that people should check out.Eight out of 10."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2020,7/10,"The first ten minutes of this film did not inspire me. Chris Pine (""Toby"") and brother ""Howard"" (Ben Foster) rob some small town banks and attract the attention of the soon to retire, curmudgeonly Jeff Bridges as Texas ranger (""Hamilton""). Well, as it pans out much better than I had expected: the characterisations are strong; the pace and writing keep it interesting and although the story is riddled with holes and inconsistencies the thing flows along well as the ranger homes in on his increasingly reckless quarry. Bridges' persona is a little similar to his ""True Grit"" (2010) but Gil Birmingham plays a good foil as his cohort (""Alberto"") and the four create quite a lively and enjoyable cat-and-mouse action adventure that had me undecided as to whose side I was on until quite near the end... Largely uncluttered by soppy romance, it's even got a slight Robin Hood spirit about it too."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 July 2017,9/10,"Jeff Bridges plays a crusty old Texas Ranger in his sunset years in ""Asylum"" director David Mackenzie's ""Hell or High Water,"" an atmospheric, slow-burn, modern-day western about two bank robbers. Ben Foster and Chris Pine are fine as the desperadoes who rob the banks. They seem pretty savvy, too, because they take their loot and launder it at an Indian casino. They aren't greedy. They take over the loose bills in the teller's drawer and leave the money packets with the ink-packs designed to explode and mark the thieves. Foster is cast as older brother Tanner Howard; Howard shot his father to death and did time in prison, while his younger brother, Toby (Chris Pine of the rebooted ""Star Trek"" franchise), participates in the hold-ups. Tanner is a mean-spirited, troublemaking dastard who has no compunctions about shooting his fellow man. Miraculously enough, these guys follow a strategy that involves robbing on Midland, Texas, Banks, because the bank is poised to take their dead mother's land if they cannot pay back the loan. ""Sicario"" scenarist Taylor Sheridan wrote this cops and robbers outing. Just as villainous Tanner and Toby ridicule each other as brothers will do, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham of the ""Twilight"" franchise) exchange barbs. Alberto constantly needles Marcus because he knows his old partner wants to do something useful before he ends up on his pension. Marcus decides to investigate the bank robbers, and this assignment keeps both men on the road. Marcus is a shrewd judge of character and he figures out what the Howard brothers will do next. What could otherwise have boiled down to a cutthroat Texas manhunt turns into a character study on both sides of good and evil. Clocking in at 102 minutes, ""Hell or High Water"" features wide-open, sprawling spaces and towns on the brink of extinction in Texas. The banks are the real bandits, and the Howards manipulate the situation to their advantage. In one scene, Marcus and Alberto enter a steak restaurant right across the street from a bank that Marcus bets will get robbed. The waitress that takes their order is a grumpy old dame (Margaret Bowman of ""No Country for Old Men"") who asks them what they don't want on their order. Everybody, she points out, buys a steak and potato at the restaurant, and they either don't want the green beans or they want the corn on the cob. Bowman is a real hoot and a holler, and her minor role enlivens the action. ""Hell or High Water"" qualifies as a down-t0-earth crime saga with interesting characters. Bridges delivers another wonderful performance that borrows something from his Rooster Cogburn portrayal in ""True Grit."" Incidentally, Bridges received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Similarly, ""Hell Or High Water"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay. This is one you shouldn't miss"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 September 2019,4/10,"I was definitely underwhelmed by this movie. An all star cast and a promising start, but it just fizzled. Highly anti climatic and fairly predictable. Good acting from all, but they didn't have much to work with. The storyline was slow, the final shootout wasn't very cinematic, the movie just didn't have good flow."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 July 2017,5/10,"In West Texas, two brothers go on a bank-robbing rampage. They are targeting the branches of one bank in particular, The Texas Midland Bank. This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate. On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.Interesting idea, clumsily written and so-so in execution. While the whole idea of robbing a bank to pay off a loan to that bank is wonderfully, wickedly poetic, here it is turned into a ideological, political sermon. So rather than a decent crime drama, the movie gets turned into an attempt to be something bigger, and it fails at that, taking shots at things clearly troublesome to the writer, but not necessarily to anyone else.Add in much fake atmosphere - mournful music, long shots of Texas vistas - just to make the movie seem more profound than it is, and you have case of style over substance. It was as if director David MacKenzie was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers' Fargo, but then didn't have the story to go with the atmosphere.It's not all bad though. Jeff Bridges is great as Marcus Hamilton and there are a few good action scenes and funny moments. I found the proliferation of guns a great, often funny, indictment of American gun culture. Not sure it was meant to be that profound or funny though, as it was probably quite realistic."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 August 2016,10/10,"HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016) **** Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Marin Ireland, John-Paul Howard, Dale Dickey. Excellent neo-Western about a pair of down-on-their-luck siblings (Pine - eerily resembling Tom Selleck - and Foster, both superbly low-key) who embark upon a string of bank robberies to finance their late mother's outstanding debts results in a give-and-take with a Texas ranger on the cusp of mandatory retirement (a canny, wily, crusty and flat-out wonderful Bridges) and his Native American/Mexican-American partner (Birmingham) one step behind them in pursuit. A lean, taut and smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan lays down the right rhythms for filmmaker David McKenzie to take his time in each beat setting up the plot, character development and action with nimble skill. Giles Nuttgens' cinematography evokes the best of Terrence Malick films - beautiful and elegiac. One of the year's best films."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 December 2016,5/10,"Almost as if it were made as a response to the recent collective shout from Trump America comes this noir-infused thriller set in the dying towns of West Texas.Chris Pine, too pretty to be believable as a Texan redneck, and Ben Foster, close to unwatchable as a very convincing redneck, play two brothers who hatch a scheme to rob banks until Pine has collected enough money to provide for his ex-wife and estranged kids and get them out from under the oppression of debt. This movie is clearly meant to be a howl of anger on behalf of poor, working-class rural America, who look at banks as villains and want to blame elite America for its problems even while they accuse liberals of being too soft and allowing lazy people to collect welfare. There's a pride of a certain kind of Texan attitude that pervades this film, but it's damn near intolerable from my perspective as a city dweller who understands that the real world isn't a John Wayne western and who doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of a bunch of hothead macho men itching to shoot somebody with their precious guns. I didn't feel sorry for the people in this movie, despite the screenplay's heavy-handed attempts to shove their plight down my throat. The people who live in areas like this prove time and again that they are incapable of voting for leaders who could actually do something to help them, and instead actually vote against their best interests because they're too uninformed not to, and then whine that the world has forgotten them. If the film had cast even the slightest critical eye on this environment and asked some more probing questions -- like how responsible are these people for their own plights -- or if it had come out in a different political climate, one where I don't now have to watch my country be governed for four years by a woefully incapable president because a bunch of poor Americans still think abortion is the most important topic in the world, I might have been able to tolerate it. As it is, it made me profoundly irritated and revealed to myself how little compassion I feel like having at this moment in time for the people whose voices were so loudly heard during our latest election.Grade: C+"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 August 2016,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. A good guy doing bad things for a good reason. A bad guy doing bad things for a good reason. A good guy whose make-up doesn't allow for bad things by anyone for any reason. Director David MacKenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) serve up a quasi-western featuring a crusty old Texas Ranger doggedly pursuing two bank robbing brothers. If not for the numerous destroy-the-flow screaming political statements, this could have been a near instant classic ‚Äì just a tick below No Country for Old Men.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard. Details eek out slowly about each ¬Ö most importantly that Toby is a divorced dad and Tanner is an ex-con. Toby has meticulously planned out their bank robbery spree. The goal is to save his family ranch so his boys can escape the ""disease"" of poverty. Tanner is along to support his brother ¬Ö and probably because he enjoys the adrenaline rush.Soon enough, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail of the boys, and his highly developed instincts and gut feelings annoy his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) almost as much as Marcus' incessant and insensitive racial teases ‚Äì a reminder of the days when buddies would verbally jab each other without the risk of class action lawsuits.The performances are all excellent. Pine is the quiet guy resigned to a life without happiness, but refusing to give up on his boys. Foster is the wide-eyed trouble-maker who long ago realized he would always be one careless moment from the end. Bridges literally becomes the Ranger being forced into retirement (age) but intent on remaining somewhat relevant. Additional support work is also quite colorful in a west Texas kind of way. The wonderful Dale Dickey gets an early sequence with the boys, the great Buck Taylor is always a pleasant presence, Margaret Bowman adds yet another memorable character to her resume as the T-Bone waitress, and Katy Mixon (""Eastbound and Down"") gets to stand up for the little people.West Texas is a character unto itself with massive poverty, oil pumps on the horizon, dusty streets, rickety fences, and gun-toting citizens everywhere. Each of these elements is beautifully captured by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (Dom Hemingway), as are the actual bank robberies and the quiet moments between brothers and Rangers partners. To cap it off, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis add a nice score and even better soundtrack ¬Ö the best of which is an opening song from Townes Van Zandt.Mixed in with the impending gloom are some terrifically witty exchanges and some downright funny moments. Exceptional acting, a spot on setting, wonderful photography, and superb music are only slightly offset by the previously mentioned obnoxious and too obvious shots taken at big banks and oil companies. Sometimes a good story can be just that ¬Ö and not a political statement."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 November 2016,9/10,2 brothers rob banks in small towns in Texas to raise money to stave off foreclosure. A pair of rangers Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham from Twilight pursue them. the Ben Foster and Chris Pine are the brothers. As I expected Ben does white trash well but Chris is actually convincing enough. Jeff has some good lines.It's all about a good plot and well written dialog and how the story creates sympathy for both sides. The movie isn't excessively violent. Shows you don't need a high body count for tension - just characters you care about. The bad guys in this modern Western are the foreclosing banks. Look out for the social commentary about the despair gripping heartland USA. A major plus point is the ending is as satisfying and feel good as could be.A very good crime Western.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 February 2017,10/10,"Taylor Sheridan takes us back to the concept of the Wild West but in his fine script HELL OR HIGH WATER he keeps the time and the locale contemporary ‚Äì present day in west Texas. And instead of ornery outlaws he places his story in the hands of a divorced father and his ex-con older brother who resort to robbing little banks in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas. David Mackenzie directs with a fine-tuned sense of balance between humor, sensitivity, pain, and loss and manages to pull together a splendid cast of characters that gives a very fine ensemble performance.Following a series of armed robberies at a number of branches of Texas Midland Bank where very little money was taken, the idea behind the robberies is rather sensitive - the motive of unemployed oil and gas worker Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother Tanner (Ben Foster) just released from prison is to raise enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage that will forfeit their recently deceased mother's ranch if not paid off. Oil was discovered on the ranch and in order to secure the future of his sons and ex wife (Marin Ireland), Toby needs $43,000. After two of the robberies, caustic old Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his American Indian deputy partner (Gil Birmingham) pick up the trail and just miss foiling the next, and last robbery. To offer more would be spoilers, though the manner in which the story is brought to closure identifies the tenderness that exists on the part of both the robbers and the law.Both Chris Pine and Ben Foster offer excellent portrayals of two young men attempting to cope with life as it has been dealt to them. Jeff Bridges is in fine fettle as the old retiring age lawman who rattles off racial epithets/slurs to his good-natured Indian/Mexican partner in dialogue that is immensely memorable. Every minor role becomes major in the quality of delivery of a cast of surprisingly fine actors. Yes, it is a shoot 'em up contemporary Western, but it also is an extraordinarily well- written, directed and acted significant film with a fine after-burn."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 October 2016,8/10,"Movie of the fall thus far! What worked: Great background story/environment development. West Texas looks dirty, poor, decaying by the relentless hitting of the new global economy. The line ""I fought 3 tours for this"" resonates with the audience. Strong developmental characters which are blunt, brash, tough matter of fact with a mix of humor and understanding. The over worked waitress and the ranchers dealing with a fire displays the tough life. One takes care of their own problems in West Texas. Strong bank robbing lead character Chris Pine, the thinking alpha male, takes his family problems into his own hands. Ben Foster the bank robbing brother who does evil out of family loyalty and the adrenaline thrill! Jeff Bridges the down to earth no Sh@@ Texas ranger with locker room humor and all. Great sad story. Medical cost made the family almost lose the ranch, and oil. The social message of hard life and poverty . The culture of taking care of your own problems collides when the bank robbery string comes to a violent climax. The open ending of what will happen next leaves a bitter feeling after the violent climax! 8 out of ten"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 April 2017,8/10,"I'm not a big fan of cowboys neither the Southern American accent. I think you gotta live there to appreciate your own kind. I wouldn't last a week between those rednecks. But watching a movie like Hell Or High Water is totally different. You couldn't expect anything else than a fat Southern accent and the cowboy bank robbers played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine are just perfect in their roles. Jeff Bridges was also excellent as the almost retired ranger, with his mild sarcasm and no-need-to-rush-action. The whole movie feels like slow motion except during the robberies but it's a delight to watch. Great scenery's with a good story-line, great dialogues, what else you could ask more? I really enjoyed this far-from-my-bed-movie and I'm sure a lot of other people will as well."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 January 2017,8/10,"Its premise might be straightforward (two siblings resorting to bank robbery to save the ranch, and the restless Texas Ranger in pursuit) but ""Hell or High Water"" doesn't feel conventional. To some extent, this reminded me of ""Heat"" - not in the fates of certain characters, but just the dance between lawman and bandit - and the pivotal heist that can so badly reverse one's fortunes. But you basically know what you're in for with this, and can expect great performances from the three leads *(although the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and his partner was unexpected and quite pleasant). But since I've brought up ""Heat"", this was much more low-key and for me, it's the dialogue that really sets this movie apart. Long stretches of sun-blasted Texas scenery, enlivened by the occasional punchy one-liner. And in case that sounds boring, this certainly isn't. But for a movie about gunning up and robbing banks, there's more fun to be had when the guns are holstered. Top to bottom, this is a great movie.8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2016,,"""Hell or High Water"" is a carefully crafted film with superb dialogue and a fine acting ensemble. The film blends wry humor with the serious backdrop of a hardscrabble life in the midlands of Texas.The structure of the film is well-conceived with a pair of brothers who are robbing banks for relatively small stakes pursued by the two police officers who are on their trail.Chris Pine and Ben Foster are entirely believable as the troubled brothers, both ironically seeking a kind of redemption through the robberies. Pine's character Toby is the deeper thinker, who has carefully planned the bank heists to pay off the mortgage on his family ranch by the deadline of its foreclosure. Toby is motivated to offer his son the chance to break free from the family curse. Foster's character Tanner is the brother who desperately wants the respect from Toby. It is surprising how sympathetic the two brothers become as the film progresses.The two Texas Rangers are Jeff Bridges' character Marcus Hamilton and his sidekick is Alberto Parker, as played by Gil Birmingham. The two cops have their own special relationship that serves as a mirror image of the two lawbreaking brothers. It is inevitable that there will be a ""showdown"" between the two pairs of characters.The only disappointment in the film was its ending. The ultimate lack of resolution is, unfortunately, a weakness rather than a strength of the film. The final ""conversation"" also stretched credibility in what had previously been extremely realistic depictions of the bank heists and the cin√©ma v√©rit√© conversation between the cops.Still, this film is a cut above most of the mindless Hollywood film fare. The filmmakers were clearly attempting to weave a social commentary about the callous nature of home foreclosures and the same general mood of discontent that was apparent throughout the 2016 presidential election. In this regard, ""Hell or High Water"" serves as a time capsule for the decade of the teens in twenty-first-century America."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 August 2016,9/10,"David Mackenzie's 'Hell or High Water' is A Terrific Movie, that turns out to be an unexpected delight of the Summer. With underwhelming superhero movies or reboots doing the rounds, this Heist/Crime Motion-Picture offers a Solid Story, that is Sharply Written, Expertly Directed & Very Strongly Acted. 'Hell or High Water' Synopsis: A divorced dad and his ex-con brother resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's farm in West Texas.'Hell or High Water' is a story of family & crime. You watch the 2 brothers rob banks, as they are tired of being poor & they indulge in aggression. And then you have Two Texas Rangers, after them, because they're wearing a uniform & they serve for the protection of the people. Its the difference of dynamics between its characters that make 'Hell or High Water' a solid watch. I wan engrossed by the camaraderie of the 4 characters, they are interesting to watch & hear. 'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail & culminates in a crisp 101-minutes. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story & have an interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done. He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts' Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Nick Cave & Warren Ellis's Score is good. Action-Sequences are well-done, as well. Performance-Wise: 'Hell or High Water' is filled with superior performances. Jeff Bridges steals the show as the senior Texas ranger, who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil Birmingham) & skill to put things together & get to the criminals, is delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on & proves once again, that he's among the Greatest we've ever had. As the 2-brothers who go on bank-robbing spree, Chris Pine & Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while Foster, an actor who's potential isn't new to know, continues to astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine & Foster, appears real & affecting.On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a Winner! Don't Miss It!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 August 2016,9/10,"Every once and a while a good crime drama that involves cops and bad guys who do robberies comes along and it entertains and thrills and you the viewer love seeing the chase and the blood that is shown and most of these type of pictures spill acts of heroism and vigilantism so well and with this independent entry ""Hell or High Water"" it pretty much covers all of what I just said.Set in West Texas along areas of poor and economical depressed towns where their is no hope has many ticked off especially two brothers Tanner and Toby Howard(Ben Foster and Chris Pine)Tanner's an ex con and Toby is a divorced dad who's just watched his mom die. Now the debt is left of how to live and pay the banks off on the debt left on the dried up and worn ranch that the family has. Now that plan involves the brothers robbing banks to make it and these guys are due as they have been poor and born losers all their life! Now enter the hero the tough as nails twang Texas drawl talking Ranger named Marc Hamilton(in a spot on and near perfect role for the great Jeff Bridges)who's outspoken and a guy who will do what it takes to bring justice for the small town and the film becomes a chase of cat and mouse games with bullets and blood now need I say more ""Hell or High Water"" is a movie I love it's a showcase of justice the old style way all while showcasing vigilantism."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 December 2016,8/10,"""From the director of STARRED UP (2013) and the writer of SICARIO (2015)"" seems to be a double warrant that this latter-day cat-and-mouse bank robbery Western will not disappoint. Hell yeah, you bet, it doesn't. David Mackenzie's latest picture takes place in New Mexico, substituted for West Texas in the story, its vast flat-lands where cowpokes once galloped heroically now has been infested by an economic downturn, Mackenzie rams home that halcyon days are gone, derelict landscapes are sublimely captured by the film's traversing shots which also topically inform viewers that capitalism has avariously seized the opportunity to exploit the scrape for its own benefit, with big placards of banks' artifices glaringly omnipresent against the lugubrious backwater. The mother of Tanner (Foster) and Toby Howard (Pine) is the victim of a bank stratagem, the heinous reserve mortgage, after her decease, Toby inherits the range, but needs to pay off the debts to the Texas Midlands Bank before the deadline, otherwise the ranch will be foreclosed, more significantly, oil has recently been discovered on the land, it will be a gold mine but he must secure the dough before bank takes it over, so he avails himself of this obsolete action (nobody robs bank nowadays!) to bag enough cash from the said bank, with Tanner lending a helping hand, who is an ex-con (for manslaughter of their own father) and has just been released from the jail over a year. In Toby's plan, they cannot risk taking notes of big face-value, which can be tracked, so they need to rob several branches to rack up the sum, and Tanner turns out to be quite an apt partner-in- crime, although sometimes also a loose cannon who has no scruples about violence when he sees fit. But Taylor Sheridan's script robustly refuses to lend an easy dichotomous characterization between the two brothers, Tanner is aggressive, presumptuous, but also deeply connected by their brotherhood and family bond, he has nothing to lose, and will do anything to make sure that Toby can buy their land back from the bank, ethically we shouldn't root for him, but Ben Foster brings home Tanner's atrocity and self-sacrifice to audience in such a pressing force, our moral compass might be unconsciously deflected. Chris Pine's Toby, on the other hand, stays close to our compassion, a retiring but seemingly innocuous Texan (although Sheridan ascertains that the violent DNA runs in the family), divorced and has two children whom he hasn't seen for nearly a year, if he fails to pay the mortgage, he will lose everything, not to mention a safe future for his children, we can wholeheartedly concur his actions because he has no other alternative, also because he is righteously fighting against the canker pervading in our society presently, only if, their last mission had not gone awry, a robbery on the pay-day is a big remiss, while trigger-happy on-lookers are simply too bovine to be martyrized for the interest of the banking conglomerate. The pair traces Howard brothers are two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Bridges), and his half- Mexican-half-Comanche partner Alberto Parker (Birmingham). Marcus is on the verge of retirement, considers the chase his last field-day out and wallows in his politically incorrect jests with a condoning Alberto meanwhile trying to outguess Tanner and Toby's moves, which culminates in an an-eye-for-an-eye retribution in the wild where Bridges gives a text-book paragon of changing emotions, from initial insouciance, to sudden terror, then a pang of anguish until a regarding but also benumbing victory, the Dude is back for more trophies! Then, in the finale where Marcus visiting Toby in his ranch, both actors superbly register an enticing ambiguity in the face of the ugly truth behind their inevitable encounter, intrepidly take the gray zone with a whopping bang, death could be a relief after all the damage has been done, but it is the residue of the unpalatable memories will haunt both in the rest of their waking hours, or maybe in their dreams as well. A summer sleeper in the North American box office front, HoHW is a remarkable endeavor pays reverent homage to the Western genre while yoking its story intimately to today's climate without losing its sober angle, an evocative soundtrack cooked up by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is also irresistible for those reminiscent souls, heading vigorously into the Oscar season, in my opinion, Bridge is reserved for a nomination, Foster could be a left-side contender, while its script, cinematography and editing also have a good chance, if it can scoop a SAG nomination for its splendid cast, then a BEST PICTURE player will not be a long shot afterwards."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 November 2016,7/10,"This is one of those dry slow burn film that is worth the patience to sit through. Mainly because of the development of the characters, the interactions that is sometimes serious, dramatic, awkward and humorous. The cinematography and character elements sort of reminded me of a Coen brothers film. Nowhere near at complex or having multiple scenarios and many viewpoints in the story colliding with one another. The acting is very good, Jeff Bridges fit right into this role but the actor that really impressed me was Ben Foster. As the loose canon brother between the two bank robbers. Ben Foster didn't really impress me as an actor all that much. The last movie he really stood out to me was in the film ""3:10 to Yuma"". Overall, despite the slow development and a simple plot it's a film that is well worth the watch. Mainly because of the unraveling of the story, the dry and yet enthralling style of it all.7.5/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 September 2016,10/10,"'HELL OR HIGH WATER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed crime drama flick; about two bank robbing brothers, in West Texas, trying to raise money to save their family's ranch. The film stars Jeff Bridges, Chirs Pine and Ben Foster. It was written by Taylor Sheridan (who also wrote 2015's outstanding 'SICARIO'), and it was directed by David Mackenzie. The film received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics (98% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), and it's been a small hit at the Box Office (so far) as well. I loved it. Toby Howard (Pine) is a divorced father, living in West Texas, that desperately wants to leave a better life for his two estranged sons (John-Paul Howard and Christopher W. Garcia). His brother Tanner (Foster) is an ex-con, that wants to help Toby achieve this dream. They're family ranch is about to be foreclosed on, and there's a great deal of oil that's just been discovered on the land. The brothers decide to rob several banks, in order to pay off the farm. Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) is the retiring Texas Ranger that wants to stop them. The movie is a very well put together western/heist flick; that focuses a lot more on rich character development, than action. With that said, the climactic shootout/chase at the end is epic. The three leads are all great in the film, but Bridges is classic (it's probably one of his best performances ever). Pine is likable, as the movie's main character; and Foster is awesome at being crazy, once again (I don't think he can play anything else). Like I said, the movie is a little slow-paced/slow building at first; but it's worth it! Sheridan's script is brilliant.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 November 2016,8/10,"No one should ever ask for a sequel or, hell, remake, to the Coen Brothers classic modern Western with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, but this might satisfy those who dared to.I've wanted to see Hell or High Water for some time now. On the day after a heated, year and a half election season ended, it might not have been the best day to see it since it was sooo¬Ödepressing.The movie revolves around two brothers acting as some messed up Robin Hoodlums who rob banks to help secure the ""lessor evil"" brother's family's future. Meanwhile, a grumpy old ranger is dragging his punching bag partner through the investigation and might be smarter than his Columbo tactics indicate.Unfortunately for the film, they really hammered over our heads about how bad the Texas towns the characters were travelling through are doing. In fact, in a movie about bank robberies, there are more signs of the recession than banks. We get it already. Luckily, there's much more here to absorb than concentrate on all the obvious, and in most cases, literal, signs.For the second half of my life, I've developed a deep appreciate for Jeff Bridges. Here, he is good, sometimes pretty good, but out of left field, Chris Pine showed some real acting chops. I wish I could say the same for his brother, played by Ben Foster. Ben wasn't bad at all, but he's playing the same role/acting he's always done. The real star here was Pine.As mentioned above, it's fairly close to the classic and modern ""Western,"" No Country for Old Men, but never hits it completely. With one emotional scene ‚Äì and when you get there, the stakes are high and you get a jolt, but just not as many as I would've liked to in comparison to the other film.Overall, totally worth it, but take heed: it's truly a depressing movie. Wonderfully shot and acted with a script that's pretty real, but it's still a downer. Be prepared for that.***Final thoughts: Normally, I do all I can to avoid trailers, even going as far as to look away and pretend not to listen when they're shown before movie theatre feature presentations. But, I saw this one from beginning to end several times over a month or so of watching many movies. Initially, I thought I saw it all, knew it all and had the movie I actually did want to see pegged, but mercifully, they only showed a snapshot of all that happened in the movie. Just a taste. Which is what trailers are SUPPOSED to do. Most ruin many critical scenes and plot points and that's why I stay away. For Hell or High Water, you can rest assured: the trailer-maker(s) respected this film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 July 2019,6/10,"Pretty good movie with some great acting. not really my type of movie, but i enjoyed it (1 viewing)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2016,10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Two brothers, older, hot headed, reckless Tanner (Ben Foster) and calmer, younger, more observed Toby (Chris Pine) are committing a series of bank robberies to offset the foreclosure of their mothers home. Detective Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail to track them down with his Inuit partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) with whom he enjoys regular racially charged banter. On the verge of retirement, and his last big case looming, Marcus's experience and expertise plays off against the recklessness and hostility of the brothers to build up to an explosive climax.David Mackenzie's latest film after 2014's excellent Starred Up, sets its sentiments and certainly its politics in motion pretty early on, slowly hovering over some graffiti on a wall which reads 'three tours of Iraq, no bail outs for us.' The action takes place throughout in a series of American ghost towns with a creepy air of barrenness and desolation where once there was seemingly prosperity and hope. The tone is set in a scene where Birmingham's character talks of how many years ago the ancestors of Bridges took the land from his descendants, but now the banks are the ones doing the same thing.On the surface, Hell or High Water seems a straightforward cops/robbers tale, with a standard formula and clich√©d characters, and it may well have been if Mackenzie hadn't injected something a little extra in the overall product. It doesn't just roll the characters out, it properly examines them, their motivations, fears and doubts. We learn of the brothers family circumstances, and their respective feelings towards their late mother, while Bridges as the seasoned cop is shown wrestling with his world weariness as his retirement looms. It's slow and sobering, with an unmistakable touch of the Coen's No Country for Old Men to it.Like a lot of intelligent scripts, it blurs the distinction between right and wrong, good and evil, heroes and villains in a whirlwind of moral ambiguity, with some sweeping desert cinematography, lingering atmosphere and a genuine air of suspense that will leave you thoroughly pleased. *****"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 July 2018,8/10,"While 'Hell Or High Water (2016)' has a few overwrought and oddly expositional moments, it's an excellent heist thriller that uses its palpable sense of place and brilliantly well-realised characters to totally compound you within its incredibly realistic and wonderfully tactile world. It immerses you in the dusty planes of a 'Neo-Western' New Mexico with confidence and ease. There's a lot to unpack thematically, from the phenomenal mirror-image brother relationships to the thinly veiled political message, and most moments, even the exciting and genuinely tense 'action' sequences, are conveyed with a subtlety that makes for a much quieter, more character-driven affair than usual. It has proper stakes and emotionally affecting moments of all kinds, and it certainly leaves a lasting impression. 8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 November 2020,9/10,"British director David Mackenzie has been making films for around twenty years now and with his varied output I suppose he could be called one of 'the new auteurs'. The fact that he isn't necessarily that prolific only piques our interest. He made ""Hell or High Water"" in the US in 2016 and it was nominated for Best Picture which proves that really good independent cinema can find favour and a market. Superbly written by Taylor Sheridan, it's the story of two brothers who become somewhat less than competent bank-robbers in an effort to raise enough money to save their late mother's ranch. The brothers are Chris Pine and a brilliant Ben Foster, (surely one of the best actors working anywhere today), and an even better Jeff Bridges is the grizzled old sheriff on their trail. It's the kind of movie the Coen Brothers might have made but not improved on and it has a real feeling for the New Mexico landscapes where it was filmed, (it's beautifully shot by Giles Nuttgens), and you would never guess watching it that Mackenzie himself wasn't American. There's also a terrific Nick Cave/Warren Ellis score; the perfect package, in fact."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 July 2017,7/10,"I don't know why, but sometimes when I watch a film it reminds me of another film and I just can't shake that feeling for its entire runtime. In this case, 'Hell and High Water' just made me think of 'No Country For Old Men' all the way through. They are both set in the deserts of Texas and are about an outlaw on the run from the law. Okay, so that smallest of synopsis doesn't quite fit if you've seen both films, but it's as near as I can get in such few words. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in this age of 'shared cinematic universes,' it wouldn't surprise me to see both films somehow existing side by side.Whereas 'No Country For Old Men' had a man on the run with an ill-gotten bag of loot from a hired killer while the law was ‚Äì kind of ‚Äì hot on both their trails, 'Hell or High Water' as a pair of brothers robbing banks while Josh Brolin is a sheriff on the brink of retirement and his long-suffering partner looking into the trail of empty cash drawers they've been leaving in their wake. Both films show the contrast between the two sets of characters' journey and from now on I'll do my best to concentrate on 'Hell or High Water' rather than constantly dwelling on how similar it was to 'No Country For Old Men.' The two robbers here are played by Chris 'new Kirk' Pine and Ben Foster (who looks fatter than the last time I saw him on screen!). I guess this casting was deliberate, but Pine is definitely the more sympathetic of the two and we get the feeling he's being led astray by his older, more violent and law-breaking brother. Plus Pine is also afforded the backstory of an ex-wife and child who he owes money to. Then we have the long arms of the law, mainly Brolin, who shines as the gruff and not always politically correct sheriff who is hot on their heels. I would say that him and his partner are probably more enjoyable to watch than the bank robbers as the banter between them and general long suffering vibe is truly a joy to watch.So, it's ultimately a cat and mouse game where you probably can guess that the two couples are going to meet up during the final act and it's all going to end badly for someone. Despite enjoying the film with its lush desert setting and realistic banter between the pairs, I'd say that its predictability would be the one area where it falls down a bit. I was only about a quarter of the way through when I made my prediction as to how it will play out for the four main characters. I won't mention it here as it turned out to be 100% correct, therefore would be giving away one hell of a major spoiler.Despite the bank robbery scenes naturally involving high-tension and speedy getaways, I did feel that the overall pacing of the film was quite slow. To some, that may sound like a negative point, but it's not the kind of story that needs fast-paced shootouts and high-budget actions scenes. It's a character piece as much as it is a cops and robbers film. I did my best to stop mentioning 'No Country For Old Men,' but I have to say that if you enjoyed that, i.e. characters, settings and mood, then you should like this one too. At least no one gets killed by a weird, portable hydraulic air-type pump thing. Weird."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 August 2016,9/10,"I think just by looking at the box office numbers, it's proved that it's near impossible to put out a western that has broad range appeal. Hell or High Water takes the genre into modern day gracefully and gives us easily one of the top 5 films of the year to date.I always try and find the time to go see the next western to be released because Hollywood rarely spends the time or money towards making them, so when they do they are usually pretty decent. Hell or High Water is more than decent, it's magnificent. The screenplay comes from the brilliant mind behind last year's Sicario, Taylor Sheridan. And just like Sicario, all of the characters are well realized and established from the word go.Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham all give well-crafted performances and largely against type as well. Director David Mackenzie speaks out against typecasting actors and he does a good job of not doing that here. Bridges and Birmingham play a funny buddy cup duo who have been through more than one rodeo together with a love-hate relationship. Their banter back and forth makes for some of the best comedy moments of the film, but it's not just there for kicks and giggles, every line adds weight to the characters so that you care when the final showdown begins.That duo is nicely complemented by the duo of Pine and Foster, who play brothers who rob banks in order to save their family's ranch. Just as Bridges plays the quick witted, Foster plays the unhinged and unpredictable brother, Tanner, to Pine's more subtle and reserved turn as Toby. The screenplay itself never asks the actors to do anything too crazy or stunning, which is what makes the performances all the more special. The ability for these four men to do so much with their eyes and unspoken actions makes it some of the best work they have all done.I also loved how patient and subtle the film itself was. It doesn't push bloody gun battles or massive twists in your face, it relies on great acting and a good directing job by David Mackenzie. I was immensely impressed by this film and I can't recommend it enough. I hope we hear about this film come award season.+Pine and Foster's best work to date+Bridges banter with Birmingham+Subtle and patient+Characters are well thought out by Sheridan9.5/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 August 2016,,"This is definitely the type of simple film that many might dismiss when first hearing about it or seeing the promotional footage of it. What's really surprising about it is the amount of emotional and dramatic weight that it carries. It's not primarily interested in gun fights or car chases. Instead, it's interested in exploring the dynamics of race and culture, and in depicting everyone as flawed individuals who you still feel empathy for. It gives you a portrayal of what poverty and the economy can do, even when never attempting to justify the horrible behavior on display or trying to make excuses for its characters. It's filled with wonderful, thoughtful dialogue while also playing out like a realistic morality tale. The three leads are also fantastic, especially Ben Foster, who deserves to get more roles as the talented character-actor he is. This is highly recommended."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 December 2016,,"Blending the good, old-fashioned ruggedness of westerns with the cold-hearted brutality of crime thrillers, Hell or High Water is an intelligently scripted & smartly directed tale of family, sacrifice & personal duty that is further uplifted by its set of badass characters & solid performances from its cast, and is impressive enough to rank amongst the finest films of the year.The story of Hell or High Water unfolds in Texas and follows two brothers who carry out a series of bank robberies to pay off the mortgage for their ranch as some twisted form of poetic justice. The case is given to two Texas Rangers who are able to deduce a pattern in their operation and wait for them at what they determine to be the siblings' next target but things head for the worse real soon.Confidently directed by David Mackenzie, the story is cleverly paced & expertly crafted from start to finish, and manages to be gripping until the very end. The screenplay is even better as all events that transpire over the course of its runtime unfold in a seamless, sensible fashion with few twists surfacing every now & then, plus each n every conversation carry weight & meaning behind those words.Shot in sparsely populated areas with rural settings, the film is beautiful to look at and makes apt use of warm colour palette & camera angles to further enhance its imagery. Editing is excellently carried out, for it provides a tighter structure to its narrative and allows its characters to evolve at their own pace. Music is complimentary to the unfolding events and although the gunplay it has in store is brutal, it certainly isn't mindless.Coming to the performances, Hell or High Water features a committed cast in Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster & Gil Birmingham, and each one of them chip in with terrific inputs. Bridges is in as the ageing Texas Ranger with Birmingham as his fellow partner, Pine & Foster play the two brothers and although everyone is despicable in one form or another, their finely handled character arcs & fully-developed relationship dynamics do allow the viewers to invest in their journey.On an overall scale, Hell or High Water is one of the most fulfilling film experiences of 2016 for me, and easily packs one of the best screenplays of the year. The plot is lean, the characters are fully- fledged, and the interaction between them only adds more meat to their arcs, not to mention that the actors do an outstanding job in their given roles to make it one of the most complete films of the year. Destined to garner a cult following & scoring high marks in nearly all filmmaking aspects, Hell or High Water is absolutely worth your time & money. Don't miss it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 January 2020,,"You know the kind of film this is. Border crime, terse visuals, sudden violence, melancholy prairie. Texans in stetson hats ride muscle cars instead of horses but it's still very much a western that we see. We still have the grizzly old sheriff in pursuit of bank robbers (and being casually racist to his Indian deputy). We have a posse of townsfolk giving chase, in SUVs nowadays. The notion that the two outlaw brothers aren't all bad, they do what they do to save their momma's ranch from the paws of greedy bankers.And as customary in westerns the last fifty years we have all of this tied to the passing of the West. The tone is elegiac. We stop to see cowhands in horseback rustling a herd away from a prairie fire that no one is bothering to put out, it will simply burn down to the river. The small towns we see along the way look decrepit, a far cry from their Roy Rogers days.It's not a completely wistful take. The Indian deputy reminds us that this was all someone else's smalltown America before you people came along. But as plaintive music now and then swells over shots of dusky prairie, the fundamental point here is a sense of inadvertent loss.The notion is that America is no longer great; that some essential purity of America is gone. Bankers took it away. Huge swathes of the country would agree of course; it's a fitting western for the Trump years, meant broadly. It would have been written and began production long before Trump came along on the back of outrage.It's what has come to be the worldview of the modern western, fueled by angst, fatalism and resignation to the passing of a way of life. Any worldview that laments change and looks back with nostalgic attachment to some purer past has no place in my home. But here's the cinch. These people would not look at their muscle cars and gas-guzzling SUVs, or TVs and cell phones, as part of modern change that sweeps away a way of life. They would not bat an eye at rock bars or getting a tattoo, which their grandfathers would have found abhorrent.In the western (both as film and mentality) so many things can change in other words, except the notion that a purer way of life is being swept. It's interesting to note that out of the many possible threads of what the western could mean, it has been reduced to this. What would it be like for example for modern westerns to celebrate the resilience of community, or the joy of banding together for common work? Sulking is a powerful impulse."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 December 2018,8/10,"Hell or High Water is an intense and complicated film. I found myself rooting for Chris Pine at certain points in the story, and then, at other times, I was rooting for Jeff Bridges - both of whom give fantastic performances. This is a slow burn movie with plenty of suspense."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 November 2016,9/10,"Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine put on an acting clinic.Bridges at 66 has enough swagger, 'tude and testosterone to be an action figure.Pine, always reliable as a A-lister, takes his craft to a whole new level. He is as far from Captain Kirk as the earth is from the moon. Superb work. And unforgettable.The script is to die for. Intelligent to a degree that makes you wonder aloud how the constant stream of B and C movies out of Hollywood ever get funded. Solid from the first line of dialog to the last.West Texas is the unbilled co-star. You feel like you are there.One of the best releases of the year."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 March 2019,8/10,"In the dry plains of West Texas, Toby (Chris Pine) has enlisted his brother, Tanner (Ben Foster) in a grand scheme of deception. They will rob banks, with ski masks, until they have enough money to reverse a ""reverse mortgage"" with which a bank fleeced their newly deceased mother. Not just any bank, the bank branches of the offending financial institution. Tanner, an ex-con, just wants the thrill of the plan but Toby wants to save the ranch for his two sons. What's more, they have planned it out in many ways to cover their tracks, such as burying getaway cars. Naturally, after the first two successful robberies, the Texas Rangers are called in. Marcus (Jeff Bridges) is on the verge of retirement; his partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), a half-Comanche, wishes he was about to rock in a rocking chair. By studying the methods used so far, Marcus gets an idea about what bank may be next. What's more, Tanner does one job on the spur of the moment and leaves clues. As the brothers get closer and closer to completion, will Marcus find them first? This excellent, sometimes violent, film has one sensational story. But, likewise, the cast is fabulous, the scenery is vividly desolate, and the direction is smooth. Are you a fan of old Westerns and cat-and-mouse plots? You will find H or HW a dream come true."

Things are going according to plan until sheriff Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) gets involved. Now, the two must not only get the money they need in a few days, but find a way to avoid the law as well. There are movies that are great. There are movies that are so good that you need to tell everyone you know to watch. Then there are movies that are so good there are not enough words to describe how good they are. This is one of them. The movie is not only one of the best movies of the year, but it is also one of the best of the last several. The acting is amazing, the drama is intense, but the best part of the movie is that you can understand both sides of the situation and you really aren't sure who to pull for. That to me is the sign of a great movie. It is a shame that movies like this aren't as widely seen as large budget popcorn movies. Overall, a definite must see. One of the best movies of the last few years. I loved this one. I give this an A+."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 August 2016,8/10,"""Hell or High Water"" is a buddy film. In fact, it contains two sets of buddies. The first is a pair of brothers, who have been estranged due to the older one's (Ben Foster) incarceration. In his absence, the younger brother (Chris Pine) had to deal with the failing health of their mother and a myriad of financial burdens. Reunited, they put a plan into action that has a high risk/reward profile. In the process, they become closer.The other buddies are a pair of Texas Rangers who set out to intercept a pair of amateurish bank robbers. Jeff Bridges is the older ranger with only three weeks to go before retirement. Gil Birmingham is his partner of Comanche heritage. Their friendship is hidden behind a fa√ßade of insults and teasing, but they share a strong bond.The story takes place in Texas beneath the unforgiving summer sun amid the ubiquitous dust. It's a stark environment for a deadly game of hide and seek.So much of the film is about fate. The paths of the two pairs are fated to intersect just as the older brother is fated to always return to crime. In their conversations, a heavy fatalism hangs over them like the layers of dust that coat every surface.Seeing Chris Pine out of a Starfleet uniform may be eye-opening for some viewers. Sadness and grittiness are ever present in his characterization of a young man who resented always having to be responsible because his older brother failed to assume the mantle.Jeff Bridges turns in one of his finest performances. It's a meaty role with layers of depth, perfectly portrayed.The story is nearly universal. Toby, the younger brother, could be an absentee father in Detroit, where his kids rarely see him, struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is faltering and an older brother who turned to crime. It is not clear who the film blames for the victimization of the struggling local economy, but we know who the characters blame. Whether they are right or wrong, they clearly represent a tragic segment of American culture."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 November 2016,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Hell or High Water"" (2016) is without a doubt one of the very, very best films of 2016, hands down thumbs up. This is a seemingly simple story is told with such a brilliant skill that i was blown away for every single moment and minute of this small masterpiece.Script was simply perfect. It is so rich in details, every conversation is near damn perfect. Director David Mackenzie without a doubt gets here an Oscar nomination next year for best directing. Cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well, well everything. And i didn't even mention acting, which was stellar - by everyone and this is why i think Jeff Bridges is one of the best screen performers of our times. Overall, ""Hell or High Water"" is the fastest 100 min. I've had in a movies in many moons. It so damn perfect - this is a movie heaven."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 March 2017,7/10,"Overrated 21st Century WesternI don't understand how this movie became so popular. Is it good? Yes, it is. But it's not an Oscar material. A classic western story put in the 21st century. Already seen many times, just in different scenery. It is even boring at first half. I was close to giving up on it after 45 minutes, but then I realized it is too late in the evening to start some other movie, so I finished it. And I'm not sorry that I did. But I would not watch it again for sure. I'll try to list what I think is really good about this movie. Jeff Bridges nailed his role. It is the only deserved Oscar nomination for this movie. I especially loved his ""racist"" jokes about Indians and Mexicans, and perfect timing for them. Jokes are good themselves, but in Jeff's interpretation, they are awesome. Further, the soundtrack is excellent. And finally, Ben Foster had a few really memorable scenes. First, when he leaves the car and goes towards persecutors, like Rambo, shooting bursts of machine gun fire. Second, the moment when he says: ""Lord of the plains... that's me."" and then takes a bullet in the head. Everything else is mediocre and mostly already seen.7/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 April 2017,,"What poetic justice can be more perfect than making the villain pay (literally) the damage it has caused its victims? I'll come back to this. HOHW has been described in different ways by different critics, juxtaposing terms like western, thriller, chase movie, crime story, drama. What I would like to call it is the collision course of two wildly different odd couples, ironically, in a maddeningly languid pace. I should add an additional spoiler warning here although there is really not much of twists to speak of. The point is that quite a few critics use the term ""slow-burn"" in unqualified praise of this movie. Some of the reasons and cause-effects take their good time in being revealed. While there is no intention on the movie makers' part to create a suspense mystery, the audiences may sometimes get that flavour, and enjoy it. In that sense, the next paragraph in which I attempt a capsuled plot outline will in a sense constitute a SPOILER. The main villain is a creature all of us are too familiar with: a bank (the Texas Midlands, in this specific case). Without going into any details, let me just say that the bank managers to get an imminent foreclosure on the property of an old woman who just died. Her two sons' unorthodox way of fighting back is to rob its branches to make the repayment to save the property in order that the oil reserve just discovered will ensure that the next generation will not be victims of poverty that they struggle with all their lives.The two brothers, one of the two aforementioned ""odd couples"" are Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine). While temperamentally explosive Tanner who has been having a violent and criminal life is an infinitely more experienced bank robber, it is mild-manners (for a bank robber) Toby that is the brain, masterminding the scheme of laundering the loot at casinos. It is also Toby who has even a resemblance of a family, with estranged wife and off spring living on the aforementioned property. Toby is still very close to his teenage son Justine, as well as maintaining a civil relationship with estranged wife. Oh yes, the brothers Tanner and Toby love each other deeply.The other ""odd couple"" is pre-retirement Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner Mexican-Comanche Alberto (Gil Birmingham). Just the name of the actor is sufficient to conjure up the persona of Marcus. Alberto is an absolutely reliable and level-headed partner. Comradeship and friendship between the two are very evident, Marcus's customary tongue-in-cheek racist remarks toward his partner notwithstanding.Women do not play any significant part in this movie but make a mark. Two short scenes, both with waitresses, are particularly unforgettable. Katy Mixon is a kind-hearted, soul-soothing waitress Jenny that strikes up a brief conversation in the restaurant with Toby who is unaware that Tanner is pulling a single-handed job at a bank across the street. When she is called away, he leaves after placing a $200 tip on the table. When the cops subsequently investigate the robbery, Jenny in her honest nature tells Marcus about the tip but refuses to show him the bills as ""evidence"", claiming ""the tip was left BEFORE the robbery"". Marcus, without losing a beat, retorts ""before THIS robbery"". Still Jenny wins. A much shorter appearance by Margaret Bowman as the world-wearied waitress at ""T-Bone Restaurant"" is the true scene stealer, with two veteran, hard-as-nail cops cowering before her. Later, in a conversation between Marcus and Alberto, the latter refers to her as ""rattlesnake"".Performances are from good to riveting. Pine has opened up a new dimension, moving from main-stream blockbuster hero to somewhat artsy character actor. Foster reprises again his overpowering stage presence going back ten years to ""3:10 to Yuma"". With double nomination (Oscar, Golden Globe) for best supporting role, Bridges effortlessly delivers what you expect of him. I am not sure if I should categorize Birmingham as ""support to a support"", but anyway, he is good! The final scene, a climatic confrontation between Pine and Bridges where not a single shot is fired and not even a voice is raised, is a gem."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2016,8/10,"From the British director of 'Starred Up' fame, it was like another 'The Place Beyond the Pines'. Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2016,7/10,"Two brothers commit a series of bank robberies to raise enough funds to prevent bank foreclosure while a tough Texas ranger on the verge of retirement pursues them in this modern western from the writer of 'Sicario'. The film opened to positive reviews with a lot of acclaim for its performances. Of particularly note is Jeff Bridges as the elderly ranger who eventually reveals a very human underbelly to his overtly racist and condescending character, Gil Birmingham as his patient partner and Ben Foster as the elder and more unpredictable brother. It is the dialogue that really makes the characters come alive though and the film is frequently laugh-out-loud funny with excellent repartee between Foster and Chris Pine (as the other brother) and some truly kooky supporting characters, even if a number of them are little more than stereotypes. Whatever the case, the best aspect of the film is how we are positioned to care for both Bridges and the two brothers. There are no villains in the film, give or take 'the bank', and while the film harps on a little too much about the evils of the bank, the lack of human villains make everyone in the film feel like the victim of unfortunate circumstance and chance - something that has earned the film comparisons to the movies of the Coen Brothers. This is a motion picture that deserves to be appreciated on its own terms though. Between the gorgeous cinematography, brooding music and witty lines, it is not an experience easily forgotten and one that leaves it up to the individual viewer to decide whether the ends justify the means."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 December 2016,8/10,"There's a real old-fashioned, rough-and-tumble aura about the opening scene of Hell or High Water, as two bank robbers break into two Texas Midlands banks wearing balaclavas and waving guns before fleeing the scene with dust filling the air behind their clapped-out banger. While the legendary outlaws of the West fled the scene of the crime on horseback and sported much more impressive facial hair, this modern-day, un-flashy heist carries the same rush of crime- fuelled adrenaline as watching the likes of Billy the Kid and Jesse James in countless genre movies of old. Yet while the picture certainly attempts to recapture the spirit of the Wild West mythos, its themes are very much rooted in 21st century sociological struggles.The two would-be thugs aren't after the cash for the glamour, but instead they are brothers desperately trying to raise the cash required to pay off the bank about to roll over on their deceased parents' farm. It turns out that the quiet, more thoughtful sibling Toby (Chris Pine) is the mastermind behind the series of robberies, which are made extra delicious by the fact that they are robbing the very bank they are looking to pay back. Ex-jailbird Tanner (Ben Foster) seems to go along with it just for the thrill-ride, and although he is sympathetic and dedicated to his brother's cause, he's going to carry out his work with a balls-to-the-wall attitude, as it seems he was simply born bad. The jobs are planned with expert precision; using a different vehicle every time and burying them afterwards, hitting the banks early, stealing only unmarked bills, and cleaning the money in the casino afterwards.But it isn't long until ageing Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) in on their tails. Speaking as though he has a mouth full to the brim with chewing tobacco, Marcus is an old-school cowboy who enjoys making fun of his half-Cherokee partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) and falling asleep beneath the stars with an almost- demolished eight-pack dangling from the grip. He is also the smartest guy in any room, although his easy-going demeanour means nobody seems to realise. After Tanner makes an improvised smash-and- grab while his brother sits oblivious in a diner across the way, Marcus goes and figures the whole thing out. His un-PC sense of humour combined with Bridges' natural screen presence means that Marcus is a real crowd-pleaser, and a nice counterbalance to the emotional weight of Toby and Tanner's desperation.I had a new level of respect for Pine after the film, as he is an actor who has found life difficult outside of the Star Trek franchise, but seems to have found a perfect fit in the gangly, stoic cowpoke. Toby may even garner the most sympathy as the father struggling to keep up with his child support as well as trying to rescue his childhood home. Yet director David Mackenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) work to keep their characters grey, and tell a more honest story of how people react in times of financial hardship. The great enemy here are the banks, eager to swallow up property by the handful as posters offering debt relief litter the highways. It's an intelligent film, and one of many in recent times to react angrily to a every increasing capitalist society. Yet it's also gritty and thrilling, and isn't afraid to indulge in a moment of bad-assery, because after all, isn't that what makes the West so endearing?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 November 2016,9/10,"Delivering a searing follow-up to his gut punch of a prison movie Starred Up, Scottish based director David Mackenzie has very quickly become a director of note with his Texas based heist drama (with thriller elements) Hell or High Water delivering one of the year's most memorable cinematic outings filled with ominous vibes, intense performances and against all the odds more wit than a standalone comedy.Using the Texan landscape at his disposal (that isn't actually Texas at all) as another character in the film (the dusty plains, debt helpline signs or near abandoned cities feel alive and vibrant), Mackenzie finds eye catching scenery and freedom in his direction away from his oft used British infused experiences and alongside Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's moodily pitched score and Giles Nuttgens camera work, Hell or High Water brings the relatively straightforward story of desperate brothers Tanner and Toby Howard to life in vivid fashion, which marks this film down as something more than it easily could've been.Held together by the chemistry between Chris Pine's good intentioned Toby and Ben Foster as his more criminally minded and loose cannon brother Tanner, Hell or High Water benefits greatly from the work of its two leads while the inclusion of Jeff Bridges bringing out his Rooster Cogburn character is but the cherry on top of an already enthralling picture.Bridges could play this role in his sleep and while his mumble riddle Texas drawl may irritate some, his an absolutely joy here as aging ranger Marcus Hamilton and his partnering with Gil Birmingham's native Indian ranger Alberto Parker offers up outstanding comradery and evidenced by the cinema patrons I saw this film with, a huge amount of heart and laughs that makes the film's final stretches that much more engaging as our characters inevitable clashes with each other offer fine payoffs to what has come before.Whilst not a heist film (the film merely has a few heists sprinkled throughout) as some may've wanted, Hell or High Water is both an effective drama of family bonds and a realistic thriller that will shock with its sporadic yet wince inducing violence and engage with its heartfelt and believable characters.Finely acted, impressively directed and smartly scripted by Sicario screenwriter Taylor Sheridan, Hell of High Water is one of the year's best and another great showcase for the increasing talents of David Mackenzie.4 ¬Ω gun wielding civilian vigilantes out of 5"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 April 2017,7/10,"Hell or High Water has received much praise from critics and from the Academy. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and at the time it was overlooked, but since being nominated for a few Oscars, it has picked up and is quite well known for movie fans. The acting from the leads are all well, as is the script and writing. There are few tense moments but the film never fully has much suspense which one had assumed. When thinking about it, it is quite simple with no turns or twists. It reminds of the Town, though in that film I find superior since the audience had more of a connection and care for it lead characters, and there was more of a buildup to the climax.This film is quite predictable with its ending, they could have went with another direction instead of the typical Hollywood fair but to some, it worked. Overall, Hell or High Water is an entertaining brainless action/crime heist film. Although not as amazing as it's been panned out to be."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 January 2017,5/10,"Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, after reading rave reviews but I must admit, I found it slightly boring because it takes some time for something to happen. Its about 2 brothers, Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine), who go around robbing banks, to try and save there families land, after there mother dies. Tanner is the ruthless brother, who has just been released from jail and has a dodgy past but Toby has a clean record, and has spent time looking after his mum before she died. Whilst going through a separation with his wife, Toby plans to leave his kids there land, which has oil beneath it, but they have to buy the land before the bank takes it away from them. Whilst going on a robbing rampage, Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges), makes it his goal to catch the thieves before he retires, with his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), who questions his methods. When Marcus finally works out there pattern, the rangers finally come face to face with the robbers but Toby manages to get away. With the case closed, and the blame fully on Tanner for the robberies, Marcus works out that he wasn't working alone but there isn't enough evidence to takedown Toby, who played a big part in the robberies. It's quite a basic plot, with no thrills or twists, so I was surprised that it went down so well with audiences. The cast played there roles extremely well, and the chemistry between the two brothers is very believable but it seemed very one toned in my eyes. There is some enjoyable wit, especially between Marcus and Alberto, which lightened up the intense mood but I still was expecting more from this western. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by David Mackenzie, 50, who also brought you The Last Wilderness, Young Adam, Asylum, Hallam Foe, Spread, Perfect Sense, You Instead and the great Starred Up starring Jack O'Connell. He certainly has covered many genres throughout his career, and he was a surprising choice to take on a western, because he is born in Scotland and his last film was a prison drama. He done a good job with the script, which was written by Taylor Sheridan who brought you Sicario, and he put together a great cast, who were perfect for there roles. At 67 years old, Jeff Bridges has proved, time and time again, that he still has it, and with a role in the upcoming Kingsman sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and another 4 projects in the pipeline, he certainly isn't planning to stop acting any time soon. Anyway, I can understand why people enjoyed it but I still preferred No Country For Old Men.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $27millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/western/dramas, starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Dale Dickey, Buck Taylor, William Sterchi, Kristin Berg, Jackamoe Buzzell. 5/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 September 2016,8/10,"The question of whether the ends justify the means boils down to this: if a goal is morally important enough, is any method of achieving it acceptable? Socrates said, ""It is never right to do wrong, and never right to take revenge; nor is it right to give evil, or in the case of one who has suffered some injury, to attempt to get even."" The question dominates Scottish director David Mackenzie's (""Starred Up"") Hell or High Water, a modern genre Western set in West Texas in which two brothers, the unemployed Toby (Chris Pine) and the ex-con Tanner Howard (Ben Foster), rob various branches of the Texas Midlands Bank in order to to meet overdue alimony payments to Toby's divorced wife Debbie (Marin Ireland). They also want to prevent foreclosure of their deceased mother's ranch by the same chain of banks. Toby also recognizes that the oil discovered on the property influenced the bank to sell their mother a mortgage she could not repay. He calculates that if he pays off the mortgage he can then put the property in the names of his two sons, Justin (John-Paul Howard) and Randy (Christopher W. Garcia), and guarantee them a better life than he and his brother have had. The film lets us know repeatedly that the banks are the villains.Sheriff Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), a burly, good-natured but cynical officer who is near retirement has been assigned to the case. He tells his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) when he spots the Bank Manager, ""That looks like a man who could foreclose on a house."" After Alberto, who is part Mexican and part Native-American, tells Hamilton how the American Indians were robbed of their property, he says ""Now, it's the banks who are doing the robbing."" Toby later explains that he robbed banks because he's been poor his whole life. ""It's like a disease passed on from one generation to the next,"" he says, then adds, ""But not my boys.""The film is location-specific and we don't have to ask where we are. Giles Nuttgen's cinematography assures us we are in the Southwest (the film was shot in New Mexico) with dusty landscapes, oil rigs, a burning sun, billboards wanting to know if you are ""In-Debt?"", and decaying towns filled with abandoned homes. Writer Taylor Sheridan, who wrote the screenplay for Sicario, offers clich√©d portraits of rough-hewn good ol' boy types who look like they would just as soon shoot you as say hello, a cantankerous waitress in the T-Bone Diner played by eight-eight-year-old Margaret Bowman who knows what you want to order even before you open your mouth, and a sheriff who playfully teases his partner with racial jokes, some funny, most not.The two brother bank robbers are very different. Tanner is a trigger-happy sociopath who has just been released from serving ten years in prison, while his brother, though looking as raunchy as his brother, is shown as being meek, thoughtful, and careful. Neither are very proficient bank robbers. One time they arrived at the bank not knowing it has been closed up, another time they get there before the manager even arrives with his keys to open the banks.After bigger banks are hit and Tanner kills two people, the inevitable chase scene takes place that leads to the desert, then to the mountains where some issues are resolved and others are not. Hell or High Water is a highly entertaining if not quite fully satisfying film that respects its characters enough to make them fully dimensional. It also has a rare social conscience. As far as whether or not the ends justify the means - you choose."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2016,9/10,"Awards season has truly begun now, Hell or High Water is about two brothers robbing small bank branches whist being pursued by two rangers across Texas. This film was not in my anticipated list at all, I was not even remotely excited to watch this when the first trailer came out...then the reviews came in. With such high ratings, I had to see what all the fuss was about and I can honestly say the high ratings are justified. Hell or High Water is so close to perfection, so close! What brings this film to those heights you ask? The acting. All three main actors in the film are perfect and to be honest all deserve nominations for at least¬†one award in any ceremony. Jeff Bridges? A Legend. Chris Pine? Finally getting a chance to show his acting chops. Ben Foster? Whoa now, completely transformed himself (2016 has not been a bad year for him). What helped them was the script which had me transfixed from the first section of dialogue, it had everything from witty humour and banter between the characters¬†to emotional tension between the brilliant brotherly bond (dare you to say that ten times in a row!) of Foster and Pine. The direction from David Mackenzie was solid and the cinematography was sublime with some really creative shots when following vehicles. Excellent wide shots to let the audience take in the Texan environment. I won't spoil the film, but there is a scene in the movie that is what I call an ""Oh My God!"" moment (a scene so shocking, I¬†literally mouth those words out), did not see it coming whatsoever and I don't think anyone else did, brilliantly executed. The score was also appropriate, with country vibes that suit the Texas locale.¬†I say it¬†is close to perfection, the only flaw I found was that the script allows the characters to have too many conversations that do not further the plot. Whilst this is good for character development, too much of it and it starts to slow the pace down. Overall, Hell or High Water is a near perfect crime/drama with powerhouse performances (particularly Ben Foster) and a sublime script, even if the dialogue is bit excessive at times.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 January 2017,8/10,"I was not sure what to expect from this crime/drama film but I certainly was looking forward to sitting down to watch just how good actors Ben Foster, Chris Pine and the venerable 66 year old Jeff Bridges would bring this story to life. I must say that they did not disappoint me. The film opened well with the two brothers Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) proceeding to target then rob a specific bank, The Texas Midlands bank branches. Very quickly we learn that Toby is the guy who planned the robberies and he is providing specific instructions to his older more trigger happy brother Tanner, on what they will steal. Specifically these two brothers did not want to engage in any robbery of the banks customers, nor were they going after the bank safe. Toby and Tanner's intentions were simply to rob The Texas Midlands bank branches that were located in smaller towns with less heavily secured personnel and/or without any security monitoring equipment. Their plan was to quickly take the loose cash from the bank clerk's tills and get the heck out of there.Eventually we learn why Toby (and older brother Tanner) are robbing only Texas Midlands bank branches and how much they intend to take them for before these two bank robbing brothers decide to stop. As the cash being stolen from these small town Texas Midlands banks is minimal the Federal authorities are leaving it to the local sheriff's department to meet with the bank managers and assess how to capture these two bank robbers who seem to be very cautious in how they select the banks they will eventually rob.The local sheriff is a guy named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is assisted by his deputy, a native American Indian named Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). There is a secondary story we are provided with which encompasses that Sheriff Hamilton is only weeks away from retirement and as such he takes great liberties in taking flagrant pot shots about his deputy's native American heritage. Although Sheriff Hamilton's jokes appear to be both racial and personal against Deputy Parker, they are merely to remind Deputy Parker of his boss and pal's imminent retirement. Are we to believe that as these two local law enforcement officers are hunting the two brothers who are robbing banks and their identities remain unknown that maybe Sheriff Hamilton may not live to see his retirement? Well I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but there certainly are questions that the audience is expecting answers to which keeps us very interested in the four main characters.I would not classify this film as a western as it is more of a crime/drama and specifically about two local Sheriffs attempting to figure out where these two unknown bank robbers will strike next. We learn that the older brother Tanner has that stereotype ""mommy and daddy never loved me"" mantra and this is why he is the more aggressor of the two brothers living without fear or consequences for the action taken.I liked the way the film evolved and the ending was credible. It is certainly a film I intend to watch a second and/or even a third time. It is a good story, with even better acting and a quality film for the crime drama genre. I give it an 8 out of 10 rating."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 August 2020,7/10,"Well acted story with some definite highlights throughout.
However the movie is completely stolen by the T=Bone Cafe waitress!!!
She should have been nominated best supporting actress :)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 December 2016,9/10,"Saw this on a rented DVD. Its a western crime drama. Director David Mackenzie (Starred up) did a terrific job. It is a very atmospheric, character driven film n not at all boring. Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) did a fantastic job with the screenplay. He managed to create good tension in a simple robbery film. The acting by the 3 lead is top notch. Jeff bridges, Ben Foster n Chris Pines got into the characters. Its a solidly crafted, well-acted western heist thriller. The film stuns with its cinematography. The sunburnt desolate Texas backdrop creates a very nice visual palette. The colours look great. The lime green Mustang really stands out as a result. The long landscapes shots were awesome. Some may compare it to No country for old men n A place beyond the pines. Check out the scene of the rattlesnake waitress."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 September 2016,10/10,"What defines a ""western""? Is it cowboys? Guns? Horses? Boots? Or is it its morals of American masculinity itself; a study of what does, and what should, make a man? No matter what the criteria, Hell or High Water fits. Sure, it's not the typical period piece fare we normally get from the genre, but it's a wonderfully old-fashioned yarn that would've been a hit in most bygone eras. Only an ""indie"" by the most basic description, its qualitative and crowd-pleasing reach much exceeds its financial grasp. Boasting funny, enthralling, and character-filled fun from start to finish, this unconventional cowboy chronicle is the movie we've wanted all year. It's the story of the bank-robbing Howard brothers (Pine, Foster) and the nearly-retired lawman (Bridges) who's hot on their tales. The script is perfect, from the dialogue to the plotting to the characters to the themes. The simplicity of its cat-and-mouse setup allows the thematic and ethical complexities to unravel as the story does, instead of forcing it through hackneyed exposition. Touching on topics like the dangers of nostalgia, flawed justice, colonialism, and western heroism, its thematic richness is only matched by its penetrating visuals. With anti-hero films filling the cinematic landscape nowadays, this is more a ""pro-human"" film. We find ourselves ""rooting"" for everyone, not because they're necessarily ""justified"", but because we know them. Director MacKenzie is a proved actors-director, and the performances here are utterly naturalistic and masterful. Along with a wonderful soundtrack and grimily stellar sets and costumes, it's an enveloping viewing experience you feel like you're living. As entertainingly cool as it is penetratingly artful, HoHW is far-and-away my favorite film of 2016."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 December 2016,9/10,"In a year when the quality of life in middle America small towns has come back into focus, ""Hell or High Water"" feels like an important film, perhaps more important than it might have been had it been released prior to 2016. But it's not just timeliness that makes this a good movie. There are strong performances and strong writing Taylor Sheridan, someone we should definitely be paying more attention.The ""Sicario"" writer returns with another tale set near the U.S.-Mexico border, this one following two poor West Texas brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, one an ex-con (Ben Foster) and the other a divorced father of two (Chris Pine), who start robbing banks for petty cash. Their objective is to make enough money to pay off the bank before it forecloses on their recently deceased mother's ranch, which she willed to her grandsons. The property also happens to be sitting on enough oil to guarantee the boys' future.With the stolen amounts too small to warrant attention from the FBI, a nearly retired Texas Ranger named Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), are assigned to track down the robbers and the cat-and-mouse game begins.The characters could be distilled to two outlaw anti-heroes and the ranger on their tail who is about to hang it all up, but Sheridan's script evolves beyond the archetypes and into complicated, ugly territory, which is exactly where he took 2015's ""Sicario."" Whereas most cops-and-robbers stories have clear good guys and bad guys, this one doesn't. Foster's Tanner is the wild one who can take things too far and lacks a moral compass, but he's fiercely loyal and devoted to his brother. Pine's Toby seems good through and through, but he has a violent streak and their whole illegal scheme is his idea. Even Bridges' smart, shiny-badged old ranger has a slightly bigoted attitude that often expresses itself to his half-Mexican, half-Native American partner.All this ""gray"" makes watching how ""Hell or High Water"" plays out all the more interesting. We find ourselves rooting for the brothers' success only to have Sheridan execute some jarring turns in the story. Suddenly the stakes get higher and more real, and director David Mackenzie wisely keeps his hands off it all, which actually adds to the shock factor. We never feel comfortable with the violence in the film because it never feels stylish and never becomes commonplace, and that makes the violence that does happen more effective.There's also a social commentary at play beneath the main thrust of the narrative, which is what really makes Sheridan's work stand out. Race crops up at various points, sometimes subtly and other times less so. At one point, Tanner has a confrontation with a Comanche man at a casino that seems to digress from the story a bit, but it serves the purpose of highlighting differences and animosity between people, and the pervasive ""otherness"" that causes so many rifts in our society.That's where the timely factor comes in. It's not just about how these brothers represent the millions of Americans whose small town way of life is going extinct and creating such desperation, it's about how we go after what we want at the expense of other people, and treat others like the enemy. These fears, these attitudes and this desperation is cancerous and, sadly, cyclical. That's more than you'd expect from a movie about bank robbers, to be sure.~Steven CThanks for reading!

HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 April 2020,7/10,"Hell or high water is a more modern day take on western genre but in a respectful way to a old west style and this film borrowed some of its charm from old movies of same type,like some people said trucks replaced horses in this film but still we got one scene that felt like some nice omage to westerns before,bridges was perhaps the most enterteining guy to watch but pine and foster were on completly different level from everyone else,expecely foster,pine was also very convincing in playing his part and his dynamic with older bro was great,hell or high water was a film that had some surprises in it,it also had some sad emotional ones,and in end i was satisfayed with film"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 April 2018,6/10,"""Hell or High Water"" has got a revenge theme suitable for these days, where banks keep the hard working class poor. Now the poor start robbing the banks to provide a financial future for their kids. Sort of a modern Robin Hood version, if you were to look at it in perspective. Robin Hood stories have been made before and better and with more humor. Probably Jeff Bridges is supposed to be the dude that provides the fun part, but he overdoes it. Can't take him too seriously as a character. I hate that when actors act too much like a stereotype. This movie could have been better. Now it is average to reasonably good. Not great, but certainly not bad either. That could be my whole review. Had it been the Coen Brothers then EVERYTHING from soundtrack to photography to acting would have been excellent. Had it been the Coen Brothers. Watch ""No Country for Old Men"" instead of this flick, you will be in for a real treat. But it aint the Coen Brothers who made this flick, it's director MacKenzie. Who's that you might ask? I wonder too. Thanks to MacKenzie I have watched just an average heist movie, which had much more going for it. Still it was satisfying to watch. But it nags a little, that it could have been much better and in the end I feel a little empty. Is that all? That's the problem with films that take themselves too seriously. You gotta deliver when you aim for something great and classic. They didnt deliver...It is a wannabe classic. Nothing is more frustrating than second place when you aim for first."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 August 2016,10/10,"""Hell or High Water"" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the story of two brothers, Toby and Tanner. As the movie opens, we see them rob two Texas Midlands Bank branches in rapid succession. It's only later that we learn why. After the second heist, the Texas Rangers are informed, and Marcus, who is going to retire in three weeks, wants to do one final case before going off into the sunset. At this point, we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Scottish director David Mackenzie, and here he brings to the big screen the outstanding script by former actor Taylor Sheridan, who blew us away last year with ""Sicario"", my No.1 movie of the year in 2015. Here the story focuses on the two brothers, one a divorced dad and the other just released after a 7 year prison stint. The brothers are played by Chris Pine (MILES away from the recent Star Trek Beyond) and Ben Foster. But the best performance comes from Jeff Bridges as good ol' Marcus, always short on breath and ""sitting on the porch, practicing my future"", when his partner asks him why he is sitting outside his hotel room. Bridges has gotten many acclaims over his career, and I don't know that this one tops them all, but it sure comes close. Add in the beautiful landscape of the southwest (New Mexico standing in for Western Texas), plus a gorgeous soundtrack fro Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and it all comes together like a perfect cocktail. I'm trying to think of any flaws in this movie, but I can't think of any, hence my rating of 5 stars (which I rarely give).The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and I bet you with outstanding word-of-mouth a guarantee, this movie will gain strength at the box office in the weeks to come. Pretty sure this will pick up a lot of attention come the awards season at the end of the year. ""Hell or High Water"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 September 2016,5/10,"Hell or High Water has garnered a magisterial 88 on Metacritic with just about every critic fawning over this tale of two West Texas bank robbers determined to save the family farm from the big bad bankers about to foreclose on their property. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's dilemma was how far should he go in humanizing his anti-heroes without ending up glorifying them. To my mind, he went a little too far. Perhaps there are shades here of Arthur Penn's sleek hagiography, Bonnie and Clyde, that placed two odious Depression era criminals on an undeserving pedestal.Director David Mackenzie along with Sheridan have set their tale of the two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), in a contemporary milieu. Tanner is the ""real"" criminal here, having spent significant time in the slammer, and is properly depicted as what the general public would probably refer to as ""scary."" Nonetheless, the film's scenarists are not averse to also depicting Tanner as somewhat noble, especially when he sacrifices himself during a high speed chase and subsequent shootout with the police, in order to save his brother.Toby, on the other hand, has no criminal record, but allegedly has an excuse for planning the bank robberies and joining his brother in these nefarious acts, which culminate in the death of a bank guard and armed citizen, during the last holdup. It seems that the Texas Midlands bank won't give Toby a break and is about to foreclose on his farm, which is now worth a lot more since oil has been found on the property. Good guy Toby wants to leave the farm to his children since he has known nothing but poverty growing up.The twist here is the way in which Toby plans his robberies. The brothers only steal cash from the cashier's drawers, avoiding exploding dye packs and serial numbers which can be traced. The getaway vehicles are buried at the farm and the cash is laundered at an Indian casino, exchanged first for poker chips and then re-cashed for new currency.If there's any doubt that the film's scenarists have unjustifiably turned Toby into a ""noble savage"" of sorts, his underlying brute nature is highlighted in a fight against a miscreant at a gas station. But note that Toby (unlike Tanner who shoots innocent people), only fights creeps who deserve a good whipping. There is a sub-plot here which involves the Texas Rangers who are chasing the so-called bad guys. Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, partnered with Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), his half Mexican, Native-American deputy. Most of their interactions consist of Marcus making bigoted jokes at Alberto's expense but his easy-going partner plays along since he knows that his boss is really a good guy at heart. Sympathy for the bad guys becomes more apparent when a waitress at a diner rebuffs the lawmen, refusing to allow them to examine the large cash tip Toby left for her minutes before making his exit.Marcus and Alberto really don't have much to do until the end of Act 2 where Tanner flees on foot on top of a mountainside, where he engages in a gunfight with the Rangers. Tanner shoots Alberto dead and Marcus in turns finishes off Tanner. Only some of the earlier bank robbery scenes rival the climactic scene with Tanner in terms of gripping action. The rest of Hell or High Water primarily consists of a series of moderately interesting but lugubrious conversations, highlighting the anti-capitalist themes.The denouement features one further disappointing conversation where Marcus seeks to uncover Toby's motivations for getting involved in criminal activities. Since we've already found out what was motivating Toby, his explanation to Marcus is rather anti-climactic. Despite Toby's harsh circumstances growing up, nothing seems to justify his decision to rob the banks where innocent people are killed. But if you listen to Mackenzie and Sheridan, Toby gets a free pass and is now permitted to deed the family farm to his children, far clear from the bar of justice. Hell or High Water is highly atmospheric, featuring good performances from all involved, but the overarching moral stance leaves much to be desired."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 November 2016,7/10,"'Hell or High Water' reminded me a lot of 'No Country for Old Men'. I remember enjoying that film (mainly because of the character of 'Anton'), yet being baffled at how it could win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. 'Hell or High Water' has a very high rating currently on IMDb of 8.1, and I'm not entirely sure it's justified. Unquestionably it's a very well made film. The dialogue is exquisite throughout, the acting is superb and the direction is top-notch. But is the story strong enough would be my question. There are films out there that put an immense amount of time and effort into the complexity and thoughtfulness of their story line, and seemingly get no recognition for it. Then other films put almost no effort in and it gets completely overlooked. As mentioned though, it is a very well made film. Even though the story is slow and often quite simple, it somehow manages to remain interesting - mainly through great Texas-style dialogue. There's something Quentin Tarantino like about it, not in the dialogue style itself, but in the way that nothing can be happening, yet we are still enthralled just listening to what is being said. I went in with very high hopes for 'Hell or High Water' though, and sadly I would have to say it was a let down overall."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 August 2016,9/10,"Look at Chris Pine trying to prove he's not just a pretty face doing these small films that show his range, and show how he can do accents, but seriously, Pine was totally in his element here.Jeff bridges gave a great performance that matches his cowboy ethics in True Grit, playing a very old school Texas Ranger hunting down Pine and Ben Foster who play brothers robbing banks. A little in the Archie Bunker Territory when dealing with his Mexican, Native American partner, but all the way likable.Ben Foster was fantastic as well,as the bad apple big brother looking for redemption. Very dynamic acting, by all three main actors.The music really adds to the cool western feel, putting me in the cowboy mode. I thought it was interesting that they had one scene in the movie in which real life cowboys herding cattle appear, in a movie about the movie style cowboys, and it's some real cowboy stuff going on here.It's very macho without turning off the indi crowd that would love this film. There's a scene in the movie when Jeff Daniels Character confronts one of the bank robbers and it was like Eastwood and Wayne back in the day, man. It just wraps up the whole vibe of the movie in one swoop. I feel like it's the type of movie everyone in Texas should love.And it's very Texas (or rather what I expect from Texas): every dinner only sells streak, It's hard to be a armed bank robber because at least two people in the bank carry a gun. The film does use Texas as a perfect pocket for all American life with the bank robbers having a bigger agenda to save the land they own and secure a future for their family, screwing over the bank that's screwing them.It has the same appeal of the Timber when it comes to today's Westerns, but it's setting in contemporary times but with that old fashion tone gives it an edge.http://cinemagardens.com/"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 November 2016,9/10,"Holy S***, this is the best under publicized film of the year. Ben Foster is a felon out of jail who helps his straight laced brother, Star Trek's Chris Pine, out of a bad financial situation. The two travel throughout west Texas robbing banks in order to raise the money to avoid foreclosure by the very same institutions owning the title to their property. Here comes the law in the form of Jeff Bridges, as a grizzled, wise cracking sheriff on the verge of retirement. This will be his final investigation, hot on the trail of the brotherly outlaws. He is accompanied by a young insult proof Mexican-Native American partner, who absorbs horrible racist comments from his old redneck boss. The script is precise, with several memorable scenes with a superb cast from beginning to end. The soundtrack is perfect and Hell or High Water is one of my top five movies of 2016."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 January 2017,6/10,"Hell or High Water is a classic example of a movie that was made to please the masses. It's well done, well-acted, with performers who are perhaps superior to the unchallenging material they're doing.It's the standard thing about a pair of good ol' boy bank robbers, brothers, the older one (Ben Foster, who specialises in crazy) a jailbird who's either heading back there or heading to his grave, and the younger one, (Chris Pine, the story's hero) someone who we are supposed to believe was pushed into a life of crime due to unfortunate circumstance. He's the ""hero"", though I wondered more than once about the people whose money he and his crazy brother were stealing, and how they'd feel about such a person.The movie's other main character is just as familiar as the good younger brother, crazy older one dynamic. It's the ageing lawman, someone who is unrealistically forgiving of the crimes he is attempting to stop, just as the filmmakers expect you to be, and is played by Jeff Bridges as if his mouth is filled with cotton. The unspoken ""enemy"" in this story is the banks; the robbers and lawmen both seem to think they deserve it. They're not really on opposite sides of the law, here. It is assumed that the money the brothers are taking belongs to the rich, unfeeling and exploitative banks themselves. But is that really the case? What about all the hardworking people who have accounts there? The brothers are perhaps more likely to be stealing their life savings.This movie glorifies bank robbing, turning the robbers into heroes, but not convincingly. There is also the matter of the Bridges character and his casual racism toward his mestizo partner. Was that really necessary?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 January 2019,,"In the heart of West Texas, two hell-bent brothers (impulsive, volatile Foster and pragmatic, single-minded Pine) resort to robbing banks in a last-ditch effort to collect the funds needed to advance their personal goal, but their actions eventually attract the attention of Bridges, a savvy, seasoned Texas Ranger on the verge of retirement. Gripping, atmospheric crime thriller moves at a deliberately slow pace, but benefits from a riveting story, compelling characters, crisp dialogue, gritty action scenes, and striking cinematography on its way to a powerful climax. Bridges is well-cast, though it's hard not to see occasional shades of Rooster Cogburn, while Pine and Foster are perfectly matched as discordant siblings. ***"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 August 2016,7/10,"I saw ""Hell or High Water"", starring Jeff Bridges-Seventh Son, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot; Chris Pine-The Finest Hours, Blind Date, and FYI: He is playing Steve Trevor in the 2017 Wonder Woman; Ben Foster- Warcraft, The Finest Hours; Katy Mixon-Mike & Molly_tv, Blind Date and Gil Birmingham-The Lone Ranger_2013, The Twilight movies.This is a modern day western. It's about 2 good old boys, Chris & Ben, robbing banks and being chased by the Texas Rangers, Jeff & Gil. Of course the good old boys have a good reason for stealing the money; It's a recession and the Midland Banks are foreclosing on their home & land. Chris comes up with a plan to steal the money he needs for his mortgage from the bank that is trying to take his property and then use the money to pay off his debt-he does launder the money in a casino first. Ben has just gotten out of prison and is a little more energetic about robbing the banks than his little brother, Chris. Chris doesn't want to hurt anyone but Ben likes the excitement and doesn't care who gets hurt. Katy plays a waitress that lucks out when she happens to wait on the boys. Jeff is the lead investigator and just about ready to retire when the boys start their shenanigans. Gil is Jeff's partner that he loves to insult. There is a lot of humor in the movie-wait to you see the waitress at the T-Bone Cafe that waits on Jeff & Gil. If I had one complaint, it would be the music. Most people will probably enjoy it but country music is not one of my pleasures. During the credits I remember seeing songs by Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wiley Hubbard and Chris Stappleton and forgive me if I misspelled any of their names because...Well, I did mention that I am not a country fan. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 December 2016,9/10,"Come pun hell (which is about what you are going to get) or high water, I have to write a positive review of Director David MacKenzie's Texas bank robbery flick ""Hell or High Water"". The film stars Chris Pine and Ben Foster as Toby and Tanner Howard (respectively). Toby is in a steep of financial problems so he asks his criminal bank robber brother Tanner to assist him in numerous low-cash bank heists in Texas. Jeff Bridges co-stars as the about-to-retire Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, he is about as grumpy & racist as they come; but just wants to get the job done by going after the Howards. Gil Birmingham also co-stars as Alberto Parker, the mixed Mexican/Indian partner of Hamilton who becomes the butt of the many Hamilton racist remarks. MacKenzie did not cease fire and took it to the bank by orchestrating a very engaging movie that is ""Hell or High Water"". Tyler Sheridan's no-nonsense script was a hell of a good scribe time. There just might be a place beyond the Chris Pine that pins him to many other upcoming credible performances with his work here as Toby. Ben Foster has not been this good since his supporting villain role in ""3:10 to Yuma"". Jeff Bridges is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination with his scene- stealing performance as Ranger Marcus. And Birmingham is a name to be reckoned with, with some impressive work here as Ranger Alberto. ""Hell or High Water"" does go a bit deep into the current economic state with southern banks, and that works quite well in this Hell. So go out or stay in tonight in a blaze of glory, and check out ""Hell or High Water"" come hell or high water. ***** Excellent"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 March 2017,6/10,"Hell or High Water is a moody cops and robbers film that follows uneasy parallel pairing of brothers ( one through blood, the other in arms) where the characters are more symbolic than human. It is a virtual poor me testament by nearly every player in the film as they gross on about life in boom or bust West Texas, the banks (Midland in particular) being the evil monolith and their cause for woe.With the bank about to foreclose on late ma's old homestead that just happens to be sitting on oil brothers Tanner and Toby decide to pull some bank jobs to pay off the mortgage. When one bank offers slim pickings the boys move onto another. Veteran Texas Rangers Hamilton and Parker are assigned the case and set out across the dusty landscape where they encounter more resentment than respect from locals while trading insults with each other. Toby and Tanner meanwhile seek out one more payoff to save the ranch.Stuck knee deep in cynicism and self pity Hell or High Water's cast from leading to supporting center on mistrust and betrayal as they launch from major to minor tirade between heists. Taylor Sheridan's script is perhaps too ambitious as his characters drone on about faceless thieving bankers, ageism, subtle bigotry, triggering, genocide and white privilege without creating anyone of much depth since they are too busy playing victims. It is little wonder psycho like Tanner is the lynch pin to any of the energy present in the film since every one else is in a victim funk.With the stilted dialogue spouting one declaration after another there is little room for the actors to stretch but Jeff Bridges does register as the aging ranger that time has passed by. Ben Foster's Tanner does the requisite unhinged role adequately while Dale Dickey and Margaret Bowman make the most of their time in a couple of scenes.David McKenzie's direction plods most of the way as he surveys a vanishing America when he should be developing character. Opening the film with a well shot and edited bank job he manages to even inject some graffiti editorializing within it and he never lets up cutting between the brothers posing and moaning about life's inequities as if on the cover of a John Mellancamp album while Hamilton needles Parker about his Comanche heritage during a languid stakeout in the wrong town. By putting far too much emphasis on the external forces that drive them McKenzie sacrifices character in favor of this fall back to explain their actions which remain remote at best."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 July 2017,8/10,"(Flash Review)With the risk of losing their deceased mother's farm and land to the bank, where oil was discovered, two brother hold up tiny banks in towns so small they lack traffic lights in order to pay off the mortgage. This film has smart, honest and entertaining dialog that really helps move the story along. Great acting all around complimented by cinematography that accentuates the desolateness of their habitat gives the film a great atmosphere. It has many similarities to No Country For Old Men and the cat and mouse nature. This is simply a well-told good film; nothing groundbreaking but solid. Jeff Bridges is great."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 January 2020,8/10,Excellent film that does a great job executing a recycled story line. This is almost like watching a western that takes place in 2016.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 December 2016,,"Hell Or Highwater is an acrid, mournful little tumbleweed lullaby sung at the American southwest, a tale of hard times and desperate men infused with the laconic nature of the area and given the spare yet hard hitting writing skills of Taylor Sheridan, who also penned the equally bleak Sicario. I wasn't quite sure what time period he was going for here until Jeff Bridges's salty Texas Ranger brandishes a smartphone, signifying the present. I imagined an 80's throwback, but I suppose the vacuous dereliction hanging about the rural West has only gathered with time, in a place where time has curiously seemed to halt dead in a financial sinkhole where not much of anything in the way of hard earned success can flourish. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers and partners in crime, in the thick of a statewide bank robbing spree which gets progressively more dangerous, all to save a piece of property from the big banks threatening to foreclose. They're not evil men, they're not even bad men because Sheridan's script doesn't allow such stark delineation. They are men forced to make decisions, just like any other, yet in times like these one's decisions are often of an extreme nature, out of self preservation or desire to protect one's family. Pine is the introverted one, and the actor disappears into the role with ease and scruffy calm that contrasts his usual golden boy charm. Foster is the live wire, a man who functions on mostly instinct alone, lives in the moment and reacts like an animal from situation to situation. Quite the actor he is, and hasn't been let completely off the chain since 2004's Hostage. Here he fills the screen with intensity and much needed humour. The two have love for each other that occasionally peeks through the cloud of trouble they're flying in, the film adamant in showing us their damaged humanity through the desperation of their actions. Bridges is crusty and jaded, the badge and gun serving as his only family other than the uneasy camaraderie he has with his younger partner (Gil Birmingham), a man he berates solely because he seems incapable of proper human interaction, no doubt a result of decades on the job, wandering through the desolation of the desert hunting men who have broken their lives and wishing he ever had one of his own to begin with. There's an emptiness to this tale, a lonely ambiance punctuated by many a beautiful song from both Nick Cave, T Bone Burnett and more, whose downbeat lyrics only pile on the mood thicker. The film wants to examine the need to go to extreme measures in times of strife, but holds us in our seat long after the deed is done to show us the ramifications, both negative and positive, of such actions. The result isn't pretty, but it's damn well beautiful and one of the best films I've seen so far this year."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 August 2021,10/10,"The mood is set very quickly, and it feels very different from the average crime drama. While lead character Tanner demonstrates a decidedly boisterous attitude, and moments of violence dot the runtime, otherwise the film is awash in depression, desperation, desolation, destitution, and dog-tired dejection. Between atmosphere, content, and setting, this unquestionably fits in the western genre after a fashion, yet 'Hell or high water' is most definitely a feature all its own.Morose Texas rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) are hardly die-hard go-getters. The sheer exhaustion they exude is punctuated and emphasized by the sardonic, racist barbs they playfully toss at one another. Brother bank robbers Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine) butt heads even as they work together, and despite Tanner's more hard- and hot-headed attitude, I've never seen Foster or Pine in roles this subdued and dispirited. Every chord in the dour score composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, every character written into Taylor Sheridan's screenplay, every performance from the large supporting cast, and every shot captured in director David Mackenzie's eye echoes the same dire atmosphere. And every passing moment is absolutely brilliant and captivating.Within the first 10-20 minutes we're left to wonder how the narrative could possibly be drawn out over 100 minutes. The answer to that rhetorical question is that the filmmakers spread out the ambience of overwhelming existential despair to fill every corner of the feature. Pervasive themes of loss, capitalist greed, pillaging of resources, and more spill across every square meter of the gorgeous yet bleak open sky landscapes we see throughout the picture.Yet for as undeniably grim as it all may be, 'Hell or high water' is executed with unyielding dexterity and skill from every single person involved. That includes characters and actors in even the smallest of roles, appearing in only one or two scenes: Amber Midthunder as a a hapless bank teller; Melanie Papalia as a sex worker; Heidi Sulzman as another Texas Ranger; Marin Ireland as Toby's ex-wife Debbie. That includes every element of the production: hair, makeup, stunts, effects, wardrobe, location scouting, set design and decoration, cinematography.I somehow totally missed out on this when it was first released in theaters, and that was a mistake I'm ecstatic to have corrected. I entered with no particular expectations, and have been blown away in every regard. This is a truly phenomenal film, and it deserves to be seen by the widest of audiences.Well done. So very, very well done. Highest possible recommendation!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 February 2020,8/10,"Once upon a time, I thought I didn't care for westerns but recent films like this are making me change my mind on that. Hell or High Water is absolutely a modern western and the tension, the intensity that this film generates is exceptional. Any time I'm watching a movie and feel like I'm holding my breath waiting for something to happen, that's a win to me and this definitely achieved that. Extra special is the way it takes the time to steep and breath in moments. This movie is in no rush to get where it's going and I appreciate that.This is one I absolutely want to revisit in the near future because I unfortunately wasn't able to give it my full attention but despitethat it was still a solid experience."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 September 2016,10/10,"What a fine entry this is. Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster head a cast that brings to life a story of hope, losing hope, facing death, and survival. A cop is about to retire, and he has no idea he might be involved in a case which will haunt him forever.Toby and Tanner are two brothers who had a rough life and not the best experiences with their closest relatives because of Tanner's repeated problems with the law and health complications that put the family's ranch in danger of being foreclosed. Toby realizes he has to do something drastic or his legacy to his sons. The two brothers devise a scheme to come up with the money to save their mother's home.We follow the brothers as they engage in several bank robberies which puzzle the local authorities because they are relatively minor. However, matters become complicated, and people die in one of the incidents. Soon, events reach their climax, and the resolutions leaves many a scarred soul.What makes the film touching is that it explores the emotional crisis the main characters have to endure. Their feelings are bruised, relationships are strained, and soon everyone involved realizes life is complicated, and life is full of surprises.In the end, one is left with unforgettable memories of a world that has gone upside down, showing the desperation left behind by economic downturns, progress, and the inability of many to adapt or let others do so. ""Hell and High Water"" is an important reflection of the times, with a personal face that we can relate to."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 December 2016,8/10,"Such a solid film and yet it was almost derailed by what's his name's performance, the guy who plays Captain Kirk in the newer Star Trek films. But let us talk about the good things, the story. It is more relevant today and hits a major nerve with what is going on in America. Basically, the film is about a few brothers who are robbing banks in order to pay off a loan to the bank so they can save their childhood home or whatever. The action isn't anything crazy however whoever directed this amplified the action simply by adding just the right amounts of tension and grit. Anyway, this film could have been a classic for the ages if Chris Pine didn't stink up the screen with is lame acting stills. I mean Chris Pine is good in mindless action flicks or anything that does not require major acting chops but in a film like this, his handicap is more than noticeable. Regardless, all the actors around Pine brought their A-game and more than made up for it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 September 2016,9/10,"I had absolutely no intention of going to see Hell or high water . My plan was to see Ben-Hur but at the very last minute after seeing the poster for this at the cinema I changed my mind and I'm so glad I did. This is the story of two brothers who commit a string of bank robberies in order to raise the money needed to protect their family farm from being taken , ironically from the banks they rob , while all the time , an ageing sheriff tracks the heists in an attempt to hunt down those responsible. This film is a modern day western and a brilliant one at that. Chris pine and Ben Foster are superb as the two brothers. Pine's character is the semi responsible one while Foster is the nut job but not for the first time , the actor who steals the show is Jeff Bridges. He is fantastic as the nearly retired sheriff. There is so much that is good about this film . The sound track is perfect , the cinematography makes a baron Texas look almost inviting and the script is first class. In a year when we have been bombarded with substandard super hero movies this is an absolute treat and it's one , if not the best film I have seen in 2016. Highly Recommended."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 November 2016,8/10,"Like classic film noir captured the intersection of the night time in the city, Hell or High Water captures a latter day stark wasteland of the Texas desert with a nothing to lose last ditch stab at escaping generations of poverty. As the clich√© goes: there will be blood.Writer Taylor Sheridan, with the masterful direction of David MacKenzie, has woven a brilliant tale joining western and crime film elements. Two brothers who have taken different life paths are joined together by their mother's passing and the imminent foreclosing of the only thing their family ever had. With little to lose the ""good"" brother joins his older dark sibling in order to secure a different future for his offspring. With a simple modus operandi the two brothers might actually pull it off. But there's a determined Texas Ranger who on the eve of his retirement catches the case. This will change things for the brothers.Besides the stark atmosphere brought to celluloid ,there is also a synergistic casting. It propels the story which always keeps the viewer rapt and on edge throughout. In simple terms a great movie that is equal parts crime drama and western."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 June 2017,6/10,"Part road movie part crime drama, Hell or Highwater is a good portrait of the same corner of America as No Country for Old Men. It has intelligent statements to make about people on the losing side of the relationship between housing and the banks, and there are scenes of well written dialog throughout.And yet the picture as a whole feels strangely underwhelming. The atmosphere is rather bland, with little sense of conflict, tension or human drama and the characters are rather one dimensional. They are merely representations of the themes of the story. Their motives are clear but never feel personalized. Jeff Bridges plays the same weary coming-of-age law man that Tommy Lee Jones depicts in No Country for Old Men, but without the heart or the wisdom.The best scene in the is the last one, where Bridges confronts one of the men that he's been chasing all movie. There is a deeper dramatic undercurrent in their exchange that is missing from the rest of the movie. Without the gripping performances or much in the way of visual style, Hell or High Water is no more memorable than a low budget television movie. This is a case of good premise, weak execution."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 August 2016,9/10,"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A very good but familiar crime film that boasts some great  acting.  GRADE: A-  SYNOPSIS: In order to save the farm, two brother run afoul of the law  JIM'S REVIEW: The anti-hero, a staple of the 70's culture wars, is back  with a vengeance in David Mackenzie's modern-day crime drama, Hell or  High Water. Its tale, of two brothers who break the law in order to  survive poverty and foreclosure, reeks of the anger and frustration  facing the middle class families across America today.  Tanner (Chris Pine), son of the recently deceased Mrs. Howard, cooks up  an illegal scheme to fight the banks from taking the family's land.  (You see, there's Texas gold in them hills). Bringing aboard Toby (Ben  Foster) his hot-headed ex-con brother, the two siblings rob from the  rich (the banks) and give to the poor (themselves). As these outlaws  commit more and more robberies and start to acquire a real nest age to  help pay off their mortgage and living expenses, the odds of  diminishing returns becomes more and more evident. It's 60 / 39 %  against these modern day Bonnie and Clyde wannabes' success rate,  especially with a wise ole sage of a sheriff, Marcus (Jeff Bridges),  and a ""mixed breed"" partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), tracking down  this robbing band of brothers. (I excluded those powerful 1% fat cats  into the equation.) After all, the family that steals together deals  together...and deal they must with the consequences of breaking the  law. One knows, amid the gunfire and violence, that the cost of living  in the fast lane is past due.  English director David Mackenzie effectively captures the desperation  of America's poor with his stark images of a Texas wasteland. Large  billboards about mortgages and loans dot the dry rural landscapes,  nicely filmed by Giles Nuttgens. Mr. Mackenzie's film is a poetic mood  piece with intricate plotting and a narrative structure that keeps one  riveted to the characters and their actions. He also casts his film  with actors that are perfectly suited to their roles from the wonderful  lead actors already mentioned down to the smaller roles of waitresses  and tellers. (Katy Mixon, Margaret Bowman, and Dale Dickey are  standouts.)  Taylor Sheridan has created fully drawn characters and his dialog is  concise and insightful. Their conversations are totally natural and  bring a gritty realism to the story. Yes, the plot is predictable, the  set-up contrived, and the film is a tad too leisurely told from the  outset. But the haunting images and true-to-life characters are  heartfelt and linger long after the film ends thanks to a terrific  script, taut direction, and some of the best acting one will see all  year.  The quartet of lead actors are wonderful. Jeff Bridges is custom-fitted  for this role. His grizzly worn-out Texas Ranger is no stranger to this  actor's repertoire, but he wisely downplays the outlandish nature of  this country trooper and makes him human and believable. Both the  character and the actor blend so effortlessly. His consummate acting  prowess throughout the film is remarkable. Chris Pine, downplays his  good looks and shows a troubled loner, out-of- touch with life but  barely hanging on to his humanity. It is one of his best performances  in an impressive list of film roles that the actor continues to add to  his resume. Ben Foster excels as his deranged brother who loves the  dark side as much as he loves his sensitive brother. He makes his  character resonate with a flair for danger that attracts and repels  simultaneously. As Marcus' partner, Gil Birmingham brings a droll sense  of humor and fondness to his sidekick role.  The film builds to its tragic conclusion...what else could there be!  Hell or High Water is an excellent crime film that makes the ordinary  extraordinary. It is well worth a visit."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 October 2016,8/10,"The best thing in this movie - and there are lots of good things - is the cinematography. It is meant to present West Texas and Oklahoma - in fact, the credits said it was filmed in New Mexico - as a very poor and desolate part of the U.S. Yet the cameraperson filmed this movie like a painter, framing the shots carefully - and perhaps choosing special lenses to bring out the colors of the desolate countryside; that's just a guess on my part - in ways to make it intriguing just to look at.But it was also very worth listening to. I didn't care for Jeff Bridges' character; it was written too much like a stereotype. But he certainly did what could be done with the role to invest some humanity in the part.The same is true of the other actors and actresses. The dialogue they are given is sometimes caricatural or otherwise undeveloped, but these actors do a good job of putting humanity into what could be comic book characters.The action moves fairly slowly, but at an appropriate pace that never once had me looking at my watch. I was thoroughly involved in the characters, even though I didn't particularly like any of them, and that is a high compliment.I'm in France at the moment. In the States, I don't know if I would have bothered to go to a theater to see this movie. That would definitely have been my loss, because this is a movie that benefits from being seen on a big screen.It reminded me that Westerns - and this is a Western of sorts - are often among the best made of American movies."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 September 2016,7/10,"""Only as*holes drink Mr. Pibb"". So states the trouper of Tanner Howard (Ben Foster), an ex-con who just got out of the joint. He's a trigger- happy wild man in 2016's Hell or High Water (my latest review).Quote: ""The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance their Endless Summer. Whoa!"" Oops, wrong movie, wrong quote. ""High Water"" is about two brothers from Texas. They instead rob a series of banks that are trying to foreclose on their family ranch. You see their mom died leaving said ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage. Time for these boys to saddle up, switch cars from village to village, steal regular amounts from the teller drawers, and pay everything off secretively.Hell or High Water is familiar stuff. Heck, if you've seen Public Enemies, Bandits, Point Break, or even 1986's Wisdom, you know what you're getting into. Oh well. Director David Mackenzie (Spread, Starred Up) does an admirable job to boot. He creates a world in which ""High Water"" feels like the type of flick the Coen brothers would have made years ago. It's bullets and blood undercut with a little darkness, a little tongue in cheek humor, and shades of a modern-day Western. It has big name stars and another star in the canvasing cinematography by Giles Nuttgens. His camera-work showcasing the Great Plains, gives you the viewer something to stew over. The ""Big Empty"" becomes the ""big zesty"". The Lone Star State dons its ski masks, its cowboy hats, its desolate abodes, and its sizzling sirloins. Ha!Anyway, the two actors playing the Howard brothers are Chris Pine (Toby Howard) and Ben Foster (Tanner as mentioned earlier). The Texas Ranger in hot pursuit of them, is played by the veritable Jeff Bridges (Marcus Hamilton). They all immerse themselves in these roles to the point where you forget that it's actually the same guys. ""High Water"" plays out like a cat and mouse game between everybody with almost no interaction via the gun-toting robbers and their prognostic, old timer cop. Foster and Bridges could easily play these characters in their sleep. Pine however, really comes into his own just like he did in January's The Finest Hours.In conclusion, Hell or High Water is a nifty little genre piece, a film that feels almost too perfect for its own good. Its score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is at times haunting and the ending is a non-violent standoff with overly preachy dialogue. Also, the opening shot by Mackenzie is panned to perfection and the shootout scenes are loud and panting. With ""High Water's"" late August release and commonplace approach, I unfortunately have to give it a fifty/fifty chance at Academy Award consideration. ""High Water"" as a flick doesn't feel dated but it also doesn't quite meets its ""Waterloo"" either. Again it's a little too familiar but entertaining in a blithe sort of way. Rating: 3 stars."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 February 2019,6/10,"The rough Texas cowboy style, the rough plot, the rhythm of the big fruit."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 August 2016,10/10,"Surprisingly funny crime drama about a pair of brothers who commit a series of bank robberies, of only a few thousands of dollars each time (to keep it under the feds' radar) to get their family ranch out of foreclosure, with Jeff Bridges (looking like a latter day Nick Nolte) the local cop whose job it is to solve the crimes. Beautifully filmed in the vast, open spaces of New Mexico, it gives a good look at small town life, and makes a bit of a statement about the lengths some will go for money, and what they need the money for (and not just the two lead characters) Story also has a lot of intentional humour, which caught me by surprise, and top notch acting all throughout. Marred only by a bit of unexpectedly violent changes in tone in the climactic scenes."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 August 2016,9/10,"The people that populate the world of Hell or High Water seem to stand at attention and out of time. They sit at the corner booth of their favorite diner sporting white gallon hats and speed through one horse towns on the way to the only profitable business; the local liquor store. It's a solemn austere existence; one reminiscent of Sam the Lion's in The Last Picture Show (1971). Yet there is no false hope to be had here. The ghosts of the past are long gone. The only thing left amid the boarded up downtowns and clearing fires is the possibility of bequeathal.That is the basic idea brothers Toby (Pine) and Tanner Howard (Foster) have when they first don their ski masks and head for the nearest Midland Bank. Their scheme is remarkable in its simplicity; steal only from the cashier drawers, $20's, $50's, loose change; whatever they collect, they launder through the nearby Comanche Reservation Casino. The ultimate goal is to save their family farm. Seems ever since oil has been discovered on their turf, the bank has been just itching to foreclose and with the death of their mother, the second mortgage has become unsurmountable.Much of the film was shot in and around the panhandle plains of west Texas. The camera's fixation on big sky and barren grazing land appeals to our inner-cowpoke. Yet Hell or High Water is closer in spirit to Hud (1963) or Lonely Are the Brave (1962) than the high stake and higher implausibilities of The Searchers (1956). The stark small town blight litters the plains like pools of runoff and while the people talk the Big Jake talk, they mostly come across like the townsfolk of Cold Turkey (1971).Even Toby seems inclined to cut and run at the first sign of trouble. Every tension building chance of capture brings with it the possibility that Toby may just loose his cool, just may catch himself in a lie, just may fold. Yet something keeps him there, shotgun loaded, robbing banks with his older brother. Call it a moral imperative, his family is on their last legs financially and he has two sons to support, but in a sense he's also keeping the spirit of Texas alive by acting like Billy the Kid.Yet every Billy the Kid must have a Pat Garrett and for that we have the ambulant and ever jaded Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Bridges). Set to retire wrapped around a leather Barcalounger, Hamilton jumps at a chance to hunt ""them two boys down,"" going so far as to stake out a bank they're fated to hit. Jeff Bridges brings all the gravitas an actor of his caliber does to this remarkably modest film. He brings unexpected mirth to Hamilton whose shrewd investigations and causal bigotry have a ring of west Texas authenticity and twangy cheer.If ever there was an actor best suited for this film however it's Ben Foster as the older, more criminal minded Tanner. He blissfully antagonizes everyone he meets, fancying himself a Comanche: lord of the plains and enemy to all. The only person he shows love for is his brother which proves his most enigmatic quality. Living his life in and out of prison can harden a man, even to the embrace of long suffering family. Yet when asked ""why did you agree to do this with me then?"" Tanner responds ""Because you asked me to little brother,"" without skipping a beat.Hell or High Water is a modest, under-the-radar crime drama told confidently and brilliantly by director David Mackenzie. It is at once a composite of Robin Hood crime drama and elegy westerns and an example of seamless top-to-bottom storytelling. While Hell or High Water comes from well-worn traditions, it is exceedingly rare to see a film of this caliber. Like the people who populate the film, it simply stands out of time."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 February 2017,9/10,"""Hell or High Water"" may have revitalised the Western genre, but it also revitalised the buddy movie. The bond between the two sets of men, one each on either side of the law, drives the movie.There is a touch of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" about Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster). Being brothers meant there was already a close bond, but they are also friends and hang out together. However they have a dangerous edge and rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their family ranch.The two lawmen who come after them, Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham), are buddies too; two aging Rangers with Marcus about to retire. Despite plenty of bantering insults, you know these guys are tight. Their banter reveals insights into their characters.The film has a feel. As much as it is modern twist on the Western, the way the brothers hit the banks and then hit the back roads is reminiscent of the depression era bank robbers: Dillinger, Bonny and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson - with a touch of ""High Sierra"" thrown in.Jeff Bridges steals the show. He is fascinating to watch in interviews with Chris Pine and Ben Foster. He's a good listener and doesn't talk over people, he's a laid back guy; the role of the laconic, but determined Marcus Hamilton was made for him.The team of two that sticks by each other to the end is a powerful combination, and two is the magic number; just like marriage. The best cop shows in movies or on TV feature partners who have each other's backs. Newman and Redford set the gold standard for buddies as Butch and Sundance, Connery and Caine polished it in ""The Man Who Would be King"", and it worked beautifully for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"". There is something reassuring to an audience when mates face the odds together. It's surprising that filmmakers don't go there more often - it's more effective than the lone wolf hero - and there are more opportunities for great one-liners.Script, direction, photography, score and performance all came together on ""Hell or High Water"" - it's just about the perfect creative storm."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 February 2020,10/10,"The classic modern day western that could be only done in Texas. Suspenseful, and clever. Jeff Bridges plays the perfect Texas Ranger, while both Chris Pine and Ben Foster bring a dynamic that made for an awesome adventure. They even managed to pull off the perfect Comanche reference which can only be fitting for a true American Western story."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 February 2017,10/10,"In West Texas, divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Ben Foster) carry out early morning robberies of two branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. Though the robberies are well- planned, Tanner's wild nature leads to him taking unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby.Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered. They exchange the stolen bills for chips, some of which Tanner uses to gamble. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank ‚Äì the same bank they robbed. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.It is revealed that the brothers' mother died recently, leaving their ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be foreclosed. Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons because oil has recently been discovered on their land. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of frontier justice. It is also revealed that Tanner shot and killed their abusive father.Hamilton stakes out another branch of the Texas Midlands Bank, but the brothers don't show. Hamilton figures a pattern to the robberies and determines their next target. Hamilton and Parker are en route when the final robbery indeed occurs there. Pressed for time, the brothers proceed with the heist even though the bank is full of customers. A shoot-out ensues when a security guard and an armed civilian fire at the brothers and Tanner kills the guard and the civilian, but Toby is shot in the hip.The brothers race out of town, with a posse of armed townspeople in hot pursuit. After gaining some distance, Tanner stops and fires an automatic rifle at the posse, forcing them to retreat. The brothers then split, with Toby taking the money using another vehicle, while Tanner creates a diversion. He draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge where he takes potshots with a sniper rifle, killing Parker. Hamilton uses a local resident's knowledge of the area to circle behind Tanner, and kills him with a single head shot using the local's rifle."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 December 2020,8/10,Two brothers lost their mother and the older one just got out of jail. They rob banks in Texas and got back to their house in the middle of nowhere and bury the car they drive while robbing the banks. They were having lunch at a diner and the older said that he'd go to the bathroom and robbed the bank by the diner by himself and they escaped together. Before that Toby tipped generously the waitress which later said to the police that she didn't recognize them .Toby divorced and want his two sons have a comfortable life unlike them. The two rangers Marcus and his indian partner stayed at a hotel in a town because Marcus thought they'd rob that bank. They went to a restaurant with a very weird old waitress. They waited there for a long time and Marcus figured they'd rob another bank. The two robbed the relatively bigger bank on the payday. The town people chased them outside with their cars and the older brother stopped and shot the cars with his rifle and made them return to their town. It was a very impressive scene. Toby was shot but it was ok. He took the other car and the older brother moved on with the police cars behind. He went up on a hill and exploded the car. At the summit he started shooting people down there and the town people also showed up. The Indian ranger got killed and Marcus with a town man went up behind him and Marcus shot the older brother in the head. They couldn't catch Toby he wasn't a suspect but Marcus wasn't convinced. He retired but went after Toby seeing he gave the range to his sons and his ex wife and he was living elsewhere. Marcus said he'll keep chasing him and he left the ranger where they found oil beneath and making lots of money. They were rich now. Their sickness of being poor thru generations were cured. It was a very good movie with great actors like Jeff bridges. Everyone was interesting including the waitresses.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 January 2019,8/10,"That was what I was thinking when I was watching this movie. When I think that in my head, all the way until the end, I know I've stumbled upon a good one.I originally didn't know much about Chris Pine when I first saw this movie. But he shines really bright as a bank robber in this movie, trying to raise enough money to save his house from foreclosure. It's a tale of the robbers who rob, and the cops who try to stop them. A great piece on capitalism in the US, and chasing the American Dream.Highly recommended. I mean the first shot in the film is enough to make you go nuts!8 stars"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 November 2016,10/10,"This modern western heist thriller isn't the film that tap into many's expectations, at least by those who go in anticipating a series of violent, adrenaline-fueled shootout sequences (though there are some). It is a film that sets the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis into it's story's backdrop in order to generate a smart, if slightly sluggish testament of men trying to survive the brutal aftermath of the economic collapse; while competing with their morally grey persona. Most of this is greatly accomplished by director David Mackenzie who serves a strong arm for this modern western flick. Teaming up with Mackenzie is writer Taylor Sheridan who wrote the fascinating screenplay for last year's thriller 'Sicario' and sums up for the almost equally intriguing script for this one. Set in 2008 at the dawn of the global financial crises, this film stars Chris Pine as Toby, a recently divorced father stuck living in an economically depressed Texan town who has not way for providing for his family's ranch other than committing a series of bank robberies with his ruthless brother Tanner (played by Ben Foster). Their heinous crime spark the attention of Sheriff Marcus Hamilton (played by Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (played by Gil Birmingham) who sprawl across the state of Texas to hunt them down.This film may proceed with a frustratingly slow pace against the wills of viewers who favor for a more action-oriented approach, but it is hard to deny the ingenious substance David Mackenzie packs into this film. Tapping into socioeconomic themes, this film paints a gritty picture of a society devastated by the notorious economic collapse of 2008 that left millions of money-starved individuals living in poverty and pointing their fingers at the corruption of Wall Street. Along the way, it takes its valuable time during the first half to develop our characters and set up the plot for the climatic showdown. One scene in particular take place in an old diner where Jeff Bridge's Marcus Hamilton is under investigation for a bank robbery previously ignited by the lead characters, when he unsuccessfully tries to confiscate what he believes stolen money (tip money) from a waitress. This accurately paints how people are so desperate for money when they are struck with financial stress and persevere to holding on to as much as they can. The first entire first half is a little sluggish with its momentum, but by the second half it fairly pays off for the benefit of the camaraderie of the lead characters who are empowered with engrossing performances by Chris Pine and Ben Foster. But that's not all, the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens used to capture the depressed nature of the old Texan town embraces a realistic picture of a town overrun by societal collapse, and its all quite intriguing to look at especially for the fact that the film was shot in New Mexico as opposed to the film's primary setting.Hell or High Water may run at snail pace, but it is fortunately in favor of developing some engaging characters and a riveting plot that greatly sets the film on a fascinating sendoff, at least until its ambiguous ending. Though the film boasts an incredible feat, many viewers are not likely to find a reason to rewatch this after a first sit. Nonetheless, it is still worth sitting through for those hungry for a fascinating experience."

All four of the men who die in HELL OR HIGH WATER are gunmen (because Texas is NOT Chicago or Detroit, where cowards perpetrate indiscriminate drive-by shootings, killing tons of toddlers, babies, and pregnant moms as ""collateral damage"" in their ""gang wars""). One of the quartet wasted in HELL is an American Hero who fights against bullying all his life, and is willing to help a brother break a century-long Cycle of Poverty. The remaining doomed trio are either Rich People's Legal Toadies, or Fox ""News"" automatons who've been brainwashed into identifying with the Rich (which isn't hard to do in Texas, as it's illegal to teach Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving in State Schools).

HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 February 2017,7/10,"This is what American cinema ought to be. Hell or High Water is set in small towns with its steak houses, bars, secluded houses and oil derricks. It was smooth and entertaining like a well written crime fiction novel. I liked the unconventional and charming small town characters and their working class lives. I liked the plump waitress a lot (!). Everyone acted well. Nice locales. Awesome soundtrack. Taylor Sheridan is a writer to watch out for. Even though Sicario was just OK.I was not a big Ben Foster fan before this film came out. But he did a good job here. Chris Pine who played the subdued and confused brother was a perfect foil for the rough and impulsive Ben Foster. This is one of the best American films I've seen in a while. I am not saying this is as good as the American films of the 40s, 50s and 70s. But this is as good as it gets for 21st century American cinema.Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham deserve special mention for their chemistry and their back and forth digs at each other. I hope there are more films like Hell or High Water and not too many films about Mark Zuckeberg."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 October 2016,9/10,"It's about five minutes into this gritty crime drama‚Äîwhich kicks off with a long unbroken tracking shot‚Äîthat you know you're in for something special. And the remainder of the film, all the way up until the bittersweet closing shot, doesn't disappoint. The story is set in a post-GFC West Texas and follows two bank-robbing brothers who have underlying motives to their unlawful actions (to tell would spoil the narrative's wonderful drip-feed style), whilst also tracking the soon-to-be-retired Ranger who's seeking to finish his career on a high. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is remarkably simple yet effective, wisely resisting the temptation to resort to thriller-ish tropes despite ostensibly playing like one. He allows the multi-layered characters to do all the heavy lifting and is rewarded with a cast that absolutely nails it. As polar opposite siblings who share an unbreakable bond, Chris Pine and Ben Foster are magnetic; the former a level-headed brooder with the weight of the world on his shoulders, the latter an unpredictable live wire who would gladly kill for his younger brother. On the other side of the fence, Jeff Bridges brings his A-game as a sardonic law-enforcement veteran who is equal parts intelligent and stubborn, terrifically supported by an understated Gil Birmingham as his oft-tormented partner. Most impressively the film doesn't seem to pass judgment on any of the characters (or at least not until late in the piece), allowing them to exist without labelling them good or bad; they all have parts of themselves that fit into both categories. Director David Mackenzie also deserves a lot of praise, as he sublimely balances the need for a tight and tense plot whilst simultaneously allowing his characters ample room to breathe and grow. Mackenzie also gets the very best out of his cinematographer Giles Nuttgens who delivers bold, sharp and stylish camera movements in addition to a level of photography (i.e., lighting and framing) that is as good as you'll see this year. Narratively powerful, visually mesmerising and backed to Nick Cave's transcendent soundtrack, Hell or High Water is one of the finest motion pictures of 2016."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 February 2017,8/10,"Hell or High Water is a good modern western with a good cast, Chris Pine is great, Ben Foster is excellent, in my opinion he deserved an indication to Oscar, Jeff Bridges as always very good in his roles, the rest of the cast appear I do not know how to do it, but I do not know what to do with it. I do not know what to do with it. It's a very good story. I do not like the ending, some dialogues are uninteresting, and characters are also good, the rhythm is good, and the fact that the movie is short Help, Hell or High Water is very good, has good times, even with problems, has a good cast, is a very good modern western. Note 8.6"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 December 2016,8/10,"'Hell or High Water' is a low-key, slow burning Western crime drama that requires a degree of patience. It will probably be quickly dismissed by a lot of people, but those willing to give it a chance will find an intelligent and very well-written film.The plot is simple - a middle-aged father and his brother resort to robbing banks after their dead mother's ranch is about to be repossessed by the bank. The local Rangers attempt to catch them before they strike again. Don't be fooled into thinking this is an action movie though, because it isn't. The vast majority of the film is dialogue and focuses on the relationship between the main characters.'Hell or High Water' is probably one of the best modern Westerns I've seen. The ending was very well done. If you stick with it, you'll be rewarded."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 May 2018,7/10,"In rural Texas, two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who have had difficult lives are robbing small banks to save the family farm. Two rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) are assigned to solve the series of crimes.In some ways, ""Hell or High Water"" resembles ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Once we know the plight of the robbers, we viewers end up sympathizing with them despite their occasional brutality.The film has a good chase scene in the second half though compared to other past crime capers (of which there are many), the action is more steady than exciting. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie's strength is mainly in the dialogues: those between the two brothers and those between the two rangers.The Bridges character is near retirement. He is smart and likeable in some ways but acts like a dumb ass when he makes racial taunts to his long-time colleague whose heritage is half Native American and half Mexican. Birmingham's reactions to the ""teasing"" tells a lot in subtle ways; there is offense mixed with a history of accepting the rudeness. Despite this tension, it is clear the long-time colleagues respect each other.There is an underlying theme that represents our modern times: that many people, like the robber brothers, are living in hard financial times and it is the banks who are regarded as the true villains. It's rather courageous and rare for a modern film to challenge the status quo this way. Add to this the bonus of a cameo appearance by Margaret Bowman as a waitress in a small town dive - someone who seems to have been born in a swamp."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 June 2020,7/10,"This is not a flashy movie in the least bit. It's a very simple plot,, tie that in with a very fine cast and director,, and you've got a great movie!! Cops vs Robbers,,, who's gonna win?Go watch it!!!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,9/10,"The last song articulates the film's ""spirit of the outlaw."" In this modern-age western the entire West Texas world is a bunch of outlaws: the banks whose usurious system would sweep the oil-rich ranch out from under the dead woman's grandsons, the diners who don't recognize the robbers, the trigger-happy customers who turn a heist into a slaughter, the waitress who resents losing the robber's $200 tip that she needs to keep a roof over her daughter's mortgaged head. And so to the central quartet. Two brothers face off against two lawmen. Toby is the good son determined to improve the lot of his two abandoned sons and ex-wife by robbing the Texas Midland branches to get the money to pay off the Texas Midland reverse mortgage and back taxes. He recruits his wilder ex-con brother Tanner. The brothers' bond bristles with insults, parallelling that between Sheriff Marcus and his Indian/Mexican deputy Alberto. Exulting in political incorrectness, Marcus teases Alberto about his ethnic background. In return Alberto razzes his senior about his looming retirement. In blind poetic justice, the wilder outlaw and the tamer lawman are both killed.Though Toby and Marcus survive their success stays shadowed. In their last scene both appear dramatically cleaned-up, healthier versions of their earlier presentation. Marcus made it through a gun-happy society's law system to make retirement. Toby has ensured his sons' fortunes by passing on the oil-rich farm. But neither man knows peace. As Marcus senses (or as a moral man needs to believe), Toby is haunted by his brother's death and the deaths of the bank-folk incidental to their robberies. He remains an outsider in his own family, coldly dismissed by his wife, kept at a proper distance by his more promising sons. Marcus remains trapped by the incompletely solved case. How can he prove Toby was the second robber? How did Toby plan it all and get away with it? And why? The depths of Marcus's grief and anger are suggested when he tells Toby of the large family Alberto left behind.In the last scene Marcus gratefully accepts Toby's invitation to continue their conversation at his home in town. There they may find ""peace."" We're not told what that ""peace"" means for each of them, if either will get it, and how. Perhaps Toby's ""peace"" would be avenging Tanner's death and dispatching the ex-sheriff's implicit threat to his scheme ‚Äî or making the final sacrifice for his sons and going down in gunfire. Perhaps Marcus's ""peace"" would be solving that last case and bringing the robber to justice ‚Äî or in his last shoot-out heroically escaping the torpor of retirement. It's a Mexican standoff.In the last shot Marcus drives off, disappearing into the countryside as the camera drops to wheat level. That movement implies burial, as if an augur of the final shoot-out that even a modern-day Western sets us up to expect. But that reading is inflected by the reflection of a triangle of light on the left side of the screen. The light changes that burial to resurrection. Perhaps the two heroes' ""peace"" will therefore rather be putting the antagonistic past behind them and getting on with their lives. That would make this a new age Western, which prefers a negotiated compromise over another shoot-out. That gives the men a sensitive, more female side, coherent with their later cleaned-up, more civilized look. That would also balance the tough flatness of the film's women, all consigned to the margin: Toby's hardened wife, the fleshy single-mom waitress who's drawn to him, his casino pickup, the waitress who for forty years has been serving up only t-bone steaks, the only option being peas or corn. Toby's courtly abstemiousness contrasts to Tanner's prostitute performing on the bed behind him.The title comes from the lawyer's instruction: Come hell or high water the heroes have to get the cash to the bank to avoid the foreclosure. The absence of high water is evident in the arid Texas landscape and the tired bodies that move bent and broken and hopeless through it. Only an Eastern city slicker would order a trout in these parts. As for the hell, it's in the people, helpless before the banks, hopeless in their cycle of generations of poverty, with only the rare opportunity to make the one score that may be too late for them but just might spring free their kids. This circle of hell might well be the Trump supporters, on the fringe of the economy and the law, so hopeless they'll bet it all on an irrational, even lunatic long-shot."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 August 2016,5/10,"If it weren't for a predictable plot ""Hell or High Water"" would be a truly exceptional film. The acting is uniformly excellent, and the location shooting, costumes, and music are so good they are characters themselves. The basic core of the film is the pair of relationships ‚Äì between two partners (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) and two brothers (Ben Foster and Chris Pine) as they move toward the inevitable clash and the predictable outcome. The background is a small Texas community that has suffered economic depression and then the coming of the vultures (ie., Banks) who pick over the bones.The film is as much a violent film as it is a sociological study of the impact of poverty and despair."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 April 2017,8/10,"Fantastic story and cast. Come hell or high water two brothers begin robbing banks owned by the very corporation that is attempting to snake their late mama's property. What follows is a thrill ride of a movie. Ben Foster and Chris Pine portray the brothers, while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham play the Rangers hot on their trail. Great job, but the ending left me wanting more as it was not definitive."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 May 2019,7/10,"A western in the era of the great recession. Hell or High Water is quality cowboy action with enough social commentary to give it an extra kick. An excellent study on what drives people to become common criminals. The two brothers on the run commit evil deeds, but aren't necessarily evil themselves, if you catch my drift. Jeff Bridges lights the screen on fire as a crusty old sheriff who's seen it all."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 March 2019,8/10,"It's interesting to me to see how the current social climate in this country can mold a film into a Best Picture Oscar nominee. I've probably seen this same scenario a number of different times, but the reasoning behind it is what brings Hell or High Water (2016) into a different category. There have been tons of heist films, and often the robbers have a tight connection, like that of brothers. Heck, The Blues Brothers (1980) essentially did the same basic plot but with ""putting the band back together"" as their way of ""saving the ranch.""Partly because this film seemed so quintessentially Texas, I couldn't help thinking it was a toned down version of another Best Picture Oscar winner No Country for Old Men (2007). With last year's Best Picture Oscar nominee, The Big Short (2015), showing how many honest Americans were swindled by the greed of banks, it's no wonder that this year we would see the more down-to-earth side of this financial fiasco. Not only are these robberies meant to save their home, these brothers also wanted to ""stick it to the man"" that put their family in such dire straits to begin with.In the end, Hell or High Water is a pretty standard plot and it's pretty predictable from the beginning to the credits. However, when the citizens of these towns aren't concerned that their banks are being robbed and they begin to side with the robbers, you know there's something wrong with the society. Granted, this society in Texas was hit hard by the recession, so it's no wonder that they don't trust the banks that are being knocked off. It's realizations like this that help to show why a presidential candidate practically backed by big banking did not win last November.A modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype, I give Hell or High Water 4.0 stars out of 5."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 June 2020,8/10,"""Hell or High Water"" doesn't bring anything truly new to the cinematic canon, but it's well worth watching for the spectacular cinematography alone. Take a bunch of movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Badlands"", and similar anti-hero flicks, skillfully mix them up real well, and toss in Jeff Bridges playing an idealized Jeff Bridges (he does in his sleep nowadays for a very solid paycheck), and you've got this film. I'm not making a back-handed compliment, just a simple observation. Frankly, this film grabs you and never lets go. It is exceptionally well-crafted and the landscapes alone make it worth the time. So I have no regrets about heartily recommending this film, even though it's fundamentally a long way from being original."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,8/10,"Chris Pine was determined to find a film and a role that was as far away from Captain Kirk and Star Trek as he could find. In the role of Toby Howard in David Mackenzie's wonderful HELL OR HIGH WATER, Pine certainly has found that role.Reminiscent of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (but not on that, esteemed, level) HELL OR HIGH WATER tells the tale of two brothers (Pine and Ben Foster) who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on the mortgage of the ranch they inherited from their mother, in order to pay the bank back with their own money. They are pursued by a Texas Ranger (Jeff Bridges). As written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Mackenzie, the movie is much, much more than the plot. It is about relationships and character and mood and setting...And...it is one terrific film.Start with the mood. Mackenzie imbues this film with the feeling of a lazy ""dog days of August"" atmosphere. Some will take that as slow - there is much, much dialogue and scene setting shots - but I took it as wonderful. It immersed you in the world of these people and the filmmakers took their time showing you this world.The dialogue is terrific, writer Sheridan also wrote the screen play to the terrific Sicario, so I'm looking forward to what he does next. In the hands of lesser actors than Pine (the smart brother) and Foster (the wild brother), this dialogue - and these brothers - could have been one note. But they are not. They are nuanced and multi-faceted and fascinating to watch.But they don't hold a candle to the performance that Bridges brings to the table.Jeff Bridges has been nominted 6 times for an Academy Award (winning the Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart) and he just might be in line for his 7th nomination (and 2nd win) here. His Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, is just one fascinating, wonderful character. Much like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country, Bridges is playing a Texas Ranger that is nearing the end of his career. But, unlike Jones' character, Bridges is keeping up with today's ""modern"" criminal, but he's not keeping up with father time. I will start the campaign for an Oscar for Bridges for this role right now - that's how much I enjoyed it. Come for the acting, stay for the atmosphere - Hell or High Water is well worth the journey.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 March 2017,7/10,"Hell or High Water (7 out of 10) is a very good film overall and is certainly worth a watch. I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn't strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent of a ghost pirate ship drifting in the background.Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn't fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn't fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 March 2017,5/10,Atmospheric take on the Texas landscape and people. Good acting and suitably somber music. Brothers in debt with the risk of losing land resort to bank robberies. The problem with this picture is the moral stance of the film makers being to side with the brothers who commit serious crime and murder. So they are portrayed as the good guys whilst the banks and the police etc are the bad guys. Reduce my vote by 3 marks to: 5/10.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 September 2016,8/10,"A modern day American Western, Hell or High Water, tells the tale of two brothers Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine) as they travel throughout West Texas robbing local banks to pay off the interest of a loan their mother took out from the bank before she died. On their trail are two Texas rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The story moves along at a steady pace with plenty of wide open shots of the Texas countryside interspersed with trucks rolling down roads pockmarked with foreclosure, debt relief, and fast cash signs. The script is written by Taylor Sheridan who had success with Sicario and continues to excel with his storytelling. David Mackenzie directs the camera speeding along the roads or capturing the brothers bonding over beers and wrestling after a robbery. The story captures the sentiment of the times and anger at the big banks while still having a captivating plot.The acting is phenomenal with Bridges leading the way with his thick cowboy accent and his racial stereotyping of his patient partner. Foster fits well in the role as the crazed ex-con brother whose unpredictable behavior causes a few close calls. Pine is more serious as the sensible brother whose plan sparks the string of robberies and hoping to get away with it. Gil Birmingham also brings humor in his interactions with Bridges.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 March 2017,8/10,"Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as ""Oceans 11"", ""Die Hard"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage 'crimes' featured in last year's ""The Big Short"". Add in to the movie Nutribullet a soup√ßon of the West Texan setting from Arthur Penn's 1967 ""Bonnie and Clyde"", turn it on and you have ""Hell or High Water"".Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") and Ben Foster (""Inferno"", ""The Program"") play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard trying to rescue their deceased mother's ranch from being foreclosed on by Texas Midlands bank. Rather than taking one of the ""get out of debt"" offers advertised on billboards ‚Äì cleverly and insistently introduced in long panning highway shots ‚Äì the brothers have their own financial plan: a scheme that involves early morning raids of the cash drawers of small-town Texas Midlands branches. But the meticulous planning of Toby, as the calm and intelligent one, are constantly at risk of upset by the unpredictable and violent actions of the loose-cannon Tanner.Since the amounts of cash stolen are in the thousands rather than the millions, the FBI aren't interested and the case is handed instead by aged and grumpy Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, ""True Grit"") and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The pair have a respectful relationship but one built around racial banter, with Hamilton constantly referring to Alberto's Mexican/Comanche heritage. A cat and mouse game ensues with the lawmen staking out the most likely next hits. The sonorous cello strings of the soundtrack portend a dramatic finale, and we as viewers are not disappointed.The performances of the main leads are all excellent, with Chris Pine given the chance to show more acting chops than he has had chance to with his previous Kirk/Jack Ryan characters. His chemistry with Ben Foster is just sublime. Similarly, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham make for a formidable double act. It is Jeff Bridges though who has the standout performance and one that is Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor. (In fact with Michael Shannon also getting nominated in the same category for ""Nocturnal Animals"", we can add 'West Texan lawman' to 'Holocaust movies' (a Winslet ""Extras"" reference there!) as the prime bait for Oscar nomination glory!)The real winner here though is the whip-smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (""Sicario"") which sizzles with great lines: lines that make you grin inanely at the screen regularly through the running time.""In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle"" schmoozes Tanner to the pretty hotel check-in girl: a come-on clearly worth remembering as it delivers the goods, as it were.The trick here is in building up a degree of empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides. The 'bad guys' here are successfully portrayed as the banks. Before the 2017 awards, you could get 25/1 odds on this winning the Best Original Screenplay Oscar ‚Äì but I would personally rate it right up there with ""Manchester by the Sea"".Deftly directed by Scot David Mackenzie (""Starred Up"") this is a film (the first of two!) that might well have elbowed it's way into my Top 10 of 2016 if I'd seen it during its cinema release. Well worth catching on the small screen.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the- movie-man.com)."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2020,8/10,"2016 gave us some good thrillers. Hell or High Water does most of the things perfect - Setting the tone/atmosphere with the cinematography. Acting, oh my god, the acting (Ben Foster steals the show) and an engaging story. It may not have scenes you remember for years to come, but the quality of work put to the project shines through the screen - A truly mesmerizing experience!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 January 2020,8/10,One of the best westerns I've seen from the 2010's. The characters and acting are what really drive the film forward and propel it farther then I would have imagined this film would have gone. Gonna be watching this one as time goes on.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2016,9/10,"I've read the negatives in some of the reviews, and find most unsubstantiated. Nit-picky.""Hell or High Water"" has a fairly basic plot, but not as basic as some are leading-on. Somebody was complaining about killing three innocent people for 50k - they obviously weren't paying much attention. HOHW has masterclass performances from Pine and Bridges. There will be an Oscar nomination or two here. Many have compared-it to ""No Country for Old Men"". I agree with the comparisons both in style and overall quality. The look is great. The sunburnt look with that washed-out, grand cinematography, great scoring, awesome performances, steady pacing, and hidden character depth that goes way down deep to the core of the 4-main characters. This slides in front of Deadpool for my fave of 2016 so far, granted my viewed-list and the overall quality for 2016 are lagging a bit. I've only viewed about 24 films on my '16 watchlist(88), so hopefully there will be other great films to come.This is a nice turnaround for '16 and I hope the bottom 2\3rds of my watchlist is like this, a huge improvement. Just a solid, well-paced 80's-esque, cohen-esque thriller. Loved it!! 87/100You'll like this if you liked:Red Rock West(touch below but good), No country For Old Men(even, there goes the useful rating but oh well it's jmo), and Place Beyond the Pines(also even). Deserves to be in that group. Excellent."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 October 2019,10/10,"A modern-day West Texas noir that cuts out the special effects for real drama.As a West Texas native, I'm surprised at how close the scenery hits to home. The setting is as real as it can get. I cannot begin to start on the number of towns I've visited that resembled the ones in this film. But I digress.The characters themselves I enjoyed. There are no good guys in this film. Everyone has their motivations and reasons for doing the things they do. This is a modern Wild West cops and robbers chase.5/5. Worth it and will see it again. Shame that this movie did not receive the marketing that it deserves."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 January 2020,6/10,"Nothing really stood out, but i enjoyed it. story is nice i guess. execution, just normal. performance, good but not outstanding. just a slightly above average film.6/10: eh good"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 September 2016,9/10,"'Hell or High Water' is a modern day Weston, a heist 'buddy' movie with a political backdrop, think of 'The Big Short' with a western theme. I was compelled to watch this when I realised the writer of SICARIO also wrote this.A gritty drama about a divorced dad and his brother, who devise a plan to only rob 'West Midland Banks' in order to save their family's farm from repossession. The Texan area has been hit hard by recession, a failing farm industry, and oil drilling.The sense of depression is immediately illustrated in the opening scene by some graffiti sprayed on a wall that reads ""3 tours in Iraq - no bailout for me."" Remember the banks were being bailed out worldwide. In every aspect the banks were the true villains. Just as a reminder, and every so often, the barren roadside billboards advertise debt management, refinancing and other related bank services.The bank raids are the scenes with most suspense and drama, you can really feel the tension when they get into situations that especially Chris Pine's character feels most uncomfortable with, the money is laundered through the nearby Casino.Even though there is a lot of violence, there is also comedy, an example is when the rangers go to a 'steakhouse diner' and are served by a waitress, who will only serve streak done only one way, this demonstrating how nothing ever changes and no-one really has a choice, not even what they eat or how its cooked or anything else. The food ordering process and the dialogue are really funny.Ben Foster's character is always on the edge of crazy, there is tense scene at a petrol station when two young guys pull up and try to pick a fight, Chris Pine's character steps in, beats one of them senseless as he knows his brother would surely kill him if he didn't step in. Chris Pine's character ultimately wants his estranged sons to escape (what he calls) the ""disease"" of poverty. Chris Pine's and Ben Foster's performances both shine, Ben gives the star performance and every bit as well as Jeff Bridges, who plays the world-weary officer on the point of compulsory retirement due to age. I feel Ben is the actor completely in his element (more of him in this kind of role please!).Chris pine is a versatile actor not only able to play Captain Kirk (for which he's never likely to win an award for), but there's a good chance of 'best supporting actor' for his performance in this.Highly recommended film."

HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 February 2017,9/10,"Refreshingly original, brilliantly acted, thoughtful western/crime film. In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels, remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character- driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous, heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far this year."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 August 2017,10/10,"One of the best movies of 2016, without a single doubt! Remember when I said that The Magnificent Seven was the Western that we needed? Well, Hell or High Water just surpassed it.This is an amazing piece of art, with characters full-developed at the smallest detail. David Mackenzie takes his time to not only introduce us the characters, but he makes them THE film. There is an absurd level of personality development with scenes that are so simple and subtle, but that manage to captivate us through a brilliant script.Chris Pine and Ben Foster have probably their best performances ever, as well as an Oscar-worthy performance from Jeff Bridges. I mean, how great can they be? I love the duo chemistry, I cared about them so much and that put me at the edge of my seat at the end of the film, when all the action unfolds. Also, Gil Birmingham (Alberto Parker) played brilliantly Marcus' partner. The constant bickering between each other is funny and compelling.I'm surprised with the quality of the direction by Mackenzie. I didn't know him until now, so I'm blown away by the outstanding achievement in what he did. Great cinematography, amazing long takes with a perfect soundtrack accompanying this thrilling Western. As for flaws, I can't really pinpoint any ... The pacing is deliberately slow, so that might not please some people, but the truth is that, if the pacing isn't as controlled as this one was, the characters can't be as captivating and the connection between them and the audience falls apart.Hell or High Water is by far the best Western of 2016! Pine, Foster and Jeff Bridges have Oscar-worthy performances (especially the latter) in a film with a brilliant direction by David Mackenzie. Cinematography, soundtrack, script, suspense, characters, story ... This movie achieves everything that it wanted to achieve with every parameter at the very top of quality. A Western masterpiece.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 February 2017,8/10,"Hell or High Water is a neo-Western crime thriller starring Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. As far as neo-Westerns go, this one is easily one of the best. Despite its relatively simple plot, the film still feels fresh and smart thanks to its interesting characters and dialogue.Two brothers, divorced father Toby (Chris Pine) and ex-con Tanner (Ben Foster), work together to rob banks throughout small towns in Texas in order to pay off the mortgage for their family's ranch. On their case are Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Thanks to the quick thinking of Marcus, the two rangers end up hot on the trail of the two brothers as they execute robbery after robbery.Featuring well-developed characters and some great shoot-out scenes, Hell or High Water succeeds not only as a neo-Western, but also as a fun action film as well. I really enjoyed seeing the creative ways the two brothers covered their tracks after each of the robberies, matched equally by the quick thinking of Ranger Marcus. The wide landscape of Texas makes for a great Western backdrop and the film's cinematographer makes full use of this. The film also serves as a commentary on the greed of the banks so we the viewers gain a sense of justice from the brothers rationale in robbing them.I rate it 8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 February 2017,6/10,"As I saw her, more and more I realized that I was watching a western. The difference is that it is nowadays and with cars. It's a good movie, what happens is that it has moments of rest that I do not like.It is a film that is not social, from my point of view, contrary to what others say, I think what it defends is the freedom of each one. Another thing is that you do bad things and the law will look for you. But it does not speak of social defense.He has a good picture. They are in the desert and the light is yellowish but not as bright as a video camera.I love the role of Jeff Bridges, the grandfather, good-natured, cranky, but it's all a lie. The others are very well, you think you are in that world.The problem of the film for me, are the dead times that the film has. Many planes that count nothing and some sequence that could be saved.The direction without being spectacular, without making spectacular plans, but knows how to take the film and make a movie that you want to see.Spoiler:The end, typically western, when the bad guy goes to hide in the mountains and the sheriff and the others are going to kill him. And typically American, he is not arrested."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 January 2017,8/10,"This was one of the movies I just had to see with the buzz around it. I had heard more than a few times that it was the best movie of the year, so I waited patiently for a chance to watch it. It didn't get a big release so I had to be watch it on home video. The critics were right about this one, it's thrilling and it walks the fine line between a character driven drama and surprisingly effective action movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) can't make ends meet and they're at the end of their rope. The movie begins with a small Texas Midland Bank opening. One of the tellers Elsie (Dale Dickey) has come in early and unfortunately is the only one in the bank when 2 guys in ski-masks burst in. They demand the cash from the teller drawers, only small bills. Elsie tells them she doesn't have access until the manager shows up. They wait and wrangle the manager into helping them. He starts to protest but gets hit for it. The bank robbers manage to get away and speed toward the next town. Toby blasts Tanner for being unnecessarily forceful but it's pretty obvious that one of them is in it to raise the capital and one of them is in it for the thrills.They're able to successfully rob a second and then surprisingly a third before they head home to dispose of the getaway car. We then start to get a peek into Toby and Tanner's life. Toby lives one his mother's ranch (she passed away after battling a long-suffering illness) and Tanner has only gotten out of jail a year ago. They have resorted to robbing banks to pay off a reverse mortgage on the property so Toby can leave it to his kids. Both of them seem to have made peace with the fact that they probably won't get away. Their case has been handed off to the Texas Rangers and a pair of Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) are assigned to it. Marcus is about to retire and wants one last shot at glory before he gives up his badge and gun.Hell or High Water has it's own distinctive flavour. The movie radiates Texas in all it's glory. I don't just mean in the prettier aspects either. Even coming from someone who has never been to Texas, this is what you picture Texas looking like. Small one-horse towns dot the landscape and while the residents of those towns seem content, the outsiders (the Texas Rangers) take pity on them. Hell or High Water has an authentic country feel and I would add that even though a lot of what is being shown isn't pretty, the cinematography beautiful too look at. It reminded me a lot of Sicario, which is interesting because this was written by the same writer of Sicario.My favourite thing about Hell or High Water was the strong relationships between the characters. Through Chris and Ben's performances and the strongly written script, you really latch on to Tanner and Toby. They have a deep bond as brothers despite the fact they're very different people. You root for them to make it out because they're underdogs up against the system, they have a righteous cause, they've just been forced to do what they're doing because of the unfairness of the system. You also grow to really like Marcus and Alberto. They have no problem laying into each other but they work well together. A lot of their teasing each other is racial humour but it's not meant in a truly racist way, they're just like any pair of old friends who know how to get under each others skin. It can be hard to get you to like characters on both sides of the situation but it's so key to why Hell or High Water works.When it comes to the cast, you have a couple people well cast into roles they've similarly done before and a couple of surprises. This is a different type of character for Chris Pine, the only time I've seen him do something similar was Z for Zachariah. He's a better actor than he's given credit for, he slips into Toby completely. Ben Foster was also great, I like him best when he's playing more unhinged characters. Jeff Bridges was doing his Texas drawl, he's also a really good actor but he was also really hard to understand at points. Gil Birmingham was pretty poignant as Alberto, he's funny when he's playing off Bridges but he also delivers a good monologue in the middle of the movie.The movie delivers in the end too, I got a lot more action than I bargained for and it was suitably grounded and gritty like the rest of the movie. I really liked the ending, there's a classic western standoff at the end of the movie. Pairing that with the sharp dialogue, it made for a great wrap-up.The movie that I would compare this to would be The Town. Both centre of blue collar protagonists, one represents the brains and the other has the devil-may-care attitude. They also show the other side of the coin, presenting intense yet likable cops who are just trying to get their job done. I still like The Town better but they're both great entries in this genre. I thought Hell or High Water lived up to the hype, I'd give it an 8.5/10. I won't round it up to 9 though, it's really good but it may or may not make my 2016 top 10."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 December 2017,8/10,"The film's first shot features graffiti that reads ""3 tours in Iraq but no bailout for people like us."" This may be a summer 2016 movie, but it is Trump's America...a heist story for those who feel screwed over. Which is everybody. And while the story is hardly original, the dialogue is tight and fresh. From the bank robbers to the eye witnesses to the law enforcement to the native peoples, everybody senses that they were left out. And everybody has a quip that captures it. The morality - and chaos - that is left behind may not be new, but it is well crafted. Bridges and Pine are electric, and every minute is riveting."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 August 2016,8/10,"I really wanted to give this a ten, but, even though it's done well, it's very familiar territory. two brothers rob Texas banks to get back at them for being money grubbing bad guys. see, I told you it was familiar. this is chris pine's third movie of 2016 and he gets better all the time. he's quite believable as a down and outer. ben foster, as his brother, hams it up in a star turn. jeff bridges is a ranger on the verge of retirement. he and his partner, gil Birmingham, follow the robbers around til, well, you know. the acting all around is very good and the director seems to catch present day Texas, in a way I believe to be real. I live in ny, so I only know Texas from the news and movies. it's the last picture show, 45 years later, which I guess is why bridges took the role. it is a very good movie, not to be missed, just don't expect to be surprised."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,3/10,"Yet another film that I was looking forward to seeing, I even had to wait for this one to get to my area (one of the many downsides to living in middle America) Hell or High Water was sure to be a treat. I kept hearing positive reviews of this film, and it stayed at 100% on rotten tomatoes for awhile, so I was hopeful. In addition to the positive reviews, I thought Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham together couldn't a bad film make. The 2016 feature by David Mackenzie tells the tale of 2 brothers who will stop at nothing to save the land of their deceased mother, the last link to their childhood, and the riches that the oil under her land will promise. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is a Texas lawman weeks before a forced retirement, training Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) to be able to take his place. Just when it seems like it will be a quiet couple weeks before retirement, a rash of bank robberies occur and Marcus and Alberto take the responsibility to solve the case. Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) have gotten the brunt of many bad situations in their lives. After their mother passed away, they were faced with the realization that the land on which she lived was being seized by the bank. After recently learning that there is a massive amount of oil under that land invigorates the brothers to save the land by any means necessary. Toby has a former wife and a child to think about and believes himself to be indebted to them and wants to gift them the land and the oil so they will always be taken care of. Tanner is constantly on the run, in and out of jail, and has nothing to lose by helping his brother, even if the means are criminal. After weaving together an intricate plan of robbing the very bank responsible for the foreclosure on their mother's land, then securing the deed through that very bank, the two begin an old west style run of bank robberies with a couple of Texas lawmen on their tails. As much as I had been looking forward to Hell or High Water, I was monumentally disappointed. Early in the film, we see over the shoulder of Jeff Bridges' character as he is reading his forced retirement letter from the department; this begins the formulaic downturn suffered through the rest of the film. Each pivotal moment was seen coming a mile away and easily predicted. There are few things more boring than watching a lazy movie in which the audience can predict each move made by the characters, and even each piece of dialogue spoken throughout the entire film. Jeff Bridges was flat on screen, Chris Pine was horribly miscast, and there are Grand Canyon sized holes in character development that are never solved. I never knew enough about the characters to become invested in them. Ben Foster was the only shining spot in this film, but even his exceptional acting couldn't save the film. A disappointment all around, I can't figure out yet why Hell or High Water is getting the amount of positivity the film has enjoyed thus far."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 February 2021,1/10,"Ok I was very UPSET WITH THIS FILM. Yes it had a GREAT CAST But the Acting was Terrible come on REALLY you do not ROB A BANK THE WAY YOU TWO CLOWNS DID EXAMPLES.
#1 You do not ROB a Bank take away a Man's LODDED GUN PUT IT ON THE COUNTER SO HE CAN REACH IT.
Then you leave the BANK AND THE FARMER WITH HIS LOADED GUN.
He Shoots at your Car and MISSES EVER SHOOT.
#2 Out for Breakfast that Probably cost you $5 Bucks. You DO NOT GIVE HER A $200 HUNDRED DOLLAR TIP. Then ROB the Bank across the Street. As you are running to the Car Bills are flying every where.
#3 You Both are such Dummies at the Casinos.
#4 Oh as you leave the Bank the Police are SO STUPID THEY DON'T EVEN CUT YOU OFF. ALL THEY DO IS CHASE YOU AROUND LIKE CLOWNS.
This has to be the WORST BANK ROBBING FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 January 2019,9/10,Ben foster is a great in this movie. Well worth a few hours of your time...
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 May 2021,7/10,"A smart thriller, full of good performances by all the cast, great scenarios and an undeniable real Texas feeling, even for someone who never visited the State."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 January 2019,8/10,Great movie with great chemistry between the main two characters. They really seem like brothers with an interesting past and everything about their relationship and past history is real. The old cop and the native american cop is the same situation. They feel like real partners and it certainly adds to your caring about how the whole situation plays out. Loved the end scene with Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 October 2021,10/10,"The style works, is grounded in real places and the action helps the plot. Is a great western in today world."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2016,8/10,"Hell or High Water is a modern Western in spirit and atmosphere, and crime/heist drama in execution. We follow two brothers as they rob various banks over Texas in order to pay the same bank back the debt their deceased mother owed. Meanwhile a couple of Texas rangers follow their trail and attempt to second-guess their next move. The story is not your usual cops-and- robbers affair, instead it prefers to spread attention amongst all the major parties. Almost the entire second act is taken up with developing these characters and getting them in position for the finale. While this lull in the middle can drag the movie's pacing down a little bit, it goes a long way in painting each individual with their own charming quirks and personality.Toby and Tanner are ultimately rednecks who grew up in difficult childhoods, with a father who abused them and a mother who let it happen. Tanner spent a number of years in prison after standing up to his abusive father, while Toby juggled an ex-wife and two teenage boys with his dying mother. He takes it upon himself to save his family ranch and keep it out of the grasp of the banks who seek it for their own gain. Meanwhile Marcus is an aged Ranger nearing his retirement and taking the opportunity of his last job to make the most of it. Alberto is his ethnic partner just seeking to provide for his family at home. Marcus' somewhat racist slurs towards Alberto creates a dynamic of banter between them, rather than painting Marcus as a genuine racist (which he, quite obviously, is not).The message of the story is one of wealth. Toby and Tanner are hit hard by the difficult financial times of the country, and their little crop of land is one of the ones hit the hardest. Their crusade of robbing banks has little to do with the money itself, but is more a middle finger to those who they see as screwing them over. It's not just them though, the entire region is hit with it, with some people, like a waitress they over-tip, protecting them out of their own need to provide for themselves and their families financially. On the flipside there are those that take the bank robberies personally, regarding them as being thievery of their own pittances of wealth.Hell or High Water paints the region of West Texas in the same amount of detail and respect as it paints the characters who inhabit it. This isn't just a place of sand and cowboys, but of real people struggling to get by, complete with cowboy hats aplenty, almost everyone carrying a gun of some kind, and the main source of consumption is a steak and a beer (there's a great scene in a small cafe that only serves T-Bone steaks and the Ranger's confusion at the abrasive old waitress).The acting is top-notch across the board, bringing a huge amount of depth to these characters. Jeff Bridges could certainly be in contention for another Oscar nomination as Marcus, who fears retirement just as much as he does not closing the case. He wants to drag it out as long as he can to avoid the inevitable. His comedy timing and delivery is also great, giving Marcus' slurs towards Alberto a humorous edge rather than an offensive one, straddling that thin line between charming and outright racist. I've been a massive fan of Ben Foster since Hostage and I'm still waiting for him to get the recognition he deserves. Could this be it for him? It's certainly possible in my opinion, providing Bridges' equal in performance quality. His Tanner is, again, a character who could've easily turned completely unlikeable, but Foster turns on the charm, delivers his one-liners to perfection and actually makes him quite a likable loose cannon. Chris Pine's good looks almost betray him, but he still manages to slip into the redneck role and be entirely convincing. He doesn't quite get as much to chew into, but his level-headed brooding certainly adds the emotional backbone of the film's plot. He's ultimately a soft-hearted guy, but he's not afraid to stand up for those he loves.I feel the music deserves a mention as well. The licensed music isn't my taste at all (Country music is just about the worst genre out there), but even I can't deny it's perfect for the tone and setting of this movie. What would a movie set in Texas be without a smattering of Country music? When it comes to the original music though, it's all wins. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis team up again and provide their quintessentially Western audio to a movie that deserves it. They don't particularly break new ground with mood or instrumentation, but the sharp shrieking violin is the perfect mood setter that fits right alongside the licensed Country music.Hell or High Water is a triumph of filmmaking. It's not a perfect home-run due to some pacing issues, but it shows an incredible amount of depth in a story that could've otherwise been a shallow bank robbery Western to shove on the pile. It's story of wealth is one that will hit home with many, and it's augmented with some fantastic characters and performances that bring them to life. I give Hell or High Water a brilliant high 8/10, and would definitely recommend it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 November 2016,8/10,"Don't be fooled by the cowboy hats as Hell or High Water (2016) is much more than just another western bank-robber adventure. It belongs with films like Money Monster (2016) and 99 Homes (2015) that are loaded with post-GFC themes, all scorching the underbelly of American capitalism. As a hybrid genre, it cuts across several cinematic boundaries to produce an action-packed semi- comedic yet darkly probing look at a society still reeling in the wake of the 2008 world financial meltdown.The story hinges on the pursuits of two brothers who rob several banks in the wild west of Texas. Toby (Chris Pine) is the likable one who wants to save his farm from mortgage foreclosure by a bank that still feeds off the sub-prime loan fiasco. Recently out of prison and far from likable, his brother Tanner (Ben Foster) is erratic after years of pent-up violence. As opposites they represent the yin and yang of capitalism, set against against dystopian landscapes of rusting cars, abandoned houses and poverty, beyond which are desert-scapes still beautiful despite human presence. Their fox-smart nemesis is a Texas Ranger called Marcus (Jeff Bridges) who is about to retire and wants to snare one more before handing in his badge.In many ways, the details of the robbing and running play second fiddle to the bigger picture that is painted in this film. Seeing the two modern-day Robin Hoods exacting revenge on the system that causes so much injustice and pain is an innately satisfying spectacle. Except for Tanner's violent tendencies, their crimes are victimless once we accept the premise that banks are evil. Several other narrative strands weave the larger story about today's wild west. Marcus has a part- Comanche deputy called Alberto (Gil Birmingham) whom he mercilessly teases on racial lines in a nasty throwback to white supremacy. It is hard to miss the bitter irony of former Indian land stolen by cowboys that is now stolen by banks, a twist that leads us inexorably to side with the bank- robbing brothers.Outstanding cinematography and fine acting performances are the film's great strengths. Portrait- like framing shifts seamlessly from wide panoptic views to close-ups of craggy age-lines and worried glances, all in a colour palette that glows like desert skies. The storyline has varied pacing that captures both the slow clock of desert living and the danger of life on the run. The principal actors are cast perfectly and bring authenticity and nuance to their roles. This is a visually engaging and thematically rich film with an unexpectedly enigmatic ending. It will undoubtedly find a place among the nominations for this year's best."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 March 2021,9/10,"A must see movie. It's quick paced, well acted and doesn't drag on at all. Very good story, if you haven't watched it stop what your doing and watch it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 January 2017,7/10,"The movie is engaging in its complete beginning. Sadly the flow breaks towards the end. All in all I was really looking forward to watch this movie, as the cast is just brilliant. Finally Jeff Bridges at his best.First of all, the setting and the overall topic is really interesting ‚Äì the bold and really sad looking America was already portrayed in ""No country for old men"" - but doesn't make the story better. Its about two brothers trying to make money by stealing money from banks. Bad boys vs. Police. Its nothing new. My hope was, that the actors would make at least the story better. But doesn't come true at all. The two brother brings an emotional depth into the story that are rare in the genre.I still really like the first half of the movie, which brings back the old western mood. Quiet and unexpected situations. Dialogues sometimes to long but memorable. I loved to watch it but felt bored in the second half."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 April 2020,7/10,"There is nothing wrong in this film. Pace may be slow somewhere, but it is actually a well made heist film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 August 2016,9/10,"Fiction is said to reach more truth by ignoring logic than the reverse. Not sure I agree but this movie is a strong argument in favor of that idea. There's a financial dilemma at this movie's core that I didn't really think made sense, but it quickly becomes beside the point.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers who have little reason to obey the law. Their family is losing the farm though there's a good chance there's oil there. Their bank wants to foreclose on the family to get the oil and the brothers think they can get the money to forestall the transfer by robbing small banks. Jeff Bridges is the Texas Ranger looking for retirement who wants one last notch on his belt.For me this played like an acting contest between Bridges and Pine, with Jeff perhaps just squeaking ahead of Chris near the end. This is no small feat, Bridges is masterful and Pine is just beginning his career. But both are excellent here. They both believe in this project and evoke West Texas types that ring true on several levels. It made me wish I had been born back there and it will make you long for that kind of life too."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 October 2016,8/10,"A superb screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) both in terms of structure and dialogue, is the backbone of this ultra-high quality genre movie. It features two double-acts, each on either side of the law: Chris Pine and Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. All four are excellent, in their very different ways. Pine here gets a role he must have been dreaming of for quite a while, where he can shine as an actor rather than a pretty face. His partnership with Thomas, who excels as his wired, wiry brother, is terrific. Jeff Bridges is great as ever as a shrewd Texas Ranger on the cusp of retirement, with a perfect foil in a stoical Gil Birmingham as his sidekick.The direction by David (Starred Up, Hallam Foe, Young Adam) Mackenzie is mostly laudable, with some excellent work in several getaway-car sequences. There are, here and there, some strange choices: an oddly truncated helicopter shot, the use of a hand-held camera for a simple, quite touching scene between Pine and Thomas, an eccentric final image (which I think may refer to missing evidence, but it's not at all clear). The music is mostly good, but sometimes gives away too much.Carping aside, it's an engrossing and entertaining movie, that pays its audience the compliment of considering them intelligent human beings."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 November 2016,9/10,"'Hell or High Water' is one of those films which doesn't do anything technically or storytelling wise that you haven't seen attempted before, however it so well directed, so well written and so well acted, that you can't help but be bowled over by it. This is one of the best modern westerns I have seen in the recent past. 'Hell or High Water' at the heart of it is about the failure of the American economic system. Like a few other films made after the great economic crisis of 2008, the film comments upon how there are many parts of America and the American population that the post 2008 financial recovery process has failed to touch. Just like the John Ford or Frank Capra films of the Depression Era, more than characters, it is the institutions like the banks that get vilified in 'Hell or High Water'. The motivation behind the crimes committed by Toby and Tanner has its roots in the past injustices done by the bank against their mother which adds to this theme. At the basic level what 'Hell or High Water' does by depicting the recession hit working class America is lift the veil of America's economic prosperity from the eyes of urban America and the world as a whole. When it comes to films about vigilantes, you can have something like Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde' which romanticises the actions of the characters, or you can have Terrence Malick's 'Badlands' where Malick cheekily makes fun of how mindless and reckless vigilantes/criminals/hell-raisers can accidentally find their way into folklore and mythic status. 'Hell or High Water' manages to remain reasonably neutral in its stance. Director David Mackenzie and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan show us both the sides. On one side they give us the motivations of the Howard brothers which are to some extent understandable. We also get these great side characters who are Texas residents and who somewhat side with the brothers from an idealistic standpoint due to their own financial misery and exploitation at the hands of the banks which makes them want to live vicariously through the brothers. However the other side of the moralistic divide is also represented by showing how easily things can go out of hand and lead to devastating consequences in these situations. The characters of the rangers, Marcus and Alberto help the narrative to give us the opposite point of view. Marcus and Alberto share a very brotherly relationship mirroring the relationship of the Tanner brothers. This is why when the film progresses towards its climax and we encounter fatal repercussions of the antics of Toby and Tanner, we understand the flip-side of vigilantism. David Mackenzie's direction is mature and gritty. He knows exactly how long to hold a shot and knows how much he can stretch and elongate a particular scene to infuse gravitas into it. He creates a brilliant dreary, desolate atmosphere. The streets and corners of the small Texas towns(although the film was shot in New Mexico) portray perfectly the presence of stagnation, a sense of disillusionment and apathy due to lack of progress and economic developments in the areas. Mackenzie makes some of the fields, the huge open spaces and ruinous locations look almost post-apocalyptic. He uses a lot of images of billboards with signs like 'Closing Down' or 'Debt Relief' at the side of the roads to further drive home the thematic backdrop of the story. The style of direction and the nature of the story itself has a very Coen brothers like feel to it and the viewer will be reminded of films like 'No Country for Old Men', 'Blood Simple', etc. But Mackenzie shows enough of his own flair to lift this from being blandly derivative. Taylor Sheridan has to be given a lot of credit for the depth of the screenplay. With 'Sicario' and now 'Hell or High Water', he has shown that he can use real socio-economic issues(drug war in Sicario) of the world as the backdrop of his screenplays and use such issues to enrich the surface level story lines. The intricate details of the script are very thoughtfully and intelligently written and they make a lot of sense.The acting is stellar. Chris Pine, just like he did in 'Z for Zachariah', drops his pretty boy status and plays a scruffy character with depth and gravity. He still retains the likability however which is also needed in this film to some extent. Ben Foster plays the live- wire Tanner and portrays the character with just the correct amount of energy and dynamism to prevent himself from going a bit too over- the-top. The chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham is great. Their conversations range from childish teasing to nuanced discussion on America's racial history. Bridges' character is lonely and awaiting retirement and he hides his fear of having to live a lonely life post retirement by constantly teasing Alberto(Gil). All the scenes involving Bridges and Birmingham are captivating.Only one minor flaw bothered me and it has something to do with the dialogue in a few scenes. Some of the lines exchanged between two characters in the film told me exactly what fate lied ahead for these characters. The foreshadowing was a little too on the nose for me and the characters met the exact respective fates that I knew they would due to this blatancy. 'Hell or High Water' is a fantastic film that keeps the viewer always on the edge and has something to say about contemporary American society which gives it pertinence. It is brilliantly directed, brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. The ending scene perfectly encapsulates the sphere of moral ambiguity that the film as a whole resides within. Highly recommended."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 July 2021,,"Had some slow burn type moments,but nothing to make you turn it off..
Overall cinematography,storyline,actors,acting & music was decent.Worth checking out!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2016,10/10,"Films like ""Hell or High Water"" are simply few and far between. A director who knows what he's doing, a writer who wrote an extremely tight script, and top-notch acting make this one you do not want to miss.Tanner and Toby Howard (both played remarkably by Ben Foster and Chris Pine) are two brothers whose mother has just passed. Texas Midlands Bank owns the mortgage on the house they occupy and they both know that oil has been discovered there. They decide to rob several different banks, pay off the mortgage, and in doing so, get even with the bank.Enter Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (played beautifully by Jeff Bridges). I do not believe I have ever seen Jeff Bridges in a movie I did not like. He is one of the few sensational actors left in Hollywood who tackles each of his roles with gusto. In this film, he comes across as the Texas Ranger (played by Tommy Lee Jones in ""No Country for Old Men"" and the codger in ""Gran Torino"" played by Clint Eastwood). Getting ready for his retirement, this is his last opportunity to feel like he still has live in him. He and his partner set out to catch the robbers.In a year of half-a$$ed attempts of ""blockbusters"" who exhibit no soul, this movie was like a breath of fresh air. As stated before, the acting--from top to bottom--ALONE makes this a must-see. And if that doesn't sell it for you, the scene with the punk at the filling station sold it for me.Rated ""R"" for violence and language, ""Hell or High Water"" is definitely a 10. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 March 2017,8/10,"Directed by David MacKenzieStarring Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff BridgesOverall: I went into this movie thinking it would be awful... I left very pleasantly surprised. It's not a perfect movie but it's a fantastic take on a heist movie.Good:1. A well told and engaging story.2. Jeff Bridges does a fantastic job throughout, even if I think he was a little too light hearted at points.3. Chris Pine and Ben Foster do great as the two brothers and bring a level of realism and relatablity to the role.4. I adore the cinematography in this movie.5. I also love the music in the movie and thought it served well.6. Perfect set and costume design.Bad:1. While reasonably enjoyable, I thought that the 'action' scene near the end was pointless and didn't need to be in the movie.2. I also that a decent chunk of the movie could have been left out.3. Jeff Bridges comedic remarks can ruin some scenes and does disturb the overall tone at points. I get having SOME humour to break it up but cracking a joke mere minutes after your partner was killed is pushing it.8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,7/10,"A battered car carries two bruised brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) across a desolate post-industrial borderland. Passing billboards advertising debt relief and loans, they make their way to the bank. It's the first of many they will rob at gunpoint. On their tail is Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), three months from retirement and looking for a hobby. What better way to pass the time than guessing the Howard brothers' next move? He's joined by his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham), and together they will chase Toby and Tanner, all the while wondering why the youngsters would want to steal cash when their family is sitting on an oilfield. Could the motivation go beyond simple greed?Hell or High Water is the ninth feature from director David Mackenzie, and it follows his excellent prison drama Starred Up. As with that film, ostensibly there's little here we've not seen before, but it's pulled off with such confidence and control that it seems effortless, making for an effortless watch. For a film about post-9/11 shattered ideals it's a very accessible and humorous package. Taylor ""Sicario"" Sheridan's script is surprisingly banter-filled and funny, to the point where one could argue the emotional impact of the climax is somewhat undermined. Indeed, the final confrontation is comfortingly predictable more than tense, its ambiguity mild compared with, say, Tommy Lee Jones's hauntingly sad dream speech ending from No Country for Old Men.The Coen Brothers' masterpiece is but one touchstone for Mackenzie. Also referenced is Michael Mann's Heat: the concurrent story lines with their inexorable slide toward violent resolution; and the idea of honour existing equally among thieves and cops. I was also reminded, in the ageing lawman and the righteous criminal, of Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, not least in the brazen reminders that our antiheroes are fighting back against a system constructed to screw over the everyman.The idea of such decency and honour is fanciful, naturally, but fantasy is part and parcel of the mythologizing of what we might call the New Old West. This is a scorched landscape of masculine archetypes. Like John Boorman with Deliverance, Mackenzie is a foreigner painting on an all-American canvas; and he's joined by fellow outsiders Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, composers who've touched the broken heart of the American Dream before in The Assassination of Jesse James and The Road. Their subtle score here takes a back seat to a dark acoustic playlist. Ben Foster can do unhinged-meets-vulnerable in his sleep, although this is Chris Pine as we've not really seen him. He's fine, if occasionally coming across as stolid when striving for ambivalent. Bridges is the growling, grumbling goodie version of True Grit's Rooster Cogburn. Marcus's banter with Alberto is fun at first, though after a while I found his racist barbs as wearying as the receiver himself does. Regardless, in both pairings ‚Äì brothers or partners ‚Äì a sense of well-worn chemistry is evident.For fans of modern Westerns such as No Country and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, this is pretty much required viewing, even if expecting the sheer existential weight of those films may be pushing expectations too far. A well-intentioned morality tale, Hell or High Water has enough deadpan humour, familiar characterisation, and well-crafted action scenes to please genre aficionados and mainstream audiences alike."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 September 2018,8/10,"I enjoyed this film, but it is nothing new and far from original. Ben Foster plays his typical out of control psycho role for the millionth time. Jeff Bridges mumbles through the movie and does his typical Brando imitation. Assorted peculiar characters and psychopaths come in and out of the movie and again, it is nothing new. Enjoyable and entertaining; yes. A classic film? Far from it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 November 2016,7/10,"Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine) Howard are two brothers, the first ex-con the other recent divorc√©e, who go on a bank robbing frenzy in the landscape of small city Texas. When ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is charged to chase them down, he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) find they're having a harder time in catching the cons than they expected.The buzz surrounding this film since it came out has been unbelievable so when I finally got the opportunity to screen this film I was beyond excited, especially considering the talent involved and how much I have loved some of the films that have come out in the post-Western genre, which has come to establish itself in the last decade. ""Hell or High Water"" fits right into the very best the genre has to offer and might even have consolidated this new genre by itself, yet even considering that I must declare myself partially underwhelmed by the lack of adrenaline and drama that I was able to grasp from the film. This is a very solidly crafted movie, but not one that I would personally call a great of the year. I am almost sure that when looking back to this era of cinema in the future and when it will be taught in film schools, ""Hell or High Water"" will be one of those films to be quoted a lot. It really does have an aesthetic that has been prevalent in the last few years: from ""No Country for Old Men"" to ""True Detective"" you can see where the film is coming from, but what is truly remarkable is how this one manages to distinguish itself from everything it came before and establish its own beautiful visual rhythm with some splendid long takes and a very specific color palette that does not deprive itself of bright tones, giving us a look that we have not quite seen done this way before and giving the story new meaning by doing so. One should talk about the four great performances that are at the heart of this picture and how each of the actors manages to disappear in his role with flawless accents, yet what truly sticks out here and what is the takeaway from the feature is just how beautifully it is crafted, how it flows from start to finish without ever giving the audience a moment of dullness even in its very calculated and slow pace and just how incredible the cinematography is, from the great landscapes to the kinetic action sequences, my breath was taken away at what I was beholding. Now, whilst the writing does do a great job in the world-building, giving secondary characters important roles and relevant commentary, in being darkly comedic to the perfect edge and using dialogue to reveal character, I can't help but notice a big void in the emotional connections and payoff the film gives. Just as its landscapes it really is a little stale. Now, Taylor Sheridan is probably the biggest upcoming screenwriter in Hollywood and I owe him nothing but admiration and respect, I only think that whereas is something like ""Sicario"" the archs of the characters were clear and when you were hit with payoffs it carried weight and emotion, here Sheridan's craft leaves you a little behind in feeling or taking away much. Still this is by no means a bad script and MacKenzie's prowess in filmmaking, his sheer power in communicating with visuals is so majestically on display here it is hard to come out without having something to think about."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 February 2017,8/10,"A modern western of quality, when I say modern, I mean it's a Western thing that happens in 20I6, yes, that's possible and ""At any cost"" is proof of that, a film with a smell and flavor of the western, with action , Duels, weapons, hats and Texas, but also with feeling. The film tells the story of Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), two bandits who make assaults on bank boxes and their executioners, the film works on this quest for cat and mouse of the two nuclei . The film tries to pass a moral about not being villains or good guys, in the western, these concepts does not exist, there is only who draws the gun first, the film is great at doing this, even if it happens in the current times, we also have brushstrokes about seeing all Points of view and a criticism of the abandonment of the cities of the interior that are still sunk in the economic crisis of 2008. The photography is great, full of aerial plans, with a palette of colors that pulls red, the climate is hot, photography Is urban and at the same time gives a complete sense of solitude, with a spectacular soundtrack, full of country, you want to pack and move to Texas, the track gives the tone of the movie several times, can even play once or Another at wrong times, but it is always a treat anyway. Chris Pine does a good performance, nothing special, he fulfills his role, Ben Foster is well out of tune, his performance is bad and it is not the movie, the gold here is Jeff Bridges, who Acts more physically with his face, full of postures, while sitting, walking, looking, he is a legitimate cowboy, does not deserve the Oscar, but deserved the indication. And a compliment to David Mackenzie who knows how to record moving scenes like no one else. Finally ""At any cost"" is a good movie, for the lovers of the western has a much more special taste."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 November 2016,8/10,"I have lived and worked in West Texas. That may be New Mexico you see doubling as the desolate desert of this dreary and depressing chunk of the country in ""Hell or High Water"". But trust me, you'd be hard pressed to notice any damn difference.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play a pair of bank robbing brothers who draw the ire and the hot pursuit of on-the-doorstep-of-retirement Texas Ranger Jeff Bridges. All three actors are superb in their respective roles. Particular kudos gotta go to the hunky Pine, however. The guy is practically unrecognizable here, and for my money gives us the best performance of the trio as the kid brother, a still-waters-run-deep kinna dude with a steely gaze and a heart of gold.If you like your cops and robbers playing a winner take all cat and mouse game in the wild west type of flick, then you are almost surely gonna get a charge out of ""Hell or High Water"". And if none of this sounds like your shot of sarsaparilla, then you're likely what they call out in this sun scorched neck of the sagebrush one of them there ""downstream folk"", pardner."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 September 2016,7/10,"Cowboys in 2016. That's what this is all about. The backdrop of dust and oil wells..those big American signs by the side of the road..Diners..Big hats..Fat policemen..the list goes on of what we expect in a movie like this...and it delivers it all.Excellent work by the 4 mains..Bridges is as good as it gets in this and Ben Foster is incredible.Chris Pine also shows us the hes really coming into his own .Beautifully filmed and directed, this reminded me of last years Sicario..then I read it's the same writer.Broods along and unwinds while keeping you informed and entertained all the way.I must also add that the extras in this are marvelous and add so much.The musical score is also brilliant and this needs to be seen on the big screen..so catch it before it's too late."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,8/10,"'Hell or High Water' is a bit of an odd duck. Mainly because it got a wide release. This is the only great film that has released in 2016 that got a wide release. I mean, there are only four or five films that I thought have been really great and all of them have either got basically no theater release or a limited viewing. I truly hope that this spurs more films like it though. More well crafted movies that actually have characters you can get invested in. There have been so many films this year that have completely failed due to poor character writing. Now, this film isn't perfect. So lets just get the negatives out of the way before we get into what makes this great.There aren't many problems here. The only big issue for me lies in the films story. It's really not that good. Once you step back to examine it, it's actually pretty by the numbers. If you've seen any heist movie ever than you probably know where this film is going. It follows a very standard formula that rarely deviates from it's by the numbers approach.But it wasn't until I took a step back that I noticed it. That's due to how well executed it is. It's one of those films that's so finely crafted that you don't really notice it's issues. That's what I loved about the film. It has such great characters that the familiar beats it hits actually feel genuine. Because you get to know these people and you feel like their choices matter to what's happening on screen.Which came as a breath of fresh air in a time when films have become so predictable and convenient. Our three main characters are played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. Who were all at their very best for this movie. Foster was the weakest of all but when acting across from Bridges, is hard to really stand out. Yet, that is exactly what Chris Pine does. I have never seen him give this kind of performance.I'm glad to see him taking on nuanced roles that legitimately show his range. It felt almost like his performance in 'Z for Zachariah' but he's far more compelling to watch here. Which really adds to his character. He is the one that you have to feel for most. And his sad yet determined personality really pushed you through the film.On the other end, Ben fosters character introduced the most conflict to the film. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into his character much but the film respected him enough to not make him the bad guy. It's so easy to make a character like that the films bad guy but he never becomes that person. It respects its characters enough to make them humans with problems instead of saying this guys the bad one and this guy is the good one.And it's all shot and directed with the utter most care and effort. With nearly every shot you can feel the attention to detail and the work put into making this the way it is. It may not be Alejandro Inarritu levels of ingenuity but I loved seeing effort being put into making the film. It's very rare to see great directing and inventive cinematography in wide release films like this.'Hell or High Water' is rare breed. It's a great film that got a wide release. There is a lot of love and care put into this and it shows. It's well shot, directed nicely, has a solid score, is brilliantly acted, and offers excellent characters. This is definitely worth going out and seeing. That being said, It falls just short of being amazing. The story is pretty by the numbers and it's ending doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do. However, it remains a great film and is definitely worth supporting in theaters."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 December 2016,8/10,"A heist thriller packaged as a contemporary western with solid performances, dry humor and a social commentary on the effects of unguarded and insensitive capitalism. While it offers nothing new in terms of plot, narrative or screenplay - it more than makes up through confident direction, well defined character arcs and excellent performances throughout. Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) are estranged brothers who led completely different lives - one (Toby) as a doting son, caring husband and father, while the other (Tanner) has been on the wrong side of the law from the beginning who has spent most of his time in various prisons for petty thefts and robberies. When the bank announces to foreclose their property due to unpaid debts just when Toby discovers oil in their farm, he is desperate to get possession of it before it is reclaimed by the bank forever. Toby comes up with a plan to rob the same bank (multiple of its branches) and seeks assistance from his brother Tanner who regularly agrees. What happens when the plan is set in motion and a retiring police chief Marcus from a small town starts investigating.Chris Pine was a revelation in this role. While it is not intense or award worthy, he does complete justice by portraying a stubborn, meticulous and sometimes desperate man to get over with what they started. Jeff Bridges has some of the best lines though they range from being insensitive to downright racist - he surely offends Indian tribes, blacks, mexicans etc. along the way. But the dry humor he evokes along with his Indian partner are worth a second watch. The screenplay plays down many intense sequences to ensure they do not get sopped down or become melodramatic which would be inconsistent with the overall theme. The setup, the screenplay that reveals the plot without the characters saying it as a narrative shows the ability of the director about the confidence and the intensity shown in the 2013 'Starred Up' was a testimony to his talent. Jeff Bridges is one of the better contemporary Hollywood actors and his choice of roles has always been that extract maximum performance within the mainstream cinema. Ben Foster plays a very generic not so bright but trigger happy ex-con which has been played over many times but still done as good as it could be.Sometimes innovation is not the only answer to standout. Perfection and old school intensity does work too."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 October 2018,7/10,Hell or high water. Modern day western about two brothers who need to rob banks in order to keep the family heirloom. Jeff Bridges plays the Tommy Lee Jones character from no country for old men (better than TLJ). Superb score by Nick Cave. Excellent acting. Very atmospheric. A little far fetched. A very enjoyable 7 and a half out of ten.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2020,1/10,"If you dig that movie, you'll like this one. If you don't, leave it taking dust."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 November 2016,6/10,"Hell Or High Water its a beautiful Neo-Western that will captivate you from start to finish, it will take you into its own story, its own characters, its own mood.The film its brilliant at creating an atmosphere, its very moody and quiet, you can hear dogs barking, the wind blowing, cars passing by, its just magnificent. The score its great, very fitting for a western like this, the writing its great too, its not too comedic or too dramatic.The acting its amazing, Chris pine, Jeff Bridges, everyone else its great too, even the people who have a small part in the film are great and memorable.The cinematography its amazing, just amazing, so great, but it doesn't distract you from the film. Some people say that the film its very derivative, but I don't think so, the film does its own thing, is its own world. The film its a bit slow at times, but it just takes a while to sink in your mind, let me tell you, it will get stuck in your head for a while."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 April 2020,8/10,"A fine modern western, which doubles as a cops and robbers movie. I sometimes felt that it didn't quite get the notice it deserved, despite good reviews and awards. The performances by the three leads are all exceptional, though Bridges has rarely been better. (He almost seems born to play a Texas Ranger.) Though the film is set in West Texas, it was apparently shot in New Mexico, and to great effect. The flatness of the landscape and its small towns are one of the films best features."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 February 2017,9/10,"If you're going to make a movie based in West Texas about the destruction of the agrarian economy and the way the banks rape the poor and why so much of the American heartland has turned into a ghost town husk of what it once was, what better way to embellish the moments than to include the songs of artists like Ray Wylie Hubbard, Scott H. Biram, Colter Wall, and Chris Stapleton in it. These are the men who've witnessed the destruction first hand and sing about it regularly.Hell or High Water, written by Taylor Sheridan, directed by David Mackenzie, and starring Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster, and Chris Pine, is a Neo-Western story about two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree to help keep the family farm in the family. Soundtrack and score writers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also included classic country cuts from Waylon Jennings and Townes Van Zandt in the film, answering the question for many traditional/independent country fans what it would feel like to witness a modern-day big budget movie with all of your favourite artists comprising the soundtrack. The answer is it's pretty damn cool.But Hell or High Water is much more than just a vehicle for good music. David Mackenzie has taken his little film with a cool soundtrack and made it one of the most critically-acclaimed flicks of the season, shining a greater spotlight on the artists and songs that are deftly interwoven with the story, and in moments with haunting and auspicious timing. Independent music artists know that awards aren't everything, but if Hell or High Water wins big at the Oscars, it will be no small bragging rights for the musicians involved.The film moves a little bit slow at the beginning, struggling to create the adrenaline rush you would anticipate from scenes of bank robberies and high-speed getaways. It takes a while for the viewer to find a personal connection with the main characters, and despite the true-to-life and naturally-poetic setting of West Texas, we've seen this many times before, and recently. The story of the retiring (or recently retired) lawman, in this case Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton played by Jeff Bridges, is a trope of many of these movies. Take Tommy Lee Jones in No Country For Old Men for example.When the intricacy of the plot of the two brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster begins to be revealed, and the relationship between them is given time to meld, this is when the movie begins to take hold, especially when their plan begins to race to a conclusion, and risks unravelling. This isn't your traditional Oscar- contending film in the sense that it isn't primarily intellectual or artistic in scope. These elements are certainly paid great deference, but this is a film of action, plot twists, and characters.Where Hell of High Water does play to the Hollywood mindset is how it re-imagines the whole Robin Hood story in a fresh and relevant light, despite the age and grit that encompass the story in its West Texas setting. This film could have been set in 1980 from how so many of the buildings, places, and people haven't changed. But the story is very 2017 in how legacy farms and ranches throughout the United States‚Äî and the family ties that have made them the harbour of memories for generations‚Äîare being threatened like never before by a modern-day banking system that does not account for how estate taxes and corporate farming do a disservice to the interests of independent land owners.As Hell or High Water works towards its conclusion, the lines between good and bad get blurred, and the moments and characters hold much more weight. Though the film feels like an outsider for Best Picture, and one you probably watch once and greatly enjoy but don't feel the need to revisit, it does sell you on the idea it should be in contention for the best in a given year.Often it is mourned that music awards shows are not more like the Oscars, where truly the best films and the best performances are and is rewarded as opposed to a simple acknowledgement of commercial success. Yet as we've seen in recent years‚Äîincluding an Oscar for Ryan Bingham in 2010‚Äîthe film industry can be a lucrative outlet for the artists that should receive accolades, but are often overlooked. Hell or High Water not only accomplishes this, it's one hell of a movie to get taken lightly. Let alone getting overlooked!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 November 2016,9/10,"Two brothers go full outlaw in series of robberies with a great plan behind their backs but not all goes as planned well not as we planned. After like half movie just developing a huge plot that was a in couple scenes great and intense but sometimes slow, it kicks off high in second half of the movie. Everything gets darker as brothers separated and one is now escaping police and second one is trying to get out of town. Car scene was a pretty intense and there was a great build up to the scene. Other brother in hills was absolutely mad, filled with great action, some of the amazing shooting and unexpected moments as well as real violence. Then movie takes the higher road to more profound plot development and some of great scenes alongside with plot dialogues and scene pressure. Jeff was absolutely incredible in movie as he is funny, the joking guy, but also a very calm and determined ranger, great performance. Ben and Chris are also very good with their problems and emotions involved deeply and they played it great. Script was amazing with great dialogues and some of the great scenery. 3.5/4"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2019,7/10,"351. Hell or High Water. Have you ever wondered what a classic western style story would be like filmed today without much done to update the script? No, me either, until I realized that's exactly what I was watching... Story about two bank robbing brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, raising enough cash to keep the bad bank man from taking the farm. Ya see, they struck oil on that land, not much, but enough to get by. Toby is the smart one, doing bad things for good reasons. Tanner is the wild card, doing bad things just to do bad things, but deep down, doing it for his brother! But coming up quick behind them is the law, Texas Ranger kinda law!! The old sheriff, Marcus Hamilton, just about to retire, and through pretty much intuition alone ends up in the right places at the right times, and with Marcus his Native American partner, Alberto, who is assaulted by the racist humor of the sheriff all day, but deep down, there's a bromance going on! And as Tanner and Toby continue their bank robbing ways, Tanner gets a little cocky takes on a bank full of people, shots fired, they barely escape with their lives, the townsfolk round up an armed posse to go after them chasing them up the road, but right around the corner is the sheriff, because deep down he knew where those pesky Howard boys were gonna strike next leading up to the ultimate showdown between the Texas Rangers and a couple of law breaking cowboys!! So this takes place in modern day, but it had the classic western set up. So if you're looking for a modern day western, go for it, looking for Heat, or Point Break, i'd say probably not.

HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 December 2016,8/10,"This film at its core is an extremely simple story of two brothers robbing banks without getting caught by the law/ Jeff bridges character. This film is actually quite surprising in the fact that it can have a lasting hold on you even with a simple premise, it is how it has been executed is the reason for that. Firstly the cast who are all on their top game for this film, Ben Foster is a crazy, wild and without limits ex convict who plays the brother of Chris Pine's character who is 180 degrees opposite. This contrasting character elements works fantastically well and shows and interesting and at some times testing relationship between the two of them. The character that Ben Foster portrays sort of reminds myself of the villain the Joker from Batman, for the reason that he does whatever he wants and doesn't care about the repercussions of his actions. The character is incredibly unpredictable which makes for great viewing as you have know idea what he will do. As for Chris Pine's character he is the 180 degrees opposite, he is quite, thoughtful and caring at heart. This all makes it very easy for the audience to resonate with the situation he is going through and make you want him to succeed even though what he is doing is illegal. Finally Jeff Bridges who is fantastic as a xenophobic and stereotypical cop, who is 100% focused in bringing the brothers to justice whatever that may be. He has the aura of a quite brutal and aggressive person on the outside but as the film goes on a more personal and heart felt element of the character appears, especially with is partner who he has banter with. Even though sometimes the ""banter"" with his partner can be quite horrible and spiteful at times it makes you resonate with Alberto, played by Gil Birmingham, and the person difficult he has in there relationship. In a strange way this film brings this simple story and characters together in a way that makes for great intrigue and viewing to see the ups and downs of the relationships between both couples. The story,script and actors may all be the main reasons why this film is so good, however there is another reason and that is the directing by David McKenzie. He does a fantastic job with this film , considering the multiple elements and themes that this film occurs along its way. Whether it be from the heart pounding bank robberies to the more quite intimate moments between the characters this film never sits still and has a very good flow to it. McKenzie also does a really good job of making the location looks beautiful when it needs to be and really dark and unpleasant during rough times in the film. It is a real testament to the talent that this director is by showing the exact same location, i.e. Texas, it two very different points of view. Finally this film has a quite surprising ending I personally didn't see it coming which refreshing to see. It may be surprising but in a way it closes and ties off all the avenues of this film, but at the same time does leave one open for mystery and suspense which always a bonus in a film of this nature.This film is 80% out of 100, it has great performances from everyone a good simple but effective story and great directing, definitely worth a watch and would not be a waste of your time."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 January 2019,9/10,"01/03/2019 Exceptional movie/storyline, excellent, life like acting, especially Jeff Bridges (he definitely made this movie great). Realistic good guys versus realistic bad guys. Do NOT pass this movie by, it's one of the hidden gems we look for. Bon Appetit"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 September 2019,8/10,"It was a solid movie. Great acting and directing. The cinematography felt right. At no time did it lose my attention. The story unfolded well and explained its self in time. It left me with a sad feeling which I think is what it intended. I didn't give it a higher score because it just didn't have that something special say in comparison to "" No Country for Old Men"" but it's definitely a solid film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,10/10,"Any movie with the Texas Plains, cowboy towns and Texas music has me at hello. Ben Foster and Chris Pine bring absolute realism to their roles as redeemers against the villainous Bank while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham as lawmen have you standing next to them throughout the movie. Some of the scenes from the diners are just wonderful and there is one in particular with an ornery old waitress that could go down as one of the best ever. Woven throughout the fabric of the movie is the theme of a dying Texas, a sense of hopelessness that the good times are gone forever, it is quite a sad thread to be sure. I've seen quite a few Texas movies and I have lived there for some time. I have to say that Texas ain't America, it's just a place that happens to be attached to America and I think it's a reluctant attachment. I'm sure they could do better on their own! The music is so good it almost has you crying, but then again all Texas music can do that to you if it's dropped into the right scene. Here it's done with such a deft touch that you'd think it was written specifically for the movie. To summarize, this is the best ensemble cast since ""No country for old men"" Bridges is at his best (or even better)and the rest of the actors are right up there with him. The plot,although it's been used before in many forms, is unfolded in a way that makes it seem like it's a brand new idea. The fantastic music and the hardscrabble scenery have you walking along with the story, so in a way you get your exercise while you're watching. Well worth the money I'd say!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 November 2016,10/10,"A great film whose final confrontation is worth the entire movie. Marvelous performances, great scenery and above all a wondrous story.Its Texas accent's based dialogue is so penetrating that I went on speaking (and thinking) like that for two days after watching the movie.Taylor Sheridan (you can see him in a cameo role 'racing a fire to the river with a herd of cattle') wrote a modern masterpiece, that somehow reminds of 'In The Heat of the Night, 1967', but full of originality and made of better, more evolved characters.Totally 10."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2019,3/10,"I was very excited to view this film, after having read about how good it was. I found a film that was not compelling or even mildly interesting, lazily acted and shot in what appears to be the armpit of the planet. The 'story' was silly. The two brothers were annoying and uninteresting redneck scum. The two cops were mildly interesting, but their schtick wore very thin very quickly. After seeing the wonderful Wind River and the pretty good Sicario, I expected much more from Taylor Sheridan's script. Actually, , and to be fair, I did not watch the entire movie, so, if it got better after the first forty minutes or so, well shame on me!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 February 2020,10/10,"I studied westerns in school, so I have some academic knowledge of them. And of all the westerns I have seen, this is my favorite. It is one of the only ones I have enjoyed so much that I watched it multiple times. It is very well done, great story, great actors, lots of action, lots of drama, very intense. Just an amazing movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 October 2021,7/10,This movie is really entertaining. Two brothers robbing banks and stores from town to town one after another until the police catch on and start getting heat. They botch a bank robbery and soon a town and the police come after to try and stop them. The movie is really entertaining and good but it didn't feel as emotional as it was intending to be. Still a good film definitely recommend.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 October 2016,8/10,"Taylor Sheridan wrote the screenplay for Sicario and he seemed to have an uncanny ability to dish out hair-pulling tension through clich√© scenes seen a million times. With Hell or High Water, he proved he is no fluke, and it is a better film than Sicario on so many levels. The story couldn't be more simple...Two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster), rob banks. Hot on their heels are two Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is on the last leg of his job before retirement and his Native American partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).The film involves elements of a crime thriller and the chase but it is essentially character studies of not one but two pairs of mismatched relationships. Their arcs intertwined so seamlessly that I wasn't just rooting for the brothers to get away, I was also hoping the Rangers catch them! I can't remember the last time I was rooting for both polar-opposite gun-toting parties in a movie. How the film succeeds in being different with familiar characters is one of its awesome move-sets (sorry, I am still in Pok√©mon Go mindset :)). It does it by giving them divine purposes which I will not divulge, but I will just say this is in the territory of The Big Short all over again where the banks are the biggest robbers of hardworking folks in the sun-drenched land of West Texas. The film is a masterful meditation and evocation of time, place, character, moral stakes, immoral choices and brotherly love. The music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis fits the ambiance to a T and is startlingly emotive, stark and melancholic. The dialogue is stellar, at times it is the silent spaces between words that speak louder. The banter is confident and many times darkly funny. Just listen and marvel at Marcus' constant racist jibes at his partner. The simple return by Alberto would be a punch to Marcus' face but no, we get an occasional return uppercut jibe back at Marcus' ignorance. The dialogue between the two of them feels lived-in. These are two buddies who have probably worked together longer than their marriages and they can take each other's nonsense because they can see through the racism to the weakness. On the other hand, Toby and Tanner's bond is drawn through contrast. Tanner is hell-bent on violence and can't seem to stand out of trouble, but he is always mindful of his brother's objective and in the end he shows what it means to lay down your life for your brother. All the nuanced and textured performances are stirring, none more so than Chris Pine's. Goodness me, I have seen him in so many movies but I be hard-pressed to say that he can actually act beyond having that handsome mien and melting blue eyes. But here Pine shows his surprising range with his grizzled and laconic look. It is a role he nails it with perfection. This is a big step-up to a new level for him that I never knew possible. Talking about the four main characters, I have to mention a minor one that is so great I am sure where she is now she will probably be a cult figure from on out. Watch out for a scene in the only restaurant in a small washed-out town as a waitress takes the order from the two Rangers. Her first line is ""alright, what do you NOT want?"" I laughed so hard my sides hurt. Her execution of the barrage of words is perfect and the reaction from the two unsuspecting Rangers priceless. This is one of those rare films that the moment it is over you begin to wonder what will happen to the characters and you would wish so hard the scene would just continue. No, it isn't an open ending. Every character experiences their closure but you will love and pity them so much that they will continue to live in your consciousness. This is a gem of a movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 February 2017,3/10,"Someone told me this was a really good movie. They lied.What a painfully slow, depressing movie. If this is what west Texas really looks like, it is one gawd awful hole. Filthy, depressing, and full of ugly people. With that as the backdrop, it's no wonder this movie sucked!The acting was good, and Jeff Bridges is always fun. But the characters had no redeeming qualities. I didn't care what happened to any of them. And the two main characters were stupid; well, at least the one brother was.I was really disappointing in this, especially considering it came highly recommended. Oh well. Live and learn."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 May 2019,8/10,"Mackenzie helms his best film to date. Sheridan's screenplay is flawless. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. Pine, Foster and once again Bridges deliver superlative performances. This is a virtuous drama / thriller set in modern day Texas. Pine and Foster portray two characters at the opposite sides of the spectrum but whose brotherhood outweighs all else. Toby is a divorced honest father and his older brother Tanner is an ex-con. The film starts out explosive as the two brothers set out to commit a series of bank robberies in order to save the family ranch. Toby is in it strictly for his family but Tanner is in for more. He is a thrill seeking reckless outlaw. The brothers pull off a series of daring well planned robberies which catches the eye of a Texas Ranger. Bridges portrays Marcus, a cunning retiring Texas lawman whose seen and done it all. Marcus' innate abilities quickly put him on the trail of the bandits. The brothers have laundered the stolen money, buried the getaway car and returned to the family ranch. They ingeniously have a check made out to the bank that holds a mortgage on the ranch which has now been discovered to be rich in oil. Toby is hell bent on keeping the ranch in the family so that his ex-wife and children can live comfortably. The plan is to now rob one last bank which is a branch of the bank that holds the mortage that they deposited the check into. It is a brilliant duplicit act of justice for the brothers. Eventually Marcus, having the gut instinct to be at the right place at the right time, catches up to the brothers after the heist goes awry and innocent people are killed by Tanner. An epic western showdown occurs with only one brother surviving. Marcus visits the ranch at the end, which is now producing more money in a month from it's wells than all the robberies combined. He has a candid conversation with the surviving brother and the brother suggest they continue their conversation soon which leaves the ending ambiguous. In this viewer's opinion Marcus and Toby will meet up again come hell or high water. It's a masterful examination of the lawless versus the law. This film is intense, gritty, raw, blazing, realistic, violent, poetic, memorable and has a cathartic ending. This is a bravura work of art and one of the finest films in it's genre."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 January 2017,7/10,"This movie is more than just about two rather sympathetic men robbing banks and an old blabbermouth of a cop trying to catch them. It's much rather about the context of the events, about the people who aren't directly involved but still have their say. And what they say is ""screw you"" to the system, a say that, as we could see in the last months, spreads far beyond the small Texan towns.However, giving a glimpse at some sore social and economical spots of the modern US isn't enough to make the movie stellar. And while Hell or High Water is without a doubt a solid product, with a plot that doesn't crumble and some mature acting from the people you might not expect it from (Chris Pine, for instance, definitely exceeded my expectations, and it was refreshing to see him take on a grown-up role for a change), it still lacks somewhat in terms of artistic design.Yes, the social and political message is reiterated over and over, loud and clear, but the story itself remains just a bit too shallow, giving you not enough moral choices to make things complicated. What if Jeff Bridges' character was less of a grumpy old fart constantly ridiculing his partner? What if the Howard brothers were less handsome or had sightly uglier motives or execution style? Maybe it would be less appealing to root for the ""good guy pushed to the edge by the unjust circumstances"". And while it would've definitely made things more twisted, it would have also made this flick more intriguing and exciting to watch.Well, maybe it wasn't the case. But even if Hell or High Water comes short in regard to artsy dilemmas, it's still right on about the Texan lifestyle, hard as nails, and about the people who live it straight, on both sides of the law. And that's definitely good enough to consider those 102 minutes well-spent."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 October 2016,10/10,"i rarely feel i've seen a 'perfect' movies...but this one was one of those... i may've been prejudiced going in since it has one of my all time favorite actors, jeff bridges, in a leading role...but it was soooooooooo much more than that... it had, pretty much, EVERYthing...dialogue, characterizations, great action, political commentary, good photography and editing...and commentary on America today. especially the fate of 'old cowboys'... on both sides of the line... interestingly enough, the story hasn't changed THAT much...it just seems that the 'common person' has the ability to be more well informed. thereby, more poetic/eloquent. i don't mind that it seemed that maybe the action part, expecting it to make it more popular with the nonintellectual/sport crowd, was just a come on in order to present the political commentary... in any case, this is one to see. a classic straight outta the box..."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 September 2016,10/10,"This film kind of came out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers for it a couple of weeks ago, but the immediate hype was intriguing so I was eager to watch this as soon as it was released. First thing I do after watching this is head straight for the shop and grab myself some bottled American lager (well, brewed under licence but it's the closest I'm gonna get.) I get home, crack one open and sit there thinking about what I've just seen. First and only film I've seen of director David McKenzie was his grim British prison drama, Starred Up, which was incredibly good. And I was mesmerised by last year's Sicario which is written by the same Taylor Sheridan so it's a win-win combination already without adding the cast. The story delves deeper than a couple of brothers committing bank robberies across west Texas, it's almost political and opens the field to a broader history in a realistic manner, but leaves you sitting on the fence with regard to who's the bad or good guy and in fact, proves either can be both giving the circumstance. We follow the Howard brothers Tanner and Toby, Tanner played ruthlessly by Ben Foster as the impulsive, trigger-happy ex-con and Chris Pine playing Toby, the struggling, better, younger brother. Foster being a worn monster truck of brutal force whilst Pine is a filthy aged muscle car. Hot on their trail is soon-to-be retired Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, and his partner, who Hamilton continually ridicules about his heritage, Alberto Parker, played by Twilight's shape-shifting wolf, Gil Birmingham. The relationships within both pairs are highly captivating and with a strong sense of realism. Their performances being some of the best I've seen all year, and yes, Bridges ultimately delivers but that's expected, Pine is equally amazing, shredding all skin and hint of Capt. Kirk but Foster is the star here. Maybe slightly biased, liking Foster since 3:10 To Yuma as Charlie Brown, his portrayal is ferociously compelling. You can't help but like the character and I suppose that's the beauty of this film, all the characters have they're own likability, making it harder to choose who's side you'll be on just hanging in there for the outcome. The script is amazing, superbly written with some classic clever quotes, giving Ben Foster some of the best lines in the movie, actually providing elements of comedy. The confrontations in particular are enthralling, making great cinema. Tense, powerful with a perfectly balanced contrast between the action and downtime, the only constant is the dusty ambiance that leaves you with a gritty taste, I could almost feel the dirt on my skin. It's excellence doesn't end there, with a flawless choice of veterans of west American dramas Nick Cave and Warren Ellis who's collaboration has been on Lawless and The Proposition; and independently Ellis doing an eerie score for The Road and Cave composing a haunting one for The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford. The perfect pairing of score and soundtrack gives the film an air of melancholy, a sober tone that belongs to this story. Great cinematography, especially the panning shots, superb script writing and brilliantly violent. Accompanied with an excellent score and great performances from all. Perfectly paced from start to finish. This is a modern western, a must see movie, Hell or high water. Running Time: 10 The Cast: 10 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 10 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the outstanding performances from all four!

HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 March 2017,8/10,"""Hell or High Water"" is a movie that doesn't attract large audiences, hence why its theatrical release was quite small. But then again these kind of movies need to exist, and not only on home video. I would've enjoyed this one in a theater, but my only option was to wait for the DVD. Not that it's a bad movie to watch at home, it's certainly not.Everyone has already said that this movie feels like a western. They are right. They're not talking about gunfights, but simple, good characters in a certain environment instead. The characters are all at the verge of their destiny. As soon as the movie starts, you feel that there is an end sneaking upon these people, you instantly perceive these characters as tragic. Same with the environment: people are poor, losing their jobs and houses, these small desert towns are nearly empty. It's a perfect setting for a simple story.Don't think of ""Hell or High Water"" as an action movie. It won't deliver as such. Think of it as a character-driven little story. One could say it's a crime movie, but it's more like drama. It's a subdued drama, since it doesn't try to force you to care. It's not a pretentious tear-jerker designed to manipulate your feelings. The story and the characters have plenty of humanity. The struggles feel real and nothing is too much on the nose, which allows the characters (and actors) to breathe, to just do their job in a more natural manner.Everyone is very good in this movie. First of all, slow clap to Chris Pine. He's not just a pretty boy anymore, he really did a good job. But Ben Foster was simply great. I've been missing that guy. He's a really good actor, but doesn't seem to work that much and too often gets stuck in bad or mediocre movies. Not this time, good job Ben. Of course Jeff Bridges is really good, that's a given, but so is his partner Gil Birmingham. Everyone on the screen is good, even the few supporting actors and extras. It's rewarding to watch a movie where the actors can actually do their job, and where people responsible for the project actually care about the art form.I haven't seen any movies from director David Mackenzie, but after this I just might. The direction was solid, but so was Taylor Sheridan's script. Sheridan is someone who just came out of nowhere, seemingly. He scripted the great ""Sicario"", and now this. Hollywood, give this man jobs. All the jobs. I'm very interested in seeing his next movie. Good screenwriters are very, very rare nowadays.The movie is well-shot too. It's not trying to impress you, there aren't a lot of in-your-face fancy shots, but must like the movie itself, it's subdued and conveys a lot of expression nonetheless. The music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis was a welcome thing.I don't really have a lot of gripes about this movie. It didn't quite strike me as a modern masterpiece, so perhaps I would've wanted a little more...something. The ending left something to be desired, I guess. I would've hoped for a little more punch. Perhaps some more edge, excitement and sentimentality, but I also have to acknowledge that ""Hell or High Water"" was so good because it lacked some of these things. It could have felt forced and compromised otherwise.In conclusion, it's a very good movie. A well-crafted and charming film that's allowed to be what it is, and where the little things matter. I'm happy I bought it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 February 2017,9/10,"FINALLY! An original, awesome movie to watch with nary any superhero spandex or sequel-itis in sight.This thing had me right from the get-go. From the opening shot of Dale Dickey to the final (verbal) showdown between Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine, we got some great acting from great actors, many I was unfamiliar with. But I have been a fan of Ben Foster's since I first caught him playing a mentally challenged student in the pilot episode of ""Freaks and Geeks"" almost 20 years ago. And he also was stellar here as an ex- con with a grudge and ultimately a death sentence on his agenda.So sit back and watch some modern day ""Old West"" bank robbers tear it up in the good old dusty Southwestern U.S. of A. You can almost see the grit from the dirt roads emanating right off your TV set."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2016,7/10,"In small towns in Texas brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) rob banks but only take the loose cash in the drawers. Texas Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham), his deputy, can't figure out why only loose cash and not the bigger stuff. Marcus decides the brothers are too smart to take the bills that may explode on them. Marcus also decides the brothers are saving up for something. But what?You will find out why the brothers rob banks, and only take loose cash. And when you find out what they are doing and how they go about it, you will be impressed. It's really very clever. Of course, it's still wrong and criminal, but very clever. This is actually the big twist that Marcus comes close to solving, but cannot prove. The banter between Marcus and Alberto is annoying for the most part especially when Marcus throws insults at Alberto because he is part Indian and part Mexican. I suppose the insults were meant to be comic relief, but they were not funny and really had no place in here. We were not impressed. The banter between the brothers was okay - nothing special - but one must listen carefully as they will talk about the why of what they are doing. It is here you will learn everything. The acting all around was good. We would have liked to have seen more scenery and what was seen was impressive - just wished there was more of it. What are we talking? A few more seconds lingering on the landscapes? Could have been done. Hmmm¬Ö¬Ö¬ÖWe will learn that the brothers are told they must: come hell or high water be at a certain place at a certain time to accomplish what they set out to do. What could it be? Again, listen carefully to their banter. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, very briefly. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 January 2017,7/10,"""Hell or High Water"" is a tense, character driven modern western that subverts the classic western idea of the ""white hats versus black hats"" by showing the point of view of both the pair of robbers and the pair of sheriffs hunting those robbers. The opening shot of the film is probably my favorite of the year: it is seemingly a static shot as a car passes by, but suddenly the camera begins to dolly and rotate slowly, following a car that has just come into the town in the background, with glimpses of a woman getting out of her car in the foreground as the camera passes by her. The car in the background disappears behind a building as the camera begins to float behind the woman in the foreground going into that building. The scene climaxes with two men wearing ski masks and holding guns suddenly jumping out from behind the building just as she is about to open the door. The shot is slow (it lasts about a minute and a half long), but it is very suspenseful and intriguing, perfectly setting up the following scenes as the two men rob two banks together. One thing this film does very well is suspense. Each shot is pretty much the perfect length, and each intense scene has the perfect set up and just enough build up. The director knew exactly when and when not to use music during the scenes, especially during one suspenseful moment near the end that is made all the more suspenseful by the silence during the scene.Each character is given depth and each one you understand, even the most despicable one in the film. The two bank robbers are Toby and Tanner Howard, the latter being my favorite character and favorite performance of the film. They are brothers and it is insinuated that they had an abusive father, who Tanner eventually killed at a young age in order to protect his brother and mother. Tanner is an impulsive hothead, and after he went to prison he spiraled into a life of crime and even more prison, leaving Toby to deal with their property and their mother, who died recently. Toby is smart, thoughtful, and while he isn't perfect, he clearly feels sorry for what he is doing and feels empathy towards others. He doesn't see his ex-wife or his children very often, but he does care about them. The whole reason he is doing this in the first place is to help them financially and make sure his children don't go down the same path as him. Despite their hard times, Tanner and Toby do care about each other as well, and Tanner is basically only doing this for his brother. The sheriffs are more normal. Marcus is an old, experienced sheriff and a bit of a traditionalist. It is insinuated he had a wife, but she died, so all he really has left is his job. He goes on this hunt with Alberto, a half-Native American half-Mexican that has a wife and kids. He was forced to go on this hunt with Marcus and is constantly teased about his race by him, although he doesn't seem to be a serious racist (he genuinely cares about Alberto, even if it doesn't always seem this way).These characters slowly unfold to us and their situations each begin to make more sense. The film is study of these characters but also of the death of the ""old west"", but doesn't view that time period with rose colored glasses. At the same time, it views the death of this time as a tragedy, but only because the big banks are taking these people's lad and money. In fact, these banks are probably the only clear enemies in the film.The film has a very clear plot throughout and some very intense moments, but it is very much a dialogue driven film that has several great small moments and encounters that are pretty much inconsequential to the overall plot. The cinematography is often restrained but fantastic, with several long takes that are barely noticeable. It is a complex and very well written film with some very good direction and acting that is engrossing from beginning to end. I recall a single short scene in which I didn't like one small performance, but other than that the cast was great across the board. It is unpredictable and suspenseful but also quiet and somewhat poignant."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 January 2017,9/10,"Despite not completely succeeding in terms of blockbusters, 2016 was a year were the smaller films got to succeed and He'll of High Water is a perfect example of this. This is a highly original, tension filled and character driven film that I absolutely loved. Hell of High Water was a perfectly paced film, were thrown right into the situation and we keep at the same pace for the entire film as we witness these bank robberies, it's never slow enough to bore but it's not to fast so that it doesn't take the time to build its characters, all the characters in this film are perfectly developed, they all have crystal clear motivations for their actions and there are no light weights in this film. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both give the best performances of there entire careers in this film, they both feel like brothers who are very different but in many ways very similar, they had amazing chemistry and made for a perfect emotional drive for this film. But in terms of Character interaction Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham absolutely stole this movie, like Pine and Foster they both felt like they'd known each other for a long time, they were hilarious together and felt like true friends who poke fun at each other but ultimately trust one and other. The bank robberies all feel realistic, you feel the quick and rapid pace of them, the intensity it real and it have for a perfect representation of how differently Pine and Foster operate from each other. While many characters in this film do a lot of bad things there aren't really any villains in this film because we see all their different points of view and it ensures that their are no singular characters to get behind. It's also just terrifically entertaining, the action is very well filmed and makes this film a pretty good re watch for me. My only real issue with this film is the fact that, at times it's a bit emotionally manipulative, I understand that we're meant to get invested in the characters but at times it came across as just needlessly depressing. Hell or High Water was one of the best films of 2016, its got terrific performances, investing characters, well done action, a perfectly paced narrative and it's a film that completely invests you in its story. Despite being needlessly depressing at times this is an absolutely fantastic thriller. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 December 2016,8/10,"Two brothers (played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster) rob banks in order to make the payments on the family ranch that is about to be foreclosed by a bank. They need to come up with a certain amount, and then they'll be done and will no longer have to worry about money ‚Äî the family ranch has been found to contain a tremendous amount of oil that would provide an income to the owners of about $50,000 a month. Using multiple vehicles to do their illegal transfer of wealth, Pine and Foster attack the banks early in the morning to minimize resistance and witnesses. But Foster, an ex-con, has a wild streak; and he may be the one to provide the mistake that a Texas Ranger (played by Jeff Bridges) is depending on to get an edge on apprehending the brothers.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Hell Or High Water"" is the scene when Pine and Foster are being chased by armed civilians after the brothers robbed a bank ‚Äî this takes place in Texas, by the way. Sick of running, Foster stops his vehicle, grabs a fully automatic assault rifle, and just lights up the vigilantes. It is an awesome display of firepower from just one rifle and one man who knows how to use it.""Hell Or High Water"" is a good drama/action/suspense movie that will have some people rooting for the bad guys. The constant reminders of unemployment, billboards of ""easy"" loans and debt relief to those desperate for money, and of course, what we know of the government's and big banks' roles in the great financial collapse a few years ago¬Öit's easy to want Pine to get away with what he is attempting. Foster's character, on the other hand, is different animal.**SPOILER ALERT** I would have given this movie higher marks, but the shenanigan of Pine getting away with everything he's done is just too much to let go. The story offers a detailed but unsatisfying explanation as to why Pine remains free at the end, and it just does not ring true. With so much damage done, no way the law would allow this to be swept away and be happy to pin it all on Foster.‚Äî M"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 January 2019,9/10,"This film gives you a western kind off feel but it's very modern...a pair of brothers who's mother just died get together to save the ranch she had owned. She had remortgaged and had fat cat bankers foreclosing on it, money is needed fast as they are close to losing it. The older brother Toby is played by Chris Pine, he is divorced but the ranch has been left to his two sons. The younger brother just released from jail for robbery is Tenner played by Ben foster and he and Toby have to raise the money owed and fast.They decide to rob banks to get the money and not just any bank but the bank chain that are going to take the ranch. So it's kind off ironic that the money stolen from them is going to pay the debt off.Bring in a fab actor Jeff Bridges and throw him into the mix as an old law enforcer and a good story and you can't go much wrong.The film is action packed, a bit of dark humour, a surprise end and it really is a good entertaining film. You certainly won't be bored with this one. I gave it a 9/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 May 2017,6/10,"Hell or High Water adds another arrow to that old quiver that says if you want to garner some nominations for acting awards, channel your inner Mushmouth. That's not to say, of course, that Jeff Bridges is not a fine actor, nor that it is acceptable in a modern movie to fill it with casual racism.This is an alt-country, slice-of-life, protect-what-you-have- because-the-government-will-not kind of affair. Robbing banks to take care of your family makes you the good guys, if you're white, and until you kill someone. Whatever opportunity the movie creates to have a meaningful discussion about the ownership of capital is surely, sorely lost somewhere in the perfectly plaited folds of Chris Pine's grease-bomb hair.It is perhaps rather unfair to watch Hell or High Water and constantly think of better Texas-noir flicks, like No Country for Old Men or The Counselor. Regardless, there are a handful of well- played moments, especially as the townsfolk chase the brothers en masse, posse comitatus. The Howard brothers are playing a dangerous game, seemingly with nothing to lose, because they would rather die fighting for what they believe in than play the crooked capitalists' game.Then again, the whole movie is based on their desire to preserve their childhood home in order to exploit the oil reserves within, which in turn, when burned, will increase the temperature of the planet and kill us all.Who's the good guy now?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 January 2017,8/10,"An original screenplay but not an original story that proving that even the most tired genre in the most commonplace setting can be done right while entertaining without the need to check the brain at the door. Carefully executed, with the right amount of slow pace and plot jolts to keep you interested, the build-up and the necessary ""conclusion"" are done just in the right way. In between, we can't help but see it through the analytic eyes of the character's decay as well as scrutinizing another American corner of Trump's overwhelming electorate. Hell or High Water is another amazingly shot film in year of gorgeous- looking pictures, as well as expertly acted by an always reliable Jeff Bridges, a devoted Ben Foster and a much undervalued Chris Pine."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 October 2019,7/10,"Hell or High Water is a solid film that I believe many people will enjoy and relate to.PROS:
Good acting. Good casting (mostly). Decent writing. Great action scenes! Good cinematography. Good character development. The old man in the bank made my day! You readily understand each character and their moral compass. Overall good package.CONS:
Pace is a bit too slow in some scenes for my taste, which could have been corrected by removing 10 or 15 minutes from the final cut. I also think they spent too much time showing the bond between the brothers at their home. After a while, I wanted to tell the writers ""Okay! I get it! They are close. Can we please get on with the movie?"" I fast forwarded through about ten minutes of the movie. An example of a great film with similar pacing would be the old 1960s Bonnie and Clyde movie or No Country for Old Men. These hit the pace on the head.This film is definitely worth watching. I did not feel like I was cheated out of my time or money. For me, the rating is a tough call between seven and eight stars. Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, etc., are the films I rate as nines and tens.Therefore, this film is a seven or (possibly) eight, which is still very good on my scale. I try not to give away nine and ten star ratings like candy.If you prefer films filled with non-stop gun-play and carnage, you may not like this one as much as I did. If you appreciate good writing, you should enjoy this film."

HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 April 2017,9/10,"My opinion---""Comancheria"" made perfectly by David Mackenzie, is certainly the most successful movie of the kind of 2016. The realization is very aesthetic and also very effective, enjoying a very good scenario of Taylor Sheridan, this movie brings us in the "" Univers a kind of western, thriller, road-movie! But quite effective with a perfect distribution with actors who have carried their respective roles to the maximum of their art. First of all, Chris Pine who gives us one of his best performances, then Jeff Bridges and then turns into an anachronistic sheriff, and finally Ben Foster who impressed by his most successful performance, you mix everything: realization, screenplay, music, decor Natural and leading interpretation, and you will only make a very good movie, a success of its kind.

'Cause herein, there is lots and lots of it. Escpecially from Mr. Jeff Bridges himself. So good, old, relaxed, reasonable and at the same time clumsy and polished dialogue. Great! Nice!

HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 January 2017,9/10,"What a great film, I absolutely loved it.The makings of a top quality film are how much you just sit there and enjoy it without getting distracted - a film that was as good, if not better, than No Country For Old Men - what a wonderful surprise, and the best film I've seen in several months.With its sense of humour, subtlety, beauty, easy-listening music and very likable characters, and its excellent plot - a nothing of a film at first that went full circle and became very much something - I'd say it's easily one of the best films of 2016.And this is the first time a director has taken Ben Foster's on-screen madness and turned it into something endearing and likable, instead of the crazy loon Ben Foster usually plays in films like Alpha Dog and 30 Days of Night. And the rest of the cast is impeccable, and I didn't even recognise 'Captain Kirk' until I checked the credits at the end.What a wonderful piece of entertainment. I went to bed with a big smile of satisfaction on my face after watching this film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 November 2016,7/10,"what really stood out was the dialogue between the characters in this story. some really really great lines of conversation...a lot of it really funny...not comedic but funny and real. Chris Pine is proving that he's definitely more then another pretty face...he can actually act. thats 2 movies in a row that Pine and Foster have been in together...the finest hours...which was a fairly good movie and this outstanding one. great cinematography of the west...in fact you can genre this movie as a modern day western. the 2 standouts in this movie were Pine and Bridges, but everybody was at least good in this movie. awesome movies don't come along but every so often...don't miss out on this one."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 August 2016,8/10,"his movie is definitely a slow burn. It keeps building and building until it amounts to something at the end. It puts the emphasis on the characters, their dynamics, and putting that to the test. Sure, the bank robbery scenes are adrenaline rushing, but the core of this movie is really the relationship between two brothers and their ideological differences. Chris Pine plays the straight arrow who has more of an ethical reason for what he's doing, even though he knows its wrong. Whereas Ben Foster plays an ex-con who's just looking for a thrill. But regardless of the difference in ideologies, you see an inherent bond between these two brothers that transcends the events of the film, and that was something great to see..."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 February 2019,10/10,"I'm actually upset at anyone who has ever seen this film and didn't tell everyone they know to go watch it that very second. Ok, that is a pretty big statement, but wow.I haven't really been a huge Chris Pine fan, as a matter of fact, I've always considered him to be just another pretty face. Well, here I am, standing corrected. He absolutely brings it in this film. Also, Ben Foster...i can't describe how scary it is at the accuracy he portrays a west Texas/Oklahoma boy. As an Oklahoman myself, I know about 10 different guys who act just like his character. Typically you may look at his portrayal as a little over the top, but I think he nailed it.The movie was the right amount of tense, drama, and interesting. Often times I find my biggest complaint to be that a movie is too short, that they didn't stretch out a storyline enough, but this script hit all the marks for me in the amount of time it was offered.Amazing, absolutely will watch again."

Two brothers robbing banks and stores from town to town one after another until the police catch on and start getting heat.

HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 November 2021,5/10,"I was generous with a rating of 5. We only made it about half way through when we dumped it. We could have finished it, but it just wasn't worth the time. If this were any good, we should have been hooked after an hour, but instead it was just a nah.If you go in for grubby, dusty scenery and two grubby, dusty losers dealing with other grubby, dusty losers with a worn out storyline, this movie is for you.

HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 September 2016,9/10,"David Mackenzie directs the perfectly execute Hell or High Water, a fantastically mastered picture written by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) to explore the integrity of the southern Texas in a game of cops and robbers between three players. Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as the dirty handed brothers Toby and Tanner who are hell bent on raising up the funds to pay of the mortgage of their late mothers farm, and secure the future of Toby's sons. A wonderfully hand crafted crime drama that's thick in strong film making and beautifully smooth in capturing the breezing landscapes of Texas.While committing a series of bank heists, Toby (Pine) and Tanner (Foster), journey among the towns and fields of West Texas to be a pair of mischiefs among the local southerners. Though Toby only seeks to provide for his family, he must have the assistance of his thrill seeking brother who gets his kicks by having the time of his life when holding up people at banks to find high spirit and adventure in the brothers labour. Meanwhile, old timer Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) tries to find one last long ride to escape his up coming retirement as he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) track down the duo.What becomes of this marvellous tale, unravels to be two brothers having a final adventure together and making the world their oyster, and two law enforcers making gentle banter with each other as they make their last chase together. Jeff Bridges' rusty ranger may have time on him but still knows the ropes and has no hesitation to have fun as well by splashing out frequent dry humour. We meet a deeply developed Chris Pine with Kirk in him at all and giving his very solidly executed performance. Opposite is the stand out performance by Ben Foster bringing a wild beast to the narrative delivering excellent chemistry with Pine.Opening with an exceptional 360 degree camera shot, what follows opens the horizon to a beautiful visual experience entering the sun setting county of Texas. A masterfully cinematography performance by Giles Nuttgens brings the story and characters into a whole new light.What sets the whole film is the wonderful, captivating original score by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis who bring brilliantly selected and crafted music to the perfect atmosphere of the film, and washing the audience in sheer western and southern sound holding all tones of each moment and enthralling the melon collie and easy amusing Texas spirit.Hell or High Water can only be described as a masterfully directed story with on the point performances, with a great score and camera work. The film does take you back to the Coen Brothers No Country for Old Men in its plain cold shell but just pure genius in filling but with the easy amusing quirks of Bridges and Foster. 9.0/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 May 2020,8/10,"Only so often comes a flic, where everyone's a character, stars, co-stars, even the extras. Plot centers on fight between big money and the small guy, where you have to look outside the Law for uncompromising solutions. Anyone wants to know why Texas is called the ""Lone Star"" the people here provide you with the answers. Great thing here is the plot gets somewhat shaded by the personalities of those who take part. Not often you say that about a movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 September 2021,7/10,"Hell or High Water delivered based on its premise. At first glance, its simplicity may cause a slight to the regular thrill of a crime film. This causes it's only fault-being slightly predictable. However, simple is exactly who the main characters are. The film's central message is therefore entirely relatable-caring for family. That is whether you caused them pain, don't have one anymore, or are just trying to make it back home to see them. This being said, the characters and their ""Why?"" were not fully developed. The solid casting/acting, plus meaningful dialogue still assisted the movie to a greater emotional depth in spite of the lack of true backstory. Definitely worth watching."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 September 2016,7/10,"This modern outlaw Western directed by David Mackenzie is receiving high praise from critics. Like the faceless cattle barons and railroad tycoons memorialized in 1950s celluloid, today it's the bankers who are handy villains bent on destroying the little guy. That's true even if the modern cowboy rides a drilling rig. Brothers Tanner and Toby Howard (Ben Foster and Chris Pine, respectively) team up to rob branches of the Texas Midland Bank, an institution that has drained the value from their late mother's ranch and now (since corporations are officially people, I can anthropormorphize) sits rubbing its hands, waiting to foreclose. That would be a double catastrophe, because oil has been found on the land, and Toby is desperate to hang onto it so he can pass this valuable parcel to his kids. But he lacks the cash to save it. Thus, the robber scheme is hatched. On the hunt for the robbers are two Texas Rangers‚ÄîMarcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Hamilton is just weeks from retirement, but sharp enough to figure out the broad outlines of the plot. He just can't quite put the pieces together. He rides his American/Indian/Mexican partner mercilessly, and you understand Parker's stoicism in the face of these insults is part of the joke. He gets his own barbs in too. Early on, he asks Hamilton: ""Are you going to do anything about these robberies, or just sit there and let Alzheimer's take its course?"" Watching Hamilton and Parker is fun; watching the brothers is fun. They are real characters and they have real relationships here. For me, a big part of the fun is not knowing exactly what to expect, because the movie falls both within and outside the usual formulas. As Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Stephen Rea says, it's ""at once a tale of desperation in hard times and a keenly observed character study‚Äîor studies."" I had a little flutter when the lawmen referred to Lubbock (home of my grandparents) and Young County (my great-grandparents). The filming, however, was in New Mexico. Not the same at all."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 February 2017,9/10,"Two brothers rob banks, for some reason, but now they are being hunted by the Texan police.David Mackenzie, the director of the very good ""Starred Up"", went on to create this modern-day western epic. Mackenzie really was one of the things who made this movie fantastic. However, he wasn't the best thing of this film, this lays in the screenplay, which I'll discuss in my second to last paragraph. Now back to the director. Mackenzie created a beautiful looking film. The use of light, shadow, composition, everything that there is to make a shot look good, was good in this film. The landscapes were nicely captured by the cinematographer of this film, Giles Nuttgens, who has previously filmed ""The Fundamentals of Caring"", an OK-looking film, so it was very surprising he created such a good looking film. The direction wasn't stale; the camera moved around, to create long, nice looking takes. An example of those lays in one of the robbery scenes. All of those scenes by the way were fantastic. They felt realistic, they were tense and, like said before, good looking. What David Mackenzie also did succeed at was creating a realistic film. Everything that was happening on screen felt like it could happen in real life. There were some scenes that were less believable, but you have to take the setting in account, and then it makes more sense. That's also something I liked about the film: they utilize the setting. It's not that the film could've been set elsewhere. It could only take place in Texas. The soundtrack was also very good. The songs fitted well with what was going on and they also made the movie feel like a modern-day western. The editing was superb. The pacing really hit all the high notes. There wasn't a single scene that was dragging, even though the film was very slow paced, slowly building up to the finally. The acting was fantastic; I am surprised that not all of them got a nominee. The whole ensemble impressed me, but the one that impressed me the most was the performance of the well-known Chris Pine. This role of his is totally different from the ones I know him for, and I like that he has stepped out of his comfort zone. He gave on of his best performances, which is also one of his most emotional performances. He really sold his role. Ben Foster as well was fantastic. I didn't see him, but I saw his well-written character. Jeff Bridges too was great. I like his chemistry together with Gil Birmingham, who played his colleague policeman. The two of them had well written banter and were a fun on screen duo. The screenplay was, like said before, the best part of the whole film. Taylor Sheridan, the writer of ""Sicario"", who's bringing out his big-budget, directorial debut ""Wind River"", which he also wrote, wrote this film. If there's something Sheridan can do is portraying characters. All of the characters were written with extreme care, and the film also takes time to develop these well-written characters. They were developed by small-talks and not by exposition. They were developed by giving small bits of information once in a while, so by the end of the movie you have a fully developed character. This also parallels the story overall. In the beginning we don't really know why they are robbing banks ‚Äì I know it is said in the trailers and in the IMDb synopsis, but a reviewer I follow said to not read them, because it's more fun to find out yourself -, but after throughout the film you keep on getting these small hints and bits of information like pieces of a puzzle and near the end of the film all the pieces fall together, to form a fantastically well-developed puzzle. That's one of the main aspects I liked about the film, but it doesn't stop there. Like said in the previous paragraph I also liked the banter between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. The back and forward jokes were funny, just like all of the jokes in this film. Both of the characters were built on each other, which ended well in the climax of the film. The jokes may seem weird, because the film has set-up this serious atmosphere, so by having these jokes, you'd expect a theme-swap, but the film handled them so well, and the jokes fitted with the characters that made them.In the end ""Hell or High Water"" was a well-written and well-acted film, with good looking shots, and good tension. The film had set-up a realistic atmosphere, and the film was able to keep that atmosphere throughout the whole film. This film is defiantly one of the better films of 2016 and I would recommend seeing this, if you are able to. That's why I'm giving this film a 9.3/10."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 October 2019,7/10,"I'll make this short and quick to save us time: the movie is good, but I have no idea why it's nominated. I understood the movie but maybe there's a symbolism somewhere that I didn't get. Two brothers, robbing banks so one can bankroll a project. Two brothers-in-arms, one retiring and is hoping for a last case to add a feather in his cap. Each set meets the same fate, and we're left with a set that may have finished their jobs but are not really done yet.Highlight of the movie includes the cinematography (it's nice to see America beyond the usual NY or LA backdrops, reminded me of 2013 Best Picture nominee 'Nebraska') and the banter between the characters of Best Supporting Actor nominee Jeff Bridges and his American Indian sidekick Gil Birmingham."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 November 2016,8/10,"Texas in no country for young or old men in this David McKenzie character masterpiece. Basically a divorced father and his ex-con older brother resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's ranch and you just know it won't have a happy ending. My wife says i'm mysterious...or am I? This movies premise is fairly straight forward what makes it special is the script, the actors, director and the US backdrop that is a modern Hell. Next week I guess we'll see if anyone can make that country great again but in the meantime have a look at the real America of bank foreclosures and unemployment. This is not to say Hell or High Water is humourless, The Rangers have a wonderful love hate relationship. In fact this could be one of Jeff Bridges best roles ever...I smell another Oscar in that tumbleweed breeze for this 66 year old veteran actor. Ben Foster and Chris Pine show the strength of brotherhood no matter what. Track this one down on the Big Screen before it's lost to BluRay."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 August 2019,9/10,The only conceivable reason this film did not win an Oscar for best picture and best actor in a leading role for Jeff Bridges is because it happened to be up against Moonlight. I have seen both films and couldn't say one is better than the other but Hell or High Water is more entertaining. Don't miss it ! ! !
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 October 2017,5/10,"I'm torn on this film; it has many good points including first rate performances from Jeff Bridges and some of the supporting actors. The music is terrific and the cinematography is gorgeous -- though I was disappointed to find out it was all filmed in NEW Mexico (us Easterners were probably easily fooled -- but don't Texans and New Mexicans sense this right off? Perhaps the crew -- 90% British -- don't see any differences between those two states!)It's also very funny in places. But HOHW has a fatal flaw, and that is....plot holes the size of Jupiter.The biggest and most glaring: EVERYTHING in the film hinges on the two bank robbing brother's motivation to save the family farm from foreclosure, by robbing one local bank chain of the petty cash in the drawer (and then laundering that money at casinos, and ultimately, paying their late mother's reverse mortgage off with the stolen cash).I am gobsmacked the film's writers did not bother to research this AT ALL. That is not how reverse mortgages even work. You do not even have to make payments on a reverse mortgage, so it could not be ""in arrears"". And the mother borrowed only $25,000? That's chump change -- the ranch is clearly hundreds of acres (we see it at the end, stretching to the horizon) and worth at the rock-bottom minimum hundreds of thousands of dollars BEFORE THEY FIND OIL ON IT. So the brothers were never ""poor"" as Chris Pine alleges at the end, when claiming that's why he robbed banks -- so his two sons would not ""grow up poor like he did"". OK -- except he wasn't poor. And most people provide for their sons by GETTING A JOB. And maybe, moving somewhere where there are more jobs. Or by SELLING the land (so you could pay off the reverse mortgage legally) and then still having anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars to MILLIONS OF DOLLARS (!!!).On top of this, it is infuriating to think the filmmakers think if you cannot provide your children with MILLIONS OF DOLLARS...they are ""poor"". There is in their eyes nothing in between foreclosure/welfare and MILLIONS? Nothing like, say, ""an ordinary job"" and ""paying your bills"" and ""living an honest life""?It's like some weird justification for armed robbery, to ""get even"" with banks -- who are apparently supposed to forgive all loans, and never demand repayment, and of course, we all know if you own property -- it is ""yours"" for all eternity, even if you don't pay your taxes, bills or mortgage loans.On top of this; HOW can people who KNOW they have just won the biggest life lotto of all -- owning a ranch pumping $600,000 worth of oil profits every year and ergo, worth at least $20 million -- be whining about ""how poor they are"" and ""how rough they have it"" and how they have to be criminals??? That defies all credulity. Most people in their shoes would be on spending sprees with the royalty checks.Some other posters have also noted other stupid stuff like ""casinos have cameras"" and ""since they are already suspect (definitely the Ben Foster character, as he's been shot by police), it would be easy to work backwards, and realize Chris Pine paid off the mortgage on his ranch in a suspicious fashion, and with checks from a casino"". The most mundane detective work would have turned up the casino laundering trick and bingo, case solved.Lastly: at the end, Chris Pine is GUT SHOT, and has a bullet in him, but it hardly effects him -- he's not rolling on the ground screaming in pain or dying from peritonitis -- and how did he get the bullet out? going to the hospital would have pointed a big fat arrow at him as part of the robbery team. Did he dig it out himself and do home surgery? WTF?Too bad that nobody edited this or read it before filming, or had a bank loan officers give it a once over -- the devil is in the details, and these flaws keep this from being anything more than a mediocre shoot 'em up robbery film (with debts, also noted by others, to ""No Country For Old Men"")."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 September 2016,9/10,"Hell or High Water is yet another limited release gem that shows that in today's film climate, independent film is the quality standard bearer. While tentpole films are fun to see because they are events, films like Hell or High Water harken back to when filmmakers were more concerned with telling interesting stories, instead of making easy money. Hell or High Water is engrossing, tells its story with depth and smarts, and features really well-rounded characters. This film is truly a great film in almost all aspects, and will likely get a ton of recognition during Oscar season.From the opening scene of this film, the film is gripping, using both intrigue and acting to its advantage. Much like many other great films, this film begins with a bang and holds the audience's attention throughout. Chris Pine has proved that he's a talented actor over the years, but this film is a major step up for him, that being said the show stealers are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster has had amazing performances in the past, but this stands as one of his best, and Bridges plays a role that fits him like a glove, and he does it perfectly.The actors are notably great, but the film is gripping because the story it tells is interesting. The story doesn't feel like a rip off of other films, and even more impressively tells it's story with depth and smarts. Nothing in this film feels like it's unrealistic or bombastic, every action in the film is well thought out and makes sense, that being said the film has a decent level of emotional depth. The impressive thing about Hell or High Water is that it's not overly sentimental, but it's the kind of film that still evokes an emotional response.Perhaps the biggest reason that the story is interesting, and emotionally gripping is because the characters are so well developed. From the onset all characters come from relatable places, and have plenty of layers. Above that the characters are funny and at some point they simply begin to feel like real people just being captured on film. That being said every character's conflict hits even harder, because the characters feel so relatable.Finding something wrong with this film is extremely hard, and in a day and age with so many films coming out in conjunction that's rare. Hell or High Water is well acted, gripping, funny, features great characters, shows an impressive amount of emotional depth, and never needlessly substitutes action for smarts. It seems safe to say that this film will get a lot of attention during Oscar season, especially for it's screenplay. If you're a fan of westerns, heist films, thrillers, or just in general like great films this film is a good choice."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 February 2017,8/10,"'Hell or High Water' was an interesting view for me. Simply because I have heard reviews all over the board for this film. Some saying that this is the greatest film of 2016 and one of the best for modern westerns. I heard some say it was an alright film, nothing great nothing terrible. I also heard some say that is was horrible, boring, pointless, dumb, etc. You name it, someone said it. Now, with a Best Picture nomination, 'Hell or High Water' had to do something right to get that credential. Well, Oberrated is here to breakdown all of your confusion. Just kidding, but I am breaking this down my way... 'Hell or High Water' was great. As far as performance, story-telling, and fantastic memorable moments, it was a well-done and great film. I can not say one person had a bad performance here, not Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, not one. Even down to Margaret Bowman who played the T-Bone waitress! This was a performance heavy film that transcended a dumb story-line when written on paper into an Oscar contender. (and I only say this because when I typed that summary section I realized, this is a dumb as hell story when typed out, just IMO.)... Now I can not sit here and say it is an all-time great and side with some friends who have said this was a 2016 best, maybe a top ten but not best. But I also can not say that this was a worst, and to those who have said it was a worst and was boring, they probably are the casuals who want a shoot'em'up film. But hey, everyone has their tastes, some just are simpler than others.So that is it. 'Hell or High Water' has tremendous re-watch value. It has incredibly memorable moments that I loved and simply fantastic performances that made this film what it is. Now, I can not say this has a chance at Best Picture, but that does not count it out as a great film. Highly recommended!-- Oberrated.com --"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 October 2020,7/10,"I didn't expect it to be that smart and good for a heist film. Fine acting especially from Jeff Bridges with a very well written plot and some good editing. Entertaining, pure and simple for a Thriller/Heist film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 May 2021,10/10,"I don't know what I was thinking when I gave this 9 stars only, back in 2017. Now, I wish I could give 20 if I could. Hahahahaha. Every line is intriguing, the whole mood is immersive you forget you're watching a movie. It doesn't have fancy mesmerizing music but here's the thing, it doesn't need one. It has good ones and that is more than enough. You should know, this isn't one of those serious boring movies. No. This is the good kind of heavy. And it is balanced with some light scenes. Like I said, this film is really well made. I'm going to watch this again this weekend.*Please stop deleting my reviews. I don't think me acting like westerner in writing is an offensive behavior."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 December 2016,7/10,"Anticipation for this film didn't build until the end of 2016 when I desperately thought ""please, I need more good movies from 2016."" Out of a plea, I saw this film hoping it could give me another good movie of the year. Fortunately, it definitely did give me a more memorable and skillfully crafted film experience that I was hoping for. First of all, the performances by the three main actors should be recognized right off the bat. Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster give compelling performances that feel rich with character and are a joy to watch from start to finish. Overall, the performances were great with the exception of some smaller roles that aren't too crucial to the film and are easily forgivable. The script itself feels tight and flows quite beautifully. My only concern was the beginning when I was wondering about the two brothers themselves. Since we don't experience sufficient back story or previous character development, it might be hard to jump on board with these criminals in the beginning. In that regard, maybe the screenplay itself could've been restructured in a way that I could care more about what happens to these two brothers. Thankfully as the rest of the film plays out, we begin to care and connect to these characters more and character development becomes less of a problem.Technically, this film is shot and edited pretty seamlessly. Gorgeous cinematography add to the ""western"" feel to it with very capable directing. Although music/score fit the setting, I feel like more somber music at times could've brought more emotional weight to where we need it the most. Regardless, the film is crafted very carefully and precise. It was a joy to watch this beautifully constructed film play out and see the care the creators took into making it.Another small issue I had was that of the pacing. Perhaps I didn't have the right mindset walking into this film but the pacing is much slower than you might think. It takes about half the films run time for things to really pick up in a way that makes you grip your seat like you want to. I can see why they chose to do that and honestly, the way these performances are, you probably won't get bored anyway. Overall, Hell or High Water was surprisingly very very good. My main issues with the film are really on the small side and although the ending was very satisfying, the movie as a whole left me slightly underwhelmed. That being said, it's hard to not recommend this movie to anyone because of its strengths."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 February 2017,7/10,"Hollywood Westerns are not gone, they just underwent a new tone and identity to fit with the times. We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the ""Injuns,"" but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America's economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario's Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel- good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn't want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you'll understand.Sheridan's plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal's sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don't contain enough girl power like we'd expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas' true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one's wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man's backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie's imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie's new take on a familiar concept will knock 'em out dead."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 October 2019,9/10,"We all hate banks and usurers. God hates them, too. Warnings against usury go back to Exodus 22:24, and there are dozens of other scriptures with the same message._Hell or High Water_ addresses the effects of usury in a parochial setting (rural West Texas), but considering the mortgage crisis of 2007-08 and the ensuing market crash and government bailout, it delivers a universal message that we non-members of the ""one percent"" can all relate to.Therefore, we have a large degree of sympathy for the two brothers who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their ranch, to raise enough cash to pay the place off. Both actors, Chris Pine and Ben Foster, are perfect in their roles. They're an odd couple: Pine's character is thoughtful and cautious, but Foster is manic and likes robbing banks a little too much.On the other side, there is another odd couple, the sheriff and his deputy--ironically, a cowboy and an Indian--who are chasing the robbers around west Texas but are always one step behind. Jeff Bridges, as the older, wizened, close-to-retirement sheriff, has never turned in a better performance. And Gil Birmingham, as his half Mexican / half Native American partner and foil, grabs us from the first scenes and keeps us hanging on. We like him so much, we suspect that he's going to be a tragic character, and we're right.There are shades of _Bonnie and Clyde_ and _No Country for Old Men_, but this film stands firmly on its own, due its depth of characterization and its political message. It's not about crime; it's about people who are victimized by a merciless system.Extra kudos for the supporting cast: Katy Mixon as a saucy waitress in a Texas cafe, Margaret Bowman as the most obnoxious waitress of all time, and Buck Taylor as the old man in the bank who tries to shoot the robbers as they escape.In some movies, it seems that the actors know they are doing something memorable, and they perform to their utmost ability. This is one of those occasions.I guess there's there's no such thing as a perfect movie, but this one comes damn close. Everything is here: Intelligent scripting, great acting, emotional impact. You will not be disappointed. The ending is amazing!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 October 2016,10/10,"This film was superb in so many different ways. The acting, directing, cinematography, script, even the timing of the scenes; all flawless! This movie - as a whole - really is a fascinating piece of work. Equal to praise is the director who manages to build characters all of whom we can sympathize with; the writer who drafts a script with so much meaning, intrigue, and entertainment; and the actors who each transition into their respective roles so naturally and seamlessly. Chris Pine is perfect as the desperate ex husband in need of some cash to build a reliable future for his kids who he preaches ethics to; Ben Foster even better as the reckless and dangerous, yet loving brother and uncle; but it is somehow Jeff Bridges who manages to outshine these impeccable younger actors - he not only makes his performance believable to the most extreme critique, but he makes you forget he is acting in a film - it is as if we are third persons watching a real life Texas Ranger do some detective work. He deserves at the minimum some recognition from the Oscars. Let me not forget to tell you that each scene is structured with careful scrutiny to every major and minor detail in order to reach a level of perfection only rarely seen in films. Finally, without spoiling the film, I will say that any film that manages to both create a blockbuster showdown between the big good guy vs the bad guy, but also create a tense emotional debate on morals between protagonist against antagonist, deserves my warm appreciation. There is plenty of humour; plenty of action; plenty of drama; plenty of real meaning. Every scene; every line; every facial expression has a purpose to creating a true masterpiece in cinema. There are plenty of excellent films to come out soon, and I warn you this is the film to beat! It is a slow moving film, but if you have the capability and patience to appreciate brilliance, then you will no doubt love this!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 December 2016,9/10,"Not all the time we're able to find a movie when everything look so simple and however you feel part of the movie since the beginning. And it's refreshing to see this kind of movie with not too many characters and everyone of the performers fulfill their role to measure, specially Foster, Bridges and Pine. The soundtrack of the movie was great too and is a little weird to see this movie so high rated in IMDb because the low-budget and the lack of ""special effects"" and things like that. Anyway, if you're looking for a good movie that goes unnoticed by a great percent of the population, this is the one. A simple movie with a simple story. Worth a watch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 July 2021,3/10,I write some reviews while I'm watching a movie for the fist time. That is what I'm now doing. So far it's OK but I have a few complaints.First I cannot understand hardly a word Jeff Bridges is saying. His mouth full of peanut butter talking is not helped any and that the whole movie seems a little muffled. Don't know if it is the channel or the movie.I'm about half way through it and it seems a little slow probably because it may be trying too hard for character development. So far not a taut movie. It may be that the language cutting is taking some of the edge off. I may come back after it ends and edit my review but I have a deep feeling I may not need too. Maybe it'll get better and I'll buy the DVD to see it uncut but I doubt it.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 June 2020,3/10,"What a speech failure Jeff Bridges has become as a parent is annoying to listen to, even if the film is good?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 November 2016,9/10,"Cinema needs this kinda movies today. The Plot:The brothers Tobby and Tanner Howard robs a bank in west Texas and head it into a nearby Casino to laundry the cash. The brother's greed leads to strike one bank, and the another and another leading tracks to Ranger Marcus Hamilton and his partner Alberto Parker to catch them. Toby and Tanner makes they're own hell to get away with it using masks, left buried cars, and shooting inside a crowded bank costumers with guns. Hell- this is like Dante's Inferno ride or Homer's Oddisey in a modern western story. The story increases tension and action to the very end.Jeff Bridges is great, Chris Pine's best acting ever and every single character was great.I think none should skip this movie worth for the Oscar's. It s very enjoyable, my favorite so far. Watch it¬°¬°¬° You must."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 January 2020,8/10,"This is a More than decent flick. The U.S. And the old way of living is on the skids in West Texas. The land of the cattleman is now the land of the Indian casino,rapacious bankers, payday loans, get out of debt scammers and desperate small scale bank robbers. To keep the family ranch two neer do well brothers reprise a James gang hit and run raid on a chain of crooked banks. They launder their stolen money thru Indian casinos in Ok. Responding to this crime wave are two Texas rangers, the old one gruff, as usual, Jeff Bridges, the younger Alberto, a half Indian that takes a lot of crap from Bridges. Are they friends? Bridges thinks yes, but Alberto bears all the insults with dignity and maybe resentment. This movie is well acted and the scenery is a magnificent landscape dotted with man's detritus of broken down towns , defunct junk, and strip development crappiness. Oil and gambling are the two money makers in this area. The locals seem to retain a cranky stubborn Texas mentality and a proclivity for guns and violence. Bank robbers need to watch out for armed citizens that are not exactly great shots.I never heard of this movie and caught it on Netflix. It's part of a trilogy of modern westerns.8 stars."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 February 2019,9/10,"Rarely does a film's character depth, script and acting come together in a raw way like Hell or High Water. This modern western is a must see."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 December 2018,8/10,Very good modern western movie. Kudos to Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster performances.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 June 2021,8/10,"This is not a plot twister but instead a simple Western movie with all the usual ingredients: Cowboys, Cops, Indians... and a straight forward storyline. What make this stands out is the way the Director captures the majestic landscape + soundtrack + strong acting from Pine and Bridges. This movie showcases both the picturesque and ""romantic"" aspects of harsh lives in the American Wild West."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 October 2019,9/10,"Everyone brings their A game here, but most notable, is the ever-so-natural relationship between Bridges and cop partner Gil Birmingham. Bridge's character is full of endearing racial insults, which his partner is either content with or indulges in the banter in equal measure. And that's true friendship right there.
And when his partner gets shot at the end, damn.. I felt that loss. And the shock and sorrow was written all over Bridge's hard edged face as if it were real, with a dishevelled manner and appearance shortly after the incident only solidifying the performance as a whole.Also includes one of the better ending for this type of film.
Instead of leaving us with a predictable gun-firing last showdown, we have a mild and civil conversation between the two remaining protagonists (rivals) - one retired and mourning his friend and partner, the other mourning his brother and racked with guilt. Both now have nothing to lose. Both willing to avenge the death of someone they were close to.
It's a possible future showdown that we, the audience, don't need to witness.I love a film that's this good which can also surprise me along the way."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 June 2018,9/10,"The first time I watched this, I turned it off at about the 5-minute mark. I thought it was another dumb movie about inept country-bumpkins, which would rely on a mixture of slapstick and overly-done sappy and violent scenes in order to create enough of a pull to keep at least some audience members somewhat entertained.How wrong I was. I finally sat down and watched it with friends who insisted it was not what it appeared to be within the first few minutes of the film. Without giving too much away, and having to use a spoiler tag, Hell or High Water is a story about two brothers who after the death of their mother, organize a series of (justified?) bank robberies. What ensues is a catch-me-if-you-can scenario with the pursuing ""law"" hell-bent on catching them, and them hell-bent on not being caught. In short, it is a typical story of cops and robbers (or so you would think), with an atypical, uncommon and unconventional narrative. Given the plot, the remote setting and the almost nostalgic atmosphere and ambiance of the film, it is honestly a miracle, and more than a pleasant surprise, just how very gratifying and outstanding this film actually is.A definite must-watch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 October 2021,8/10,"Really enjoyed this one, the acting was top draw all round, but Ben Foster threatens to steal the film at all times with a fantastic performance that's equal parts hilarious and utterly terrifying!Beautiful cinematography that really captures the heart of the story and a cracking pace that kept me on the edge of my seat. Felt very like a crime film from the 1970s and stands up with some of the best from that decade!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 August 2016,10/10,"Finally, a movie worth watching in the summer of 2016. Screenwriter, Actor Taylor Sheridan who previously wrote the intense movie Sicario is a marvelous writer. His story of two brothers who take matters into their own hands with an ironic twist has themes everyone can recognize. Family, economic despair, well-drawn characters who live with the consequences of being flawed human beings and a stellar cast which elevates every scene. Even the sound track adds context. All the buzz regarding this movie is dead on. If you're a fan of great writing, a plot which slowly reveals and wonderful acting you won't be disappointed. Pine, Foster and Bridges are superb. This is an adult film not suitable for kids."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 September 2016,7/10,You know this is a good movie. Normal emotions that might have you chuckling when its over. Emotions from anger to embarrassment and even jealousy. So we got these two brothers doin things cuz their moms debts are as big as Texas. Problems start out early when the younger brother tips a waitress a large sum of money. Now though i found this on On IMDb.com not long ago i was surprised by its theatrical release..dude Jeff bridges playin some redneck used to plain white dudes tellin him his flavors strait garbage ain't what the films been condensed to...Chris pine kinda a angry prick broodin throughout the whole film an Mr.bridges has his issues workin with an Indian partner all tie together alright with the outcome...
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 August 2020,8/10,"This movie is so Texas it's not even funny. This is real life for a lot of people out there and most people like me who have lived our whole lives in the big cities can't even wrap our brains around this way of living. But it sure makes for an interesting movie. Nothing fancy here, just real emotions, real drama, and a real good story. The acting is insanely good too! Absolutely worth the watch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 August 2020,9/10,"The film is far from fancy thing but this film is so good, they put old code of cowboy movie in the modern theme"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 May 2021,10/10,This is one of those movies you rarely see in hollywood a complete masterpiece that shows what most of people that watch movies want the mixture of western and crime is done so well that you will enjoy every moment of the movie there wasnt any part that bored me unlike a lot of movies these days......
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 May 2017,9/10,"I knew too little before seen it and I had a little surprise. I didn't expected the movie to be that good. It tells an actual story. many people it has been trough this kind of things, because in places like this, they're so far away from everyone. Jeff Bridges says it perfectly: ""No one can help them now, they're alone"".It tells the story of two brothers who start robbing banks for getting the money they need to pay the debts they're in with the bank and so the child of one of them, Toby (Chris Pine) can provide a better future for his sons. He is helped by his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) who is a bit crazy and has a criminal mind more violent than his brother. They're both being chased by the ranger of the state, the Ranger Marcus, played by a great Jeff Bridges (as always). All the actors in here are great in their roles. They fit perfectly in their roles, from the two brothers desperately looking for money to the old ranger who won't give up in making the law being applied. Even many of the secondary characters like tho woman from the bar or the mate from the ranger are great in their roles, so this a very good point of the movie.One of the few things I have to add against it it's that at parts, at least for me, felt a bit too slow and that all the things they talk with the attorney about their properties and so I feel like they were not explained clearly, but at least at the end we get a bit of explanation in this final dialogue between Marcus & Toby.Other things that is truly remarkable is it's cinematography. It captures the feeling of rush when they're escaping from all the banks, but also captures the feeling of loneliness of this Texas Midlands, all the plains with very few houses and a very long and dusty road.I recommend you this one if you want to get away from the typical image of USA (the people living in all of this big houses with plenty of money and so) and want to discover a new reality in there, and also if you want to see something different from all of this blockbusters full of explosions and non-sense things. A very enjoyable movie!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 January 2019,7/10,"Wonderful performances across the board, each actor played a role in supporting this story. The rogue nature of Texas presented within is quite entertaining and the atttitudes of all within reflect a reality that feels very realistic. Action, drama, wholesome fun, and an emotional honesty that deliver a solid film. Watch this if you root for the underdog and enjoy a rowdy film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,9/10,"This is a movie worth seeing for many reasons. 1. Jeff Bridge - The role fits his style perfectly. His dialogue is spot on and just a joy to watch and listen to. 2. Chris Pine - This movies helps shed Capt. Kirk big time. I didn't think he was much of an actor before this but I have a new found appreciating. 3. Ben Foster - His usual strong, a bit crazy, witty dialogue, edgy performance. So much fun to watch! 4. West Texas - I have to defer to those that know West Texas but if this is how the people are like out there with their guns, hometown values and dialogue, I love it! 5. Perfect Crime? - I don't want to spoil it but please keep in mind the bank dynamics. 6. Supporting Cast - Again, I don't want to spoil it but whoever did the casting did a fantastic job, assuming this is what West Texas is like. (see #4. above).It's not perfect since there are a few slow moments but there are other interesting nuances that will remind you of twists in other movies. It's so hard to write this accurately and completely and not make reference to spoilers. Suffice to say that you should see this movie for any of the reasons above.Enjoy."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 December 2016,8/10,"This is the type of movies I want to see Ben Foster in. Not in Warcraft with that golden wig and casting spells. Felt really good to see Ben Foster in this movie. Many might give this one a miss because of the mellow trailers but it's a good movie. No doubt about that.STORY & SCRIPT - The story revolves around two brothers who are planning to pay their debts by robbing banks and two ageing officers who apparently are the only ones following this case. Jeff Bridges' character, Marcus Hamilton wants a last swan song to end his career with, due to which he is hell-bent on catching these mystery robbers who are going from one bank to another. Toby and Tanner are polar opposites of each other. When one is hot-headed, the other is smart and cool but both of them are sincere about their family. The story has a very slow pace and after the consecutive robberies the movie almost comes to a halt. It allows the dust to settle before the final showdown. The ending in particular was beautiful. It had me engaged about what was going to happen and when the credits rolled I was left thinking what will the final confrontation between Toby and Marcus will be like and that's what a movie should do.DIRECTION - It was bold of the director to maintain such a slow pace to such a simple movie. We could see the ending right after the halfway mark but do you know what kept me interested? The characters. The interactions. Most of the times in movies when I see two characters interacting, I feel like people don't like like that. At that moment the movie just looses me. In this movie, the interactions felt natural. There were silent moments which left room for character building. The racial undertones in the characters didn't stick out. It felt rather natural because unlike Tanner, Marcus was racist just to tease his partner. That scene when Marcus finally gets his revenge got to me. Not kidding. Every character felt well-rounded from start to finish. Right from the waitress(both of them) to the main characters. I liked the final reveal of Marcus' body and you hear a rattling noise and you see that death was right at his feet. Just the bearer of it changed.CINEMATOGRAPHY - Let me get rid of two minor gripes. One was the sky at the beginning of the movie. It felt very artificial. Second was the fire. The CGI was really off. Probably due to budget constraints. Other than that the landscape shots and action scenes were very well shot. The bleak tone of the scenario was very aptly captured. As the movie was not rushed you have the time to actually take in the scenery, making the scenery a character of the movie. ACTING - Ben Foster was the highlight of the movie and I am happy that he was. Blunt, brute and stubborn but with a heart of gold. He felt like he had dug his hands deep into this character and he delivered perfectly. Chris Pine also showcased the finer side of his acting prowess after starring in cheesy roles and of course as Captain Kirk. Jeff Bridges, was also in his comfort zone and boy was this a step-up from R.I.P.D.FINAL VERDICT - A very mellow and probably underrated too but a must watch for people who love a slow paced movie. Due to the movies grounded tone, I felt fresh because lately I have been seeing all these cheesy movies with weak scripts botched by production houses. Very few times a movie with such a cast delivers and I can say this that this movie delivers and delivers well"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 February 2018,2/10,"When a film that is loudly and ostentatiously set in Cowboy Texas is actually filmed in neighboring New Mexico you know the director has a shaky grasp on his materials.
When I saw Hell Or High Water in the theater I thought it was about two alcoholic idiots who sit on porches drinking beer before going out and committing violent acts. Seeing it recently on cable tv I realized it's actually about THREE alcoholic idiots who sit on porches drinking beer before going out and committing violent acts. Pine and Foster sling credible Southern accents, which is astonishing in a Hollywood film. Jeff Bridges merely regurgitates the accent and attitude of his last two movies, Crazy Heart and True Grit. (It was wearing thin in True Grit.) There are a number of good, funny, evocative lines in the film, most of them spoken by passers-by. The final scene is, however, a standout. It comes about an hour and thirty-nine minutes into a movie that runs an hour and forty-two minutes. The soundtrack is a good one. Watch the trailer, buy the soundtrack is my advice."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 August 2016,1/10,"At the time I saw it, IMDb had this rated at 8.3!?!?? Damn few movies get that high of a rating, so I was prepared to be entertained by a well-crafted plot. What I got was a slow moving, meandering bank robbery crime spree yarn, which turns totally senseless and absurd when we finally find out what the overall ""plan"" was, and what the motivation for doing it all was - $50K heisted, three innocent people dead plus the planned (!) self-sacrifice of one of the bank-robbing protagonists: It's all done for the two kids of our divorced loser ""hero,"" ""so they don't have to be poor."" REALLY??? What-a-bunch-of CRAP. It's the obligatory evil bankers vs. the self-pitying mortgagor, who can only think of using today's all to familiar problem solving solution: violence. Plot holes and absurdities absolutely abound along the way crafted with the hopes that viewers will be as simple minded as the story being told.With the exception of the all too brief appearance of the delightfully gruff T Bone Caf√© waitress, who gave the best delivery of lines in the movie, the ""acting"" was a wasteland (unless you're into watching the camera pan Chris Pine posing). Poor Jeff Bridges, who has given us so many memorable performances, was little more than a sad, mumbling caricature of himself. On the plus side, the visual portrayal of West Texas as starkly and hopelessly bleak was well done.P.S. FACT CHECK: There are many (most?) reviewers who have willingly (eagerly?) bought into the the totally false central premise of the plot that the bank was going to own/acquire the ranch upon foreclosure, and was therefore the evil ""Bad Guy,"" deserving of being robbed repeatedly (and their guard murdered). WRONG! Foreclosures are governed by law which results in a advertised Public Auction with the property going to the highest public bidder, with any money received over the loan amount owed plus expenses going back to the Mortgagor.Also, the evil ""Bad Guy"" bank officer whose portrayal was demonized in the movie HAD to pay the delinquent property taxes on the property to prevent it from being sold at public auction by the Tax Collector."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 June 2017,9/10,"This film is absolutely gorgeous to watch while also having fantastic action that is surrounded by fleshed out characters that are played extremely well by a fantastic cast. We never feel comfortable with the violence in the film because it never feels stylish and never becomes commonplace, and that makes the violence that does happen more effective.'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story & have an interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done. He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts' Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are perfect. ---Yidioo"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 January 2017,10/10,"As a lot of people have pointed out, the plot to Hell Or High Water isn't totally original: the plot is that two brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, are robbing banks to pay off the reverse mortgage on their family home. It's not original at all, but it does take several original turns:-As opposed to just focusing on the Howards, with Tanner portrayed by Ben Foster and Toby as Chris Pine, we also follow a pair of Texas Rangers who are pursuing them, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) -The pacing and plotting is different: there's two bank robberies in the pre-credits sequence, then there's planning on the Howard's part and investigation by the Rangers, then the big shootout scene, then a quiet 8 minute dialogue between two of the characters. A normal Western, or even any other thriller would be building and building as it went on.-There isn't any 'villains' in the traditional sense; in a modern take (the last 10 years), the banks are seen as the villains.The other thing that does separate this and prior Westerns/Neo-Westerns is the sheer quality of work. Taylor Sheridan, who produced an excellent screenplay with 'Sicario' ups his game even further, with his dialogues in particular shining. There's an excellent scene where the half-Indian half-Mexican Alberto talks about how all the land that ""these people grandparents took from my grandparents is being taken from them, but not by any army"", which sums up a lot of the film, and gives Birmingham a real chance to shine. There's another with Tanner and Toby talking about their upbringing, which says a lot about how Tanner and Toby differ because of that part of their lives.The characters themselves are excellently altered versions of prior characters. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as Marcus Hamilton - arguably the best of the film - as he gives this old Ranger a real fire and fight, but also a humour that is natural to Jeff Bridges. Chris Pine, who has always been a good actor stuck in the Captain Kirk box, plays the desperate family man forced to crime to save his family, who's quiet but also very valiant - he's doing this for unselfish reasons. And then there's Ben Foster, who plays by far the biggest twist on the convention: Tanner Howard is a violent rogue, who is very much a live wire and fully ready to commit all kinds of acts throughout the movie, but is doing these particular robberies for his little brother's welfare, and Ben Foster channels both sides to the character with equal virtuosity, making a 2D stereotype into a guy to both fear and root for.David Mackenzie and Giles Nuttgens team up awesomely together as Director and Cinematographer. Both of them use very constant long takes specifically to wring every ounce of tension out of certain scenes - a classic example is Tanner's dialogue with an Indian where he says they are both ""Comanche's"", and the camera lingers long enough to get the tension to max, or the ending in which you tense as if something's about to happen. They also focus on the Mise-en-scene well enough to show the world and have an audience invest in it, even when there's no soundtrack or incidental music to enforce it.I can put it in words - I love this film. For me, it's flawless and will only get better with more viewings. If you like Westerns, you adore this, and if you're OK with them (like me), you'll love this too hopefully."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 October 2016,10/10,"""Hell or High Water"" is the greatest film of the last 5 years. It succeeds in making the audience laugh, cry and thrill while telling a relatable and gripping story of friendship, sacrifice and crime.From the get go, ""Hell or High Water"" ensures the audience that they are in the solid hands of the craftsman, David Mackenzie. The film opens with a long take, and is probably the best long take since Goodfellas. The take isn't only successful because of the action, composition and color that's in the frame, etc, but its element of surprise, setting and framing that engages the audience at the very beginning of the film. This quality of opening shot is repeated throughout the whole film, and if this doesn't even get nominated for best cinematography at the Oscars, I think I'l cry. All the other technical stuff is amazing as well- special effects, Music, acting and so on.My favourite part of the film, however, is its violence pacing(yet another film term I've made up). In ""Hell or High Water"", David Mackenzie teases the audience with little glimpses of unsatisfying violence, and builds up the tension and pacing until an explosive finale. I am a self confessed gore hound(to an extent), so when I see blood squibs bursting, I get quite excited, especially when I'm in a cinema. Not because I'm a sadistic, person hating emo ( in fact, I'm the first person in the world against real life violence), but rather I can engage in spectacular art that I personally enjoy, so when the bombastic conclusion to the film was unfolding before my eyes, I reveled in David Mackenzies' control throughout the film. It is a really rewarding payoff, and I could sit through and through this film again just for the last 30 minutes.To say that this film is all art and no narrative would be an injustice to its greatness. The story delves deep into the human soul, and investigates morals and values in our society that have been previously neglected. The characters are developed through the wittiy and revealing dialogue in the film, and the use of dialogue to create character is the best seen on the silver screen since Pulp Fiction(or any Tarantino film for that fact). The dialogue never feels dull for a moment, and keeps the audience laughing and engaged with the film for its duration.""Hell or High Water"" is a cinematic gem, and will be revealed to be a classic of this generation of filmmakers."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 April 2017,8/10,"Honestly, the movie wasn't any better or worse than any road movie with bad guys doing their best to get hunted by some disillusioned cop at the dawn of retirement. I didn't quite get it how you have to rob money when oil spills out of your land. Why he can't pay off the land with what the land produces, probably a legal issue not too clear.The characters were pretty traditional, a brainless bad-guy out of jail, a sunny boy chased by smiles of women out of divorce, a sarcastic old white policeman, making fun of his immigrated colleague, of Mexican Indian origins. And that's it. Country scenes are open space, blue skies, some fire and black smoke. Nothing exceptional.So why would I give 8 stars? Well the plot works fine, acting was good, except for some scenes a bit clumsy, like the fat girl in the restaurant, charming a sunny boy, or the scene before the bank, where the two policemen talk about who owns the land, describing the bankers as robbing the properties of people as the colonists robbed the Indians. Pathetic comparison, we hear it since 2008, nothing new since even before 1900.But then the end scene between the retired policeman and the bank robber is so great, so well played and original in terms of words, so true, that it makes this movie stand out.And the blues/country music adds to it too."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 December 2016,7/10,"The best reason to watch this movie is to see Chris Pine finally ACTING! Not playing a 2D horrible Captain Kirk, but actually acting. I was so glad to see he could actually do it.I have no idea why Dale Dicky is listed as a star in this, I don't even remember her part or what she was in the movie, she is completely forgettable.This is a movie about Ben Foster, who steals the show as a completely deranged off the hinge parollee soon to be back in, who does his bro Chris Pine a solid and helps him get the money to buy their farm back from the bank's shady reverse mortgage scam. By robbing banks, the bank line that is trying to steal their farm.Hot on their trail is the old weathered Texas Ranger with near psychic powers, Jeff Bridges in a solid performance.Look for spunky Katy Mixon, unzipped for tips, playing the flirty diner girl who takes a shine to the Pine. When she is later questioned by the cops, see her Texas spunk come out like a fire dragon, she briefly steals the show.This is kinda an 'No Country for Old Men' lite, sans all star cast and psycho Mexican cartel hit men. It's a gentle sit back and enjoy dust, bank robberies with nearly no death, and good ol' boys in pickups who like to get between cops and robbers, cause, you know, I own this here gun and I haven't shot it at hardly anybody!I have no idea who Dale Dicky was and who she was playing."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 December 2020,7/10,"A truly worth watching movie. A good storyline, acting and excellent cinematography in the remote plains of West Texas that seems to be a too far away a place from the glitzy USA we have come to know from most mainstream Hollywood movies. The soundtrack to the movie is awesome with a selection of some truly great tracks."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 May 2019,8/10,"Hell or High Water captures the sheer intensity and reality of becoming a lawbreaker out of quite desperation and even though you are aware of this movie's obvious ending, you still care about the people in the story who will have to face that ending. It's nuanced, beautifully filmed, nicely restrained, and meditative."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 June 2019,8/10,"I liked this film a lot because of a few things. The casting was great and the characters they played was great too. 3 A list actors who complimented each other rather than fighting for screen time was really nice to see. The old meeting the new ( generationally speaking ). Two scumbag brothers think they're doing the right thing by robbing banks to pay off the mortgage, not caring or not giving a second thought to the people they're traumatising, go on a rampage of thieving and violence. An old cop and his pissed off partner try their best to get one step ahead of them and in doing so just proves why he needing to retire. Too old and too slow. Great film and definitely worth a watch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 March 2017,9/10,"This is a modern western and just the fact that its story works makes it worth a mention. The western is more confined than most genres to a time period and placement, and the world has largely forgotten the old-fashioned stagecoaches, horseback riders and cattle wranglers of one hundred years prior. A philosophical western is even more rare, but it is always a genre that has lent itself to telling great stories about the law of the land and the lengths one goes to for their family. That's one thing the movie tells us (sometimes at point blank range) is that the times have changed: it is no longer foreign invaders and land expansion we have to worry about, but the loan companies, casinos and hidden interest payments that threaten to bankrupt our culture and way of life. The bank robbing brothers that Chris Pine and Ben Foster eloquently portray are not good guys by any means, but they are definitely sympathetic and desperate characters that are rebelling against a corrupt system. Which is a tale at the heart of any good western."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 May 2021,10/10,"...with a particular emphasis on characters and performances, enhanced by a fun but gritty story with some very intense action.Hell or High Water delivers in every aspect of film-making. From purposeful camerawork, subtle editing and directing choices to make way for the expertly written dialogue and performances by acting legend Jeff Bridges and acting talents Chris Pine and Ben Foster. There is a general sense of real people in real situations within a progressively strong and interesting story. It somehow manages to deliver a real punch without ever feeling dry or worn out.It's just as long as it has to be and never outstays its welcome."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 November 2018,7/10,"A poor man's No Country for Old Men. The first half is pretty meh, but this is a somewhat rare case where the final action scene actually elevates a film considerably and isn't boring as hell - really liked the last half an hour in general. Jeff Bridges is good, although maybe some more variety in his characters' mannerisms from time to time wouldn't hurt.Rating 7/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 May 2018,7/10,"""Hell or High Water"" provides drama and heightened suspense to create a gritty story, but there are some issues in what is being told. Due to strong acting performances, however, these issues can be overlooked for the most part.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The premise of the story is interesting and has potential, but there are some issues with realism. Because it is a film, one must make room to suspend disbelief. With that being said, it can only go so far. If there were as many bank robberies in a local area in real life as there were in the film, law enforcement would be putting in a lot more effort to bring it to an end. So the basis for the film is a bit far-fetched. But if one looks beyond this hurdle, then the film is effective in drawing in the viewer. The idea of a strong brotherly love at the center of the story is brilliant; it forces us to have sympathy for the two of them. We can identify with family pretty easily. David Mackenzie does a fine job shaping the story and getting the most out of his actors. He seems to be a natural at creating tension and forcing the audience to latch onto characters. *Cinematography/Editing: The color palette is one of the strengths of this film. The warm yellow and tan tones create a sense of heat and intensity. There are a few missteps with breaking the 180 degree rule, but overall the use of the camera made this film feel authentic and it gave power to the actors. Giles Nuttgens does not try to do too much with the camera. He is comfortable with letting the actors lead the story, rather than trying to get too fancy. The simple work with the camera allowed for the story to take hold of the viewer. In terms of editing, the film is most powerful during the moments it needed to be. It did not draw attention to itself during dialogue or dramatic scenes. However, during ""in-between"" times it seemed a bit jumpy and less than professional. There are some cuts that close in or change angles from a previous shot, but they are too similar to the previous shot and end up being more of a distraction than a directing of the viewer's eye. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue feels natural and down to earth. It never tries to be too fancy. Less is more and the scriptwriter understood that for this film, what wasn't said sometimes had more power than what could have been said. The acting was strong all throughout. Jeff Bridges doesn't overact. He stays grounded and it works to his advantage. Ben Foster and Chris Pine also carry their own weight. *Music/Sound Design: The music is minimal yet important. There are some unsettling queues that further heighten the suspense during certain scenes. Some country songs chosen for the film help to set us in the environment of Texas. The sound design is crisp and furthers the film's realistic quality. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets and costumes are believable and do not draw attention to themselves. The focus of the film is on the story itself and how it affects the characters, so there is no unnecessary wardrobe choices that pop on screen. Texas is painted as bleak throughout the story, and the sets/locations/costumes reflect that. The special effects are nothing out of the ordinary. They are believable and add to the film's gritty feel.*Conclusion: ""Hell or High Water"" tells a unique story. It does so as simply as possible, and this works well because it causes us to focus on the characters rather than on the flashy filmmaking. The strength of the film is in the actors, and that is where our attention is drawn to. This film doesn't try harder than it has to, and for that it is a job well done."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 September 2016,7/10,"Hell or High Water kind of snuck up on me. I had seen posters for it since the beginning of the summer and never really paid them any mind. Maybe it was having just seen Chris Pine in Star Trek: Beyond but I felt like I started to see this movie pop up more and more, and my interest grew. Finally having seen Hell or High Water I can say that while it does satisfy, I don't think it lives up to the lofty hype it has accrued.Hell or High Water tells the story of two brothers(played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who for reasons stated later in the movie find themselves robbing west Texas banks. They are perused by a near retirement Texas Ranger and his partner(played by Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham), both of whom don't seem to like each other very much. While the brothers use traditional bank robbery techniques such as cleaning the money at a casino and ditching get away cars, they also buck some of the normal bank robbery trends which makes for a more interesting and original movie.The thing that is truly the hands down best part about this movie is the writing. Taylor Sheridan who also penned 2015s Sicario may have somehow outdone his previous work. While I love Sicario, there is very little personality in that movie, not just in the characters but in the overall dialogue in the movie. It all feels a little robotic and plot oriented, well Hell or High Water is almost the complete opposite. This movie is brimming with character, most specifically Texan character. As an east coaster Texas has always sort of been almost a different country to me, and I never really found the whole Texan thing to be in any way endearing, more silly than anything else. Hell or High Water made me change my mind and really have a respect for the Texan attitude. There are so many great lines in this movie, that don't feel added in or punched up. You also get a better understanding of the characters from these little phrases and one liners and the actors seem to give better performances because of it.Speaking of the acting it is for the most part really good. Jeff Bridges is so perfectly cast for this role that you would think this is the way he is all the time. Chris Pine lets himself get a little dirty in this movie and i think he is the better for it. I have been waiting for the role that would show me Pine is more than just a good looking leading man and this I think is his best performance yet. Full disclosure before I get to this next part, I have a problem with Ben Foster. While I have not seen every movie he has appeared in, I can't say I have ever liked him in a movie. That being said he is not nearly as bad as I expected in this. He gets to be crazy which seems to be his only level of acting and even with his over the top southern accent, he is fairly toned down here.The directing of David Mackenzie is pretty unexciting here and I think the movie could have used a few more original ideas as far is directing is concerned, but it really does not hurt the movie. You are shown the events that unfold but there are not any scenes that are incredibly well directed, even when there was the potential for it. The movie is paced really well until the last 15 minutes or so when they can't decide how exactly to end the movie. Overall a pretty good viewing experience that was not often boring and did not feel like took up half of my day.The thing that makes Hell or High Water as good as it is, is that it knows what it is and does not try to become something more than that. It is not a complicated movie or one with a twist, you know where everyone stands at the end of the movie and in a day and age when so much emphasis is put on sequel bating or cliffhanger endings, Hell or High Water smartly avoids this. You are going to get some bank robberies, some shootouts, some cowboy hats and some good ole fashioned Texan charm and all fairly well put together to make a great end of summer movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 January 2019,8/10,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am not sure why I kept passing it up. Great acting, casting, directing. Great plot with a twist on Robin Hood. A sense of justice. I recomend"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 September 2020,5/10,Feels like a TV movie. Produced be CBS Films so I guess that makes sense. Didnt finish it. I guess I'm too picky. I feel like I never like any movies anymore.Be original. Wow they robbed a bank. What an original premise.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 April 2017,10/10,"Hell or High Water is a film that moves in a deliberate manner.It's a modern day Western yet the horses in this film are not the galloping kind. It's horsepower lays under the hood of a getaway car of two unassuming bank robbers.These aren't your infamous gangster types but rather two brothers on the shortest end of the economic downturn. People who faced job losses, home foreclosures, petty jail time, family breakdowns and in some cases, their very life. All just trying to stay afloat of the sordid mess created by corporate greed.The story touches on big bank bailouts and how that money scooped up hard earned working class assets for pennies on the dollar. The real tragedy is knowing this is an American reality rather than just a fictional story portrayed in this film.Chris Pine is brilliant as Toby, a man coming off the heels of divorce and a dying mother. He's trying to save the family farm on the verge of foreclosure due to his mother's long illness. Despite the harsh hand life has dealt Toby; he's determined pass something on to his sons. Even if it means robbing banks to do so. He enlists his ex-con brother, played by Ben Foster, to help.While Toby executes each robbery with skill and precision, brother Tanner is a bit more risky and reckless. Foster is also brilliant as the wild and unrestrained Tanner, who himself is determined to never see the inside of a jail cell again.Toss in some everyday citizens who are in no hurry to turn them in, and the film takes on a striking working man's mythos.With seasoned actor Jeff Bridges as the easy-going yet methodical sheriff on their trail; we have a spectacular Western crime drama worthy of every award it receives.Finally, after a long cinematic drought, we have a high tide film worth it's weight in gold."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 October 2018,9/10,"Taylor Sheridan is one of the most fascinating screenwriters working in contemporary Hollywood, and until SICARIO 2: SOLDADO he had pretty much scripted a trio of very good thrillers that touched on the sharp end of the US political embrace of neo-liberalism. David Mackenzie followed Denis Villeneuve in working closely with Sheridan (who has a small cameo in the film as a disconsolate cowboy), crafting the kind of film that supposedly doesn't getting made in Hollywood any longer: mature, gritty, character-driven and political. Built around three performances that all have deliberate differences in pacing, Mackenzie's considerable technical ability gives Bridges, Foster and Pine the perfect platform to deliver superb character work. What really stands out though, is the way in which the film gives over running time to perfect little portraits of disenfranchised America, from the waitresses who will not give up their tips, nor tolerate dissent from the menu, through to the bank clerk who just wants to get on with their day, this is a film saturated in local knowledge and a strong sense of place. All the more commendable when it is considered that Mackenzie and Sheridan aren't Texans. This is probably Chris Pine's transitional performance, as he shifts from more mainstream pretty boy roles to grittier character work. It is also Bridges best performance in at least a decade, as he gets caught up in just one last chase before retirement. Ben Foster continues to deliver incredible work on the periphery of Hollywood and must now be considered one of the most underrated actors of his generation. This is a film that baldly directs an attack at the greedy neo-liberal capitalism that propels the US relentlessly onwards, and it must go down as the most sustained and strident critique of the banking crisis and its fall-out. It is also a fine heist western, in the mould of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, or THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 June 2021,10/10,"This movie has it all - Great cast, landscapes, soundtrack & most of all great writing! Absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. You feel for both sides the outlaws and the ones that chase them. Some movies just kill it in every aspect - this is one of them!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 January 2019,9/10,"Taylor Sheridan's (writer) Hell and High Water is one of the best films in the past few years. This was my second viewing, and it sat deeper and more profoundly with me. Not a single performance is weak or superfluous. It's location and tell-tale times of economic insecurity are as much a character as the bank tellers, waitresses, and worn cowboys are. Chris Pine, the electric Ben Foster, and most notably, Jeff Bridges, navigate the dry roads and open expanse of east Texas. Every scene has impact and develops the characters, every exchange of dialogue in their perfect drawl just fits - as if you can only nod at its simple wisdom. The movie sticks; and if ever you find yourself crossing the great state of Texas on their long, straight roads - this film may very likely make its way into your musings."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 October 2017,6/10,"David Mackenzie's neo-western is a eulogy on the death of the American west and the last of the cowboys. There is a wistful mood and a mournful tone, with a sense of loss at the heart of the piece, and in many ways the film is all about loss - the loss of family, the loss of time, the loss of money, the loss of dignity. It's a remarkably understated crime thriller that uses the architecture of the old cat-and-mouse chase formula to sketch a surprisingly realistic picture of criminality and desperation.A lot of this film's success can be credited to both Taylor Sheridan's lean but muscular screenplay and the wonderful cast of character actors performing his matter-of-fact dialogue. Chris Pine escapes the bland movie star folly of his career thus far and completely disappears under the skin of a wounded farmboy-turned- man-of-the-house, providing the pathos and heart to the story, while on screen brother Ben Foster's fraught energy provides the conflict and volatility. And then there is the ever dependable Jeff Bridges who mumbles and grumbles his way through a performance that feels completely authentic and effortless as he doggedly pursues the brothers while looking every inch the aged cowboy. It's a shame then that his character wasn't given more meat to his bones because, regardless of Bridges' low-key brilliance, the cop-in-pursuit subplot is where the movie is fundamentally lacking. At no point do our sympathies diverge away from the outlaw brothers to the Sheriff, unlike in Michael Mann's 'Heat' where both cop and robber were portrayed in equally sympathetic and interesting ways. Therefore, there is very little conflict within us come the inevitable showdown(s) between them and that robs us of experiencing the full breath of dramatic tension and emotional impact in the third act.There is still much to like in this film, even with a somewhat insubstantial subplot. To think that a simple story about cops and robbers can still work so well in these post-modern audience aware times is actually a testament to its level of craft and execution. I thought everything about the sub-genre had been pretty much exhausted, but 'Hell or High Water' proves, much like Bridges' grizzled performance, that there is life left in this old dog yet."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2017,6/10,"I held off watching this because the trailer didn't really impress me, but I decided to check it out in the end as it's one of the few films of last year that I hadn't seen which the critics had been raving about. It started off really well, I was quite engaged in the first act but by the end I was bored. The characters aren't that interesting or likable and the story was so predictable it was disappointing. I was hoping for a little more than just a cut and paste job from other films. We've seen so much of this countless times before and for me this just didn't stand above any of the other heist/chase films. One of the biggest issues for me was that the film requires so much suspension of disbelief in order for you to go along with what's going on that by the time it hammers its point home you just don't really feel emotionally invested. It's still good; the acting is solid and the cinematography is stunning, there are a few funny moments and what little action there is is well handled but overall I didn't think it was extraordinary like some other people have, so my advice is if you like the trailer, watch it, if the trailer didn't entice you then don't rush to it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 November 2016,8/10,"Hell or High Water is in the vein of No Country for Old Men. It has that same lonesome southwest feel with tension in the air throughout and characters to be fearful of while rooting for them at the same time. Unlike No Country though, this film isn't about evil. Its about good men and good men gone wrong. There's a little bit of both in every character. Is poverty a disease and what can it make a man think about doing? Does wearing a badge make you always right? Many themes are carried through the film. Very well acted. Excellent if taciturn script. Soundtrack and cinematography are top notch. I was tempted to give it a 9 but I guess I'm not feeling generous today :-)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 July 2020,9/10,"This film is as much about its exotic locations,costumes,eatery as it's about characters and regret they posses.
It's about people whom we rarely see..but they exist with pain with them"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 December 2016,9/10,"Most anyone living in the USA the past ten years will appreciate the unflinching commentary subtly laced through this excellent film about life in the ""New"" American economy, and especially its effect on the American Southwest.But beyond that; the sheer delight at being pulled into the story itself by excellent acting, (special praise to Ben Foster) also the artful story telling, and finding oneself rooting for the characters, all of them, is a surprise and true gratification to this jaded television baby.I didn't think Hollywood had it in them anymore! The Golden Age being long gone, I had become of the general opinion that modern Hollywood movie-makers have lost their souls, as well as their marbles, and any measurable level of talent or skill.... But perhaps I'm wrong. Watch this movie and see if you agree."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 December 2019,8/10,"Shades of Robin Hood with the banks playing the role of the Sheriff of Nottingham, played out in the flat countryside of West Texas and Oklahoma. Two serial bank robbers pursued by an unlikely duo of Texas Rangers head towards a tragic (in the Greek rather than the Hollywood sense) end.Excellent acting and a good scrip make this a movie to watch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 September 2016,9/10,"In Hell Or High Water, it's difficult to call who out of the principal four male actors provides the best performance, but my money would be on Ben Foster.Sure, Jeff Bridges turns in a terrifically gruff, grumbling turn as the Texas Ranger about to retire who must tie-up the loose ends of a series of low-key, baffling local bank robberies, but Foster really inhabits his role as one of the robbers.He literally seems to slip into his skin and show what a commanding cinematic actor he can be.Expect at the least a brace of Oscar nods for this gritty, but also frequently amusing bank robbery tale.Fate and circumstance stretch out in front of our 'heroes' like the dusty, formless, endlessly bright Texan landscapes."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 June 2020,9/10,How can i start? I out of word expressing my view of this film. The most perfect cinematography i have ever seen. And the story is so perfect that you Won't notice you are actually seeing a movie.And the ending it could not have been any better. Just PERFECT. The Direction so impressive with that modern western tone i felt like I'm seeing another masterpiece. Bow ya!It's a perfect movie to watch at a perfect night
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 June 2018,9/10,"As someone who was born and raised in Texas, I can attest to how this film accurately portrays the locality and its residents. It's fun to see what you're familiar with up on the big screen.I'm finding that words are escaping me at the moment but this film was at times funny, gritty and REAL. This movie has none of that over-the-top blockbuster feeling. It's like Thelma & Louise (a genuinely underrated film) only with two male leads instead.9/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys a compelling but not too deep action film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 November 2016,10/10,"David McKenzie directs this gritty neo Western crime drama with subtlety and confidence about two Brothers on a Bank Robbing spree and the two Cops hot on their tails. This film reminds me of the good old days when movies used to have balls, it gets straight to the point from the get go but at the same time give enough time to develop it's characters. The cinematography captures the roughness of the American south and even though I know for a fact that this film is going to get no love from the academy awards but This cinematographer deserves some attention. On the other end of the camera Mackenzie manages to pull out some great performances from his cast, especially the always underused and criminally underrated Ben Foster who manages to completely steal the show here, Chris Pine who plays the good Brother gives a career best performance imo, managing to show some acting range. Jeff Bridges plays a racist cop on the verge of retirement, I really liked the way his character is developed and the interactions between him and his half Native American half Mexican partner. I think this is probably the best film I saw this year, It works so well on every level thanks to a solid script, top notch performances and McKenzie's brilliant direction, he is a really good under-appreciated director check out his previous films especially Perfect Sense and Starred Up."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 January 2017,9/10,"This was one of the few truly great movies of 2016. This movie was even better than the highly predictable Manchester by the Sea.Being a box office sleeper this movie will not get the recognition it deserves. Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges gave outstanding performances. I fear however that tripe such as LaLa land will steal the Acadamy awards. The story was great, the performances were great, the music was terrific, the photography was good, AND the characters were so believable that you will be able to empathize with both the good and bad guys alike. This movie presented itself as a ""modern day"" western complete with lawmen, Indians, bandits, bank robberies, and a posse. What is not to like."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 February 2021,8/10,It's all great until you start using the guns you have been brandishing. But what did you expect?
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 February 2017,9/10,"Hell or High Water is a movie about two brothers, robbing banks in Texas to save family property. Few key points that you have to know about the movie: 1) Cinematography - beautiful long shots of Texas landscape that just leave you drooling, amazing soundtrack (that country music...), great editing... Direction of this movie is just top-notch 2) Pacing - this movie is incredibly slow paced. But, amazingly enough, it only helps to make it even better! There are a lot of moments where the characters just sit and wait for something or just talk about something, and the viewer is not bored with it, because of the way it's shot and because of the importance of those character building dialogues 3) Acting - casting choices are perfect. Chris Pine as the brain of the operation is great. Ben Foster as an ex-convict - even better. But the person that steals the show is Jeff Bridges. He plays Texas ranger trying to catch those two robbers as a last case before he retires and his performance choices are just brilliant. He's just this old, kind of a bitter, constantly out of breath guy who is really more interested in the motives that drive our protagonists to do what they do than really busting them. Even the supporting characters shine in this movie! I loved both waitresses (especially 'what don't you want?' lady, just brilliant :), Gil Birmingham as Jeff Bridges' partner was also really great. Bottom line - grade A acting and characters development.4) Dialogues - just brilliant. Natalie's interrorigation scene, conversations in the diners, all of the Bridges/Birmingham interactions. Masterpiece! 5) Memorable scenes - like Ben Foster's assault rifle shooting scene, full of tension police blockade scene or final conversation between main characters. One of the best movies of this decade. 9/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 November 2016,10/10,"Hell or High Water, obviously a work from the hand of a great writer, Taylor Sheridan, is a very solid flick. the cinematography¬†looked almost digital, yet immense in it's capacity to fill the screen with interesting aspects of an environment that builds the audience to the role of conscience projection of a story that definitely compels them to follow it.¬† but the reason it was really good was made even more clear that it was the work of an ambitious team of producers that truly had an end in sight and decisive means to get there through a deliberate plot guided by action-packed scenes and great dialogue.¬† Jeff Bridges did his normal overacting, which is a great method for an anti-hero sheriff whose character was written as though it was made for a Clint Eastwood.¬† even the soundtrack deserves special credit, done by Nick Cave. i haven't seen as good modern spaghetti western movie since Way of the Gun, honestly.¬† 10/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 November 2018,5/10,"You can't say that Pine is leading in anything here, Foster has his stupid death like always and Bridges delivers the same voice like in any of his parts so there is nothing much to see here. 4 Oscar Nomination and for me I just can't see it. The idea is kinda good to get back at the banks that basically have become thieves which is a modern topic but you don't get the feeling that the good guys won since once of them is dead and the retired cop with nothing to loose is hunting for the living brother so I don't know for everyone else but I was not impressed and the best thing maybe is the quick and short scene so the movie don't make you feel that its being dragged like in movies that are hour and a half but you had the feeling that 2+ hours passed."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 December 2016,10/10,"Wonderful film. The locale and time frame of this modern crime film/western is similar to ""No Country for Old Men"", but, despite the fact that I admire the work of the Coen Brothers and Cormac McCarthy, I think it is a much better movie. It is less contrived and Jeff Bridges is allowed to remain true to his character. Although actually filmed in nearby Eastern New Mexico it presents a moving portrait of the realities of West Texas. The poor white working class, which never heard of ""white privilege"", the predatory lending practices of local banks, the resentment of the descendants of the Comanches ""lords of the plains"",and the ethos of the Texas Rangers. At the same time it manages to spin an excellent action adventure yarn without drowning the movie in car chases and gunfights. Jeff Bridges is excellent as the old Texas Ranger, as is his partner a half Mexican half Comanche played by Alberto Parker. Chris Power and Ben Foster are terrific as the two brothers one desperate, the other crazy who come up with a pretty smart but very risky plot to right an old wrong. Two cameos by a couple of tough waitresses are wonderful. The script is understated, witty, and deals with a panoply of social issues without being wordy or preachy. The direction is crisp and focused. The cinematography make great use of the spare dry Southwestern landscape. I believe you will enjoy this exciting and moving film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 October 2016,9/10,"The two male leads and Jeff Bridges make this a film you want to see. By a certain age, you've seen all the plots before - as here. However, despite some flaws in logic, the lead brother are compelling characters. Some lines stay with you since they are pretty cool. It is gritty, it is masculine, and it conveys the burden of economic hardship.There are a few too many flying bullets for a really great movie and it is a missed step they use a few a over done bang bang scene that was not the film needed. They needed to convey the real fear of taking a few rounds - not edging slightly to the comical. The ending comes with a slight twist and a certain fearsome gravitas that makes you think a while. Several smaller roles - the customers in cafes - or a lawyer or banker - are presented by actors who have a command of the style of movie. They add an authenticity to a film based in Western Texas.I recommend it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 February 2020,8/10,"Hell Or High Water is a film directed by David Mackenzie that stars Ben Foster, Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. Hell Or High Water manages to tell quite the compelling story despite trudging through the usual Western tropes thanks to a brilliant script written by Taylor Sheridan that fully fleshes out the characters thanks to the necessity of their actions being pushed forward due to dire circumstances. Chris Pine gives the best performance of his career and Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster follow closely behind. The music brilliantly sets the mood for a western Texas ravaged by depression and characters that aren't happy with their lives, I'd highly recommend listening to the score. The sound design and the shoot-outs and set pieces within the film are beautifully crafted almost as beautiful as the film's stunning choreography. Overall, despite the occasional trope or stereotype this film manages to do largely everything right as a film and is definitely one of the better westerns I've seen in recent memory."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 August 2017,6/10,"I noticed that the majority of the characters in this movie wore the same exact hats. While some didn't wear hats, those that did wear cowboy hats were very distinct, white with a dark band around it, the same grooves, and most distinctly, three holes on either side. There must've been a sale on dumb ass cowboy hats for a bulk price. By the way the movie was pretty good but not fabulous."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,4/10,"Despite the great performances and beautiful cinematography, it was like watching paint dry because the story wasn't there and the pacing was slower than a statue crawling in a leisurely stroll down a sidewalk. The story is supposed to be about two brothers who rob the branches of one specific bank, Texas Midland Bank, and the two Texas Rangers (not one as the advertising would lead you to believe) that chase them. The plan is to rob the banks that hold the reverse mortgage on the ranch the younger brother inherited and then use that money to payoff the mortgage. Aka, pay the bank with the same money they stole from it, after they launder the money through an out of state casino of course. Two Texas Rangers that don't really like each other are assigned the case. Of course, one is an old near retirement bigot and the other is Mexican and Commanchie minority. Of the brothers, one is a father with two sons and an ex-wife. The other brother is an ex-con that was convicted of - what else?- bank robbing. He is looking for redemption. He is dumber than his younger brother. That is all the depth these characters have because They all are rather flat and swallow. The story is shallow because certain things were never explained. They tell that the bank is evil and deserve to be robbed. But they never tell you why or show the bank doing an evil act to deserve retribution for their action. This makes it hard to feel for the brothers. Don't use old overworked tired reference clinches. SHOW US! The makers of this film relying on the average audience members having their own problems with their banks in order to having immediate sympathy with the brothers. That is a bad idea and lazy storytelling. In, the way the details of the plan was worked out and who thought of it was vague too. We never see the young brother coming up with the plan. We just hear everyone else say he thought of it AFTER THE PLAN WAS ALREADY SET INTO MOTION when the film starts! Yes, we don't see any of the pre-planning. Lazy storytelling again. In fact, almost all of the script seams to be racists jokes about Mexicans, Indians, Christians, and religion. Oh, and of course, near the end, we see the tired clich√© of the old ranger having a hound dog as a pet. This film does have it's good points like it's realistic touches and cinematography that makes you feel in you are in Texas. However, when it comes to the acting, it falls apart. The lead roles all turn in stellar performance which Pine and Bridges are the best. But once you get past the leads, it comes crystal clear many of the supporting roles had people who were not professional actors, especially the cowboy in the bank, the Cowboys in the restaurant, and the T-bone steak waitress. But even with the professional actors there was a problem because between Bridges and Gil Birmingham who play the two Texas Rangers, there was no chemistry at all between the two actors. Birmingham played his role like he was made of wood because it was so understated. This movie is way way over hyped. Save money. Wait for it on free TV."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 December 2016,10/10,"If you care for your cinematic soul in the movie apocalypse of CGI effects and soulless scripts this movie can be yours. The year is 2016 and director David Mackenzie is resurrecting the Western genre. It's the 21 century Wild-Wild-Best where the main protagonists have more to say with facial expressions, dialogue and scenes.They speak between the lines and this invisible speech penetrates the veins of your senses.In these Texas landscapes you can see a mirror of nowadays America. This is America of the poor and the desolate.Vast land, old cars, banks which prove who are the current slaves to the system and which you can rob at least few times on the movie screen for one year. Banks that have done so much damage to humanity and nothing has changed but only aggravated.Nevertheless, there is nothing vulgar in this movie, so do not expect Tarantino or The Good,The Bad & The Ugly. It is more Bonnie & Clyde meet the character of Michael Douglas from Falling Down. It has the feel of Blue Ruin and No Country For Old Men.The human wreckage lies in the middle of the story, that you have seen many times but this one, is so far the best and is beyond words. The mirror of the movie can be applied to any other place in the world.The social anomaly of how sometimes you can do the craziest thing in your life because the system had failed and you are either Neo, or Noah or Tanner & Toby in this movie.The secret is to take the reins in your hands and cross through the unthinkable. Well, would you? As I said, at least do that on the screen!Ben Foster steals the show in the brothers team, in a Breaking Bad finale.Your brain counts every second. The density of the masculinity & the protest within the massacre are so intense and merge in a self-destructive outburst in one of the saddest but expected endings.Chris Pine completes the damned symphony in almost monologue but still a dialogue ""There-was-no- other-way"" verbal clash with the old cop character played by Jeff Bridges. Epic,sweaty and dusty music from Nick Cave & Warren Ellis complements the cathartic message of this great little movie. A very personal movie. A movie that will stay and to which you will return and reflect in the echoes of your continuous self interpretation."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 February 2017,6/10,"I'm sure this film will be compared to 'No Country for Old Men' a lot. Both are set in Texas, with a near-retired ranger chasing morally ambiguous men on the run. However, in that comparison, 'Hell or High Water' comes up rather short. The cinematography was nice for the most part, but at times looked cheap and mediocre. The music was forgettable, and occasionally really out-of-place. There is a scene near the beginning where the brothers enter their Mother's old bedroom, and the director blasts violin music at the audience, hammering in the emotion to the point that it took me out of the film. The plot was mostly predictable. With about 30 minutes left in the film I knew precisely what would happen, and I was proved correct. However, that doesn't stop it from being a really entertaining film, just not a great one. The dialogue was really hit-and-miss. The banter between the brothers was mostly natural and fun. Yet the banter between Ranger Hamilton and his partner, Parker, is really repetitive and forced. To the point it is obvious they are telegraphing an emotional climactic scene between them.Though I've listed plenty of negatives, there's a lot to love in this film. Pine and particularly Foster were fantastic. Foster has long been one of my favourite actors in Hollywood, and he's never turned in a half-arsed performance. In this film he's amazing. He was given permission to go wild and ham-it-up and he is compulsively watchable. Every moment he is on the screen, we are drawn to him. It's a shame he wasn't nominated for an Oscar while Bridges was. I'm sorry to say I don't think Bridges was great in this film. I think it may be that his character is near identical to Sheriff Bell from NCFOM, but everything about his character was predictable and derivative. He didn't feel real like Bell, he FELT like a Hollywood construct.The opening act of this film is fantastic, as is the last. Though it drags in the middle, the set-pieces are worth it, and I'm glad I saw it. It won't be a classic like NCFOM, and it lacks any true gut-wrenching feeling. But it's not forgettable either. And the scenes and performances that are worth it, and REALLY worth it. Give it a watch"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 November 2016,7/10,"Hell of High water is a new movie based on script made be Tyler Sheridan who is mostly known as writer of fantastic Sicario.We are following two brothers (Chris Pine, Ben Foster) who are doing what they have to in order to collect some money that is much needed and they are chased by Jeff Bridges who always delivers a great performance. This movie is slow paced but gives us a great insight into lives of people living in the rural Texas, USA. As someone coming from Europe, fact that almost all citizens carry guns with themselves at all times is both intriguing and terrifying. Would you feel safe, for example, drinking at a bar knowing every customers has a loaded revolver at their side? Although not as good, or as complex, as Sicario, this movie makes me want to look out for any new releases written by Sheridan. Direction (David Mackenzie, known for Starred Up) is very solid as well. In my opinion, ending is well executed as well as all the action sequences.In the end, I would recommend this movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 February 2017,8/10,"So, here is a European perspective on this modern western. The fact, that every male from young to old is not only carrying a gun, but also willing to make use of it, is fascinating and scaring me at the same time. ""Hell or High Water"" is set in a world, where everybody could be killed out of nowhere by some random guy, you happen to bump into at the gas station. Every character in this movie has an aura of suppressed aggression, that is just waiting to be given a valve. The astonishing thing is: Nobody is actually questioning that and realizing the consequences, that come with this situation. Quite the contrary is true: Even the Texas Rangers, who are tasked with law enforcement, have no problems with civilians trying to hunt down heavily armed and dangerous bank robbers. They even borrow a weapon from them, if their own equipment appears not to be suited for the situation. In that sense, this movie is a fascinating insight into the nightmare, the American Dream has turned into. It reminded me strongly of ""Out of the Furnace"" from a couple of years ago. Both movies deal with self justice and governmental institutions, that fail to protect the weakest of society. Which in return leaves them no other option than taking matters in to their own hands. Based on the positive reactions to this movie, I assume, that American audiences really appreciate, how this movie depicted contemporary America. A story like this could never unfold in the same way in Europe. That alone makes ""Hell or High Water"" well worth a watch, because it does something, that all great movies should do: It opens a door into a world, you otherwise could not experience in your own life. Put this together with great performances and a fantastic cinematography and you have all the ingredients for perfect film experience."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 August 2016,9/10,"David Mackenzie's latest film, Hell or High Water, feels like one of those movies that could've been made at any point in cinema's existence. It is a simple meat-and-potatoes tale of bank heists and blood brothers, the sort of story that great directors from Kubrick and Altman to Arthur Penn and Tarantino have made their staple at one time or another. And though it's set against the woeful landscape of an America in the throes of the most recent economic downtown, you could easily see it taking place in the Dust Bowl era of Bonnie & Clyde. Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (scribe of last year's superior Sicario), Mackenzie sets his film in the Texas midlands, the last frontier against ""progress,"" as the few scattered denizens would call the encroaching destruction of their old-fashioned way of life. Gone are the desperadoes, the Gary Coopers and Jesse Jameses of old, and all that's left are a few dying embers of what had once been the great American dream. Three such embers are at the heart of Hell or High Water, and it's these three that set the desert fields ablaze in a trail of blood and violence. Two of these three are a pair of brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard‚Äîrough country boys who are at once peas in a pod and yet polar opposites. Toby (a sufficiently grunged-up Chris Pine, playing a stoic Southern loner role that somehow bypassed Josh Brolin, who usually corners the market on such parts) is quiet but decent, eking out a hardscrabble existence in a desperate attempt to keep his family ranch from foreclosure. His big brother Tanner is far more erratic and intense, which makes the casting of Ben Foster a no-brainer. Tanner's antics seem downright Tremor Brother-esque; a hard-living ex-jailbird with no compunction against brutality if required. The brothers have cooked up a scheme to save the family farm as well as get revenge on the faceless banks that have f_cked them over: by pulling a string of penny-ante heists at each branch, taking only cashiers' trays of loose bills (to prevent ink-pack bursts and access to traceable currency). It's a smart play, but also one that requires several jobs in rapid succession. And sooner or later, their luck will inevitably run out. This is where the third ember comes into play: Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton. Played as a prickly amalgamation of Rooster Cogburn and Columbo, Jeff Bridges's soon-to-retire lawman decides to pursue the bank job investigation as one final hurrah before he turns in his star. Paired with Gil Birmingham's stalwart, snarky Alberto (who also bears the brunt of his partner's deliberately un- P.C. ribbing), Marcus shrewdly assesses that the thieves are working towards a goal and accurately calculates the locations they'd need to hit in order to meet their quota. But as with every single heist film since the days of old, something goes wrong. There is a grim edge to Hell or High Water, but it refuses to wallow in it. Instead, it is bleakly funny, fraught with little character foibles sure to get a chuckle or two out of any audience. Even in the tensest moments (and there are more than a few, be forewarned), there is a nevertheless a laid- back undercurrent. In large part, it's due to how easy the three leads slip into their characters and convey decades' worth of life and experience in their performances. Bridges impresses the most, at least for me‚Äîthere are several moments in the film where he is as good as he ever has been, even as the Dude‚Äîand you could almost see yearly spin-offs built around the character on cable TV. Pine, who usually sings best playing zany sorts like in his Carnahan collaborations, nevertheless is very striking as a low-key working joe who nevertheless has a depth of insight far exceeding his rough-hewn appearance. And then there's Foster, who is never anything but riveting when he's on-screen and whose mercurial talents continue to cement him as one of the peak actors around. Hell or High Water also cements Sheridan as a writer to watch out for. His last two scripts have been perfectly methodical, like a chemist's precise formula, almost perfectly calibrated. He has an ear for dialogue, both ruminating (at one point, a cowpoke laments that the way the country's going, no wonder his kids don't want to raise cattle for a living) and snappy (""Only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb."" ""Drink up.""). Aided by a plaintive score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis‚Äîas if there could be any better pick‚ÄîSheridan's voice is powerful enough that it almost seems like Mackenzie hardly has to do any heavy lifting at all. And though he doesn't set up high-octane thrills like Denis Villeneuve did with Sicario, he instead presents a sober, soulful threnody to the dying myth of the American outlaw. (On a final note, I agree with Tanner: only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb.)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 August 2017,9/10,"I didn't get to see this movie in the theaters and couldn't wait until I could watch it on streaming or DVD. I had heard so many good things about it, and sometimes when that happens I get a bit of a letdown when it turns out not to be as good as the hype. This was definitely not the case with this one. The movie is a wonderful and exciting viewing experience. The highlights of my enjoyment were the performances by Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges, the wonderful score and soundtrack, and the beautiful cinematography. Everything came together great in this wonderful modern day western. A must see."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 April 2021,10/10,The soundtrack for this film is very underrated. One of the best soundtracks for a Western/Drama I have ever heard.Add in amazing acting from all the mains and the bleak but somehow beautiful West Texas setting and this film is awesome. For some reason I just find this film really watchable and never get tired of it. Ive watched it at least 5 times and it still hasnt gotten old.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 November 2016,7/10,"I'm not going to say I didn't like this film, because I did, but I did not like it as well as I thought I might. Although it succeeded in providing a character driven, atmospheric film, it's glacial pacing really began to drag a bit, and the predictable excitement was saved for the climax, per formula, and then it got pretty lively. The Clint Eastwood film Unforgiven came to mind for some reason, after looking at the critical raves that it drew, and the accolades it gathered, it is not one of my favorite westerns, and I do love westerns. Perhaps I have been watching films for too many years, and have a rich trove of favorites with which to compare any of the newer offerings. Maybe old eyes just see things differently. Jeff Bridges is always fun to watch, and the film is otherwise well cast. So I would recommend it, while I go and dig up a copy of Hud, or The Last Picture Show, or something with the Duke."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 November 2016,7/10,"I rated this movie because it had a good plot and no exaggerated action that most films have nowadays. Fed up of everybody being a Bruce Lee, there was only one , bless him. Also, no silly car chases and people being hit 20 times and still standing. This movie was a breath of fresh air and I wish other directors would take note - not all of us are kids. The average becoming adult now must think cars can survive the chases they go, through blow up as soon they touch anything, or people with guns can shoot a penny/cent a mile off with a pistol. So much cow dung out there!You felt for the criminal and the lawman in this film. I am so glad I watched it. Please let see some more of this director ' David Mackenzie'Acting was spot on and accompanied by some dark humour.I do like action, but real action that could be possible, believable, not the likes of Bourne, fast and furious, they are well past there sell by date. We need more films like ' Leon, Heat, Open Range '"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 December 2016,5/10,"Not bad. Much better than your everyday Hollywood garbage. Cleanly edited, doesn't drag too much, fairly engaging plot. Has some parts that aren't entirely fleshed out like the stupid line right at the beginning. There's just something off and it feels like it's not polished, but still has a Hollywood sheen on it nonetheless. it's all done pretty well, but none of the characters seem real. None of it feels authentic. The three main characters seem like actors trying on their country western clothes, though Jeff Bridges is always fun. The social commentary is also pretty ham-fisted, and non-committal aside from ""banks = bad."" I suppose they should get credit for at least stepping somewhat away from the good guy vs. bad guy clich√©. Pretty good cinematography. Makes the Midwest look serene and lovely and solemn all at once. Worth a watch, and maybe a second viewing."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 September 2016,9/10,"Simply a well structured and remarkably crafted movie. Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges deliver superb performances that truly are award worthy. The tone is somber all the way through with tremendous spikes of tragedy and humor. At first, the story seems shallow because it picks up directly following the brothers as they rob banks. No back story or set up, just directly in to events. It's as the movie unfolds that they flesh out the characters and their motivations. What results is truly riveting with each lead getting proper treatment as both Pine's character and Bridge's character converge. When they do finally meet, it's cinematic gold. Some clich√©s hold back the characterization just a bit (all banks are evil, all Texicans are gun toting nuts, poor people are always held down by ""the man"") but they in no means derail the movie.A must watch if you're a film fan."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 August 2020,9/10,"I saw somewhere that the difference between American film making and French Film making is that American films are plot driven and French films are character driven. I bring this up because of the number of really negative responses to this movie seem uniformly opposed to the plausibility of the PLOT of Hell Or High Water., which I guess is understandable, because the plots of most good-to-great films are not only plausible but can be schematically diagrammed and empirically proven to be %100 absolutely demonstrable as the GENUINE ARTICLE, narratively speaking...That this approach is complete nonsense in determining whether a movie has credibility or not should seem pretty obvious, but there are always hard-core narrative constructivists, the Anthony Scalias of pseudo-criticism, to wit: if nobody ever done this, then it's all a bunch of horse hockey.Plot is important; a narrative arc that is rational and symmetrically pleasing can be a beautiful thing. But, it's not the only thing. There are endless number of great films with plots that either make no sense, are hyper-inflated, are just plain silly or are just not plot-dependant. In the end, it doesn't matter, because story-telling is not about plot. Yes, the plot matters, but there is so much more that makes an engaging , interesting, and beautiful story in narrative film making.Hell or High Water is an excellent film. If your standards require that THE PLOT of a film adhere to narrow strictures of...whatever, then your viewing pleasure may be affected. If you like to observe people under pressure, exhibiting idiosyncratic characteristics that speak to the strengths and weaknesses that all of us have, then you might find this satisfying. I like it. A lot."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,9/10,"""Different"" is code for mental handicapped in this case.Anyway, herein lies a rather humorous spectacle of human handicaps. But why do they have to belittle drunkenness and gambling by associating it with these poor idiots ? Why do that, seriously?Look, it's one of those odd movies that you just sort of don't know how to react to. Of course, not a black person to be found. But two Indians do manage to get included for some sort of semi comic belittling? Again, not sure what this is about. Ultimately I consider myself an Indian, because I am of Tahitian descent, which was an ancient and extinct race of humans. And I have Scandinavian native genes as well, the very far north living humans who are also extinct.I couldn't tell you what kind of humans are depicted in this really, nor what kind of humans inhabit this earth.But, I know that I am of the ancient and extinct races of humans. So I have an understanding of their fate, their end. It is good to have ended.In my minds eye."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 February 2020,8/10,I finally took time to sit and watch this! From the opening to the end I enjoyed it! A well crafted story that doesn't give it all up front. Sad but very enjoyable film with great acting and direction!
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 November 2016,8/10,"I liked this movie for a few reasons. First of all this is a good movie. Some movies depend on who is watching it or who the movie is geared towards, well even if you do not like this movie...you will still think it is well done, well acted, perfectly executed and gripping. Even if the genre does not appeal to you at all the movie is so obviously well done that it is very hard to dislike.That being said there were strong characters, compelling action sequences, lots of moral philosophy thrown in and ideas such as 'is it worth stealing if you are doing it out of a loving and financial obligation to your family'.Also refreshing that this movie was not riddled with smart phones, laptops, social networking and similar situations. I get that it is a part of our culture but it is more interesting to use technological devices than watch actors pretend to use them, strong story without any need for gadgets computers or computer generated special effects.Go watch it!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 November 2016,8/10,"This is a movie that relies on simplicity over complexity. It uses the backdrop of West Texas, which stretches out as far as the eye can see and is really brought to life by the absolutely masterful cinematography of Giles Nuttgens.That is probably the films biggest strength, in my opinion anyway. The picture is so smooth but with so much edge that it is impossible to not get sucked into the world this film attempts to convey. Every shot in this movie has a story, and is filled with so much detail hidden in plain site that my jaw was dropped for most of the duration.The story is about two brothers caught up in the career of robbing small banks scattered around the small towns of West Texas. Played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine, the relationship of these brothers unfolds in a way that allows us to have an idea of how their relationship has been before the events of the film.That is the magnificence of this film. The way it throws us right into the middle of the story of these characters. It doesn't rely on much exposition either. The film shows us who these characters are and why they are doing what they are doing. The brilliant acting of Foster and Pine make it feel all the more sweeter. Jeff Bridges is as good as he's ever been as the retired turned back cop who comes across the case of the bank robberies. Every other actor in the movie also does a really good job.Hell or High Water is a brilliant crime film set in modern West Texas that feels almost like a 21st century western. It's cinematography and performances, as well as the writing all combine to form an incredibly subtle, yet touching film about family, friendship, and doing what is necessary for the ones you love, even if that means breaking the law."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 November 2018,7/10,"Perhaps a bit overhyped though. Performances were great, but Bridges insistence in the end made little sense to me. I'd say generally after the two brothers scheme succeeded the film was over for me. Unfortunately not for the director."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 June 2020,10/10,"This movie provides a fresh take on storytelling of a Western, if it may be counted as one. The initial 10 min of the movie could bore many in the audience. But once you are past that it provides a really great and gripping storytelling of these small town amateur robbers. The setting of West Texas also enhances the ruggedness and authenticity that this movie required. Along with quite an engaging storytelling. Credit to where it is due performances of both Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges is exceptional."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 December 2017,7/10,"On the face of it this is a standard cops-and-robbers bank heist tale, with a chalk/cheese pair of protagonists and a cliche edge-of-retirement lawman to give chase.The script here though is sharper than your average. Jeff Bridges (on form) as the lawman, pulls out zingers a-plenty and there's generally plenty of black humour to go around. A deft melding of the ol' Slow West (gun) stock with a modern layering of dead-end ghost towns and bank foreclosures: the huge Texan landscapes & skies, both entirely empty, the camera snaps up whenever the opportunity arises, the moody score (when not dipping into Country-Rock) and dialogue all contributing to the very definite feel of a moody mourning, like something in this world is lost or broken.Old fashioned American film-making, albeit from a Scottish director, I found this is a little lethargic to get going but by the end I was completely sold."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 June 2020,8/10,"This is a terrific movie, especially if you like rural town dramas. Jeff Bridges is great.Would have given it an even higher rating if it wasn't for the no-so-veiled constant ""blame others"" narrative (in this case, blame the greedy banks for ruining small town America, so robbing them is OK). Give me a break. Here's a little advice: less is more, especially when it comes to your preaching about banks actually wanting to get their loans repaid, heaven forbid.Otherwise it is very entertaining and well acted."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2016,9/10,"A fine movie, worthy of addition to the other great films set in Texas such as Hombre, Last Picture Show, and No Country for Old Men. My one gripe is with this and many other films and that is the gratuitous addition of music at regular intervals. First, it is the lazy director's way of manipulating feelings ( ooh, something bad's going to happen, the music tells me so) and filling space. The songs in this movie are sentimental but the images are anything but. I played two great scenes without sound, one, where the two brothers wrestle in the twilight and the other the last few minutes at the end and both are much stronger without music (natural sounds OK). I think this addiction to music interludes ( probably insisted upon by some tone deaf executive) began with 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. It worked with that movie but rarely since. But otherwise 'Hell or High Water' is brilliant - acting, direction, and writing all top-notch."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 February 2017,6/10,"This is a good all-around movie. There are times when the pacing slows and the movie gets somewhat sedate, while looking at them with that west Texas glow about their faces. You may find yourself daydreaming a bit. Then the atmosphere changes. The movie is good at delivering key plot points after slow points in the plot. However, the way the movie started, who would have thought this movie would slow at all. It is not full of action; it is a movie with very good dialogue and a simple plot. They need money to secure a life for their loved ones, and they ain't gonna earn it by working! When the movie starts, you think it's gonna be the wild wild west. Then it turns to this thought provoking, moody movie. The movie becomes a vehicle for the sheriff ‚Äì Jeff Bridges. He's a better actor in his older age. All the actors are excellent. Chris Pine's range is a surprise. Ben Foster is great as usual. His Oscar day is coming. Nevertheless, make no mistake, this is a vehicle for Bridges and he delivers. The movie has great action when it has action, great dialogue first and foremost, and pretty good cinematography. However, it's being held back by the pacing and the ending. The movie should have gone all the way, a little more action, a little more suspense, danger and an ending that shows instead of imagines. A final showdown would have been nice. However, the movies becomes 'No Country for Old Men' on Benadryl."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 September 2016,9/10,"I can't believe people aren't going to this film in droves. The cast, the writing, cinematography, the score....all quite excellent. Good people doing bad things for good reasons is basically the story but, the way it's told is just masterful. The two brothers, played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine, are great foils for each other and act their parts to perfection: Foster the crazy ex con trying to support his younger brother played with quiet subtlety by Pine. They fight and love just like brothers....reminded me of me and my sister. The sibling connection really comes through on the screen. Jeff Bridges will probably get an Oscar nod for his grizzled lawman on the edge of retirement, and well he should! The entire cast deserves an Oscar nod as well as the director, cinematographer, the screenwriter and Chris Stapleton. If you haven't seen this one go.....and I'm not saying this just because I'm from Texas."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 September 2016,9/10,"Awesome modern western movie with brilliant performances all round. It's a movie Im very likely to buy DVD of and treasure it. Tired ( and even frustrated ) with CGI crap which is being made and shown liberally, HOHW comes as a breath of fresh air. I really enjoyed it thoroughly. It's pretty gripping and has no dead spots at all. The story is pretty good as well. I am truly glad i went to see the movie. Well done crew - - producers directors actors etc. My thumb way up for y'all!!!!! I forgot to mention that the locales were rather well chosen by the makers. I believe most of the movie was shot in Texas and the neighboring state of Oklahoma. Loved to see the oil being drilled in the backdrop in several scenes, just lends more authenticity to the movie, I believe. This movie is a must see for all western movie lovers!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 August 2019,8/10,"Two brothers are robbing banks with different motives as the law closes in. Set in modern day rural Texas the brothers must stay one step ahead of the law whilst dealing with Texas locals who aren't afraid to defend their towns.A highly enjoyable movie. All of the cast does a great job, providing some tense scenes mixed with a little humour here and there too. A solid crime drama that is well worth watching.I really enjoyed Thunderbolt and Lightfoot with Jeff Bridges, another modern western about robbing banks from the 70s. This time Jeff Bridges plays it more serious as the retiring policeman as opposed to bank robber.Chris Pine does a good job proving he can turn his hand to more grittier roles.I am a big fan of the coen brothers movies Blood Simple and No Country For Old Men. For me this movie will go on the same shelf.After recently whetting my appetite for westerns again with the sisters brothers, this movie has left me wanting to watch more."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 June 2020,6/10,"I don't think this is a great movie, but I like Jeff Bridges, so... The most interesting parts of this film come from the themes of white poverty and inequality which go hand in hand with the power of the financial institutions that hold these poor people by their throats. Chris Pine does a fine job of portraying his difficult relationship with his ex-con brother, his love for his boys, and his seething hatred for the system that has kept his family poor for so many generations. Though Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for this film, his role is captivating, mostly because he's Jeff Bridges and he plays these parts so well. Yet, his character seems to be unaware that he is part of the machinery that keeps the status quo in place. While Bridges sits on the front porch in an old wooden chair, his partner asks what he's doing, and Bridges replies, ""I'm practicing my future,"" by which he means his soon to be retirement. He too is a cog in the wheel, and we can't help but love the man for his honesty. A good film overall."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 October 2016,9/10,"After a very disappointing summer, I was very happy to see a good film like this in the theaters. Hell or High Water has all the elements I am looking for in a good film. It's engaging, it has beautiful cinematography, a killer soundtrack, great acting (with great chemistry between the characters), a nice and interesting political message and very good writing.Chris Pine plays a very three dimensional character and so does Jeff Bridges. Their characters are both morally imperfect, but they are portrayed as the good guys. I think it's interesting to think about who really are the good and bad guys in this film, but one character for sure is evil: the banksHell or High Water is not afraid to address a flaw in American society. Banks are ripping us off, who cares if they get robbed? The banks control the human, of course there will be resistance. The banks are the reason our protagonists rob banks after all.One thing I didn't like about this film is mentioning how native Americans got their land taken, it's sad but true but I didn't think it belonged in this film. Maybe the screenwriters wanted to be a bit politically correct, or the message about natives just didn't get to me, since I'm not American myself. Apart from it being set in Texas and having lots of wide shots of deserted landscapes, there are some very recognizable tropes from the Western genre. First of all, the white hat obviously resembles the good guys, while the black hates represents the bad guys. But that's why only Jeff Bridges' character can be seen with a white hat in the poster. He's a police officer, he brings criminals to justice. However, beneath this white hat lies a broken man coming to his end. Furthermore, the story of this film felt like a western, two men robbing banks must've been influenced by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Also, we can't forget the accents, that also give this film a western feeling.I was very happy with this film, it lived up to expectations (this film was on my radar for a while), it's a great addition to the Neo Western genre and it got me excited for David Macenzie's upcoming projects."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 January 2019,9/10,"It's been some time since we've seen a movie like this. A simple story with good guys and bad guys with a good excuse. Nothing fancy here, you may even guess the end, but it won't disappoint. Jeff Bridges plays an ideal Texas Ranger that's at the end of their career. Gil Birmingham is the other Texas Ranger that's counting the days his partner(Jeff Bridges)retires. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are fabulous playing the brothers on a mission. Long and short, the film and the cast deliver."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 February 2017,8/10,"Hell or High Water really caught me off guard. I saw it for the cast and was blown away with their performance and the gritty tale of desperation. Bridges played his typical role very well (nomination) and Pine was the believable every man, but Ben Foster laid it all on the line and was fun to watch. Even though it was well shot you will be fine watching this at home. It received nominations for Best Drama Picture, Supporting Actor and Screenplay."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 November 2019,8/10,"Another very good modern western. Taylor Sheridan(Wind River, Sicario) knows what he's doing. It's easy to see why it was nominated for best picture. Very well made with a little social commentary. Absolutely worth watching."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 January 2017,3/10,"Sure were some pretty shots in this thing, so many it's like the tonal palette was a fourth character, in the same way lens flare was a character in the recent Star Trek re-imaginings, reminding us to take note of how much care went into the colour correction. Why the need for this fourth character? Perhaps because the story is so needlessly, dog-walkingly banal, the colour manipulation could stand in for gravitas. Riding perhaps on the faintest memory of No Country for Old Men, a film that makes the much vaunted so-called art of Hell or High Water look like a pile of chocolate bar wrappers strewn on the floor, this exercise in stretching a fleeting moment of acting into a two hour migraine is, under all the tonal work, daft and missable."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2016,8/10,"This was great. Really enjoyable. Nice to have a movie where dialogue over powers sounds of explosions, screaming, tires squealing, people swearing and filling the screen with ""people"" pointing guns sideways and repeatedly yelling out the words ""Yo"", ""Homey"" or ""Bitch"".Jeff Bridges is what makes this movie. I love Jeff, but ever since Crazy Heart I worry that...well..... he could be a bit over the top. ""True Grit"" is a great example of how he went too far. Here? he doesn't. He takes the character right up to where he looks like me may ""go to far"" and stays there, right where he should be.I like that the Brothers are NOT made to look like heroes. People that may influence a few morons in our country to ""copy cat"". Credit needs to be given there.There is a few ""Holy Crap"" moments, and several moments of wonder. But the key here is the lost art of the Spoken Word.After the movie, I thought... Jeff may get a nomination for this. Then reality set in, I recalled SO many roles like his through the ages that never did, they were just accepted for what they were. Great actors that were under appreciated. Then I thought... well.... the ""award"" is for ""best in THAT year""? and if ""they"" keep creating junk as they do, well, sure then, hey... Jeff really shines here, he really does.No need to get into details.... I'll keep it simple....just watch.Good stuff."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 June 2019,3/10,"In addition to my review about this being an affront to Texas, it was filmed in New Mexico. In fact the same location as Breaking Bad's penultimate episode."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 August 2017,1/10,"If I'd seen this movie before Trump got elected, I might have given it a 2 rating instead of a 1. I don't care about West Texas and I certainly don't want to try to ""understand"" its citizens. The best thing about the movie is Jeff Bridge. Otherwise, it's just awful. West Texas, bigoted, gun toting ignoraamuses, the ugliest scenery I've ever had to endure, cattle herding, stereotypical ""men"" who make wise cracks to each other to form bonds, lonely waitresses,stupid bank robbers, and a plot you could drive a truck through. An example: the bank robbers steal the money from a bank at 8:30 in the morning. (This is in the first scene, so it's not a spoiler). They drive away. A cop car goes by in answer to an alarm at the bank. There are NO other cars on the road. The police don't stop the car to search it. If the police in this town are that dumb, they deserve the bank robbers they've got. The dialogue is flat and almost unintelligible, the characters are predictable, the plot is weak."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 January 2019,9/10,"A great storyline, which carries the viewer along at a good pace throughout to the more than satisfactory ending. The location footage is brilliant as is the music.
I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 August 2016,10/10,"I actually went to see this with my brother and we both thoroughly enjoyed this film. It probably helped that we're both Texans and have spent some time in West Texas so combine that with the brother narrative and it really made for a fun, nostalgic ride. Similar to Fargo and No Country for Old Men, this film completely nails the landscape (although filmed in similarly looking New Mexico), along with the charm of its people, albeit sometimes sarcastic charm. I loved Sicario, so being penned by the same writer, he deserves some tangible credit as both are solid, captivating, character driven films. I actually laughed a lot and didn't really expect it watching the trailer. There are so many original and heartfelt funny scenes in the film that don't feel forced or contrived, but truly genuine. ALL the actors were perfectly cast and did an outstanding job. Katy Mixon and Gil Birmingham really stole the show for me. Some of the pacing was a little off at times, and the backstory could have been a little more fleshed out, but overall, this was a beautifully shot, beautifully acted and original film that should be seen and remembered...especially considering the endless dross that's stained the retinas of late."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 January 2017,10/10,"Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as bank robbing brothers in this superb modern Western from Starred Up Director David Mackenzie. With a screenplay written by the acclaimed Taylor Sheridan (Sicario), Hell Or High Water is a tense, taut and brooding crime drama set in present day Texas.The plot is simple: the family ranch is on the verge of being repossessed by the bank, so Pine resorts to desperate measures and teams up with his criminal brother Foster as they embark on a series of bank robberies in order to raise the cash to secure the ranch. They are soon pursued by Jeff Bridges' almost-retired Texas Ranger as they work their way through a number of small, near-desolate Texan towns.However, whilst the premise here may be straightforward, Mackenzie actually offers us something hugely substantial. The quiet Texan towns and the desperation of the brothers are just some of the methods in which Mackenzie shows us how the global economic crisis has had, and still has, a devastating effect on people. We see a waitress desperate to hang onto a generous tip, houses for sale and a number of roadside billboards and posters offering loans and debt consolidation schemes. Indeed, the banks themselves are very much portrayed as the villain here, and as such it's very hard not to want to root for Pine and Foster as they cleverly seek to steal the money they need from the very branch they owe, so that they can make the necessary payments with the bank's own money.Considering this is a story that could perhaps have been set in any town, any state, or any country even, Hell Or High Water felt very much like an homage to the genre of Western movies but also to Texas itself. The sumptuous sweeping shots of the towns and absolutely gorgeous photography of untouched prairie landscapes felt as if they were intended to show the state of Texas in both its expansive and desolate glory, whilst providing the audience with a nod to the great Westerns of old (High Noon, The Searchers and True Grit all springing to mind).Credit must go to Mackenzie for superbly merging the old with the new here. This is ultimately a story founded on the 21st century economic crisis, yet set in what is ultimately a 19th century backdrop. One scene in particular that stood out for me was when the brothers were filling up their car at a gas station; a cowboy leaves the scene on horseback as two young kids drive up blaring out music from their car. Later, we see Jeff Bridges' Texas Ranger and his partner held up in their car as they wait for a group of cowboys to drive their cattle across the road. These were odd juxtapositions but they perhaps serve to highlight this fundamental theme within the film.Numerous references to Native Americans further enhance this idea; the acknowledgement of what once was. Again, though, there is more substance here, in that these references serve to point out an irony that the citizens of today's America are having everything taken away from them (by the banks) as the Native Americans had everything taken away from them (of course the circumstances here are vastly different). Most of these references were made by Bridges' character; perhaps the personification of this sense of 'the old'. Reluctantly approaching retirement and making constant racist comments to his partner, Bridges is world-weary and worn out with nothing to look forward to. Tracking down the brothers is his 'one last job' and one he embraces obsessively as a means to stave off his retirement. He is the epitome of 'old school' in his humour, methods and etiquette, but it is clear he is also terrified of entering a world he is unfamiliar with. It's a fantastic performance from Bridges, who emotes and conveys awkward humour, obsession and fear in his own unique way.Countering Bridges is the ever brilliant Ben Foster. The oldest of the brothers, he's street smart, unpredictable, ill-tempered, quick-witted and reckless; and the personification of ""the new"". It's his actions which give the brothers' journey an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and excitement and yet despite his copious flaws, Foster manages to make his character an endearing one.This is Chris Pine's vehicle, though. It's a restrained and thoughtful performance, and with that an intensely brooding one which encapsulates the entire tone of the film. It is Pine's younger brother who has masterminded the whole scheme to obtain the money, whilst getting revenge on the bank that has caused his family so much grief. It is he who has asked his brother to revert back to a life of crime. He is doing a bad thing in order to do a good thing, and there is barely a scene in which Pine is involved where we don't see the remorse and the shame etched across his face. It's a role which could not be further than that which made his name (as James Kirk in the Star Trek franchise) yet one he commands with great maturity.Mackenzie really does deserve much of the praise, though, for this fantastic piece of film making. Hell Or High Water is so steadily paced yet creates a significant amount of tension as a race against time evolves. He draws incredible performances from his leads, provides his audience with stunning visuals and touches upon themes which set this way above a typical heist movie or generic Western.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 October 2018,8/10,"I'm always skeptical when I see a load of 8, 9, or 10/10 reviews, followed by several 2 or 3 star ones - is this a truly awful movie shilled by production staff, or a little gem, misunderstood by the few?Happily, Hell or High Water is one of those rare films that falls into the latter category, I'm not going to spoil it with any details, I'm simply going to recommend it if you enjoy that rare thing today, a genuinely good movie."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2021,8/10,"I hope the wonderful news of Jeff Bridges' cancer being in remission will cause people to revisit his canon of work. ""Hell or High Water"" is a taut, gripping, gritty flick, and Bridges is the primary reason why. He has that quality or ability to seemingly erase the boundary between the audience and his performance, and here he is at his best. And that is why, good friends, the Dude abides."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 December 2016,9/10,"Today I'm going to give you my review of the 2016 film Hell or High Water. This movie is about a couple of brothers robbing banks to raise money that they owe to a bank. I don't want to tell you why they owe money exactly, because I feel like the story is better off if you find out while watching it, like I did. This movie is honestly my favorite that I've seen this year and today I'm going to tell you guys why this movie is such a classic.The biggest thing that stuck out to me was the performances of all the actors/actresses in this film, so I'll just go through the list. First off, Chris Pine does an absolutely amazing job in this movie, even though he was great in Star Trek and pretty good in this years Finest Hours, I would say this is the best performance he has given this year, and maybe even the best in his career. One thing I really loved about this performance was the accent that Chris Pine used in this movie, it was very very believable. He also brings a dark and realistic tone to this movie that really sets the tone for this movie and drives the story to be more believable and more relatable. Now Ben Foster in this movie really is unbelievable in this movie, he really embodies this role, while I was watching the movie I couldn't even tell that it was Ben Foster, he does a great job in every way, all in all it was a perfect performance, and I really hope to see him get at least an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Now another actor that I firmly believe should be nominated for a best supporting role was Jeff Bridges, who plays this sheriff who is on the verge of retirement and this is his last rodeo, he spends most the movie trying to track down the two criminal brothers. He adds some comedy to this film that fits in perfect, there is not too many jokes and they all seem to hit at perfect times. Jeff Bridges just like Chris Pine gives a great accent that is very believable and feels real. The chemistry between him and Gil Birmingham was perfect, their dialog felt so real it left me wanting to see more of them two together. At the end of the day the performances of this movie were amazing everyone in this film does an absolutely incredible job!Another thing I really loved in this movie was the music, it really fit so perfectly with the film. The score has kind of a western music theme to it, and it fits so well. The music was so subtle and it just makes you feel more connected with the world, just like every musical score should do.I also believe that David Mackenzie did a great job directing the movie, every shot felt so real and it felt like it really fit with the tone of this film. David Mackenzie is really a great up and coming directer and I'm excited to see what he does next."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 May 2018,10/10,"I am writing this review two days after visiting Texas. Let me tell you right now, this movie has not only captured the look and feel of Texas, but the people of Texas. Every character in this movie,{including the T-Bone Caf√© waitress} I feel like I met while visiting there. This movie captured the heart and soul of Texas. Hell or High Water is extremely dynamic in the character study of each and every person in this film. My favorite is Ben Foster's character 'Tanner Howard', everyone else in this film is the resin, this guy is the catalyst that truly makes this one solid movie. At first glance Tanner seems shallow and foolish, as the movie progresses you see that he is the only one that truly grasps the reality and the consequences of their actions, but he does it anyway because of his loyalty and love for his brother. I love the seen in the Casino where Tanner and the large Comanche Indian go nose to nose, it is the second reference to the white man becoming like the American Indian and being stripped of land and dignity. It's as if Tanner has become a Comanche warrior on his last stand before becoming extinct in the world of the evil rich. This is a movie that really should be watched more than once so you can catch every line that is incredibly scripted. Well, I gave this movie a 10 because I loved it, every aspect of it, even the music."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 December 2016,,"Set in Texas, ""Hell or High Water"" is a crime drama about two brothers who resort to robbing banks in an attempt to save their family's ranch from foreclosure. It works very well as a straightforward crime story, but there's much more to it than that. There's also lots of sociopolitical subtext here about the current economic conditions of working class people in the US, as well as the financial system that's exploiting them.And the performances here are top notch: Ben Foster, Chris Pine, and Jeff Bridges completely nail their performances in this one. But the same could be said of everyone who appears in this film.Anyway, thumbs up from me. A number of critics have called this film ""one of the best of the year."" I tend to agree with that. It will probably make my personal ""top ten"" list for 2016. It's a really solid crime-drama with plenty of things in it to recommend."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 November 2016,8/10,"And you think you know the lyrics but you really don't. And as you go on mumbling on with it to remember the words, you re- experience and unknowingly fall in love with it. This is like a country music, nothing you haven't heard before but it still finds the new tone,and manages to keep it simple. There is great depth in characters and some good dramatic structure. Foster and pine are great together and you've got your ever reliable Jeff Bridge as a Texas Ranger and nothing goes wrong in the movie. It's effective storytelling combined with great landscapes and fine performance. This movie will feel like a silent retreat from those loud summer blockbusters and superhero movies. All in all this is a good movie and probably one of the best neo- western movie in recent years."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 October 2016,2/10,"If the whole plot basis of a film is that someone who owns an asset that can generate 600 thousand dollars a year can't raise 40 thousand dollars to pay off the loan on it, then you really beggar belief. Why would anyone take part in several armed robberies and risk frying on an electric chair rather than spending 30 minutes with a half decent financial adviser is preposterous. If you can suspend disbelief over the ludicrous plot then what do we make of the rest of the film. Jeff Bridges does an amateurish impression of Marlon Brando in the Godfather with his mouth stuffed with tissue so that you struggle to fully understand a single sentence he says. How this film scores a review of 8.2 beggars belief and makes me lose all credibility in review scores on this site. It is currently scoring higher than 'No country for old men' when it's not a patch on that film."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 March 2017,9/10,"I don't think I have the words to express how fantastically dramatic this film is. As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I'm also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren't sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine's eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 September 2019,8/10,"I just saw this movie and oh Gosh, it¬¥s excelent. Dialogues, situations, characters, all just fine. Before checking the name of the director, I had the feeling the Cohen brothers were there, but no. Anyway, impressive movie, to be kept in my video files..."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 February 2017,7/10,"A good cops and robbers story. Maybe not Oscar worthy. But a good story nonetheless. A modern day western that probably would have been received even better if it had been made 20 years ago (closer to the Savings and Loan crisis) The acting is strong and the story is well paced. Gritty cinematography works well for the movie and the ending fits the disparate tail to the end.You've got to appreciate a movie that your not quite sure how its going to end. The fact that the Hollywood snobs didn't say this movie is ""critically acclaimed"" means that it might actually be good.....and it was. Jeff Bridges still has ""it""....don't miss Hell or High water!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 September 2016,7/10,"Spoilers below. Hell or High Water is a modern western film. With all the things you would expect in a western, but with current setting. Events play out in rural Texas. Chris Pine plays Toby who is divorced from his wife and estranged from his two sons. His recently deceased mother has left him a ranch on which oil has been discovered. Problem is that his mother was in debt to the local Texas Midland Bank and they are going to foreclose on the loans if they are not paid back very soon. So money is needed quickly or the oil rich land will be lost.Toby, and his career criminal brother Tanner (Ben Foster), embark on a series of early morning bank robberies of Texas Midland Bank branches in order to get the money to pay back the bank. Nice twist. Banks bleeding the people dry is an overarching theme of the film. All the robberies are small so don't interest the FBI. They do interest the soon to retire Texas Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) though, and he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) go on the trail of the robbers. Jeff Bridges plays his role in a nice gnarly way. And has a good rapport and banter with Gil Birmingham's character.The film has everything you would want from a western. Even a modern one. Dusty sunlit Texan vistas, bank robberies, a posse like band of locals going after the robbers, a shoot out, a good sibling story with a sacrifice, nostalgia for a time that has passed, and a moral message about generational poverty and the role of banks. I liked it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 September 2018,9/10,"Excellent. excellent movie ! the one that deserves much more :) The movie is one of the best , anyone must watch"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 January 2019,3/10,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Given this cast, what could go wrong? As it turns out; several things can go wrong. A tepid plot I could never feel vested with and a wretchedly slow pace that even the iconic Jeff Bridges could not distract me from. If you want to see this genre done correctly just watch No Country for Old Men again."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 September 2017,6/10,"While this movie held my attention and had *excellent* cinematography, the rest of it fell flat. It's hard to call this a 'character study' when all the characters are essentially the same the entire movie. It's SO slow moving, with sparse and plain dialog with an ending that's more of a 'huh'?? This could have been so much better expanding on any of the backstory or truly making any of these characters real, but I didn't get much out of it. I continue to call BS on many movies nominated for an academy award these days. I wouldn't call this a Western Either. Just the main pairs of characters having similar dialog and otherwise just hanging out together. In short, I was expecting a lot more."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 September 2016,8/10,"You got to love Jeff Bridges performance and the way he walks and carries his lips all movie long . The guy embodies a ranger about to retire so beautifully you can almost feel the retirement depression coming. And when I saw him near the end of the movie sitting on a sofa (not a rocking chair) watching TV, I said to myself ""that's me in 15 years only"". You don't need to be from Texas or even have visited the state to understand the way of thinking of the Texans; "" the lords of the plain"". Right from the start, the movie takes you there and makes you appreciate the empty plains the empty streets, the small businesses, the oil rigs, The bank clerk, the branch owner, the burger joint waitresses, the old men depositing some valuables , The Comanche chief, the ""half breed"" Indian Mexican, the locals...All these characters were beautifully portrayed and studied versus the influence of their surroundings and the movie excels in that regard."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 February 2017,9/10,"One of the best Movies of 2016, with a pair of Protagonists at the center to be cheered on, followed by a Cop vs. Thief type of story. A complex narrative, combined with a stunning cinematography.The main strength of the Movie are the characters, revolving around a Heist drama that is not only effective, but it is thrilling, engaging. The characters are grounded just right, as they even bring lightness to the movie by involving #Humor once in a while.The movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or action scenes, but creates tension in the form of #Dialogue and in the form of brilliantly filmed short-action. It's also the difference of dynamics between the characters that make this movie a solid watch. The story is well-paced, as it neither rushes or drags on."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 September 2016,8/10,"I saw this movie without benefit of knowing anything about it at all, and that certainly enhanced my enjoyment; so beware of potential spoilers that follow. This is a modern western that revolves around two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who try to save their farm from the bank, and an old grizzled lawman (Jeff Bridges) who tracks them to a bloody finale. Foster is the crazy one, who has done a lot of time and is reckless beyond all reason. Pine is the seemingly stable, law-abiding brother who is trying to keep the farm for his children, and is the mastermind. We are thrust into the bank-robbing action at the start, and it takes awhile to figure out what they are doing. In the meantime we are introduced to Bridges and his partner Alberto, engagingly played by Gil Birmingham, as their sleepy routine is interrupted by a string of robberies. There is nothing new in the action--except perhaps the rather open-ended conclusion--but the whole of it is done so well (acting, directing, cinematography) that it is a pleasure to see it get some traction at the box office. Well worth seeing."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 November 2017,8/10,"A by-the-books bank robbing flick that could best be described as No Country for Old Men-adjacent for several reasons, one being Jeff Bridges (who, at his age, is doing his best to corner the market on ornery, hardheaded, no-nonsense old men that groan all of their lines) who plays a character cut from the exact same cloth as Tommy Lee Jones's was. It's what you'd expect a movie about two brothers in Texas robbing banks would be. But it's not trying to change conventions, instead focusing on being a ""really good one of those,"" with solid work on both sides of the camera."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 September 2016,10/10,"and the score was awesome too! It's such an unexpected pleasure to see a truly multi-dimensionally great movie. So many things to savor, the parallel men bonding story, brothers and lawmen. The background economic hardship, the beauty of the country, the embedded, latent and explicit violence. Desperation, fatalism, bad family histories. The script was chiseled, funny, unexpected and the actors stepped it up, Bridges was well matched to Chris Pine, Ben Foster was great. Also, the underlying political context was always referred to and provided a kind of Greek chorus to the events that were occurring on camera. The slow gravitational pull between Pine and Bridges was powerful and had an unpredictable outcome, which I loved."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 January 2020,8/10,"I went through plenty of negative reviews about this film. Most of them concerned about why the hell they were robbing banks when they're earning 50K!
I wonder why some stupid people failed to understand that they robbed banks to pay the mortgage, failing which could've led them to loose their ranch & they'll be left with NOTHING!! Earning came after paying off the debts they owned, not before GENIUS! It's that simple!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 September 2016,9/10,"I am not going to waste words describing what this movie is about, everyone should have read a description already. This movie exceeded my expectations. The writing/directing was tight and refreshing, the acting was superb. Jeff Bridges could (and probably should) win an Academy Award for his part.After a summer of many disappointing movies, this was a breath of fresh air. I and probably many of you are tired of fluff movies. This movie has meat to it. Everything clicks and I was engaged the whole way through big time.This is a must see movie, go see it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 April 2020,1/10,"So it's ok if people die, including a Texas Ranger, so the hero bank robber can get back at the greedy evil bank. Try to he a little less transparent."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 November 2016,6/10,"I waited a long time to watch this movie. It seems that the Indian Govt. is following the US govt footsteps to prevent piracy.. Ha. ha.. Nonetheless, if you asked me if it was good movie? Definitely YES. If you asked if it was a great movie? Perhaps not. One reason could be that the trailer appeared to have raised the expectations very high. The actors do a good job but the story appears a bit run down. However, the real let down for me was that the movie appeared to lack the connection between events. It somehow did not appear to be a very well connected sequence of events. I wouldn't write any more on this since I am not writing a spoiler. But do watch the movie. It is still quite good, especially the characters but somehow, its just not quite there."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 November 2016,9/10,"What a pleasant surprise to come across a movie like this. Totally did not expect it. Crisp writing and great performances by everyone. Where every bank robber movie tries to be a Tarantino rip-off, this movie had its own voice. If I had to compare it to a famous director or directors, it was more of a Cohen brother film than anything.The dialog is refreshing and witty. I just wanted to applaud the writer about halfway through I realized I was seeing a well made film. Cast is great, especially Jeff Bridges but also Chris Pine in a great performance where we see real acting chops.In a sea of crap out there, it was great to come across this gem."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 December 2019,8/10,I love how the Explained poverty. To solve One's problem can create another problem for someone else.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 September 2016,10/10,"The heist movie is a classic staple of American cinema. ¬†Bonnie & Clyde, Heat, Ocean's 11, Inception, really when you think about it is a heist movie, and so on. ¬†There's something about the have-nots taking from those who have that's intrinsically American. ¬†Hell or High Water isn't just a great heist film/crime drama. ¬†It's a film born out of an America that hates financial institutions. ¬†The great majority of us in debt, fighting liens, repossessions, and looking on while the same companies that inundate us with statements get bailouts. ¬†There's some graffiti sprayed on the wall early in the film in a dusty town in West Texas that reads ""3 Tours in Iraq; no bailout for me."" ¬†This is the America in which the Howard brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) begin their bank robbing spree.Directed by David Mackenzie and written by Taylor Sheridan, Hell or High Water is quite simply one of the best films of the year and worth seeking out if it's playing in your areas. ¬†Sheridan marks himself as a screenwriter to watch. ¬†This is only his second screenplay after last year's masterful Sicario (Sheridan has also written the screenplay for the sequel, Soldado, which will be released next year). ¬†Despite the action, of which there's plenty, this is a character-driven, dialogue intensive film. ¬†Sheridan's script manages to be Texas through and through, while developing the movie's two pairs: the Foster brothers and the pair of Texas Rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) trying to put together the pieces of a pattern of robberies that seems to make no sense.It sounds odd in a gritty crime drama, but Hell or High Water is also a deeply funny film. ¬†The relationship between the two rangers is fantastic and there are a few moments in the film so absurd and surreal that you can't do anything but laugh at the characters trying to adapt to the situation. ¬†It's also the sign of a brilliant script that laughter can be turned to shock and tears in the snap of a finger. ¬†Taylor Sheridan is an actor with a long resume, most notably three years on Sons of Anarchy, but his calling is clearly at the keyboard. ¬†There are only a handful of screenwriters who I bother to keep track of, some to make sure I watch whatever they write (Aaron Sorkin) and some to make sure I avoid anything they touch (Akiva Goldsman - A Beautiful Mind aside). ¬†I will go see anything Taylor Sheridan writes.Great words are nothing though without great performances, and everyone in Hell or High Water delivers career-defining performances. ¬†Chris Pine is always likable and I love him in Star Trek, but I've never seen him deliver anything on the level of this role. ¬†This is the best part Ben Foster has had since he should have been nominated for an Oscar in 3:10 to Yuma. ¬†Jeff Bridges absolutely should be remembered at awards time for his one-week- from-retirement crusty old Texas Ranger. ¬†Gil Birmingham also is a fantastic foil for Bridges as his half¬†-Mexican/half-Comanche, Catholic, televangelist watching, Christian rock listening, take-no- nonsense partner. ¬†And whoever plays the waitress in the restaurant that only serves T-Bones and baked potatoes, you are a national treasure.I'm not a huge fan of David Mackenzie's directing, but this is by far the best thing he's ever done, and a few stylistic choices are the only nitpicks I can make in what is otherwise one of 2016's best films. ¬†Not only is Hell or High Water an entertaining, intelligent entry into the vault of great American heist movies, but it captures West Texas and the mood and festering anger of a country struggling to make ends meet."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 March 2019,10/10,"This is the movie I've been waiting for. I'm not going to say much here except take the time and see it for yourself. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as always, a great cast on top of a great story with the best ending possible.
I was hoping it would end this way, and it did and I'm so happy!!!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 July 2017,9/10,"A tight, tense movie that works well as an action thriller, but that provides a lot more depth and emotion than most other movies in the genre. The movie is built on great performances (and writing) for its four main characters. it's impossible to single out one as above the others; all four actors deliver performances that are very honest and real, while being just larger-than-life enough to be entertaining and memorable without becoming silly. The script is wonderful; I love how it opens in media res and how it naturally fills in details through dialog without becoming pedantic. Cinematography and music are both very well done. This is the kind of movie that will become a replayable classic: accessible and propulsive, filled with one great scene after another, and with quality work from everyone involved."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 September 2016,7/10,"I went to see this after reading rave reviews and at first thinking it was a western but on further inspection its actually set in modern times and is about two brothers who go on a series of bank raids. The film is shot in widescreen which looks superb on a large cinema screen especially as this film has lots of panoramic shots of the Texas countryside. The music is good too which is why i say this is a well put together film and well acted by Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. Now i get to the down side. I feel the film was slow paced, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but without much in the way of suspense i felt it was a little boring at times. The main hook of the film is really the relationship between the two brothers, the rest is pretty much standard bank heist type stuff. There are a few humorous moments throughout the film which gave a bit of comic relief from the pretty heavy story line but overall i felt a little disappointed. A decant watch and i'd watch again when it comes on t.v but it didn't blow me away like some people are saying."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 January 2020,8/10,"The film has certain elements of the western genre but nothing pretentious in its narrative and technical aspects, it presents the story of two brothers against authority but all justified in favor of his family.The film begins in the middle of the action presenting the first robbery as the initiator of the story, setting elements such as the uncontrolled character of Tanner (Ben Foster), the focused attitude of Toby (Chris Pine) and the conservative and authoritative personality of the Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges). The three characters represent a psychological confrontation throughout the film between a person's desire, duty and purpose.The conflict or duality between right and desired is present from the beginning and reflected in all the characters of the town, such as the waitress capable of collaborating with the law but taking advantage of the crime of others. For this is how the main characters of the brothers are presented in an impoverished town and frustrated by the limits imposed on them to take advantage of the wealth under their feet, these brothers are the enlightened ones able to camouflage themselves in a system to take advantage, robbing banks of the same chain with those who will then make deals and practically, although unintentionally, mobilizing the people.We see the family commitment of both characters from the beginning for the death of their mother, it will be for the children of one of them that they going to steal again. Everything is controlled by the authority represented in a Ranger with a great ideal of commitment to justice, although rather it represents the ashes of a system that tries to maintain order.
The film continues its course focusing its intention on discovering the purposes of this triad of men, this will lead us to the climax of the film where the three intentions collapse staging with the last robbery. During this a hierarchy of the three characters is generated with their intentions.Tanner (Ben Foster), the character who steals for pleasure, accepts his sacrifice for duty with his brother. Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) ends up disgusted even when he defeats his enemy and gets justice. And Toby (Chris Pine) who plays with the purpose of helping his family is the hero who does not seek his benefit and who manages to turn the system to the aid of others and for his survival."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 July 2019,8/10,"This movie is about much more than two brothers on a bank heist binge or than an old time sheriff and his Native-American partner. It is about the inevitable- it's about the way life continues on a bound circle. It is a nod of the hat to the struggles that we all undoubtably face in our lives. Wither its financial struggle, coming to the end of an era, death, or even that we are all under the influence our human desire to have more power-- there are some things in this life we just can not avoid. Hell or high water, they are bound to happen.The movie bases its story on the inevitable problems of money and debt. No matter who we are or where we are from, money will always be a factor. Though this creates the plot of the film, I do not believe it to be the over all arching theme to be strictly about money.Much of the plot is also based on the idea of ending era's. This is most obviously noticed with the intrinsic struggle of sheriff Hamilton and his fear of retirement.Death is another large part of this film. As a certain character in this film meets his death (I will not reveal who dies exactly to avoid large spoils), it feels as if it was meant from the begging. As if no matter what, this character was set on bound tracks to an early death.Finally, the most sneaky nod of the hat to the inevitable, the constant undertone of the human desire to have more power. This is most obviously noticed in the constant references to the Native American people and their stolen land. This is well portrayed by Alberto; who explains that the power struggle was once between the Native American's and the white people, but now the power struggle is fought between the everyday working person and the bank.Outside the hidden meaning of the script, this film has much to applaud-- Jeff Bridges being one of them. He not only transforms so brilliantly into a modern day Texas sheriff, he successfully pulls on the heart strings of everyone who watches this movie. He is truly one of the greatest actors.Director David Mackenzie masters the ""long take"" in this movie by letting the camera go on continuous shots, thus letting the actors create a realistic scene (the opening scene being a great example).The film's sets and locations make the audience feel as if they were actually there. The light blue Texas sky matched with the sun faded colors of the surrounding buildings make you feel like you are really in the heat of small town Texas. The worn out towns shot in motion as the characters drive effectively create the back drop for this story of small town suffering.The only noticeably negative aspect of the film is the cheesy feeling given off by one or two smaller role actors.Over all, I give the film a 7.7. I love the writing, I love the films meaning, I love Jeff Bridges as well as the other leading actors, and I love the Texas style realism. I give this film a high recommend."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 August 2016,10/10,"In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels, remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character- driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous, heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far this year."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 June 2016,10/10,"The American western seems to be slowly making a comeback in recent years. With films such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit there have been some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. Hell or High Water fits right in with these mentioned films by containing a lot of comedy, engaging characters, and no holds barred violence. Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank-robbing brothers share great chemistry and draw sympathy from the audience with compelling performances. Jeff Bridges stands out however as the hardened cop tasked to track down the brothers. His racist slurs and aggravated man persona works perfectly with his gravely, yet genuine voice and he finds perfect timing in his comedic delivery. The music, done by Nick Cave is also perfect. After crafting one of the greatest scores with Assassination of Jesse James, he gets pretty close to that here with very foreboding and meditative music. Especially right before the big showdown. And when it all goes down, the film will have you on the edge of your seat. It doesn't hold anything back and people die out of nowhere. It's very realistic and is worth the tension filed build up.Hell or High Water is a surprisingly great American western. Hell or High Water (2016) Directed by: David Mackenzie Screenplay by: Taylor Sheridan Starring: Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster Run Time: 1 hour 42 minutes"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 April 2017,10/10,"One of the best movies in the last ten years. Chris Pine never impressed me much until this. He and Ben Foster were sublime in their portrayal of the disposable majority in our country. Hell or High Water is a dissertation on the reality of the lie that is called the American dream and how two brothers made it happen despite the 1%ers best efforts to rape us and our ""once great"" country. This movie finds a moral high ground justifying their tactics against a system of hypocrites and corporate thieves that are the 1% and their enforcers. I can only hope this movie inspires a wave of copy cats, in every detail. Watching this film will embolden every person abused by our country. I look forward to growing old with both of them.The essence of this movie and the hopelessness 99% of us feel is summed up in the conversation between the two corporate enforcers¬ÖNative American pig speaking to the typical WASP pig: A long time ago your ancestors was the Indians until someone came along and killed them. Broke em down made you into one of them. 150 years ago all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Until the grandparents of these folks took it. Now it's been taken from them. Cept it ain't no army doin' it, it's those sons of bitches right there. points at Texas Midland BankA slice of dystopian America that leaves me with hope, with acting that leaves me forgetting they're actors."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 August 2016,9/10,I have always been a fan of character driven movies. If you can relate or have a sense for what drives the characters in a movie then the movie is that much more interesting and relevant. Hell or High Water definitely falls into this category. The plot holds your attention. The acting is exceptional. Jeff Bridges gives one of the finest performances of his career. Rivals his performance in True Grit. His performance is definitely Oscar worthy. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are outstanding as well. Chris Pine shows that he is definitely a serious actor. Ben Foster is excellent as well. The movie is well paced and edited. I highly recommend this movie.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 May 2021,9/10,"Rich characters, great story and acting. Taylor Sheridan is probably one of the finest Directors and story teller in Hollywood."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 January 2017,9/10,"This movie is about family going through life's worst crap together! I think Ben Foster should have gotten a nomination too for his gritty portrayal of a big brother to Chris Pine with a shady past but so much heart! This movie has it all action, bank robberies, police chases, tender moments and a few tissue worthy scenes! The acting in this movie is a master class for all would be actors and each actor brilliantly portrays his character with detail and endearing pluck! When you route for the bad guys and the good guys equally? Well, you've got yourself an award winning movie on your hands! Highly recommend this one and the hubby loved it too!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 March 2017,10/10,"One of my favorite films of 2016. The writing and acting are great. I was a little skeptical of Chris Pine going in, but he did a good job. Not award-worthy, but a solid performance. I think this is a good movie for fans of No Country for Old Men, but it's not a rip-off by any means. It's also faster-paced."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 June 2019,9/10,"A modest, realistic depiction of a few bank robberies. Well written with a sharp script, extremely well directed, and pulls at the heart strings."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 June 2019,8/10,One of my favorite movies of all time. Hell or High Water has accomplished a feat of something I cannot put into words. It is the perfect movie. It deserved best picture.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 July 2020,9/10,"Watched this movie after reading BTMMans review & concur fully, good thoughtful acting from a top drawer cast with lots of subtle and interesting interplay with all the characters and it works as good on film as it did on paper.
There are enough reviews here to give you the picture of the brothers & the chase so take the time to put the phone away, the beer down and give this your full attention and enjoy it all the more. I could easily have given it a 9.5 or even a 10, but my seat was a little uncomfortable so it only got a 9. Jeff Bridges is such a class act and extremely watchable plying his craft. One not to miss."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 October 2016,10/10,"FINALLY a movie about rural America without judgment warning: Do not Miss this classic... 100 years from now this movie will still be a must watch classic for social commentary. every frame of this film captures real America in current moment of time. you can interpret your own views in every frame its not preachy, mostly (excluding few chit chat between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham).to every east coast and west coast American kind request: watch this movie first the brothers (Ben Foster &Chris Pine)both deserve Oscar nomination at least elder brother (Ben Foster)deserves a Oscar win for sure he lives the role so honestly you don't cry or feel good at the end . only a honest performance can give that moment of vacuum when it happens .salute democracy is a living dream we have to cherish it every moment and start any point of view from respect to fellow citizens and not, by judging them cinematography deserve an Oscar- remember not a single flower or scenic romantic scene but every frame captures pathos with respectthis movie is not a poverty porn ,cameraman deserves a huge credit for this .Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham are too good ..their performance no comment will fully explain their performance just sit back and enjoy Hollywood badly need more real movies like this if they /we forget to respect this gem of movie we will be punished with more stupid movies every time we spend 10 $ in am movie hall"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 January 2017,10/10,"An excellent film in every way. I cannot fault it on any level. A brilliant storyline, superbly acted and directed. Add to that the tremendous soundtrack and great cinematography and a film has been created which I will happily revisit time and time again. The wonderful Jeff Bridges, as he always seems to, gives real depth and integrity to his character. The relationship between Ben Foster and Chris Pine is always engaging. The brief, hilarious cameo scene from Margaret Bowman, an 88 year old actress, will forever after be etched in my memory. All in all, a real contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Win or lose, David Mackenzie has done us all a favour by reminding us that the best action movies don't rely on crash bang wallop pyrotechnics or high speed chases."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 January 2017,9/10,"I just found this movie after watching 2 masterpieces - Hacksaw ridge and The Arrival. I must say I am much more impressed with this film.First off it is hard to tell if the story of this movie is a Western, Heist Crime Drama or deep socioeconomic study reflecting the state of affairs in an important part of American society.Script is very good, dialogues are very realistic and characters are developed just enough. No pretentious pressure on the spectator to bond with the protagonists. It is not a story of heroes or villains it is more a study of a situation with realistic characters with a story in it.Pace is slow for fast paced action lovers, but it is in no way bad. It just contributes to highly atmospheric nature of the movie and bursts of tension spice up the flow and fit very well in it.Photography is very good. Not breathtaking or spectacular but still masterful, and you can see the hand of the director and his team in carefully crafting every scene, and everything withing a shot.Scenography is mostly beautiful rural mid-west landscape and boring small towns with their motels, diners, bars, casinos and banks.Acting is outstanding. Especially Jeff Bridges, but I must say every episodic role seemed to me to be acted very good. Even some memorable performances of a couple probably non-professional actors.Sound is great, no dialogue is unintelligible, no music is out of place and action scenes are not much more louder than the rest of the movie.It is really extremely difficult to find any flaw in this memorable accomplishment of the film crew.This movie will make you think. It might explain to you why Trump won the last election. It could even give additional fuel for thinking to the participants of the gun ownership debate in the US. There is only one dishonorable villain this movie points a finger at - the banks.Some people are screaming out loud that there is a giant plot hole in the film cos having found oil on your mortgaged property means there is no motivation for you to get money through all this trouble. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING about. Mineral, gas and oil rights are very complicated in mortgage situations and none of the cases are strictly defined by laws. Most cases are regulated on contract by contract basis and in connection with state laws but in most cases contracts favor the lenders and in some cases finding oil can even mean automatic forfeiture of the mortgage to the bank."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 September 2016,10/10,"I don't understand why this film isn't getting higher ratings. It is terrific. Unlike the first reviewer, I welcomed the ""political inserts"" as a chance to hear different viewpoints and to ground the story into reality. The gritty setting and performances are very impressive and make for an unusual and welcome change from the typical fare that's available.It has a little Thelma and Louise vibe that I enjoyed. There's gentle, not forced, humor.Jeff Bridges has added another great, honest portrayal to his solid body of work.Chris Pine proves he's got real range with this performance. Not once did I think it was Captain Kirk speaking those lines.All the small, supporting roles are really fleshed out characters. In a novel, it would have taken pages to provide their backstories. Here, the actors inhabit their characters so fully with their performances, it adds a richness and depth to the film that is typically missing from Hollywood's constant supply of remakes.See it!!!!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 January 2019,9/10,"Having lived in Texas it is very easy to relate to the story and locale. Thought I was sitting down to a B movie but it just kept getting better and better. Great acting and wonderful story. Excellent videography, I really liked the shot with the still windmill in the foreground. In real life the ending would have been a bit different, but it is a good story to tell anyway. Recommended watching."

HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 August 2016,,"This is an excellent film for men by men. It's sensitive yet tough. The relationships between the two sets of men are amazing because it's so realistic to the way ""country"" and less refined men talk with one another. The plot is great. The story is well thought out. The most amazing part for me was the whole ""non-sjw"" aspect of it. The way the men insult each other (the way many str8 men relate and bond) is something rarely seen in films. The racial insults between one pair of men is amazing and something that women and sensitive types don't get. You can see how much they care for each other in this ""politically incorrect language."" It shows men being vulnerable emotionally yet not emasculated."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 August 2016,7/10,"David Mackenzie directs some pretty shots. There a lot of moments in this film that are truly beautiful, one moment comes to mind in which Jeff Bridges, restless, gets up out of bed, wraps a blanket around his shoulders, and walks out into the windy road with the blanket fluttering behind him like a cape. It is a stunning image.And this film is full of stunning images. The overall package is satisfying, but there is a lot missing. Too many shots linger on characters as they narrow their eyes in thousand yard stares. It seems like Chris Pine does more posing in this film than a model, while the camera lingers on him and Ben Foster as they say nothing. There is a lot of nothing happening, and that's where the films narrative fat comes from. This is not an exceptional genre picture, there are two interesting set-pieces but not much more in the way of thrills (anyone who tells you this is a suspense movie is exaggerating). But I don't think this is an exceptional drama film either. The characters are paper thin, what resonates more is their interactions, but that has as much weight as quippy dialogue in a buddy cop movie. Even the films message is underwhelming and has been done so much during this decade. Just last year we go 99 Homes and The Big Short. It seems to me that this is the type of movies that critics love. The slow burn genre film with political commentary. They distinguish this kinda thing from regular thrillers, which they dismiss as meaningless fun, by commenting on the fact that these types of films transcend the genre that it is in. For the most part, films that ""transcend genre"" tend to be slower paced, have more artful shots, and have an obvious message like, 'violence is bad.'This film doesn't say anything new about predatory lending, or the death of small towns and small town industries, it just uses them as set dressing."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 November 2017,5/10,"Meh. Very weirdly convoluted and stretched out way of conveying what ended up being an extremely simplistic and actually quite boring story. Characters and acting were okay enough to be worth watching if you're otherwise bored, but if you miss the entire plot, you haven't missed much. If you're sensitive to offhand racial digs, don't bother."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 April 2017,10/10,"These days it is hard to find a decent movie that's not politically correct with race, gender, or religion. This movie is a great movie for those of us who are looking for an action packed movie with a good plot line. Any bad reviews and ratings will mention politically incorrect issues, but for those of us who are looking for good movies with a decent amount of action and comedy this is for you. A good amount of ""adult"" comedy that is great as well as a decent plot line. All in all, its good movie for those of us who aren't ""Sensitive."" It's worth the time."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 December 2016,10/10,"The way this story is told is a good reminder of how to make a common story compelling, the actors are well selected, and the quintessential feeling of the scenes ranges from action, to comedy, to drama, in a very well fluent sequence that reminds you why we like the movies so much in the first place, great film to enjoy amongst any member of the family if not the hole tribe together.Mi favorite role play is from the Texas ranger that fills the icon of a old wise son of a gun, that battles with the inner demons, i like to see him dwell in frame, you almost get the feeling of grasping what he is going trough but then again it seems larger than life, like some one facing death each second, i don't know, its just a super cool acting for that part, and also is really funny the relationship with the native American ranger, seriously, the movie its plain art."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 January 2017,7/10,"Hell or High Water is a very good film, but it isn't for everyone. Everything from its dialogue heavy scenes, to its casual, calm pacing could alienate many viewers. Director David Mackenzie navigates a relatively simple story with highly complex characters very effectively. Hell or High Water is the type of film that doesn't drag you along with it, you choose to go along and can get off at any time, but by watching the whole movie will prove much more rewarding.The direction is impeccable, as it showcases the beautiful but scary American desert and explores the evil actions of men who aren't necessarily bad people simultaneously, creating a powerful and interesting atmosphere throughout the film. Great cinematography helps create this atmosphere, while also generating the tense and exciting scenes that make this movie very strong visually.The acting is stupefying from all members, in particular Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. They bring to life the three dimensional characters that shine on screen, and bring the vivid story to life. The screenplay is very strong, with particular praise having to go to the originality of it. On paper, it seems like another bank heist gone wrong type of movies, but it really isn't, thanks to the proficient acting and suburb character writing. There are some issues however. It was a very dialogue heavy film, which is fine, considering the dialogue was very good. But it sometimes seemed inaudible what they were saying, or it became easy to tune out what the characters were saying, even though it was important to the story. Perhaps it was a bad sound mix, or the southern drawls were too thick, or the fact that Jeff Bridges was in it, but it was far too easy to miss the dialogue which ended up effecting the overall quality. The pacing was also a bit of an issue. It was very different from most films, and was quite relaxed for a lot of the film, which led to a few dull scenes in the middle. On top of the mumbled dialogue, the pacing made the story more complicated than it needed to be. None of this, however, deterred how good a film this was. Hell or High Water had an amazing screenplay with terrific direction to bring it to life. The originality of this heist gone wrong story and its excellent acting and cinematography make it a stand out film. Some poor pacing and inaudible dialogue dragged Hell or High Water, but it still came out on top.3.5 / 5"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 October 2018,8/10,Things people can do when they are in desperation. Very nice movie.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 June 2021,2/10,A tried story line and clunky dialog let some good acting go to waste.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 March 2021,9/10,"Taylor Sheridan has become one of my favorite writers of films and even with his television (Yellowstone). After viewing Sicario and Wind River it was only right to get around to this, and boy I was impressed. Ben Foster was spectacular with his role as Tanner Howard. The cast for this film was picked correctly and I don't think anyone else could have done a better job. The film is extremely realistic aswell with the shootout scenes, cover-ups for the heist(s), etc. If you're a fan of classic westerns and want a modern day spin on such with some quality writing, directing and acting, this is the film for you."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 April 2020,9/10,"Jeff Bridges is incredible! Chris Pine is exceptional. The story and script are perfected through Bridges and Pine. An incredibly original film with a simple, effective plot."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 February 2018,4/10,"This movie dragged on for me. It was just a bit above a total grade B movie but definitely NOT worth my time.
Credibility stretching reality bothered me. I especially disliked the Texas oriented gun culture. At one robbery one gun packing guy on the floor sneaks it out to try to be a hero. It ends badly for him as it does for the guard. Immediately after that the ruckus attracts about a dozen gun packing 2Nd Amendment hero wannabes that come ""heroically"" blazing guns afire after the 2 bad guys. In spite of riddling their pickup truck with dozens of penetrating rounds they receive only ONE flesh wound!
Then in a follow on fire fight the dozen ""heroes"" are assaulted by the bad guy with an automatic weapon rapidly firing about 4 FULL cases of ammo at reasonably close range missing everyone.
REALLY???? 
Well it adds excitement for sure. But it moves the movie down to the level of a cheap guy flick with action.The 2nd Amendment Texans of course will feel vindicated other than the fact that had no gun been pulled, no one would have been injured in the robbery, much less killed. The implied harmless ness of major gunfire in this movie is disturbingly unreal and is the final ""shot"" that makes is a cheap thriller."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 February 2021,9/10,In my opinion Academy Award performances by Jeff Bridges and Chris Pine. It's a strong believable plot with excellent performances by all the actors involved. Even the extras were above average. This was my first introduction to Ben Foster. He's going to go far. The movie really captures the spirit (or lack of) of West Texas.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 January 2019,10/10,"This movie is excellent. The most striking thing to me was the cinematography. You could take a screen capture at just about any point in the movie and have a photo worth framing. It's stylistically excellent, and was a work of art visually. The writing was great, especially in the sense of the character personalities. Every character had depth and interest. I wouldn't call it a twist ending by any means, but I thought I had it called and I didn't. The music added a lot as well. If you like darkish new-westerns, this is definitely worth considering."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 August 2021,9/10,What a refreshing change from the norm. Very simple story. Incredible acting. Such a nice surprise. I'm glad i stumbled upon it. The older Bridges gets the better his acting.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 June 2021,10/10,Loved this movie! Great acting by everybody involved. Also great pacing and camera work. The way Margaret Bowman delivers her lines alone is worth watching this piece of art.10/10.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 September 2016,10/10,"I went into this movie with pretty high expectations and I was still blown away by how fantastic this film is. From the first minute to the very end, I had my eyes glued to the screen. The screenplay and directing were amazing, but what really made the film were the absolute perfection of the cast. Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster have been in roles in like this before and they continue to be the embodiment of actors who love their profession. The true surprise of the film is Chris Pine. I've always liked him in his other films. However, it seemed he was becoming a typecast actor with action and comedy films. He was truly remarkable and more than held his own against Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster. He most definitely shot to A-list status. This film deserves Oscars all around, from the screenplay to the actors. Can not wait to see this film again."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 January 2017,9/10,"One of the better movies I've seen from 2016 offerings. Storyline was just active enough to keep viewers attention but still maintained the slower pace of a typical hot & dusty western . Acting was really good - not surprising from Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine or Ben Foster but was equally good from Gil Birmingham, Katie Mixon and Dale Dickey. Dialogue between the two Texas Rangers was hilarious, believable and exactly what would/should transpire between two mature Texas lawmen who have worked together for a long time. Cinematography was so good that I felt the hot, flat dusty west Texas terrain like I was sitting right out on the blacktop of one of those long flat roads where you can see in any direction for many miles. I can certainly see why the Foreign Press nominated this movie for a Golden Globe award. Nice to see such a good movie being dedicated to director David Mackenzie's parents."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 December 2016,6/10,"I always judge a film by the story and how it is told to the audience. I really like intense stories, this is NOT one of them. The pace is lacking all over the place, the score keeps the story stuck in first gear, the dialogue lacks depth, the comedic relief is tasteless with only racial slurs fired to the native American character, the dynamic between the brothers is not realistic i mean if i had o take care of my mother alone because my brother is a pure 100% delinquent and half witted i wouldn't even talk to him. The only thing i must rescue is the story, on paper is a good one but the way it is told keeps me out from entering the narrative."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 June 2019,8/10,"A decent modern day western. Character development was done very well. However, this leads to some slow spots throughout the movie. Could have been paced a little better. Overall a good movie worth watching."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 February 2019,10/10,"FAMILY. THEFT. JUSTICE.Hell or High Water can be summarized by these three words. Directed by David MacKenzie, Written by Taylor Sheridan, and starring veteran actors Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham this film was nominated for four different Oscars and received multiple other awards from various film festivals. Taylor Sheridan's original screenplay was one of the aspects of this film nominated for an Oscar and it was deservedly so. Every piece of dialogue in this film is essential either to the characters' development, further enriching the world the film takes place in, or helping to keep the plot moving forward. An interesting aspect of the writing for this movie is that many of the best lines are in fact ad-libbed and Sheridan purposefully left many scenes open-ended in order to allow for the actors to add their own flare to the characters. When a writer does this, it can either take the film to an entirely new level or sink its chances of every getting off the ground. Much to the relief of the filmmakers and joy of the fans of this movie, the scenes that do sport unplanned dialogue only complement the lines written. Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as Tanner and Toby Howard respectively, two brothers who were forced to grow up depending and protecting one another from their harsh reality. Taking inspiration from classic Western leading men, Chris Pine plays Tanner Howard as a closed-off, cautious, desperate man who says more with his body language and facial expressions than with his voice. Ben Foster embodies Toby Howard as the exact opposite of his little brother, a recently freed felon who is completely comfortable with who he is and indulging in every whim that crosses his mind. After spending every last cent his family didn't have on treating their mother's cancer, Tanner is desperate to keep the family ranch out of the hands of greedy bankers looking to seize upon his family's misfortune. This desperation is furthered by the discovery of liquid gold, oil, on the property and Tanner realizes that if he doesn't pay back the loans owed to the bank, his sons will be forced to live in the same poverty he and his brother grew up in. Together they come up with a plan to rob branches of the very bank threatening to take their land and after they successfully complete their first robbery they are set on a collision course with the two other main characters of the story. Jeff Bridges takes on the role of the gruff, shrewd Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, a man staring down the long, lonely barrel of retirement forced upon him by his superiors. Bridges masterfully steps into the literal cowboy boots of Hamilton, bringing to life not only the aging Ranger's desire for one last hoorah but also showing the character's calculating lawman side honed by years of facing the worst of humanity. Gil Birmingham fills out the main cast as Texas Ranger Alberto Parker, the long-suffering half Comanche, half Mexican partner to Bridges' Hamilton. Birmingham and Bridges play well off of each other, the banter between them coming across as not only natural but believable. Ranger Parker is the assigned partner of Ranger Hamilton and finds himself having to deal not only with Hamilton's off-color jokes regarding his heritage but the man's assured nature stemming from the Ranger's many years of experience. Taking his barbs good-naturedly, Parker gives just as much as he gets and although he butts heads with Hamilton, he respects the man and his knowledge of how to anticipate the criminals' next move. These two sets of brothers are set on a colliding course, one defined by blood, the other defined by friendship and mutual respect and the only way it ends is with blood. After successfully robbing a number of banks, the Howard brothers come across the last bank they will need to hit, the largest of their list of targets. Unfortunately for all of those involved, they charge in while the bank is packed with patrons. As they rush to grab the cash they will need to complete their plan, a security guard they don't initially see and an armed citizen shoot at the brothers, prompting Toby to kill both men and drag his shell-shocked brother out of the bank with the bag of money. Finding themselves surrounded by armed Texas residents, the brothers evade capture but not before Tanner is shot in the side. After an emotional goodbye, the brothers separate, Tanner going to exchange the money at an Indian Casino across the state line in Oklahoma while Toby leads their pursuers on a wild chase through the Texan wilderness. Rangers Hamilton and Parker arrive on the scene as Toby uses his higher vantage point to rain down rifle fire on those chasing him. In the crossfire, Ranger Parker is shot and killed instantly with a shot to the head. Seeking justice, Hamilton jumps into a truck with one of the locals still chasing after the Howard brothers and enlists his help in flanking Toby. With his full attention kept in front of him, Toby doesn't realize the danger at his back until it is too late. Taking a 500 yard shot, Ranger Hamilton shoots Toby through the head, killing him where he sits. Both Tanner Howard and Marcus Hamilton are forced to deal with the deaths of their brothers, living in grief and feeling as though they no longer have any reason to carry on. Tanner pays off his family's debts and the land is saved, oil drills quickly popping up to pull up the source of his family's salvation. Now officially retired, Marcus can't ignore the fact that the case will forever go unsolved so he resolves to pay Tanner a visit. What follows is one of the best acted and most tense scenes in the film as both men, both of whom have lost so much to each other, discuss the aftermath of everything. With the arrival of Tanner's ex-wife and sons the tension is broken temporarily, until both men promise an end to their entanglement should the other wish to visit where the other lives, gun in tow. Family drives many to do things they never thought they would do. The theft and changing of hands of the land, from the Native Americans to the homesteaders responsible for helping settle the United States, to the farmers and landowners being forced to foreclose and return the land they poured their blood, sweat, and tears into back to the bankers who loaned them the money for said land. Finally, the justice of taking the life of the man who killed one's own brother, an eye for an eye, a life for a life. David Mackenzie, Taylor Sheridan, and composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis craft an incredible tale of just how far two brothers are willing to go in order to provide for their family and the two brothers willing to stand up for the law. Everything about this film fits together seamlessly, from the direction to the writing to the use of music and song to help portray the emotions seen on screen, Hell or High Water is a stark look at what it means to be human and how much or a role brotherhood plays in defining humanity."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 September 2017,1/10,A very uninteresting story. Its very slow and probably the worst movie I have ever seen. This is about two brothers robbing banks...The direction is poor and so is the acting. This film has no story...its just long and boring. When will we see good quality films again? I guess those days are gone.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 January 2021,10/10,"I don't typically review a film as a 10, but this one passed that threshold for me. I love everything Sheridan has done so far. There is something about the bleak and desolate settings mixed with an engaging plot that gives his work some real staying power. From Wind River, hell or high water, and Yellowstone, it seems everything he does is right up my alley. I've shown this film to at least 10 people and everyone has said they thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch again. Ben Foster has been one of my favorite actors for a couple years now and he is fantastic in this movie as the Alpha type of brother who can't help but always pick a fight. Jeff bridges and Gil Birmingham are hilarious together, their chemistry was surprising but refreshing in a movie that I was not expecting any humor from. Love the loyalty of the two brothers all the way up until the end. I think I just talked myself into watching this one again. Damn I love West Texas"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,1 September 2016,8/10,"If Hell Or High Water is just a slight indication of what I hope to expect in regards to the quality of films I expect to see for the remainder of 2016..I will be really impressed.A modern take on the western. Two Texas brothers on a bank robbing spree with Texas rangers and other law enforcement in pursuit. There are a few things that make this film stand out from other modern crime films. The motives of the protagonists are unique. They have a plan and a time limit. The locale FEELS authentic.The Production Design and Cinematography (Tom Duffield & Giles Nuttgens, respectively) are GREAT. I was immersed in the story and the world that was displayed on the movie screen. Also...I have to give credit to Nick Cave for the music. I'm not a Country music fan by any means. But all of the music choices worked seamlessly.This movie balances action, tension and drama quite well. There is a pace. And at times, unfortunately, a bit of a languid pace. Especially in the middle of the film. This didn't bother me too much as this gave room for the characters to develop. I cared for all of them. From the major leads to the minor ones who walked in and out of the story. All of them felt real. When the action does pick up again for the climax, was quite impressed.Hell or High Water is on my Top Ten list for 2016. No doubt whatsoever. Excellent acting by the leads (Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham), a great tension-filled story (with an ALMOST perfect ending), an immersive soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. A definite recommend. 8/10"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 August 2016,5/10,"I was anticipating this movie given the high rating on many review sites but unfortunately came away quite disappointed. It's an okay movie with a decent story and good acting. The story: I found myself thinking too much of ""No Country for Old Men"" while watching this movie. Old part of Texas that still seems like the wild west, bad guy being chased by an old aging lawman. It also had a feel of a western version of ""The Town"". They start out robbing banks and doing it in such a way to keep from getting caught but over time they make mistakes that brings the law down upon them heavily. The movie starts out quite good going right into the action. But it takes forever into the movie for the characters to develop or to get a full understanding of what is happening and why. I've read in other reviews about the great performances by the two main actors that play brothers, but for me they go a bit too heavy on the Texan accents. Chris Pine is barely understandable much of the time and Ben Foster plays the same character he did in ""Alpha Dog"" (Jake Mazursky). I had to guess at the plot throughout much of the movie and there were characters introduced that you never saw again but played a key role... The old lawman (Jeff Bridges) who goes chasing after him with his sidekick reminded me of the relationship between Hank Schrader and Steve Gomez of ""Breaking Bad"" which also has kind of a wild west feel to it. All in all, these characters were not very original and the story line seemed too familiar. There were certainly some good lines and scenes in the movie. But the movie really left me wanting for more. I tried reading all the rave reviews trying to figure out what I had missed and I just don't see this movie as a cinematic great. I've read all the reviews about how it goes into detail of life in middle America that have suffered through this depression and the moral dilemmas when trying to take care of your family. Just an okay movie that I would have preferred to have waited to see at home rather than spend the money to go to the theater and see it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 December 2019,9/10,No country for old men but without the weight of the Coen brothers.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,10/10,"You need to see this movie. That could be this entire review, but I think I should describe how amazing this film is. Unlike most summer movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines. The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers) is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it, like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 October 2016,8/10,"This one has all the bases covered: well written, well paced, well shot, well acted. It doesn't even overstay its welcome and ends at just about the right time. An almost complete absence of a heavy hand anywhere, down to the score which does the best thing it can do and blends right in. No attempt is made to overstate anything, and the scenes flow from one to the next with a masterful hand keeping the rhythm. The standout moments will depend on what each viewer reacts to, whether it be the scenery, the action setups, the comedy relief or the human drama. It's all there to be found, thanks to solid performances and good editing. I would argue that Chris Pine delivers more than anyone had a right to expect and almost steals the show. But the overall standard of acting is good enough that every interaction feels genuine and each character pulls more than his weight. You could argue that the experience lacks a little sparkle, and it certainly feels a galaxy away from the avalanches of special effects and color explosions we have had to endure. But the complete absence of glitter suits a movie so uncompromising. The land is hard, it's people are tough, the choices are difficult. The movie makes the right one and builds on people and their struggles and not on the fireworks. As such I expect it will satisfy mature audiences more readily. Having said that, some fireworks do go off, and quite the impact they have too. One thing to note is that some viewers will struggle to understand some of the dialogue, simply because of the accents and pronunciation. It takes a while for the ear to adapt and settle.More than anything though this movie is an ode to Texas and the far West, to the survival of a resilient people through adversity, and to the classic Western. You could see a bank robber fleeing on the highway with cars chasing him, or you could see a posse of vengeful gunmen galloping after an outlaw. The drought is financial, the old mine spews oil and the riders mount trucks, but the deal never changed: gold or lead."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 December 2019,10/10,"Ya see? Hollywood can still ""make'em like they used to"" if they have a notion. Great movie all around....one I will be watching over and over because i know I have more to absorb from this classic!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 November 2016,10/10,"This was by far the best movie I have seen in a long time. Every scene, every word of the smart dialogues delighted me intensely. The messages about loans and financial aid printed in background walls, nothing was there by chance. IMDb has classified the movie as a western, genre that I usually dislike, but the life of a forgotten region of the US rather than the plot is the core subject of this masterpiece. The amazing soundtrack supports the melancholic shots of desert landscapes populated by hopeless, desolated characters - such as the lonely waitress that bears a child and has a mortgage to pay. The acting is nothing less than superb: Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine perform at their best. And as every western this movie also has a final dwell - a one that does not involve guns but words instead. I cannot stop thinking about this movie and the way it portraits the United States and the world crisis in our days."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2017,7/10,"One thing that got on my mind through the whole movie was: i've seen this before. All of this. I don't think I'm the only one who gets Coen brothers vibes from this movie, or generally speaking, from a certain genre which is thriller/western drama with an old ranger who's not very enthusiast about his impending retirement and a couple of spoiled thieves, one smart the other one crazy. Nevertheless, characters - especially in the second half of the movie - begin to look more and more tridimensional, and more than once Taylor Sheridan's screenplay surprised me, not only for a smart and quite subtle way of showing the main themes of the movie, such as Texas' citizens economical issues and the even more interesting father's responsibilities and his duties, but especially because it didn't lack of a huge amount of suspense and unpredictability - and honestly I was quite worried about that. Pine gives a surprisingly real performance, while Ben Foster is simply exquisite and charming in his craziness, and the relationship between the two brothers is as genuine as the two lawmen's, Marcus - an amusing Jeff Bridges - and Alberto. The final showdown between the good and the bad (what's the difference anyway? but most of all, there's one?) is thrilling and totally not what I was expecting. Interesting characters, deep performances, not much refreshing in my opinion but very enjoyable anyway."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 December 2016,9/10,"Keeping it simple - you will just not be able to forget this movie. Not a chance!Best performance was by Chris Pine, however the performances by the legendary Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster are too nothing short of brilliant themselves - which brings me to why this movie is my unforgettable : the depth of the characters and the brilliance of actors! Speaking of Chris Pine, you wouldn't expect the Star Wars actor to ooze with masculinity, but let me break it to you I didn't see that good a manly performance since Christian Bale in Dark Knight series or Brad Pitt in Troy. It's not that Chris Pine is running around destroying half of the city or fighting epic battles and banging unbelievably hot women, he is only fighting to bring his ungrateful family out of poverty, just being a provider, just being a man! And the last scene where Chris is confronted by Bridges....oh what a beauty! No high octane action in that scene, just two men sorting their stuff out. Chris Pine I apologize for thinking low of you."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 January 2017,9/10,"From beginning to end I was caught up in the atmosphere and characters of this film. It harked back to some of the feel of 70's thrillers like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot but was its own film entirely. Jeff Bridges is interesting to watch even if he is getting up from a chair! Chris Pine also holds his own. Special mention should go to the cinematography and location work. It really captured the downtrodden locale and empty landscapes well. I also enjoyed a lot of the bit parts in the film, which seemed to be particularly well cast.Ultimately it was just a solid script and direction to match. See on a big screen!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 March 2017,9/10,"This is an absolute brilliant masterpiece. The fact that this film did not win an Oscar is just beyond me and just goes to show Oscars is more about political and cultural snobbery rather than objectively rating a film. This movie is so good that it made me create this account just to share my take on how good it actually is and how much this film can do. Sicario didn't appeal much to me, but i absolutely love this.Let me start off by saying that the story in the movie is not a ""deep"" story, its not trying to do what Shawshank Redemption did with the story, its not trying to spoon-fed you popcorn, this movie is more about showing some of the best acting you will ever find in a movie. Ever. Its so good your biggest struggle in this film is finding out who does the better job out of the three. The dialogues in this movie is outstanding, i was so hooked on the small talk that in most movies seems redundant, in this movie i was sucking it all up and i was buying it all. The cinematography was great. The acting is incredible. The characters are awesome and they bond so well, you get so committed to these characters you have a feeling they're all your best friends, you have a feeling you're watching a 7 season long TV series, its incredible what this does.This movie is by far the best movie in 2016. One of the best movies of all time in my opinion. The best acting you will ever find. Never liked Ben Foster, considered Chris Pine a Hollywood pretty-boy with a small acting range, my opinion on those two flipped on a plate. They are so great and the synergy between them is off the charts. Jeff Bridges is good 'ole Jeff Bridges. Hes a great actor with character and this role fit him perfectly, he just does what he does best and it comes so natural to him you cant even tell hes acting. He reminded me of a mix of Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road (a very underrated movie ahead of its time sadly) and a bit of Harrison Ford in The Fugitive.Jesus Christ this movie is too good. The story in the movie isn't an invention of the plate, that means everything else has to be great in order for this to be a movie to remember; the acting, the characters, the dialogues, the cinematography its all absolutely outstanding. You have to watch this if you haven't. Incredible."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,6 March 2017,9/10,"Great script. The dialogue was really well written. The interaction between Gil Birmingham and Bridges is priceless. The characters are well defined and the story kept me on the edge of my seat.The cast all turned in excellent performances, those with minor roles (especially Buck Taylor & Katy Mixon) gave their usual yeoman performances."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 September 2018,9/10,"I really enjoy this film never heard of it before I came across it by accident. . . glad I did. I love the Texas Rangers interaction with each other. Good acting two brothers rob banks to pay off Ranch before it goes into foreclosure. My only real gripe would be a small plot hole if the ranch can generate so much money what can't they use that to pay it off; I feel like that was never really explained. However, still a really enjoyable movie"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 January 2020,8/10,"Hell or high water is a great film that doesn't get talked about enough. Although the films admitted slow pace for the first 40 minutes it used that time to develop characters. Speaking of the characters, the preformces in this film are stellar, and the world around them feels loved in and real. I agree that this film is incredibly inspired by the Coen brothers masterpiece ""no country for old men"" I feel like this has different very different motivations behind the characters. Not to mention the incredible cinematography. Not to touch on spoilers but the last 30 minutes in this film is some of my favorite moments of film in the last decade, but not just the least 30 more specifically the last five minutes which a conversation between two characters that floored me. If I am going to complain I think it has little rewatch value and the slow place in the beginning although important got a little boring. In conclusion a great film and is on Netflix right now if you want to watch it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 March 2017,6/10,"Spoiler alert How would Jeff Foxworthy sum up the absurd nature of this plot? ""If you can't get a loan from someone for $43,000 on an asset that will generate $50,000 a month, then you might be a redneck."" Only an idiot would think this is a great plot. Hell just borrow the money from their lawyer and pay him back $100,0000 and take no risk at all. Otherwise the cinematography and the acting were fine."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 December 2016,3/10,"This movie is more bland than the dust blowing outta west Texas. A typical bank robbery movie that has high aspirations. Do you want a worn-out end-of-the-line Sheriff/Ranger/Police Chief? Watch ""No Country For Old Men"". You want a bank robbery that succeeds against the odds? Watch Steve McQueen in ""The Getaway"". Want some Texas atmosphere? Watch ""The Last Picture Show"" - which incidentally is set in the very same town as the first two robberies of this movie. Nice, Jeff! Seriously, this movie tries - and fails - to achieve the level of greatness or niche of film legend as those movies previously mentioned. Its a compilation of Texas things we have seen and done before. There is almost no action and what is here you could safely let your children watch on Sunday mornings.There is no furthering of the dialog, plot or even sensibilities. Its as though someone tried to take all the cool parts of bank robbery movies and put them together while making sure they wouldn't be accused of plagiarizing the films that have gone before. Its a safe movie. It entertains but it won't blow you away or make you think. Which is a shame for all involved."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 August 2017,9/10,"As a Brit who's spent quite a bit of time in Texas over the past few years, I enjoyed this modern take on the Western. The oil price downturn has been devastating for many people who live in Texas, especially in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis and the subprime shenanigans in the US housing sector. So, this film has something to say about that, which I could relate to.There was a road trip aspect to the movie, which I also liked. This reminded me of my own journeys along the Texan highways, and although I've never been west of Austin in a car, I really appreciated some of the scenery shown here.The characters are all strong. Many people here mention the great jobs done by Ben Foster, Chris Pine and, of course, the always-watchable Jeff Bridges. However, fair credit must also be given to Gil Birmingham, who played Bridges' put-upon partner. I had downloaded this movie on Amazon Prime as something to watch on the train but I wished I'd seen it first in the cinema. The Western does seem to be making a comeback and if they can't be laugh-a-minute (e.g. The Hateful Eight) then they need to be intelligent and observant, like this one! I think it has something to say about the consequences of violence as well, although the writers are smart enough to leave things hanging so that you have to draw your own conclusions about the rights and wrongs of what the characters did.But very nice effort!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 September 2016,10/10,"I loved everything about this movie. The soundtrack, setting and unbelievable acting combined to make for an enjoyable afternoon matin√©e. Great screenplay and direction/cinematography were as good as it gets. The fact that IMDb requires 10 lines seems a little silly to me. I liked this movie so much that I'll repeat the above: I loved everything about this movie. The soundtrack, setting and unbelievable acting combined to make for an enjoyable afternoon matin√©e. Great screenplay and direction/cinematography were as good as it gets. So with that, I will conclude my review with another shout-out to IMDb. Maybe reduce it to 5 lines."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 April 2017,9/10,"When I started to watch this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The opening sequence answered all those questions for me.I was sucked in immediately. The bank robbery was done so well. It felt realistic. No pointless explosions or unbelievable action sequences. The men doing the robberies immediately had you asking why they were doing this. The victims had realistic reactions; the feisty older woman, the scared teller, the old man with a gun and nothing to lose. The background of these two men come out shortly after the opening sequence. At that point I was all in. Everything just fits. The music matches up with the scenes. The choices for the roles were perfect. The colors and scenes make you feel like you are in a small town in the middle of nowhere out west.The action scene at the gas station had a punch that looked so realistic. I think scenes like that were why I enjoyed this movie so much. It felt real.The police officers story line is also very well done. It is a good cop, bad cop scenario, but not in the typical fashion. They make you almost not know who to root for, the robbers or the cops. It really is quite amazing how well the director and writer put you in an argument with yourself on who you want to come out the winner.There are so many great scenes in the movie. The father-son talk just before the final robbery. The scene with the officers talking, and it almost appears to dawn on them that the bank is almost the real enemy, the cause of so many of society's problems. The brothers wrestling while a country music song plays in the background.You knew how the last robbery was going to play out, yet it was done so well it was still perfect. It still had a twist that was unexpected. There was a death that shook you no matter what side you were rooting for. And the emotion that came immediately after was so passionate. I loved this movie. It is one of the best I have scene recently. It had a great story, one that had you rooting for all involved. You felt the pain and the struggle behind the robbers choices, the love they had for each other, the pain on how life played out. You also felt the the fight the officers had in wanting justice, the respect between them almost identical to the brothers."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 February 2019,6/10,Bank heist movie with a weak plot. Some of my favorite actors subjected me to intense boredom. The movie has some good moments but just watch this if you've run out of things to do. Too slow and predictable for me
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 February 2017,7/10,"I had high hopes & great expectations for this Oscar nominated flick but alas i was let down. I gave it a 7 and I think thats a fair rating. The story and film overall were good But the acting wasn't 'amazing' like some reviewers have stated ( many 10 ratings, cmon) nor a 10 in terms of overall greatness. Film was written well with a good storyline but i found some parts predictable. Both lead male roles did a good job portraying their Texas characters and the Texas landscape scenes were good in showing the vast empty land mass that is 'middle TX'. The ending was abrupt could of been better. Also, they never go into the Family story of why he's divorced, and why they only show a scene with 1 son and not the other was odd. I'm glad i rented it and not paid top dollar at the theater."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 January 2017,9/10,"let's talk about Hell or High Water! This movie was by far one of the top 3 movies of the year and if this does not get nods for some Oscars then we have a problem.Pros: This movie hits across the board. It gets top marks for acting, story, script, cinematography, and directing. Chris Pine and Ben Foster could pass for real brothers in real life I think. Oh and if you need another example of their on screen chemistry just watch The Finest Hours. These two guys are in my opinion besides Benedict Cumberbatch the top actors in Hollywood right now. If not any of the other movies I discuss this one deserves your attention.Cons: Nothing really to add here. Just my usual complaint, Should have been longer."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 July 2016,9/10,"With Taylor Sheridan as the writer and David MacKenzie at the helm, I had high hopes for this movie. Both of their last respective projects (Sheridan - Sicario, MacKenzie - Starred Up) were gritty, violent, and engaging. All of those hold true for Hell or High Water.The main characters, Chris Pine and Ben Foster turn in great performances. Ben Foster plays the ex-con brother. And as usual, he turns in what I think was the best performance of the movie. He has a knack for playing a top notch supporting role, and often times gets overlooked. Chris Pine also nails it as the more straight laced brother. For a pretty boy of Hollywood, his portrayal is authentic. Jeff Bridges also compliments these two well as the older, sort of jaded officer. Both him and Foster even provide a good amount of laughs, but neither overdo it.The setting of the movie really sets it above others in the genre. I would say this movie is more crime/drama or heist film than Western, but it definitely has a Western vibe due to its northwest Texas setting. The area has been hit hard by the recession, a failing farm industry, and big oil. It all makes the recklessness and danger Foster and Pine engage in that much more enjoyable, and even sort of relatable. The audience can at least sympathize with them as they do what they think is right. Overall, this film is well worth a watch. It can be put in a league with more recent films like The Town, Drive, and The Place Beyond the Pines."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 November 2018,9/10,Love the theme. Love the sarcasm. Love the portrayal of west Texas
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 March 2021,4/10,"Weak script with scenes where characters do nothing but engage in less than interesting conversations about their past just to give exposition. Doesn't deserve the casting and praise it got, imo. The lack of effort in the writing tarnished the directing and acting worth its while."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 November 2016,7/10,"My main criticism is the fact this movie was shot in New Mexico and it claims to be in Texas.. if ANY person on these boards knows these two regions are NOWHERE near similar. Texas is very developed, yes even in the West. NM is NOT.. it is barren and desolate with different vegetation and other major geography differences. Secondly.. the way Hollywood depicts West Texas is so grossly ridiculous. You would think everyone is white.. or total trash..with thick ridiculous accents. Unreal.. and no wonder people hold Texas with such contempt if this is all they see or are exposed to is this type of characterization. It is akin to an African American actor in an urban setting speaking constant Ebonics with a 4th grade vocabulary, sure they are there..but it would be a gross stereotype casting that PC types would go nuts over. The story is refreshing in it's simplicity. Bridges is good, even though he epitomizes the problem I listed above... Those comparing this to No Country for Old Men are FAR off. Other than the occasional similar ambiance it has none of the depth, charisma, or nuance of No Country."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2017,10/10,"I've only watched a handful of movies in 2016 cause I'm really picky about the movies I watch I hate watching bad movies so when I heard there's a movie starring Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster it was already a must watch film . The two of them I admire for their great acting abilities . Second when heard it was a crime story about bank robbers with a fugitive feel it was right up my alley cause I've been looking for such a movie for 4 years now. This is the best western I've seen in a long time albeit a modern western . The writing and directing was perfect both the dialogue from the bank robbers and the rangers was amazing .It created suspense and build the characters .The pacing was spot on .There were no empty scenes . The director captured the landscape brilliantly and brought more feel to the film. The cast were great ,I must say Chris Pine surprised me I like him but I never thought he was capable of such a performance . I have nothing to say about Ben and Jeff except great as usual . It's a must watch film about down on their knees brother who wants to save their family ranch and the the ranger looking for one last job before he retires . There was a few plot twist that I didn't expect .10/10 they don't make many films like this anymore ."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 November 2016,10/10,"Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham did an amazing job letting the viewers truly bond with their characters, confusing(by heart) who's the protagonist and the antagonist. The brotherly bond of the brothers and the lifelong friendship the officers will make you hate the fact that in an action movie(a western one in fact), one of them has to die.The movie will let you delve into the world of modern cowboys. It gives you a very Texan feeling without even knowing a thing or two about it. From what I hear and see from today's media and mainstream stereotypes, I would definitely say that the movie portrayed Texas accurately. This is a definitely a movie worth watching."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 August 2016,7/10,"Certainly worth seeing for the acting and the atmosphere but that's not enough to overcome the plot deficiencies. Caution for those that have not seen the movie as there are spoilers that follow.If I were a Texas Ranger I would be flabbergasted at the portrayal of their inability to solve the case and find the second bank robber. Here are some pretty obvious clues for the clueless Rangers. Knowing the entire family history, how could the Rangers not stumble on the fact that the family farm was in foreclosure? Foreclosure would have required all sorts of public filings readily available to anyone who looked. Even the Midland Bank officer comments on the timely last minute payoff of the loan and back taxes. One look at the check from the casino, made out to the bank, would have solved the crime as there are countless camera in casinos, particularly at the cashier windows.In the shootout with the townies, Tanner strolls down the middle of the road firing an automatic weapon that rips into the townie vehicles. There are at least 10 armed men who never get off even a shot despite Tanner taking the time to drop his clip and reload, twice. The townies are shown running around their vehicles instead of taking cover and returning fire. What an insult to the armed gun loving males of Texas. Ballsy enough to give chase but so inept in the use of their weapons as to lack any credence.While chasing Tanner, is it possible that all the townies and all the cops didn't get the license plate of the getaway truck before it explodes in flames? That piece of info would have led the Rangers to the used car lot where Toby takes the truck for a test drive linking him to the crimes.And finally, the Rangers KNOW that a waitress in the diner just prior to the 2nd robbery and a table of three men can identify Toby while he was in the diner. One of the men even describes what Toby looked like (cowboy-like) to Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) . Hello? The plot is so incredible that it compromises the ridiculous ending to a slow moving character study of some of the dumbest characters in the history of westerns.And before you get all misty about the amazing West Texas scenery, not a single shot of the movie was filmed in Texas."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 November 2016,7/10,"This movie is very enjoyable. It is, however, not as stellar as I expected from the glowing reviews and raves. Maybe it's because I am from West Texas, where this movie is centered, and the way Hollywood thinks this place works is only a few notches ahead of your average Western. Jeff Bridges is excellent, although his character swerves into caricature a time or two (or three). The plot is good, maybe a little too simplistic when its all said and done. Bridges Texas Ranger is a little too racist, even when they are good natured jibes at his half Mexican, half ""indian"" partner. Texas is basically half Mexican at this point, and people in West Texas also respect the native American culture more than most, because a lot of us have native American blood. In 44 years, I've heard only a handful of jokes about ""Indians"" and Bridges character utters them three or four times. But, Hollywood. Chris Pine was excellent in a subdued role. Ben Foster played an interesting character, but more Rambo and less of a believable Ex-Con. Neither of their accents were believable, and it took a little away from it for me. Some of the bit actors had a better grasp of how the characters should talk and sound. Other than that, a good little tale in the western tradition. The final scene was my one of my favorites."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 August 2016,,This is one of the better cops and robbers movie I have seen in quite a while. This will go down as one of my favorite Jeff Bridges movies. This movie kept me interested throughout. Very well acted. I would especially recommend this movie to law enforcement. One heck of a ride. The interaction between Marcus and Roberto are classic. There are many great moments in this movie. The T-Bone steak house scene with the salty waitress is classic. The sassy waitress at the diner is another classic moment. The movie depicts what would probably happen in a small town in Texas when one of the banks get robbed and the locals decide to get involved.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 October 2016,8/10,"Went to watch this movie as I was at a loose end one day waiting for the missus shopping and it was the best rated movie showing at the time on IMDb.I was not disappointed and thought the movie was very good throughout. Jeff Bridges playing the cantankerous police office brilliantly.The plot was plausible and apart from a couple of scenes near the end not too much bloodshed. I would definitely recommend this movie. I particularly liked the ending of the movie which left me thinking would it have a sequel, I hope not as likely it could not match up to the original as sequels often don't."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 May 2020,3/10,"Good actors will confuse you. Movie was boring as hell. Kind of an OK storyline, but I already miss my 1.5h. I'm also confused about imdb 7.6 rating?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 November 2016,8/10,"This is my first IMDb-review and I just came from the cinema watching this movie. Me and my mother enjoyed the movie a lot.It is a slow paced movie which gives its characters enough time to develop and so we as audience can enjoy them, not only from a audience point of view but also understand their intentions and motivations. This is a movie which reminded me a little bit of MUD or The Place Beyond the Pines in the way how it is told, or also Cop Car. The Movie is beautiful and very well written. I can recommend it to everyone to watch it. And Jeff Bridges, damn this guy plays just fantastic in this flick."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 April 2017,6/10,"Basically, an updated version of the Jessie and Frank James story done for the umpteenth time. Decent acting but still a well worn plot minus a new or original plot twist or story line. Movies like this fall into the same clich√©d progression pretty much all the time. Big bad establishment types (in this case a Bank), good people who are forced to turn bad to survive, and a conflicted lawman figure tasked with upholding the law while trying to maintain some personal honor. Been there...done that....don't want to do it again."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 January 2017,1/10,"The movie fails due to lack of originality - of plot, of script, of presentation (I'm talking about often muffled dialog, so bad that I actually turned on the English subtitles when turning up the sound didn't help). There is truly little that isn't a clich√©. While there is plenty to criticize in modern American society, the story overemphasizes stereotypes. One is given a picture of rural dysfunctionality on par with a Trump stump speech. This is particularly evident when the two brothers are confronted by young punks at a gas station who for no reason verbally assault them and then threaten them with guns. At a time when conceal/carry has become commonplace (especially in places like Texas) this encounter is worse than stupidly suicidal. More importantly, it adds little (or nothing) to the already lacking plot. Robbing banks to pay off the mortgage isn't much to start with,but I'm sure someone with more imagination could have come up with something better than the weak twist we're given at the end."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 November 2020,10/10,"A great cast, amazing story, and beautiful photography. As compelling as any other movie I've ever seen."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 January 2019,8/10,"Two brothers of contrasting personalities set out for a similar goal, yet with differing motivations. They are: Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) - the smart and the stupid - the cerebral and the primal; the brothers team up to rob some banks, consequently for another duo on the other side of the law - Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) - to chase after them for a run time of less than 1 hour and 50 minutes, of slow, but thrilling sequences delivered with witty, comedic and sometimes, sentimental dialogues without any lack of the gun-banging that is typical of westerns. However, this is no typical western; a cynical take on the genre, quite akin to the modern classic - No Country for Old Men - despite the differences in themes both represent, both were nurtured by the blissful hands of excellent cinematographers, capturing shots of sweeping landscapes and intense, nail-biting scenes - complementing the surprising, but fantastic performances from Pine and Foster and a resembling re-enactment of the legend himself, Bridge's famous roles, which is not a disadvantage to the film, especially not when paired with Birmingham's wry portrayal of an Indian character - who has to live through Marcus' constant spews of racist jokes, but not without Alberto flinging them back at him, which makes for some comedic back-and-forth-s that are much needed following somber moments. They share an interesting dynamic, however, the sentimentality of it all seeps through the brothers more often - not solely for the fact that they are brothers, even if it is a major contribution to my experience. I relished the subtlety of the performances, having them to transcend the film to an emotional family drama. Director David Mackenzie has been successful at creating this magnificent modern and realistic representation of the post-western genre that would not have been a likely possibility if well-reputed screenwriter, Taylor Sheridan wasn't at the helm of this script. Alas, it is a product assuredly deserving of its praise and your time."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 November 2017,9/10,"I doubt I will ever get tired of watching this film. Like many classic westerns it is written so well with just enough words for the actors to work their craft, it seems effortless as the story unfolds. Years from now I shall play the DVD and still enjoy it. Chris Pine and Ben Foster have quickly become indicators that a movie is worth paying to go see. Both have an excellent body of work in different genres. Beau Bridges has been so for quite a while now. All the bit parts are well played so that this movie has nothing in the way of weak links or flat spots. Gotta love the grumpy old waitress. And Ben Foster is absolutely the right age if anyone is planning a movie about Custer. Aside from being a western Hell Or High Water plays nicely alongside 99 Homes, Money Monster and Killing Them Softly. All these films are concerned with Americas economic problems and peoples feelings of despair and abandonment. Crime is usually the solution closest to hand. The movie drives through run down Texas towns with scenes of failed businesses, while Foster and Pine crack wise in the style we liked so much in the first Magnificent Seven film. Think of Brad Dexter and Steve MacQueen. The soundtrack follows the images beautifully, the tone of Hell Or High Water is pitch perfect and I haven't met anyone yet with a bad word to say about it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 January 2019,5/10,"There were some good moments and Chris Oine and Jeff Bridges did well in their parts. But overall plot was lacking. Also, why do you have to diss on soccer? Only the biggest sport in the World!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 June 2020,9/10,"That's all I came to say, that and this film is in my top 20 all time"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,30 April 2019,9/10,"The once peaceful lands of Western Texas have been surrendered into the control of the Texas Midlands Bank; forever dominating the people's wealth. A family's ranch is in jeopardy when tough circumstances meet brutal enforcement. Brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard must face the debt their mother leaves behind to keep their ranch. Beneath the land lies black gold which will end their poverty. Before they can progress, they must satisfy the bank's demands whether or not their methods are legal.Many and if not all of the best criminal films do not compare to the dry and dire nature that Hell or High Water depicts. The movie starves itself from the traditional happy-go-lucky plot leaving a crude and lawful journey to follow. In comparison, Escape from Alcatraz also depicts the dependability of family and the desire for change that drove the inmates to commit crimes. Hell or High Water challenges typical crime films with a different approach at success; sacrifice to break the shackles of poverty.
Generally, crime is one of the most difficult genre to depict in a film without excessively including fatuous events, characters, and plots. Many crime films obsess with including comedic and impractical scenarios that spoil the thrill of a crime film. Tom Cruise's
""American Made"" was a true disappointment because the realistic events beneath the film held great potential; a common airline pilot recruited by the CIA in order to bring down the Medellin Cartel finds a new interest in the commission from smuggling drugs. Historically, the twisted events of Barry Seal's recruitment would appear fictional and that is exactly how it is depicted in the film. Likewise, Clint Eastwood's ""Escape from Alcatraz"" took a mushy approach representing the infamous convicts who escaped the inescapable. ""Escape from Alcatraz"" and ""Hell or High Water"" share the same grand scheme plot but only one of them captures the anticipation and excitement of the process. Furthermore, the advancement of the film industry allowed Hell or High Water to nail criminal films spot on by making the audience feel like they're in the moment. Somehow a sense of connection develops as you learn the principle of the film and witness the phenomenal acting.What makes Hell or High Water unique is the storyline that is told in a duel perspective. Throughout the film we see the Sheriff and his Deputy pursuing Toby and Tanner after they blow their cover. Generally, law enforcement is seen as a side or background aspect to a criminal film that appear when convenient. However in the virtually lawless land of Western Texas it's the Sheriff's personal conquest to glorify his last days with his badge. As for the Howard Brothers they have one goal in mind; keep their ranch and ensure a wealthy life for their family. The wholesome plot of the film makes Hell or High Water change how we see crime and the importance of family to some.Mackenzie, a relatively new director, makes a return since his last hit: ""Starred Up,"" which follows a young offender through his timeline in custody. Prior to Hell or High Water or Starred Up, Mackenzie has only directed 6 other films none of which affiliate with crime. However all his films share the surreal realism of the stagecraft and portrayal of characters. CGI is praised for its tactility in portraying situations such as firefights, explosions, narcotics, and decent size land modifications. Yet CGI adds a cartoony aspect to a film that is supposed to feel live action. Mackenzie cleverly avoids using CGI making the film incredibly realistic. Gunfights in the film follow the stereotypes of Texan gun owners but in a way that adds to the story showing the feral turf of Western Texas. Additionally, the entire process of Toby and Tanner's heists is shown with minimal offscreen assumptions unlike other criminal films. In the end Hell or High Water does a spectacular job with its acting which makes me crave a sequel.Hell or High Water deserves a showtime for everyone even those with little interest. Ridded of cliche plots and CGI overkill, there is a laundry effect from the first to the last minute of the film. This film is remarkably a token of Mackenzie and a valid landmark for his 10th film. Rather than settling for big name faces and over advertised films experience crime without greed and glory instead for a greater purpose."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 August 2020,10/10,"That's it! You cannot get a full keg of Texas in a big city. Texas is hard and tough outside the city. Ft. Worth and San Antonio are still cities in Texas. But Texas is wide and natural. Hell Yeah to the writers, directors, and money men in an era when girls want to be boys, and boys don't know how to be men outside of the American West...On BOTH sides of the law. Thank you four years ago for keeping the culture based on the history alive even if it is fiction!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 August 2016,7/10,"Jeff Bridges does it again. Another outstanding performance from one of the great actors of our era. Ben Foster is quickly becoming one of the best supporting actors in the business. Chris Pine delivers what I would consider the best performance of his career. The plot revolves around Pine's attempt to divert an endless cycle of poor, West Texans who seem to work their whole lives in a small, blue collar town with nothing to show for their hard work other than a slow, painful death after 50 years of struggle. Pine's character is driven by his love for his two sons and will do anything to keep them from having to work the dehydrated farms that are now a burden to those who own them. This scenario is called out in a great interaction between Bridges and a local rancher herding his cattle during a brush fire. Ben Foster creates a character so deep that you are able to both sympathize with him and yet loathe his actions at the same time. This polarizing performance is full of genuine passion that could have only been garnered by someone who feels true empathy for the character he portrays. The setting in West Texas plays a key role in the movie. The townspeople keep to themselves and support their local boys against big business much like you would see in the Irish communities of movies based in Boston or the African American communities in movies around Detroit, Baltimore, or the deep south. When the brothers start stirring up trouble, the old-timers just keep to themselves and gives the local Texas Rangers the cold shoulder. There are three points that bring this movie down from a 10/10 to a 7/10. First, there is a lack of plot commitment. There are several sub-themes for the movie without one taking the leading line. On the surface level this movie is about a young man trying to do the best for his sons. Sub-plots consist of the relationship between Bridges and his Ranger partner, the relationship between Pine and Foster, small town vs. big banks, and then of course the common crime dramas and westerns. The second part that took this down a point was how the movie spends a lot of time building empathy for certain characters and then forces you to turn on your opinions. When I watch a movie or show, I don't want to feel betrayed by my emotions for characters. Finally, I felt the ending came up short of being definitive. I understand it was left for somewhat of interpretation, but it didn't need to end there. I really hope this wasn't a re- write to allow for a sequel. I think this movie could have easily been a 10-12 episode show on your favorite streaming website. Overall, great acting, a solid story and some great action scenes give us a breath of fresh air during a summer of sequels and remakes. We should all enjoy performances from Jeff Bridges while he is in his prime and revel in watching Foster continue his consistent, solid performances. Pine delivers his breakthrough performance while transitioning from heartthrob eye-candy to a solid, leading man. This is one of the best movies of the summer of 2016."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 December 2019,9/10,"Highly entertaining!
When you've binged through enough Amazon or HBO shows...
Or tire of scrolling through endless Netflix or SVOD titles....
Then do a search for Hell or High Water! This is an exceptional movie. Acting is outstanding. Career performances from Chris Pine and Ben Foster in a profound brother narrative. Jeff Bridges is as excellent as ever. The story is equally powerful - a clever and creative take on the bank heist trope.Had some issues with direction. For instance, SPOILER: Would have liked to have better explained Tanner's (Ben Foster's) kill shot. It's central to his character and the story but it's left too vague for me. But that's real nitpicking for an otherwise almost flawless movie. You will not be disappointed renting this one."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 December 2018,10/10,Probably the best movie of 2016 and it should've won the Oscar. One of the best movies I've ever seen and one of a very few that I still put on once or twice a year and probably always will because it's that good. Bridges is amazing as expected but it's Pine and Foster and their brother character's bond that puts it over the top for me. Great performances and the movie gave me a new respect for Pine. Original plot putting a twist on the bank robber movie. I still can't believe so many of my friends haven't seen it.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 April 2019,10/10,"The writing, cinematography, pace, acting and soundtrack come together beautifully in this film. A true modern day western with greed as the motivator, bleakness as the backdrop and grit as the fuel."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,17 May 2020,10/10,"""Lord of the Plains.""Every time I watch this movie, I want to start up RDR2 again. It is the prime example of a modern western: bank robbing, Texas rangers, and Comanches! You can literally plop this story in the 1800s and it would still be awesome! My all time favorite western."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,20 July 2020,10/10,"What an outstanding movie! ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". It doesn't pander to any Hollywood 'wokeism' about what a modern movie should be about but neither does it stereotype these characters.There's no obvious 'good guys or bad guys' in this
movie which makes it far better. It's almost like True Grit meets Robin Hood. You'd think it's just a really old plot that's been used hundreds of times before. However, the main three or four characters are very different people and there's some brilliant subtle and clever acting going on. It's what gets left out and doesn't need to be said it overacted that shows.No overkill with the action scenes either, enough to make it interesting but keeping it realistic at the same time. It won't be to everyone's taste but if you're a 40 something year old guy who likes a 'real guy film' (No offence intended) and not endless syfy rubbish, I think you'll really enjoy it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 August 2020,10/10,"Great balance of good acting, drama and occasional humor. Modern western storytelling in an all too real state of affairs."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,9 September 2021,6/10,"This was a dent movie but as a native west Texan the forced accents were very distracting. I would suggest the dialect coaches work much harder or find true west Texans to learn from. We aren't from Alabama, Georgia or South Carolina.. it has its own twang. Not trying to be overly critical, but if you're going to have a film tied to a specific region, you need to nail it. Not use two ol boys.. one from LA and one from Boston. Other than being weirded out by that.. the story and premise was well done. Love anything Taylor Sheridan does.. (Yellowstone, Wind River, ect.)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,14 September 2021,10/10,"This is coming from someone born and raised in Arizona, and spent years in Texas, Grew up like this. Captures the modern American southwest like no other. They nailed it. Ben Fosters performance is amazing, so is everyone else's. Way underrated even with the awards it received. Best film made in the past 10 years.It's a Modern Western like ""No Country for Old Men"" but this is the best in that genre I've seen so far."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,19 January 2019,10/10,Start to finish. A fine example of incredible talent hitting on all cylinders. Hat's off to everyone involved.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 June 2017,7/10,"Beautiful views, quiet small towns, and the brothers actions is like a knife cutting through the air and disturbs the silence. brilliant dialogues of Jeff Bridges, good acting from Ben Foster. The hardships of the people, the towns, you can almost empathize with the reasons that led the brothers with their actions. Could be a robin hood story, but not when innocent people are getting hurt when one of the brothers enjoying the crime too much."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 April 2020,5/10,"I can't quite understand how this movie is rated so high. If you can stay awake long enough, there's eventually some short-lived suspense, but I wouldn't feel right calling it an action movie. Most of the plot is predictable and the rest of it is ridiculous. When it tried to get clever, it just got absurd. It's like everyone is a MacGuffin; I couldn't care less if anybody in the movie got what they wanted or died. I did have higher expectations because of the score on here. Currently it's almost as high as No Country for Old Men, which completely blows this movie out of the water in every way. This movie is just average at best.. nothing special or new"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,28 November 2018,10/10,"The movie is chick full of memorable lines. Interesting plot carries the movie along, the characters are the foundation. The relationship of the 2 brothers, the 2 Texas Rangers, the cinematography, the music."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 November 2019,10/10,"This movie, and No Country for Old Men, remind me of my father. It's hard to explain to other people, but there's a streak that runs through these movies that encapsulates where he came from, and what he taught me."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 September 2016,9/10,"I liked it. Few movies these days interest me at all, but this one was like slow hand churned ice cream. It takes a while and just gets better. There was a little bit of sex. There was a little bit of gore. Kind of a western with Rangers and cowboys and deputies and robbers but all in a modern setting. I was totally unaware and am still unaware of the Brazos River running through Archer County, Texas, but my buddy said it could have been sarcasm. Ruined my suspension of disbelief for a little bit of the movie, but the idea of small town Texas and the areas it covered were a welcome difference from most movies. Some of the dialogue had a ring of authenticity but with perhaps a California gloss. Some phrases were just made up though. Not quite No Country for Old Men overall, but better in some ways."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 January 2019,9/10,"This was a great movie. I'm not going to address that here, as it has been done elsewhere. However, a few negative reviewers panned the film on the basis of the financial motivation of the robberies, which they appeared to misunderstand. Some seemed to think the farm was being ""seized for back taxes""-- it wasn't. some thought it was a ""foreclosure""-- wrong again.No, actually, the farm was subject to a ""reverse mortgage"" with a buy-out option. In a reverse mortgage, the owner is payed a monthly amount BY the bank (rather than paying money TO the bank, as in a regular mortgage), while continuing to live in the home. At the end (usually based on the death of the owner), the home becomes the property of the bank. In this case, the family had a brief window in which to buy back the home, after the death of the owner, which was to expire within a few days of the robberies (hence the rush to get the money).Of course, the goal of the buyback was not to ""save the farm"", but to have the family gain from the very lucrative oil lease payments."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 December 2017,1/10,"I simply cannot understand how this movie got nominated for Best Picture Oscar !!! I got bored in the first 20 minutes like never before !!!!
The fact that its screenplay got also nominated for Oscar simply gives me ghoosebumps ! This only confirms me that academy awards (doesn't worth capitalising anymore) it's only politically and financially infuenced ! SPOILER ALERT !!!Can someone explain me how the little brother didn't end up arrested in the end of the movie ?? With dozens of witnesses, and even him identified by policemen after splitting cars ?!
Simply unreal !!! I could rewrite this movie screenplay while going to toilet in a single morning and improve it !And what really scares me the most are other users ratings and its rating on IMDB. But I guess this is what 21st century is all about: LYING, LYING and keep LYING all the time, on TV, in media, in movies, on blogs.... LIE as much as you can :)"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,10 December 2016,8/10,"60 Second ReviewSlow paced film that shines a light on the desperation felt by many left behind in the ""fly over"" portions of the U.S. while weaving an engaging tale that speaks to friendship, brotherly love and devotion,and what some are willing to do for their children.

HELL OR HIGH WATER,24 September 2016,10/10,"In today's film market I sometimes get discouraged as to how far things have fallen since the 70's, but every once in awhile a film comes around that restores my faith. Sheridan's script is raw. It's an unflinching look at these characters, and West Texas as a whole. The actors (especially Foster) completely inhabit their roles. Mackenzie's direction matches perfectly. The film is tense, and often times darkly humorous. It's not an overly violent film, but the moments of violence explode off of the screen. I also feel compelled to mention the wonderfully De Palma-esque opening sequence. This film reminded me of the American New Wave in many ways. The characters are dark anti-heroes, yet they are likable. There is a social commentary within the film, but it never feels preachy. The cinema of it all comes first. I highly recommend this stunning modern western, for it's the best American movie I've seen in years."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 March 2017,2/10,"This was up for an Academy Award? The very first scenes are a conglomeration of clich√©s, and it gets worse as the movie goes along. I didn't like anything about this movie with the possible exception of SOME of Jeff Bridges performance. I kept expecting things to turn around. People loved this film. The two brothers were terrible in every regard. With every new misstep, I was thinking it couldn't get any worse, and then the movie would go to a new scene. A 1000 words isn't enough to describe the reasons why this movie sucked."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 May 2020,7/10,Good movie seems to be a remake of Miles from Home. So if you liked this check that one out.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 January 2019,8/10,"I think Bridges is finding his last niche in this one. A great, small cast. The subject matter was touching. A modern TX Robin Hood."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,23 November 2016,4/10,"7.9 out of ten? What's wrong with you people? You really haven't seen an interesting movie so far? This one is mediocre at best. Nothing really interesting happening here, so my advice is don't waste your time on this and do something else. While I understand that there are some good things here like brotherhood and employees bond and overall the climate of life in a slow lane in Texas outskirts, this surely is not enough to spend your 2h. Well, if you don't have any other movie around than, yeah maybe (which I find hard to believe). Not much of a review, I know but then again, nothing to review here. I recommend watching Animal Kingdom - much, much better fun."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,3 January 2021,8/10,"Really gave me Grand Theft Auto vibes. The Texas setting is perfect and the characters, especially the almost retired sherif are really well played."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,31 August 2016,9/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hell or High Water.A modern day western of sorts, it masterfully mixes American folklore with the realities of today. Set in present-day Texas, this movie follows the brothers Toby and Tanner as they rob a number to banks, laundering the money at a casino to eventually pay off the existing debt on their family ranch, recently identified as containing rich oil beneath. The landscape is barren, and the only real colour is the billboards along the roads advertising debt refinancing and bank services. Even when the brothers succeed in robbing several banks, many civilians applaud them, or refuse to give a description to the investigating Texas Rangers, because they side with these men over the heartless banking corporations.These Rangers, Marcus and Alberto, follow the robberies with a cynical eye, doing their best to anticipate the brothers' next move. They are the modern day Lone Ranger and his sidekick Tonto to the Jesse and Frank James robbers of Toby and Tanner. Every resident, waitress, cattle rancher or otherwise bemoans his or her station in life, granting sympathy or respect to these brothers who, as it is eventually revealed, want to secure the ranch for Toby's sons. In one scene, Toby (Chris Pine) admits to his elder son that his own actions shouldn't be emulated, but that he wants his son to create a new path in life. Alberto expresses his derision of how his people (Native and Mexican Americans) had been marginalized and forgotten, and now, thanks to banking greed, most Americans face the same fate. Toby sees his destructive looting as a way to finally move his own family out of financial hell and into new freedom. The ethical waters become quite muddy as violence increases with each robbery, but both brothers stay the course.As with any idealistic plan, things don't end quite so happily. The Lone Ranger, days away from retiring, loses his steadfast partner, Tonto, in a shoot-out. Tanner, the more reckless of the James Brothers sits atop a desert cliff for once feeling he is king of the plains, like a Comanche, only to catch a bullet through his temple. Toby grinds onward, securing the ranch home for his sons and estranged wife, while Marcus knows he is complicit in the carnage left behind the robberies and shooting deaths. There are no easy answers in this film. Where is the country financially and how do people get out of the hell they are in? How does a cattle farmer still have to deal with wildfires in the 21st century? This anachronism is as out of place and time as Jesse James and the Lone Ranger are, and yet it is a reality. There is no pretty bow to wrap things up completely, but the story, brought to life with wonderful performances by Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham, is well worth the ticket price."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,2 July 2017,8/10,"West Texas seems to be a big place for movies lately... Just loved the dialogue, very sharp between Jeff Bridges and his deputy, Alberto. Alberto was great... and especially loved the waitress Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon). Again, kudos to the writer... thinking Elmore would have liked this."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 August 2016,3/10,"The film was exciting and even adrenaline rushing at some points, but it does not take an asset manager, banker, or anyone else working in the financial world to know that as soon as oil was discovered on that land the oil companies would have paid very well in order to buy the land, or perhaps even just lease it in order to siphon the oil. Hell, even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious issues that many people are facing in this country. I just wish they had been as hell bent on making the plot as believable as they were in trying to get their political points across."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 August 2016,,"The gunshot spectacle was ridiculous.Okay, he was shot.When in the truck with his brother, we see him tape the gunshot wound and utter a few moans and groans.Now, if he was shot, I would expect he would have experienced one or more of the following: shortness of breath, pain, sweating, obvious discomfort, bleeding.So, the truck pulls up to the car. He exits. And there he is standing, having a casual conversation with his brother. No blood dripping, etc.Then, he's stopped by the cops. By now, there should be blood on the seat, on the clothing, on his hands -- all visible by the officer. He sits calmly while the officer checks his ID, which had not an ounce of blood on it. He sits there, in no distress ‚Äì even though he has a gunshot wound.This was just plain stupid and insults filmgoers' intelligence.Otherwise, the film was reasonably entertaining."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,8 September 2016,9/10,"Friend and I saw this in Palm Spgs. Cal. Exlnt film and glad you are making money. Acting was excellent. . .why do film makers use the media and portray drinking alcohol and so forth to permit shooting, fighting, hate, anger and so forth as a ""villain""? The music and scenery was perfectly matched and became another actor in the film. It was great to see Chris Pine in another role and he really has promise. Jeff could ease up on the mumbling. Racist banter as a bit disturbing, even as male bonding. It was great to not know who to root for as the film went on. The women's roles could have been more developed and the waitress in the T Bone restaurant, though short was a highlight. ONWARD!"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 September 2016,3/10,"Went to watch this movie, and expected good things as the trailer and read up on this film looked all positive. However the story line was really bad, and little happens throughout the film. Very boring and would not recommend it, for anyone who thinks it might be a great action/crime, you are wrong. A very simple story line, and little insight into the brothers lives, its as if you are waiting for the movie to start getting tense, but next thing you know, its the end. The last 20 minutes are probably the best bit of the movie, however not much makes sense. Very disappointed and cant understand how this has gained a high rating."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 November 2016,9/10,"Hits you in the feels but picks you up right after. It has gripping, (at times catches you off guard) and believable kind of action, but doesn't necessarily focus primarily on it. There's much more going on in the movie than you realize at first. I admit I questioned the incredible ratings across the board (IMBD is too low on it even at 8.1 IMO) the first half hour or so, but it just got better and better as you begin to understand the profound and surprisingly grand reasons for their underlying goal and you witness the hard- hitting plot points. Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges per usual,fine performances. But Ben Foster was the real standout, as he has been in several diverse roles in the past decade+. He continues to prove he's become a household Hollywood go-to as he's shown he can play nearly any character that is needed."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,12 October 2016,,"This is a great movie. The writing is excellent. The dialogue is sharp, biting and entirely believable. The acting is superb. It is hard to believe how well this movie was cast; it's perfect. The relationships are developed well and so are each of the characters. There are moments of true drama and moments of pure comedic genius. The cinematography is awesome. It really sets the stage for the action of the film and provides incredible context for the story that unfolds. The music, too, enhanced the film and added to the depth of the story. The entirety of the film transports one into the world that the characters inhabit.Jeff Bridges performance is spot on. Even the minor characters manage to make a significant contribution to the story and enrich it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,13 November 2016,10/10,"This is well worth watching, Chris Pine gives a brilliant performance and gives us a glimpse of what he is capable of. Ben Foster is excellent in his role as the black sheep and Gil Birmingham gives an outstanding performance as the deputy on the case but its Jeff Bridges who is the star of the show all the way. The script is perfect and its played so well that you have empathy for both good guys and bad guys.The finale is wrapped up well and the scenes between Pine and Bridges are perfect. Its such a pleasure to watch a movie that can entertain you with more than just a few explosions and brains being blown out and although there is plenty of action its the story telling that brings the magic and keeps you watching.See it if you can...you wont be disappointed."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 November 2016,9/10,"I didn't saw any trailers or even read the synopsis before i went to see it, but i couldn't be happier, the whole movie felt so authentic, the connection between Cris Pine and Ben Foster was fantastic, my favorite part being the scene where they just chase around each other in the yard truly felt like they were brothers, the ending despite of being kind of predictable, in regards of Ben's character death, is still full of meaning non the less, he did everything in his power to save his brother.Can't forget about Jeff Bridges has the typical veteran Texas ranger, with his slow pace, and racist jokes towards his younger partner, the scene at the dinner was terrific ah aha ""what don't you want says the old ""lady"".I truly recommend you watch this movie, you will have an awesome time. time."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 November 2016,4/10,"I watched this film a couple of days ago and even though the story line was basic and predicable i thought the acting was good, But when i was watching the ending it was like i had already watched it before, well its just clicked it was copied off the 1941 film High Sierra starring Humphrey Bogart, In a world of remakes and films made from comics, also films made about an earlier time ie Fantastic beasts and where to find them (Millions more for JK), it would be nice to see something original,i am sure we all could take our knowledge of films and make our own by copying past movies if this was a song in the charts people would be suing for millions,"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,7 December 2016,10/10,"The growing pantheon of films featuring bizarre depictions of the American Midwest just received an enthusiastic new member, for once not from the minds of the Coen Brothers. This modern take on the classic ""cops and robbers"" tale is directed by David Mackenzie in his return to the screen after a three-year hiatus. In fact, if this film accomplishes anything at all it should be to send the message loudly and clearly to any studios hoping to hire Mackenzie in the future: don't rush him. The film is centered around a string of bank robberies in Texas committed by Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his slightly psychotic brother (Ben Foster), all while being pursued by a dogged Sheriff hoping to stave off his retirement a little longer (Jeff Bridges) and his loyal partner (Gil Birmingham). This may seem to be a fairly straightforward story by this description, but the twists of morality and ideas of what the true crime is here make it anything but straightforward. The real anchors of the film, as they should be in any character study, are the incredible performances of the cast. Chris Pine has comparatively few lines to the other three major characters, yet he manages to convey Toby's pain and stolid commitment with great skill. Ben Foster's manic glee is a real show stealer in itself, consistently keeping the audience on edge as they try to gauge how close to going over the edge he is in any given scene. Veteran actor Jeff Bridges is predictably great, finding an excellent balance in his sheriff character wherein viewers are rarely sure exactly how capable he is, both physically and mentally, while never doubting his dry wit for a second. Gil Birmingham has the least meaty part to work with, but finds an enjoyable and surprisingly beloved chemistry between himself and Bridges. The actors make viewers care about both pairs on either side, making this the first film I would say that truly makes you dread when these two opposing forces inevitably meet. Many claim it, this one owns it. While the performances were undeniably great, it will ultimately be the vivid cinematography that sticks with viewers long after the credits roll. Opening with a 360-degree pan of a small town in the Midwest, we are immediately plunged into this world. The dilapidation is apparent as the camera shows graffiti-soaked walls, vandalism, and general disrepair swamping most of what we see until the bank comes back into the shot. Now we see the bank with new eyes; it is no longer just a bank that we suspect is about to be robbed, we now know it is for some reason the only clean, well-kept building in the surrounding area. This helps key viewers in on the central theme of the film before a word of dialogue is uttered or a single scene transition takes place. From a film lover's perspective, it is breathtaking. Moving beyond the opening, there is much more to appreciate here. The wide vistas and blue-yellow color palette of this part of the country is on full display here as Director David Mackenzie never shies away from long, establishing shots of the quiet surroundings. Masterful use of angles accentuates the themes of the film in subtle ways; as the brothers discuss their actions, a low-angle shot is used to give them a sense of power, yet all the while a windmill looms over them, continuously turning its spokes, and serves to underline the idea that the action of the film ultimately will not change anything. Sound is not without purpose here, either. Most of the film's sound stays within the diegesis, helping to establish a sense of place within the world. This leads to many quiet moments where the creaking of equipment or the rustling of grass is all that exists to your ear. In addition to rooting viewers, this lack of excessive dramatic flair helps to feed directly into one of the films main themes; that nothing we see here will affect anything. Naturally, if nothing we are witnessing will serve any pretense of changing the problems we see for the better, what would be the point of dressing it up with a sweeping, dramatic score? It would only be dishonest, and dishonesty is best left to the banks. At the end of the day, Hell or High Water offers a simple tale told complexly, presented beautifully, arranged painstakingly, and paid for happily. With a few Oscar-worthy performances from the principle actors, incredible visuals, and some heady themes of morality, this film easy ranks among 2016's top releases. Come Hell or High Water, make sure you check it out."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,18 December 2016,8/10,"This was a good movie, in the style of No Country for Old Men-lite. The accents were really really good. I am a native of West Texas and I have friends who sound just like the two brothers. In No Country for Old Men, the wife of Llewellyn, Carla Jean, has the most annoying fake Texan accent but there is no problem with that here. The biggest problem I have with the entire movie is the pumpjacks are fake. I work in the oilfield and I know the pumpjacks would not be sitting in the middle of a field without a caliche pad. If they could have CGI'ed a tank battery also to go along with the pumpjacks it would have been more realistic."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,21 December 2016,6/10,"""Hell or High Water"" (2016) is, in story line, ""Miles from Home"" (1988) meets ""Lone Star"" (1996). There is Great acting in all three films, which makes up for the derivative story line. Pines redoes Anderson, retaining the younger brother, as 'innocent', while Foster redoes Gere and makes the elder sibling new. ""Lone Star"" returns in the Bridges vs Birmingham relationship in the Sheriff's office. It also returns in the father-son plot. Sayles rocks as a Director with ""Lone Star"", pulling a terrific performance from Cooper as he searches for his dad. Sinise rocks as a Director in ""Miles from Home"", heightening the political relevance with the Krushchev cameo and more direct tie to the Robin Hood myth. All are worth seeing, though the originals, in script and in plotting, win the day."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,22 January 2017,7/10,"Really liked this movie. A modern day western, but am increasingly getting very tired of spending a couple hours enjoying a story only to have the the ending left unfinished. Do they think it is 'clever' not to wrap the story up? Is it supposed to be fun to have the audience decide their own ending? Many a good movie has been ruined by this tired and over used technique IMHO. I would have preferred they just leave the last scene out altogether. That all said I found the acting solid, the dialogue fitting, and the visuals riveting. I would have liked to see the law men's back story fleshed out. I kept asking myself , who is this Sheriff and why do we care about him and his deputy?"
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 January 2017,8/10,"""3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us."" These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted. Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.Hell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing. The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation. It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems. With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety. Even if it means sacrificing his own. Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby. Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet clich√©d character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.The biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world. Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing. On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.The characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good. Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third. To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.The film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating ""to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money? Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is."" Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that ""a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians. Until someone came along and killed em. Broke em down, made you into one of them. 150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Til' the grandparents of these folks took it. And now its been taken from them. Except it ain't no army doing it. It's those sons of bitches right there"" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.That's the charm of Hell or High Water. The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions. Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws. ""Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money? Long gone, long gone for sure."" In this film, it's back to basics. Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.It's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.Hell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down. For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,5 February 2017,1/10,"What a waste of my time! Looking at the 9- 10/10 reviews I thought wow I'm in for a fab movie night. Gosh I was so wrong!!! Slow moving, no proper story line, simple, mosh mash plot. It's simply 2 brothers,robbing banks for cash for Toby's sons to live on for their future.... but they have a money making ranch which was left to them anyway in their Grandmothers will. Turned it off thinking... wow what rubbish! Not sure really what else to write as it down st take much to put it into a paragraph. Price has done many more fantastic films this is a real set back for him. He needs to keep to the pretty boy look in films if u ask me he didn't suit the part."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,16 February 2017,9/10,"For such a long time I've been waiting for a good movie without CGI and superhero nonsense filmed in the real world. Movies as they should be.The story is great, the characters are great and the acting is great. I'm not going to waste anyone time reviewing this in depth etc. If you want a movie like they used to make them with quality acting then this is it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,25 October 2018,9/10,"Superbly written, acted, and directed. However, the true testament to this film is the authentic nature of the characters and settings. This is a modern day, genuine west Texas outlaw drama. You can't help liking both the protagonists and antagonists. The last time I found myself rooting this much for the characters on both sides of the law was The Fugative with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Well made, well done, and two hours well spent.BTW... I'm a movie buff and this is my first review."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,4 June 2017,9/10,"Very enjoyable movie since the beginning. Reminded me of my time traveling in Utah because of the arid landscapes and the small towns. The critic to the American banking system (well worldwide) while at the same time accepting it as a fact that you better live with was surprising. Also the painting in a wall at the beginning of the movie stating ""they rescued us from Irak to forget us here"" (or something similar) reminded me of those US-citizens not happy with US spending in abroad military interventions.A good movie with a good end where two men with a lot of thing to be angry to each other just accept each other fates. Loved every aspect of it."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 August 2017,10/10,"I have watched this movie over 90 times, and I can see it another 90 times. Why ? Because it cleverly shows a ""Brothers Love"" and a fathers love and the length he will go for them. I guess that makes me have to surrender my man card. I would do this same thing for my brothers if they were still living, and or my children, That is why this movie is special. If you have not watched this movie yet, You Must, as it is specially surprising. I am from Ohio by birth, but my heart beats for Texas ""GOOD, BAD, or INDIFFERENT""."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,29 April 2018,,"Goofs:
""During a scene near the very end of the movie, multiple pump jacks can be seen on the ranch property, but no tanks for storing the pumped oil.""I live in SW Oklahoma just a little NW of the Wichita County, TX oil fields. The storage tanks are very often not located in proximity to the wells. This ""goof"" is not correct."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,11 January 2019,9/10,"A modern Western the way we want it. A gripping story without any lengths and some really well played characters.Driven by classical motives such as family, survival, comradeship and revenge this movie builds up wonderfully until it's classic western-showdown.On the edge of the story the movie touches today's challenges in the west and confronts the viewer and the characters with its bloody past.Highly recommended and for sure a future classic of the genre."
HELL OR HIGH WATER,26 January 2019,4/10,Very predictible Horrible ending. With a great case I expected more.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,27 January 2019,1/10,Could it move any slower or be any less exciting? Do not waste your time on this lame movie.
HELL OR HIGH WATER,15 February 2019,9/10,"Bridges, Pine and Foster all control the screen with their respective roles. Foster especially because his comedic relief helped kind of off-set the seriousness of Bridges and Pine. While it may not be the most original film script wise, It is a very satisfying and complete one. Well worth watching and I would highly recommend."
