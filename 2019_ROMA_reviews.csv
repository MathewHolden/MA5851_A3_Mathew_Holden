ROMA,2 January 2019,10/10,"Have a lot of admiration for Alfonso Cuaron as a director. Also really like to love almost all of his films (having been mixed on 'Great Expectations'), though 'Gravity' is one of those more appreciate than love divisive films that also boasted some of the best cinematography and direction of that year. Of his previous films am especially fond of 'Children of Men' and 'A Little Princess' (the film that introduced me to his work and is a personal favourite) in their own way for different reasons.Was really excited in seeing 'Roma', with talks of it being one of the highlights of 2018, one of Cuaron's best films and trusted friends saying how emotional it was and especially praising the cinematography, direction and sound mixing. Nothing was going to stop me from seeing 'Roma' with the praise being as high as that, despite the (from personal opinion) rather condescending detractors being quite vocal, including making ignorant and off-base paid reviews allegations that says more about themselves than it says those they're criticising. After seeing 'Roma', and this is a genuine opinion here, am going to join those praising the film. Praise that 'Roma' deserves every ounce of and more. One of my favourite films of 2018 definitely, and it has been a variable year so that is saying quite a bit, and quite possibly Cuaron's best film.'Roma', being a semi-autobiographical film, is Cuaron at his most personal, both the writing and the direction. One of the main reasons why 'Roma' did such a lot for me was the emotion, with such brutal thought-provoking realism and poignant, without being over-sentimental, pathos it was the film that connected with me the most emotionally. It also was him at his most thought-provoking and there was no sugar-coating, in fact what was also admirable was the not holding anything back pulls no punches approach. It depicted real life situations and struggles and in a way that was relatable and hard not to get nostalgic or moved over.The pacing has been criticised for being slow, it is deliberate but personally was caught up in the emotion and the compelling realism of the very personal story-telling to care. Plus since when has a film being slow ever always being a bad thing? It only is a problem when there's no reason to be and with the subject to me it came over that the deliberate pace for 'Roma' was not an accidental choice. Sure, finding its rhythm is not immediate but it is very rewarding when stuck with (rather than stopping watching after a ridiculously short period of time and then bragging about doing it). The script is sincere and thoughtful, not written or delivered heavy-handedly.Now we get onto what is especially great about 'Roma'. It is a visually stunning film, have not seen cinematography this amazing, varied or clever in a long time and it complements the evocative setting and the strikingly effortless and atmospheric lighting so brilliantly one is truly immersed. Another major star is Cuaron's direction, showing a visual master of his craft and a person clearly passionate and in love with the story he's telling. Both wholly deserving of major awards attention. Same with the sound-mixing which has all three of the qualities that the cinematography has been described has, so appropriate to the mood and enhances it in a way that few other films this year have done so well. As well as the astonishing and very moving breakthrough lead performance from Yalitza Aparicio, as the most compellingly real and rootable character in a film full of them and strong performances.In conclusion, absolutely loved it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
ROMA,27 February 2019,5/10,"ROMA is a 'snapshot of life' style movie from director Alfonso Cuaron, one which has received plenty of acclaim recently as well as the award for best foreign language film at the Oscars. Still, what do they know? For me, ROMA is a typical kind of movie, not particularly powerful or hard-hitting, and flawed to say the least. Cuaron has done much better with the likes of CHILDREN OF MEN and even HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. The film follows an ordinary poor family and their nanny as they go through a period of social upheaval in Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s. Naturalistic performances from an unknown cast count towards it, but the story is episodic and stretched out and the decision to shoot in black and white robs it of vitality. It's better than GRAVITY, but that's not saying much."
ROMA,7 June 2019,7/10,"Cleo Gutiérrez is one of two maids working for an affluent family in Mexico City. There is marital difficulties as the husband Antonio leaves for Quebec City. Cleo's boyfriend disappears after she tells him about her pregnancy.The black and white cinematography is terrific. The movie starts looking good but horribly slow. It's the slowest of art house movies. It borders on pretentious. Then Cleo starts to have more to do than simply mop the floor. It's interesting to have a non-actor be the lead but it's also limiting. The movie builds up its story until an epic street battle. I like almost everything about that sequence except holding the last scene on that couple in the streets. The power of seeing the horror indirectly is completely obliterated by pointing the camera at the specific aftermath. There is also the drowning scene. It's too obvious. Again, filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón is pushing the point too hard. It's in your face and he can do better. There is also something awkward about being that obvious when the shooting style is so observational. They are minor bumps in an otherwise compelling ride."
ROMA,16 March 2019,10/10,"This broad, award winning film, brings a culture that few of us are aware of, down to the basics. There are dream and hope. There is a subtlety here that has been put there by a filmmaker that sees all sides and lets the audience grapple with the issues. There is beauty and pain, but it is melded masterfully."
ROMA,23 January 2019,5/10,"Roma is a personal film from Alfonso Cuaron. It certainly seems to hark back to his childhood as it is set in Mexico of 1970.Shot in black and white, the way the shots were composed certainly reminded me of European cinemas of the 1950s and 1960s. It could had been made by Fellini or Clouzot.It tells the story of two women across the class divide. Cleo is a young maid working for a middle class family. She is treated well and she has a boyfriend, Fermin who loves his martial arts. When Cleo falls pregnant Firmin abandons her. When Cleo sees Firmin again in the backdrop of violence, the shock pushes her to labour.Sofía a biochemist who teaches and Antonio, a doctor are Cleo's employers. They have four children as well as Sofía's mother living with them.However the household is going to split. Antonio goes for long business trips, it signifies that he has a mistress and this time he has no plans to return.Both Cleo and Sofía are abandoned by their men.Roma is beautiful to look at. Cuaron also makes a reference to his award winning Gravity by a showing a scene from the 1969 film, Marooned.However there is very little story here, it does feel flat and insipid. We know very little about the characters and the events depicted. It is like a slice of Maria's life. It left me unfulfilled."
ROMA,22 February 2019,6/10,"The boring daily life of a maid in the 70´s in Mexico is the storyline of ""Roma"". The screenplay follows the life of Cleo, the maid of an upper middle-class family. This is a typical film for professional critics and viewers from the First World. For a Third World viewer, the situations shown in ""Roma"" happen everywhere and every time and are part of the dailylife. The beautiful black-and-white cinematography and the excellent camerawork are the great parts of this average and overrated film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Roma"""
ROMA,7 February 2021,5/10,"A colleague of mine, who's an art student brought in the dvd and insisted I would love it.If I'm honest, I couldn't follow it, there's a story here, but I think I'd need to watch it again to fully understand what was going on, but for me, the pacing was so slow, I really couldn't sit through it again.On the plus side, it's beautiful, I'm an amateur film lover, and in no real position to comment, but the filming, camera work, and direction are jaw dropping, if you're into art house, you will have a real appreciation for this.It's not my cup of tea, for me it's style over substance, but I can see why there would be an appeal. 5/10."
ROMA,3 July 2019,8/10,"Life of a maid - I never had a maid or nanny. But we all know about women (mostly) who do this type of work. It can be because the parents are too busy (work related mostly) or because they just want more free time for themselves. Now if you attach an attribute to that, you are the one judging, I'm simply stating what most of us know anyway.Try to be open minded, although even if you aren't the movie slowly takes over. It's quite slowly paced, but that is how it gets to you. It's mundane and it feels like you are invading someone elses privacy. But instead you just get to be another member of the family/group. Someone who is just there to observe. And while you may know where this is heading, the planting/seeding and later harvesting of clues and happenings (car parking for example) is quite something. To say it is well made, would be an understatement, but it also is able to touch you. If you let it that is of course. Good movie/drama"
ROMA,29 December 2018,7/10,"I've found Netflix original movies to be a hit or miss affair, mostly miss. This one comes somewhere in between. As I write this, ""Roma"" is getting all kinds of Golden Globe and Oscar buzz, but I have to wonder if that has more to do with the current state of pop culture and #MeToo sensationalism as opposed to the story it tells. Because the story itself is somewhat rather mundane, a slice of life look at a Mexican housemaid and her employer who are the principal characters. Both are beset by troubles inflicted by their partners, the homeowner Sofia (Marina de Tavira), who's husband has left her, and Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the domestic who's almost part of the family but always knows her place in it's hierarchy.To be fair, there are some uniquely creative elements in the story that drew my attention, like the Mexican family's penchant for having the heads of their deceased dogs mounted and hung on a wall, and a guy made up to look like Swamp Thing in a couple of scenes. The one with the naked martial artist Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) seemed to be thrown into the story for it's voyeuristic possibilities; it didn't take much from there to determine that Cleo's choice of boyfriend would turn into a creep who would cause her much suffering.There was really only one time in the movie when something of a momentous nature occurred, and that was during the first twenty minutes of the last half hour of the story. The beach scene had this viewer on tenterhooks trying to determine what the outcome would be with the two young children who ventured too far out into the ocean. At that point, the film could have gone for unrelenting pathos or a miraculous save that would put Cleo's life in context of a bigger picture than the day to day conditions she had to endure. The story opted for a life affirming message that allowed Cleo to transcend her mundane existence, and that was a good feeling.I wouldn't go so far to say that this was a bad picture or that I wouldn't recommend it, but it does require a certain amount of patience to sit through. It's held together by some humorous spots that worked when required, my favorite one was when Fermin's friend Ramon (José Manuel Guerrero Mendoza) reluctantly agreed to bring Cleo to where her boyfriend was training. Realizing he was going out in public, he stated, ""Hold on, let me put on some pants""."
ROMA,8 January 2019,10/10,"Alfonso Cuarón's ""Roma"" is about a maid working for a middle class family in Mexico City in 1970-71, but overall focuses on a couple of things. The obvious point is Mexico's social hierarchy. The protagonist is Mixtec, while her employers are white. One scene pans across the rooftops, showing the maids hanging people's clothes. Equally important is the political situation in Mexico at the time. Industrialization in the 1950s and 1960s had driven millions of rural people into the capital, where they had to live in slums. The years of Cuarón's childhood were marked by the army's massacre of protesters in Tlatelolco right before the Olympics started, and then by the Corpus Christi Massacre (which the movie depicts). The depiction of the father abandoning the family brings to mind Cuarón's expose of Mexico's ruling class in ""Y Tu Mamá También"" (which also showed the country's hierarchy).On top of this, the city itself is just as much a character as any of the cast members. The locales - whether the upscale neighborhood where the family lives, or the slum from whence the maid comes - and the various sounds mark almost every scene in the movie. Indeed, much of the movie is minimalist, emphasizing the action. It all adds up to another fine piece of work from one of Mexico's three great directors of the past thirty years. I recommend it."
ROMA,24 February 2019,8/10,"Along with The Favourite, this was the most nominated movie at the Academy Awards, both films receiving ten nominations, it was predicted to do the best during Awards Season, and it was available to watch on Netflix, so there was no way I could miss this Mexican film, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men, Gravity). Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez (Oscar nominated Yalitza Aparicio) is an indigenous live-in maid in a middle-class household in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. Living in the house with her are the family: matriarch Sofía (Oscar nominated Marina de Tavira), her husband Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), grandmother Teresa (Verónica García), their four young children, and Adela (Nancy García García), another maid. Antonio is a doctor, he leaves for a conference in Quebec, it becomes clear that Sofía and Antonio's marriage is strained. Antonio returns briefly, but leaves again, saying he is going to Quebec for a few weeks. Cleo and Adela go out to the cinema with their boyfriends, Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) and Ramón (José Manuel Guerrero Mendoza), but Cleo and Fermín decide to rent a room instead. Later, at the cinema, Cleo tells Fermín that she thinks she is pregnant, as the film are seeing is about to end, he leaves saying he needs the bathroom. But he does not return and is nowhere to be found, Sofia shares her concern, and takes her to the hospital where Antonio works, a doctor confirms her pregnancy. Sofía takes Cleo, Adela, and her children to a family friend's place for the New Year holiday. Landowners and the workers mention recent tensions over land in the area, and during the celebrations, a fire erupts in the forest. Everyone helps extinguish it while a man counts down the remaining seconds of 1970 before singing a Norwegian lullaby. Back in the city, Cleo accompanies the children and their grandmother to the cinema to watch a movie. They see Antonio walking out with a young woman, Sofía tries to conceal this from the children, but her second son eavesdrops and learns about it, she tells him not to reveal it his siblings. Through Adela's boyfriend, Cleo finds Fermín at an outdoor martial-arts class, she also attends. Fermín refuses to acknowledge that the baby is his and threatens to beat Cleo and the unborn child if they try to find him again. With the baby almost due, Teresa takes Cleo to buy a crib. On the way, students are gathering to protest, this turns deadly when police commence clubbing, while bands of roving youths randomly shoot at protesters. When a wounded man and a woman run into the store trying to hide, several youths find the man and shoot him dead, another gunman, who points a gun at Cleo, turns out to be Fermín; he glares at her momentarily before running off. Cleo's water breaks, she, Teresa, and their driver try to get to the hospital but are stuck in traffic amid the violent protests. Antonio comes by to reassure Cleo before she reaches the delivery room but makes an excuse to avoid staying. Hearing no heartbeat in Cleo's womb, the doctors take her into surgery, where they deliver a stillborn girl, there are multiple failed attempts to resuscitate the baby. Sofía has a drunken failed attempt to park the family car in the car garage, she buys a narrower car, but plans to take the family on a final trip in the old car to the beaches at Tuxpan. Cleo is brought along as well, Sofía wants to help her cope with her loss. Sofía tells the children that she and their father are separated, and that the holiday was so their father can collect his belongings from their home. At the beach, two of the children are almost carried off by a strong current, despite not knowing how to swim, Cleo wades in to save them. As Sofía and the children affirm their love for Cleo for such selfless devotion, she breaks down and reveals that she had not wanted her baby to be born, they all hug her on the sand. They return home to Roma to find the house reorganised. Cleo prepares a load of washing, telling Adela they have a lot to talk about. Cleo climbs ladders to the rooftop with the clothes to wash before the credits roll. Also starring Diego Cortina Autrey as Toño, Carlos Peralta as Paco, Marco Graf as Pepe, Daniela Demesa as Sofi and Latin Lover as Profesor Zovek. This is definitely an art-house approach to filmmaking from Cuarón, telling a poignant semi-autobiographical story in black-and-white colour, it is a compelling of a marriage falling apart and a live-in maid standing at the heart of the family, the 1970s setting all looks and feels authentic, the camerawork with slow tracking, widescreen shots and striking lighting is effortless but effective, it is a simple, fairly quiet, but most enthralling drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Alfonso Cuarón, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
ROMA,21 December 2018,,"This film has beautiful and thoughtful visuals constantly. The background is very well composed, and there are many times when the background is more interesting than the foreground. The number of extras they have to hire for the background is almost unbelievable!As for the story, it is very very slow in the first half. I was thoroughly bored until the plot finally starts to pick up in the hospital. The intense final half an hour saves the film for me."
ROMA,26 December 2020,7/10,"I have to say that I found the look of this film quite breathtaking - Cuarón's beautifully shot depiction of life in Mexico City in the early 70's is positively laced - almost like a collage of photographs - with stylish imagery. The fact that it is entirely shot in black and white adds richness too. Though set in pretty turbulent times, the story, however is really nothing to write home about. ""Cleo"" (Yalitza Aparicio) provides an authentic performance as the maid for a doctor and his upper-middle class family. She has a special bond with his wife ""Sophia"" ((Marina de Tavira) and we follow their rather intimate and caring relationship that defies the glaring gap in their social classes. There is certainly plenty going on, but as with normal life these things progress slowly - if at all - and, unfortunately, that rendered this a bit of long watch with little development with either plot nor character - after a while I became a bit immune to the cinematography and started to want something a bit more substantial as it ends pretty much as it began... This is a timeless piece of cinema, no doubt - but is it great? Hmmm...!"
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"Mexico City, 1970. An upper-middle-class family live a reasonably average, mundane existence. Their maid, Cleo, is an observer to their domestic existence but she has a life of her own. This is her story.Good drama, directed by Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity, Children of Men, Y tu mamá también). Slow-burning yet very engaging. You get sucked in by Cleo's story and feel with her as her life takes its twists and turns.While it's a great drama, there's some quite funny moments too, and a tongue-in-cheek nod by Cuarón to his own film, Gravity.Superb cinematography, with some shots that could be straight out of a photography exhibit.Not particularly powerful or profound though. I kept waiting for the plot to lead to something that tied everything together, a single event that made all the (what appeared to be) build-up worth while. There is an event towards the end that does give meaning to some of what came before but things then quickly go back to the Act 1-like feel.This all said, this movie is not about providing great profundity or a dramatic conclusion. It's about life and its journey, and what an engaging journey it is."
ROMA,21 December 2018,9/10,"I already want to see ""Roma"" again.It took me a good while to settle into the rhythms of Alfonso Cuaron's critically acclaimed new film, and by the time I did I wanted to go back and start it over to see what I might have missed. A lot comes at the viewer in ""Roma,"" and it's hard to take it all in on a first viewing. No...that's the wrong way to put it. Nothing comes at you -- you have to go after it. That's what makes ""Roma"" unique. Cuaron crams his frame in any given scene with tons of movement and sound, but he shoots almost everything in medium and long shots and chooses to pan his camera rather than insert a lot of edits. The result is you have to decide what you want to look at, and while the main protagonist is in virtually every scene, she's not always necessarily the focal point.That protagonist, by the way, is Cleo, maid to a wealthy family and played in a quiet and quietly devastating performance by Yalitza Aparicio. ""Roma"" is an episodic assemblage of scenes that shows what life is like for Cleo, without big showy emotional moments or much editorializing. She's treated fairly well by the family she works for, but make no mistake -- they rarely let her forget she's their employee. The film is a lot about privilege. The family treats Cleo as one of their own when they feel like it or when it's convenient to, but don't when it's not. She's part of their most intimate moments and they her's, but she'll never really be one of them. She has much to take care of, but nothing of her own to really care for. And there's a big wide world out there, the movie makes clear, that will never include people like Cleo.For a while I was a little disappointed that I wasn't feeling ""Roma"" as much as I wanted to and as much as rapturous reviews led me to believe I would. I was engaged by it, but I didn't feel heavily involved emotionally. But then pretty far into the movie something happens to Cleo, and in that moment I realized how invested I was in how things turned out for her. ""Roma"" sneaks up on you in that way.Grade: A"
ROMA,23 December 2018,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. It is possible for a filmmaker to be ""too close"" to the material when undertaking a story that is somewhat autobiographical. It's also possible, in that situation, for them to catch lightning in a bottle and magic on the screen - and that's exactly what writer/director Alfonso Cuaron has achieved with this look back at his childhood home life. In his follow-up to GRAVITY, for which he won the Best Director Oscar, Mr. Cuaron has dedicated the film to Libo, his family maid/nanny during his youth in Mexico City.Balancing artistry and everyday humanity like few other films, it takes us inside the home of a well-off family: Antonio (Fernando Gredigaga), the father-husband-doctor; Sofia (Marina de Tavira, the only experienced actor in the main cast), the mother-wife; Teresa (Veronica Garcia), the grandmother; the four kids; and two live-in maids, Adela (Nancy Garcia Garcia) and Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio). There is no separating the human emotions from the near-poetic art form of Cuaron's movie. It is unusually quiet, filmed mostly at midrange, and with no musical score. Yet, in the stillness and quiet, so much is happening.The focus here is on Cleo. We hear many times how she is considered part of the family. Of course, she (and we) are reminded that's only true to a certain extent as she is admonished for not cleaning up after the family dog or 'wasting' electricity in her living quarters by using the light in her tiny living quarters at night. First time actress Yalitza Aparicio brings a realism and accessibility to the role as the quiet, perpetually-in-motion maid/caregiver/nanny and she is mesmerizing to watch. Her duties include keeping the house clean, cooking meals, getting the kids up in the morning, getting the kids to/from school, and putting the kids to bed at night. What little scraps of time she has for a personal life are spent going on a date with the cousin of Adela's boyfriend. Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero) is a martial arts fanatic and just prior to their intimacy, he demonstrates his skills to her with a shower rod and literally nothing else.When Antonio and Sofia announce to the kids that dad will be attending a conference in Quebec ""for a few weeks"", we as viewers understand what this means, even though the kids don't. Spending time with his mistress means Sofia and Grandma Teresa must manage the house ... but of course, as always, the bulk of the burden falls to Cleo. When Cleo finds out she's pregnant, Fermin dumps her - leaving both Cleo and Sofia as abandoned by men. It's fascinating to watch this unfold, and contrast how the two women react and cope. The dialogue is secondary to the situations in the film, but there is a great line of dialogue after the men leave: ""We women are always alone.""From a cinematic aspect, Cuaron's film is a delight to watch - reminding at times of the classic Italian and French films of years past. Since his first film in 1995, Cuaron has frequently collaborated with (3 time Oscar winning) cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, but this time Cuaron wears multiple hats as writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor/producer. This is his movie - and his most personal one - from top to bottom. Working closely over the years with Lubezki has influenced Cuaron's camera work ... it's stunning. He uses wide, initially static shots with slow pans - just the way we see in real life. And just like in real life, what he shows us is sometimes mundane and at other times various degrees of emotional. The remarkable opening credit scene could be quickly described as Cleo mopping the dog mess from the garage floor. But of course there is much more. We also see the reflection of planes flying overhead and hear only the sounds of everyday life. It sets the stage for the entire film.This is 1970-71 Mexico City, so in addition to Cleo getting the kids to and from school, the street riots - some quite violent - play a role, as does the incessant sound of dogs barking in the background. Cleo's trip to the delivery room is filmed with real doctors and nurses, while a later trip to the beach offers yet another gut punch ... and both sequences maintain the overall feel of authenticity. Lest you think this is just another ""small scale"" indie, Cuaron goes big a few times - the street riot, a mass martial arts training session, and the beach trip. His film is a story of class and family, making it more than just a thing of celluloid beauty. It also brilliantly captures the essence of life's emotions: the ""bad"" with two men who ignore their responsibilities, the ""normal"" with kids being kids, and the ""good"" with seeing Cleo become such a vital and beloved part of the family."
ROMA,23 January 2019,8/10,"Set in the 1970s in Mexico City, this movie follows a maid in a middle class family. Two major events affect the family. The father leaves and the maid gets knocked up. There are some surprises here. One of the nice things in this movie is the affection show to Cleo by the family. The villains here are the men both rich and poor. The baby daddy is a violent scumbag and the father of the family is an irresponsible whipped douche bag. The filming is absorbing - and explicit. The matter of fact was things are shown is refreshing. The tragic parts are better because of it - not sentimental, just realistic.One fault is that I wish it wasn't made in black and white - it's hard to sense some things when it's not in color.Best Picture? Not sure. Best actress? she's very believable but don't know if there was that much acting involved - it was more the story that 's good."
ROMA,11 December 2018,,"Set in '70's Mexico City, Roma is a reverie by Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity) evoking the period and the lifestyle of an upper-middle-class family and its servants. Although it is not a lyrical reminiscence, parts of its production represent levels of happiness or sadness without shouting the states.Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young servant in a doctor's generous home in the Roma section, quietly loves the four children but watches as his wife becomes aware that he will not return from an alleged research job in Canada. As Cleo has her own man problems--the father of her soon due child has left her-the director suggests women are alone in this world, and it would appear, have only each other to rely on.For the director reminiscer, the times are changing, just as students and police clash, a female doctor is Carla's obstetrician, and his wife finds substantial work to support the family. Meanwhile Carla loves the children, is a father substitute, and growing friend for the mother.Cuaron laces his mise en scene with common symbols such as the dog feces constantly on the regularly-scrubbed garage floor and blinds as bars. Dogs roaming throughout the story provide the antidote to the immaculate residence, a sign that reality bites, despite the comfort of a home high above the living standards of most Mexicans.Throughout the writer/director presents images reinforcing the hidden danger in modern living: martial parades through narrow streets, water down drains, ocean surf almost taking half a family, hospitals so antiseptic as to be surreal, a lover threatening, a Ford Galaxy scraped by too tight a garage, among other representations. Cuaron takes the simple daily life and infuses it with figurative dangers.Cuaron's world when he grew up becomes more Darwinian with each recollection. Roma, however, is a beautiful evocation of a bygone era by a director who knows how to combine reality with art. One of the best films of 2018."
ROMA,20 December 2018,9/10,"I must say that the latest work from director Alfonso Cuaron called ""Roma"" is well done as the film is based on his own experiences and memories growing up in Mexico City as a kid. The film is touching and heartfelt as it's common themes that involve life like connection, change, attachment, sorrow, loss, and love is something everyone can relate to. The film done in black and white and reading the subtitles will hold your viewing interest along with the story. Set in the early to mid 1970's in Mexico City it's a wide open look at the life of a middle class family who struggle with everyday things and eventually a broken home will come out of these struggles, however the wild card and backbone that holds the family together is the young maid Cleo(in a strong performance from Yalitza Aparicio). Along the way Cleo too is faced with her own problems of loss and her life suffers sorrow and change. Still thru all of the storms that both the family and Cleo weather at the end a bond of love, connection, and attachment, is never broken. Overall this movie makes you appreciate family, and love proving that connection and attachment shines thru even when change, loss, and sorrow happens."
ROMA,10 February 2019,9/10,"Not sure I'm qualified to review this as this took me three full weekends to finally complete it.While an overall great film, the best part of this experience was how beautiful it is. If this wins Best Picture, great. Director, Actress, wonderful. But, it's a full-on SIN if this doesn't win for Best Cinematography.I loved this movie. It felt real, human and true. This is an absolute love-letter to a youth. But above all, again, and I'll probably say it again: it's simply stunning.The movie is set in 1970-1 during a political battle, but let's forget all that. It's really about a housekeeper that holds a broken family together when tragedy hits time and again. True tears were shed when the film wraps and with good reason.This movie is for true cinema lovers. It's so breathtaking, so intimate, you'll be hard-pressed to replicate the vision.***Final thoughts: Thanks to my friend, Kevin of Fat Guys at the Movies fame for finally explaining why ""graphic nudity"" always refers to a man's junk. It's much harder to show a woman's genitalia, so to speak."
ROMA,23 April 2019,7/10,"Roma is a lot like spying on the neighbors through binoculars. You see what goes on, but you have little sense of the inner lives of the characters.The movie follows a young maid through her life caring for a somewhat dysfunctional family. We see her clean, chat with her co-workers, date, and encounter misfortune, but we never really know who she is. The movie reminded me a little of how I saw the world as a child, with the lives of those around me somewhat opaque. The difference is that while I didn't see the world clearly, I had the focal point of me, while this movie is never quite about anything.This distanced approach words best in a stunning, disorientating hospital scene, but in spite of some good moments, like the appearance of an eccentric martial arts teacher, the film generally left me dissatisfied.The movie is most notable for its stunning black and white cinematography. The opening scene, which is nothing but water on tiled stones, is truly remarkable.I thought this movie didn't deserve the wild critical acclaim and awards it received, although my girlfriend was far more enthusiastic. I would say it was worth watching but if you don't watch it, no great loss."
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,"The story of Cleo and her 'family' might hit a sensitive chord for many viewers who grew up not just in Mexico but in any Third-World country, maybe not just in the 70s but probably the 80s or early 90s.By no means am I depriving the story from its cultural core but it was Roger Ebert who said: ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone."" Still, it's not just about the characters, I could relate to the context as well on a superficial but still deeply personal level.Coming from a middle-class family of Morocco, we also had these girls who came from poorer backgrounds (generally rural areas) and whose treatment would look a bit like slavery from a European/""Western"" standpoint. The term wouldn't be appropriate though as they were paid, certainly not mistreated and in most cases were considered like members of the family. Not all the ladies of the house treated them with respect but they were often loved by the kids as sister-figures or even surrogate mothers. I was practically raised by the same 'dada' from the age of 4, she dressed me, woke me up, cleaned me till I was 8 (my daughter does it alone since she's 3) and well, she was part of my life and I miss her a lot.I could relate to the story of Cleo and I was glad that the film didn't take the predictable ""clash of the classes"" path: having her fired, being rejected or ending as a prostitute in some brothel of Mexico City... Cuaron is above these tiresome archetypes and his intention is clearly to take the opportunity of a nostalgic voyage through his childhood to show people with a strong capability of caring and being empathetic regardless of their origins or social backgrounds. And Cleo, played with mesmerizing naturalness by Yalitza Aparicio, is obviously a girl to inspire the very feelings she exudes: she loves the children she saw growing up since the cradle, she's devoted to her ""Signora"" Sofia, played by Marina de Tavira, and she values her luck to be part of that world... she knows she could have been unluckier.It's also interesting that Cleo isn't conventionally good-looking, not in a glamorous Hollywood sense anyway, and her petite frame and youthful face illuminated with a wide smile accentuate her vulnerability. She incarnates a sort of third world within the third world, like an extra layer of fragility making her the perfect target for the kind of troubles no upper class European looking girl would get herself into. Though the film is overarched by the social and political context of Mexico circa 1970-71, I didn't feel like Cuaron tried to make some social commentary, maybe it's just a character study of a woman who could only depend on the kindness of strangers, like Blanche Dubois, but is able to find some inner strength to overcome a blind (but not malicious) adversity if not triumph over it.And indeed, in her harrowing journey (that doesn't follow any pattern of cinematic predictability), it's less in what happens to her than the reactions it inspires. The film is less driven by plot points but the way people react and reactions to their reactions... or non-reactions for that matter. There is an interesting scene where a Karate master shows a trick that looks extremely easy until it's done with closed eyes, I don't know if it was supposed to symbolize one of the film's underlying messages, but it's true that many things that happen are due to people's obliviousness, carelessness or lack of empathy. And near the end, both Cleo and Sofia realize they had more in common than they would have thought, adversity strikes everyone... only in different ways. Blind again, but not malicious.What I liked in ""Roma"", besides its realism, is the fact that it doesn't just try to depict a slice of life but Life with a major L, providing sights often suggested but rarely shown in the movies. Indeed, the film contains many graphic sequences including a naked male body (and I'm sorry to say that it's more distracting for me than a woman's... maybe because the thing ""moves""... chuckles) and one that shouldn't be spoiled but that had me almost gasping with tears because it was the moment where many aspects of an editing that demanded some patience from us finally paid off, and I knew I had to expect a high spot of emotionality sometime in the film. Cuaron's ""Roma"" (whatever the title means) is truly daring by showing life and death with the same clinical detachment from his lenses, one that also shows in the climactic scene, hinted by the poster.Now, I wanted to give he film a 10 because it has reached a cinematic level of perfection I rarely found in a movie but sometimes its beauty just feels so deliberate it becomes sophisticated. The film benefits from Alfonso Cuaron's perfect command of the camera (we're obviously talking of the Oscar-winner for Best Cinematography and maybe Best Director) but the cinematography tends to steal the story's thunder and compromises the film's attempt to be a realistic portrait of a Mexican's slice of life in the 70s in an atmosphere of love devoid of the cynicism we get from today's dysfunctional families. The children in the film are not only adorable but played with an authentic simplicity and since so many directors said it was a nightmare to direct children, Cuaron deserves a credit for that too.So It's precisely because the story is so well told and well acted that I wished it wouldn't be so well directed... though I approve the choice of the black-and-white for no other reason that it gives the film a sort of dreamy aura fitting its nostalgia.Overall, ""Roma"" is a great film with a few haunting moments."
ROMA,4 December 2019,7/10,"'Roma (2018)' revels in the kind of mundane reality that most movies purposefully seek to avoid. It isn't really about anything specific, other than its central character. As a partially autobiographical piece, it surrounds itself with the sort of details only someone directly involved with its inspiratory events would notice. In this way, it almost feels like an 'inside joke'; a personal exploration of an intimately nostalgic time-period only important to those actually involved with it. Still, it uses its insular events as a way to comment on the social unrest of 1970s Mexico. One of its more powerful scenes involves the heroes caught in the middle of the infamous 'Corpus Christi Massacre'. This comes when the movie is at its most intense and it's a genuinely compelling sequence. Shortly after, the piece delivers what has to be one of the most heartbreaking moments in recent cinema. It's affecting, for sure. Most of the time, though, the flick feels kind of distant, almost like an impartial observer. The floaty, unmotivated camera-work compounds this; it sort of seems to exist in isolation to the characters, unaware and indifferent to what they're doing in front of it. It all feels quite cold and, prior to the previously mentioned heartbreaker, there's never a real sense of emotional connection. The feature isn't dull, just detached. It's incredibly well-made and its performances are almost perfectly realist. Sometimes, the pacing sags and the story is too precise for its own good. These issues aren't deal-breakers but they do have an impact on the experience's overall effect. Generally, the affair is well-conceived and relatively entertaining. It's enjoyable enough for what it is, elevated by standout behind-the-scenes work and some truly impactful segments. 7/10"
ROMA,13 March 2019,9/10,"As I belong to a specie in danger of extinction - those who have not yet subscribed to Netflix -, I had to wait for a rare public screening of Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's film 'Roma', which almost won the Academy Award in the Best Film category, in order to form an opinion to myself. I'm trying to avoid discussing the 'legitimacy' of Netflix and of the other 'private' distribution channels. I have an opinion, but it does not matter now that I have seen the movie in a cinema. I am trying to judge 'Rome' by the same criteria that I use for any other film, asking the same questions about the way the movie created empathy, taught me new things, impressed me aesthetically and/or I had fun watching it, disconnected from the problems of everyday life. My appreciation according to these criteria is that 'Roma' is a good film, but not a masterpiece.Inspired largely by the director's real biography, 'Roma' has as main heroine Clio, one of the two maids in a middle-class family home in the neighborhood that gives the name of the film in Mexico City. The story takes place in 1970 in a world that is a collection of contrasts: the neighborhood is inhabited by relatively wealthy people but we see a lot of poverty on the streets, the family house is well maintained by servants but signs of decay are present everywhere, the marriage in the family itself is about to fall apart despite the four children. Servants are much more than just servants, Clio is also the caretaker and the confident of the kids and is considered a part of the family in many ways, but class differences are always reminded. The story slowly moves away from the bourgeois house and the family cell, gradually the circles of characters and locations widens, it first includes the social milieu with which the maids are in contact, then the extended family and its social circle, until it includes a panoramic view of several sectors of the Mexican society. The crisis whose symptoms we watched at the private level is more general, it is the crisis of a society haunted by corruption, violence and class differences. 'Roma' makes a zoom-out from being a family film to a social and political fresco.Clio is a character that viewers of this film will not easily forget. The director's love for the woman who inspired the role, a woman who actually still lives with his family, is obvious. The performance of the young Mexican debutante actress Yalitza Aparicio is gorgeous. It's worth watching her in the extraordinary scene at the maternity and then you may ask yourself as I did what it means for a woman to play such a scene. It's not the only memorable scene, there are more in the movie. Alfonso Cuarón has also signed the cinematography and he knows his craftsmanship, combining scenes with camera moving in parallel with the characters, panoramic frames that represent true human and social compositions, long frames, or short frames sequences. The black and white film fits very well and the light is very well used.Besides many qualities, the film also some flaws. Above all the length - some scenes are artificially extended, others seem to try to say too explicitly 'this is an art movie', for example the introductory scene that includes the generic. I wrote a few weeks ago that 'Green Book' seems to have been made with the Academy Awards in mind. So, I think, was 'Roma'. Alfonso Cuarón is well acquainted with the American cinema industry, he has worked in Hollywood and has attended several Academy Awards ceremonies. Even the choice he made to distribute the film on Netflix may have been deliberate, the debate between the camps of the opponents and of the fans of streaming channels will soon end with the victory of the latter, and 'Roma' has skillfully used this momentum. If it had been distributed in cinemas as a Mexican film, it would not have been distributed to larger audiences in the US and around the world, and would not have attracted the attention of the Academy members except maybe for the prize of the best foreign film. So it won (on merit) two more awards (best director, best cinematography) and was very close to winning the big one. It did not succeed, eventually the majority of the jury members preferred the 'Green Book' - a much more conventional film and safer choice. Cuarón and his colleagues can console themselves with the fact that many viewers who have seen both movies believe that 'Roma' is a better film. Including me."
ROMA,23 December 2018,8/10,"I'm often weary of films with tremendous amounts of praise or build up before I get a chance to go see it. Unfortunately, Roma never managed to get to a theater within 50 miles of me, I finally gave it a shot via Netflix. It's still a movie I would have rather seen in a theater setting, but the intimacy of this story certainly works on a small screen as well. Alfonso Cuaron's follow up to his Oscar winning (and one of my favorite films of all time) Gravity, is an emotional rollercoaster and displays a master at work in cinematography and framing. But more importantly, it takes us through a year-long journey in the life of a maid for a family in Mexico City during the 1970's. Cleo, played by non-actress Yalitza Aparicio, is the aforementioned maid and essentially the second parent figure for the middle class family, which goes a good chunk of the film without a father. The only criticism I have for the film is that there isn't a defined arc that Cleo goes on, or at least not the traditional one, so upon first viewing it takes a while to latch on to her character, but it really is a beautiful representation of a slice of life type of story. It doesn't feel like a movie, rather, we are just a fly on the wall for a year of Cleo's life. Whether it be something joyful or tragic, we're there for the ride. What Cuaron managed to give us a mixture of both in the most beautiful way possible.8.7/10"
ROMA,3 December 2018,,"The praise for this is undoubtedly deserved, as it's hard to find flaws with this immersive, visually and emotionally powerful tale"
ROMA,25 September 2020,8/10,"The opening shot of a puddle created by a maid mopping, one that soon reflects a plane soaring overhead in the sky, seems to tell us that we're going to see these events from the perspective of someone at the bottom looking up, inverted if you will. It's mirrored in the closing shot before the credits roll.I love how Cuarón wrong-footed me with this film. I didn't know much about it going in, but as it established a couple of young maids working in the house of an affluent family with kids, I thought I was going to see mistreatment as part of a statement on class. We do see the conditions of the wealthy family contrasted to how the maids exist in their little room, as well as what a slum looks like, so it's not as if class isn't explored at all here, and we also see it in small moments like the maid having to stand while the mother and her kids sit, clearly always the low rung on the totem pole. However, the servant is generally treated rather well, even when she unexpectedly gets pregnant, though it's clear she's completely vulnerable to her employer letting her go for it. If anything, the film seems to put more of a mirror up to how men of either class can treat women poorly, and perhaps the most telling line is ""No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone.""The camera work is fantastic throughout the film, but never better than in the sequence out in the waves at Tuxpan. There is such restraint in the storytelling from Alfonso Cuarón, something so realistic here, and the film has probably the best delivery room scenes I've ever seen. Yalitza Aparicio is brilliant as the young woman, oozing authenticity and an enigmatic, Mona Lisa smile. Did I really get to know her character? I'm not sure, but maybe I got to know quite a bit of her through her actions. It's humbling to see her simply moving through her duties without a hint of duplicity or ego, which make the film's big scenes and its quieter moments all the more emotional. She's a beautiful person, and it's a beautiful film."
ROMA,15 December 2018,8/10,"This one creeps up on you, but it's worth the effort to stay with it for the climactic emotional wallops. Granted, for much of its languorous two-and-a-quarter hours, ""Roma"" appears to be another in a long line of staid domestic dramas--the sort of foreign-language pictures that seem to frequently garner some critical praise around awards season, and this one appears all the more artsy with its desaturated black-and-white look. There's the focus on the lower end of class stratification, with the protagonist Cleo, an indigenous Mexican, as a live-in maid to an educated middle-class family of presumably some European ancestry. While the family of her employers struggles from the abandonment of their father, so does Cleo face her own problems being disavowed by the man who impregnated her. Meanwhile, the narrative occasionally cues us into the political turmoil of its setting in early-1970s Mexico, with the poverty, land seizures and redistribution, and the massacre of student protesters. While much of this is of some interest, especially for offering a semi-autobiographical account of the childhood of one of today's premiere filmmakers, Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men"" (2006) and ""Gravity"" (2013), among others), the heart of ""Roma"" is the dramatic arc of Cleo.Characteristic of Cuarón's oeuvre, ""Roma"" is visually splendid, if often times contemplative, as well. The affect of the story seems to necessitate the tendency for long steady takes, but there are some impressive and even ironic compositions, which are heightened by the tendency of framing in long shots. One of my favorites is the shot of the women and children exhausted while on a supposed vacation, abandoned by their men, as a wedding is celebrated in the background, even though a sequence such as the one in the shop during the street demonstrations may be more technically intriguing. There's also all of the business with the cars and the gated garage filled with dog poop. The significance of the repeated views of airplanes, however, somewhat eludes me for the time being (although I suppose it's a visual representation having something to do with the intimate narrative focus within a broader societal context). The water motif is more obvious, and the parallel tracking shots stand out.As far as an insight into the presentation of the filmmaker, as offered by himself, the self-reflexive scenes of movies-within-the-movie may be the most illuminating. Surely, most will be reminded by ""Marooned"" (1969) of Cuarón's own space picture, which earned him an Oscar, ""Gravity."" While that one went so outward that it left the planet, ""Roma"" may be of comparable innovation despite focusing inward."
ROMA,16 December 2018,,"Stitching together memories from his own upbringing to carve a deeply personal & empathetic love letter to the people who raised him, Roma finds Alfonso Cuarón drawing on his childhood to create an absorbing portrait of domestic life amidst the political turmoil of 1970s Mexico.Set in the titular neighbourhood of Mexico City during the 1970s, the story of Roma chronicles a year in the life of a young live-in housekeeper to a middle-class family. Through her eyes, the film captures events that end up transforming her life as well as that of the family she works for.Written, co-produced, photographed, co-edited & directed by Alfonso Cuarón, the film appears to be headed nowhere during the first half but once we enter the final hour, everything starts to come together piece by piece, all subplots converge towards a single outcome, and much of it begins to make sense.Shot on location, photographed in black n white, and utilising set pieces that evoke the depicted era, the film exudes authenticity from start to finish. The camera takes everything in with its smooth panning, and narrates the tale through a series of long takes that become more challenging & immersive as plot progresses.Coming to the performances, Roma is led by Yalitza Aparicio, a newcomer with no formal training in acting nor any prior acting experience. And yet, under Cuarón's supervision, she delivers an emotionally resonant performance that helps elevate this film to a better height. The supporting cast play their part responsibly but it is Aparicio who impresses the most.On an overall scale, Roma explores Mexico's social stratum, domestic strife & political turbulence through the prism of one family, and is Alfonso Cuarón's most personal film since Y Tu Mamá También. An ode to his homeland, to people who raised him, and to events that shaped his life, Cuarón's passion project is realised in vivid detail but given its near-universal praise, Roma does fall short on expectations."
ROMA,20 February 2019,6/10,"It's interesting that after directing films like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban & Gravity that Alfonso Cuarón would make such a simple slice-of-life story. And even though it's intentionally slow and uneventful, you start to feel like you're a part of the family-much like a live-in maid-and become affected by the small moments. Roma feels like it came from a school film festival, made by a very talented cinematographer."
ROMA,5 January 2019,10/10,"There is no shortage of good reviews for this film, and I'm going to add to them quickly. But I'll start by noting there are a number of reviewers who did not like the movie, and I think it was often for the same reasons I liked it.First of all, the black and white cinematography is startling. It gives and gives. Not only is it fluid and almost tender, panning in consistent ways slowly across this Mexican world, but it has so much detail (70mm film detail) that you can look and look and keep finding. Almost as if you were there. And yet there are those who just don't like the restraint of black and white. Would this have worked in color? Of course, in a different way. But the difference would be critical--it would try to make it more ""real"" rather than a portrait of a young woman's world seen from a distance.A distance of time, and of shifting memories. As much as this film is quasi-documentary, you never once think it's truly a documentary. It has too much cinematic beauty. So you enter that world of cinema that is so wonderful, a created world (not a re-created one). And you are then in the hands of the moviemakers.Director (and cinematographer, and writer, and producer, and co-editor) Alfonso Cuarón is clearly making what is ""his"" film here, though the acting is also a key to the success overall. But in planning what to show and what to emphasize in this young maid's life, he finds something that isn't autobiographical, but rather simply perceptive and honest and empathetic. We feel for all young women in their roles as servants to the rich, with the good and bad that goes with it.A great achievement, and one for film buffs and lovers of older films above all. I know Cuarón is one of those, and I hope you are, too, because this will make your day."
ROMA,27 August 2021,7/10,Visually it's a great movie. It was good as a story.It can be a bit boring for some people. Watching Mexico of those times was a different experience.
ROMA,28 January 2019,8/10,"RomaThe upside to being a servant in America is you never understand what your boss is yelling at you.Unfortunately for the maid in this drama, her employer speaks perfect Spanish.Introvert Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) works for Mrs. Sofia (Marina de Tavira) maintaining her family home in the heart of Mexico City's richest neighbourhood as well as helping her raise her four children while their father is away on business. The family dynamic begins to shift, however, when Sofia's husband's absences begin to grow longer and a deadbeat rebel fighter impregnates Cleo.Slow yet startling, subtle yet spirited, writer/director Alfonso Cuarón lovingly retells the tales of his affluent childhood through the eyes of his family's improvised maid in this black-and-white Netflix import that is beautifully shot against the social unrest of 1970s.Best of all, when you clean up after rich kids you know exactly where they hide their allowance.

ROMA,9 June 2019,8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed ""Roma"" (2018) for a few things - superb directing and amazing cinematography as well as very good central performance - those are highlights of the entire movie. So is it enough to call it great movie? On one hand, pure craftsmanship - ""Roma"" sure is a great movie, but its story wasn't that much involving for me to be honest. It was a bit hard to get into it, because i did not relate to a main character, nor her life, nor her struggles (except the ones that were universal).Overall, ""Roma"" can be a difficult movie to watch on some boring evening because of a story which is obviously biographical, based on a memories of a master movie maker Alfonso Cuarón - one of my favorite. On the other hand this movie is so well done that i kinda involved me, despite that main character and a world she lived in were not relevant for me. Its a good movie to see it once mainly because of phenomenal cinematography and directing."
ROMA,28 October 2018,8/10,"At around the 100th minute, Roma made me gasp. And then it stole a tiny tear from me. The story of a singleton, who works as a full-time caretaker and maid for an upper middle-class family in Mexico City in the year 1971 is what all the dictionaries around the world should change their definition of the word 'poignant' to. There is no other way to describe what director Alfonso Cuaron has carved in monochrome in Roma which is a film about everything, with an unpredictable and neat narration, somber music, and above all, a never-ending string of beautiful elements to look at. I have this theory that even if you don't watch Roma to understand what it tries to convey and just look at the flowy cinematography and the visually loud frames in motion in front of you, you will feel a peculiar energy transferring into your body. An energy to face the world like the protagonist Cleo faces (or tries to face) in this tragic drama that is built with so much attention to details that I would need an essay to describe the subtexts and small symbolic references that the film makes to send across a message about human nature and relationships, social hierarchy, politics, and violence. Roma made me gasp, laugh, and consider - and it does so in such a random order that you will find it difficult to realize that it's just a film. The running time might remind you that, but let's not talk about it because it is probably the only thing that will prevent you from feeling the film.

ROMA,2 January 2019,,"Even though nominations haven't yet been announced, ""Roma"" is currently ranking second, after ""A star is born"", in the betting odds for Oscar's Best Picture. And, yes, this is talking about Best Motion Picture, NOT Best Foreign Language Film.""Roma"", shot in heartbreakingly beautify black-and-white, is one of those rare gems that you may not register strong feeling about while watching. But subsequently, it grows on you until it feels almost like a personal experience.The title ""Roma"" is just the name of the district where the story takes place, in Mexico City in the early 70s. The narrative is episodic, along the line of a-slice-in-life genre, covering one year in the protagonist's life. It is, mind you, not one of those ""nothing happens at all"" movies. The key events are familiar - unplanned pregnancy, infidelity, growing up, among other things. The somewhat ordinary everyday story is told against the macro backdrop of a country in political turmoil.Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is a young woman, on of a staff of three (the other two being the cook and the driver) serving an upper-middle-class family in a large two-story house. The Caucasian household of seven comprises the well-educated couple, a grandmother, and four children (three boys and a girl, ranging from post-toddler to early teen). Cleo's job description, if there was one, might have run several pages. What we notice right away is the affectionate relationship she has with the children. She is a servant, but also one that in many ways is treated like a member of the family. When she gets pregnant from a casual relationship (the cad simply vanishes upon hearing the news) and, trembling, asks if she is going to be fired, her kindly employer takes her to see a reputable doctor instead. While her problem is taken care of, it soon becomes apparent that the role-model family she has become so attached to has it own problems brewing.The beauty of the story is in the telling. Quite often, busy/noisy backdrops are used to frame the central action. On the other hand, closeups are rarely used. The aggregate effect is a remarkably natural narration of a year in Cleo's life, with accent on being naturally realistic rather than melodramatic. Very gradually but surely, the audience's empathy is built, so that in a couple of emotional scenes towards the closing, it is ever so deeply felt.To-date, 8 foreign language films have received nominations for Best Picture in Oscar but none has won. 9th may just be a lucky number."
ROMA,30 July 2020,7/10,"This film has lots and lots of spinning cameras. It is used to good effect but can seem overused or distracting at times. Although cinematography is the film's strong point, the pacing is definitely not, as it really drags on at times without exploring much of the character's lives beyond what we have already seen. It picks up over halfway through the film and it redeems its slow start with an impactful portrayal."
ROMA,26 March 2019,9/10,"You wouldn't know it, but director Alfonso Cuaron has being paying homage to one of the women that helped raise him as a child throughout his career. This woman, Liboria Rodriguez, is clearly close to the filmmaker's heart, and he cast her in cameos in a few of his films, including 2001's Y Tu Mama Tambien. Now, Rodriguez is the topic of her very own film, Roma, Cuaron's ode to the network of women that were key to his upbringing in 1970s Mexico. Of late, Cuaron has mainly focused on big-budget movies for Hollywood, such as last year's Gravity, the riveting thriller Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter film of the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban, but he has dialled things way down for his latest. Roma is about as small-scale as you can get, focusing on a humble maid working for a middle-class family in Mexico City, but complete with the director's trademark dizzying camerawork and gorgeous cinematography.In a debut appearance, Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo, a maid working in an affluent household in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood in Mexico City. The four children are incredibly affectionate towards her, scrambling for a cuddle when they sit down to watch television, and parents Sofia (Marina de Tavira) and Antonio (Fernando Grediaga) clearly rely on her as they get on with their busy lifestyles. But there are cracks starting to appear in the marriage. Antonio squeezes his bulky, show-off car into the narrow garage every night, hinting at the father's growing dismay with his surroundings, and he quickly grows frustrated when Cleo fails to clean up the dog s**t littering the patio. However, as happy and content as she may appear on the surface, Cleo has to deal with her own problems when she falls pregnant to a martial-arts obsessed military type who is nowhere to be found. With her employers' marriage falling apart and a baby on the way, Cleo struggles to juggle attempting to hold the family together for the sake of the children, and the idea of starting life as a single mother.Trying to summarise the plot of Roma is no easy task. This is a slice of life plucked from Cuaron's own memories, shot in luscious black-and-white that almost feels like remembering the past through an old photograph. Roma is about class, politics and poverty, but mainly it wishes to tell a story of an unseen hero whose stories are rarely told. It's a film of moments that leave a mark despite how inconsequential they appear, very similar to the neo-Realist films of Satyajit Ray and Robert Rossellini, somehow telling a story that feels vast and epic in scale while keeping the focus on an incredibly personal level. Cuaron is a true craftsman, and, with regular collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki unavailable, actually steps up to the role of cinematographer. This compromise actually worked out in the film's favour, as you couldn't imagine anyone else recreating a time and place from one's childhood with such detail and intimacy. Liboria Rodriguez is clearly a huge inspiration in Cuaron's life, and here the director steps aside to shine the spotlight on her and many other that disappear into the crowd. It was a surprise to learn that Roma would be distributed through Netflix, but after seeing the film, it's hard to believe that any studios would take a gamble on what is essentially a collection of memories played out on screen. But what beautiful memories they are."
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"Quite simply a considered and beautifully bound together work of art, Oscar winning director Alfonso Cuarón's black and white love letter to his home country of Mexico is a stunning achievement, a film that at first seems like a small and intimate character study but slowly and assuredly becomes so much more as it encapsulates issues and themes that still resonate strongly today.Named after a famous district of Mexico city, Roma is set in the early 1970's and focusses its attention on newcomer Yalitza Aparicio's young maid Cleo, who finds herself trying to maintain a household around a sad and depressive break-up all the while dealing with the fact she is soon to be a mother herself, to a baby of a father who wants nothing to do with her.It's far from the most original set-up but thanks to Cuarón's masterful delivery of the subject matter and material, Roma quickly shows off why it has been hailed as a genuine threat at next year's Oscar's ceremony.Magnificently captured by Cuarón, who acts as his very own D.O.P here, Roma, with its largely improvised script and cast of unrecognisable faces, is the type of film that over its 130 minutes will begin to feel like something akin to a documentary as we are well and truly transported to this very particular time and place, Roma becoming the type of film that you can smell, feel and touch as Cuarón brings his tale to vivid life.Accompanied by the sounds and eccentricities of the vividly unique country (Roma is completely bereft of any musical score), Cuarón's personal film is made alive thanks to its astounding sound and production design as we follow Cleo on a yearlong journey through the turbulent period of Mexico's history.It's one of the most immersive and all encapsulating experiences you will have all year and one that's deserving of a cinema visit if you can find a local screening, it's as if you yourself are walking the streets, a fly on the wall in these households as Cuarón brings us into his passionately recreated world.Roma really is the work of a director operating at the top of his powers, no shot feels wasted, each one framed and shot in a way that comes from the mind of a director who knows exactly what he wants and how he wants it to be and after a run that has included Children of Men, Gravity and now this, it's safe to say that Cuarón is one of the greatest filmmaker's working today.If there was nit-picking to be done with Cuarón awards calibre film, it would be that the film starts off particularly slow, with some viewers likely to be wondering what the point of the whole exercise is but if you can stick it out, Roma morphs steadily into an emotionally engaging and at times heart wrenchingly powerful film, with a last act that is up there with the best filmmaking seen over the last few years.Final Say -Look out A Star is Born! Roma has stamped itself as an official Oscar heavyweight, as Cuarón's film is not only the best film to be released through the Netflix production house, but one of the year's most unforgettable and magical examples of movie-making.4 ½ martial arts showcases out of 5"
ROMA,23 December 2018,10/10,"Roma (2018) was written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón. I find it incredible that Cuarón also did the cinematography. (It's amazing to consider a director who actually operates the camera.)Despite the title, this is a Mexican movie. (Roma is a district in Mexico City.) The protagonists are sophisticated members of the upper middle class. There's one exception--the lead role of Cleo is played by Yalitza Aparicio. Cleo is the maid. She comes from a poor rural area, and is clearly of indigenous heritage. (In fact, the actor Yalitza Aparicio is, indeed from a poor rural indigenous village.)The movie actually has two plots. One is of a upper middle class family in crisis. The other is the Dirty War carried out by the Mexican government in 1971. (The movie is set in 1971.) When we hear the term ""Dirty War,"" we think of Argentina. However, Mexico had its own terrible Dirty War, and it is featured prominently in the film.This is a great movie. The plot is wonderful, the direction is wonderful, and the cinematography is wonderful. Who could believe that one person could carry this off? Well, not only one person. The other person is Yalitza Aparicio.Aparicio is a superb actor. As director Cuarón has said, ""Without Cleo, the movie doesn't work."" I would add that without Aparicio, Cleo wouldn't work. It's impossible to believe that Roma was her first movie, but it's true. I'm certain that she'll become a star.The movie itself has a very high IMDb rating of 8.3. As soon as it reaches 25,000 ratings, it will be in the IMDb top 250 movies of all time.We saw the film at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work better on the large screen, but is still worth watching on a small screen. Don't miss it!"
ROMA,1 March 2019,7/10,"When it came to cinematography, the movie was beautiful. The choice of the black and white shooting was really clever and it gave the movie a sense of homemade family videos, like the girl was part of the family and yet she was an outsider, as the plot suggested. However, even though the story was powerfull and the performances really good, it lacked intensity and a climax at least. Actually, it was kind of flat. So, 7 out of 10."
ROMA,14 December 2018,10/10,"Typically I would wait a few hours to gather my thoughts and write my review. Not this time. There's no need to even doubt the only word that describes this film. Perfection. Absolutely magnificent. There is not a single flaw to be had in this delicately crafted drama. Honestly, I'm slightly overwhelmed with emotions. This is the reason why Alfonso Cuarón is, in my opinion, the greatest director working today. This is why world cinema far exceeds the limitations of Hollywood clichés. This, is pure cinematic bliss. A masterwork in filmmaking. A house maid to a wealthy family soon becomes pregnant and must cope with the responsibility that rapidly approaches. A story primarily focusing on family, thematically conveying unity and faith in times of chaos and conflict. Where both revolutions and arguments are parallels to each other, causing rifts in communities and families. It's a drama entirely focused on a servant who views her employer's family as her own. She's willing to risk her life for them. She looks out for them, cares for them and consistently thinks about them. The inner turmoil which occurs when she unexpectedly becomes pregnant soon manifests into regret, worrying about losing the family she currently has. It's a drama filled with love and tragedy, one that will evoke an array of emotions. Happiness, hatred and sorrow. This plethora allows you to become absorbed in the monochromatic world that Cuarón presents. It transfixes you until the very last scene, pulling you closer word by word. 'Gravity' is my favourite film of all time. Cuarón has had a perfect career. But Roma, well, it might just be his finest work to date. It's a tale filled with personality. You can sense how personal this story meant to him, through his gorgeous editing and cinematography. His childhood memories come to life by utilising captivating camera techniques. Sublime tracking shots, precise panning and his renowned one take scenes. You can't afford to blink. Not even once.Aparicio's performance should not be missed. Not for one second. Incredibly nuanced yet irrefutably powerful. She brings humanity into her character, creating an achingly beautiful individual in the process. Everything about this drama felt real. No Hollywood clichés, no moments of absurdity. Just sheer visceral drama that captures the equilibrium of what it is to be part of a family. Every shot was mesmerising. Every word spoken waa felt. I just can't. I can't. Seriously shaken to the core with how perfect this film was. There is a moment in this film where conflict breaks out on a street. The proceeding twenty minutes was possibly the most emotionally distressing period of time I've witnessed in film. Ever. Cleo is so well developed that I started to cry during the third act. Yes, there were moments of devastation. But I cried because my passion for film as a medium just took over. I couldn't control myself. Cuarón took every aspect of filmmaking and turned it into a work of cinematic art. He understands film in its entirety. Roma not only gets a perfect rating. Not only does it becomes the best of the year by far. It becomes one of the best films I have ever seen."
ROMA,9 February 2019,10/10,"Cuaron continues making some of the most emotionally engrossing and visually intentional films in the modern climate. In Roma, he treats the Mexican experience (and in the macro, all of humanity) like a Monet painting or a marching band. From afar, things seem beautiful and in order. But the closer you get, the more chaotic it appears, though no less beautiful. Achingly gorgeous, unexpectedly funny, and clearly personal, it's the only 2018 film that truly wrecked me by the end."
ROMA,18 March 2019,9/10,"The (gorgeously photographed) final end credits give a mention worthy special thanks: ""Por Libo"". Libo was the nanny of this very director, who was inspired to make this picture about her, based on the love his nanny gave to him as a young boy.However charming this ""tribute to a nanny"" might seem, I had some doubts beforehand HOW this director could make a story interesting (and not tedious), when it was just about an oridinary housemaid. Yet he succeeded brilliantly in mesmirising me from beginning to end anyway. How did he do it? Well, HOW he did it, is what earned him oscars for best direction and photography. More about the good later on, first the bad, although there is very little bad...The bad; the leading character isnt very charismatic. Ofcourse the leading character isnt suppose to be charismatic, because she is just playing the part of a simple housemaid. But therein lies the only minor fault of this picture: the leading character does NOT evoke a lot of emotions. Consequently ""Roma"" certainly is NOT a hardhitting, emotional drama.After 30 minutes I was still wondering where this story would take me. Not bored, but a bit puzzled that not many dramatic events seemed to happen or were even about to start happening. This movie toddles along for quite a while.The good. Roma is truly one of the most touching, subtle, mesmirising portraits of family life I have ever seen on the silver screen over the past several decades. Thankfully this Netflix picture was released in a few cinemas as well, because this movie is best appreciated when there are no phones or doorbells ringing when watching, because it has an incredibly slowburning, fragile pace.""Roma"" feels as if life is unfolding in front of my eyes, with truly breathtaking photography. Merely the end credit titles by themselves are of a magnificent beauty and creativity which left the entire audience silent untill the very last end credit title rolled over the screen: SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH."
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"""Roma"" (2018 release; 135 min,) brings the story of Cleo, a live-in maid/nanny/housekeeper to a middle-class family in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. As the movie opens, we see her cleaning the house, making lunch for the 4 kids, and we get to know the couple, a doctor and his wife. It all seems quite idyllic. The doctor then needs to attend a conference in Montreal, but in reality he is separating from his wife... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when we last heard from writer-editor-photographer-producer-director Alfonso Cuaron, it was 2013 when he went on to win multiple Oscars for the stand-out film ""Gravity"". Having taking his time to decide what to do next, Cuaron went on to revisit his own self, taking a look at his upbringing in Mexico City. The movie is set as 1970 turns into 1971, when Cuaron himself was 8-9 years old. The movie centers around the ups and downs in the life of Cleo, one of the two maids in the family, but of course along the way we follow the family itself, as Cleo is an integral part of the household. The genius of the movie s that Cuaron simply observes characters in which we become emotionally involved, and then lets the camera roll, often in a single shot that lasts for minutes on. Shot in nuanced B&W, the movie itself becomes very nuanced, and breath-taking. Check out the New Year's Day celebrations, as the family visits an uncle, and Cleo ends up going to a separate celebration for the locals, and she wistfully raises a glass ""to a beautiful 1971"", not realizing what awaits her yet. Yalitza Aparicio (a complete unknown to me) is masterful in her role as Cleo. Keep an eye out for the sweeping photography when there is unrest in the city as students/rebels clash against police, wow, just wow. I had recently made my ""10 best of 2018"" movie list, and after I saw ""Roma"", I immediately realized that I needed to redo that list, as ""Roma"" is the best movie of the year, period. Yes, it is THAT good.""Roma"" premiered at this year's Venice film festival, and has slowly been rolling out to US theaters. It finally opened at my local art-house theater this weekend here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this was attended okay (about 20 people), and the audience was spellbound (you could hear a needle drop upon the movie's concluding scene). If you have an interest in a HUMAN story that will touch you in more than one way, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Roma"" is a WINNER all the way."
ROMA,30 January 2019,5/10,"Based on the childhood recollections of Director Alfonso Cuarón, Roma is set in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City in the early 70s. I was much impressed with Cuarón's 2013 mainstream sci-fi picture, Gravity, a visual tour-de-force. Here he's decided to try his hand at art house fare and once again has hit a home run in the visual department. Filmed in black and white, Roma is a film filled with striking images as well as a stunning soundtrack which features no music-instead there is only ambient sound which captures the atmosphere of Cuarón's middle class household as well as other neighborhoods in Mexico City which prove fraught with political tension and violence.
Sadly Cuarón, while a brilliant visual director, is not much of a screenwriter. His protagonist, Cleo (played by newcomer and non-professional actress Yalitza Aparicio) is a maid who works for Senora Sofia, mother of four children. Also in the household is the grandmother (Sofia's mother) and Antonio, the doctor husband who is rarely at home. There's also Adela, employed as a cook and friend of Cleo.
Cuarón wastes a great deal of time in the expository scenes as he introduces us to Cleo and the family. The daily drudgery of Cleo's job is depicted along with a mother who has some trouble containing her unruly kids. It's also suggested that the relationship between husband and wife is not good and as we eventually see, falls apart completely. It takes over half an hour before the break into the Second Act occurs. Judicious editing could have solved the problem of lugubrious pacing but Cuarón seems enamored with presenting his ""photo scrapbook"" of memories and recollections which amount to one vignette after another at the expense of character development.
While Aparicio does a remarkable job for a first-time actor, her Cleo is an unrealized and underdeveloped character. Cuarón emphasizes Cleo's ""quiet dignity"" but in doing so puts her on a pedestal. In other words, she has virtually no flaws or idiosyncrasies except for being shy (if you can call that a flaw). In the second half, Cuarón elevates her to virtual sainthood in a traumatic and tragic childbirth scene along with a scene at the beach, where she saves two of the children from drowning.
The ""break into two"" occurs when Cleo learns she is pregnant after going to bed with Fermin, a martial arts enthusiast who turns out to be the boyfriend from hell. Aside from Cleo, all the other characters in the film are shown at a distance and hence we never get a feeling for them as real people. The mother in particular is depicted in this way, with scenes where she becomes cross with the children or is seen driving the car into the garage after drinking.
Occasionally the plot intrudes as Cleo reveals her suspicions of pregnancy to Sofia, who caringly brings her to the hospital where she is checked out by a gynecologist. There's more lugubrious pacing as Cleo spends a good amount of time attempting to locate Fermin who has disappeared. It turns out that Fermin is likely part of a roving band of paramilitary youths, known as Los Falcones (The Hawks). Cleo finds him at an athletic field where this large group of young men are involved in martial arts training. That's where Fermin threatens Cleo with bodily harm if she ever looks him up again.
Perhaps the best (and most riveting) part of the film takes place where Cleo and her grandmother find themselves in a store shopping for a crib and a riot starts up right outside the building. A group of Socialist oriented protestors are suddenly set upon by members of Los Falcones and shockingly Fermin is one of them. Right in front of Cleo, the young fascists shoot and kill one of the protestors who has just entered the store seeking refuge from the violence outside. For a moment it appears Fermin is about to shoot Cleo, but he backs off and leaves.
Unfortunately we never find out much about Fermin and the group he belongs to. As with most of the characters here, Cuarón provides a mere impressionistic glimpse. There are never any significant political discussions among the characters that fill us in on the background and context of the violent political scene existing in Mexico at the time.
Cuarón leaves his two most harrowing moments for the second act ""dark moment"" and third act crisis. The failed childbirth and scene in which Cleo saves Sonia's children from drowning are designed to merely reinforce what we've been told throughout the film: Cleo's saintliness is unassailable.
Ultimately Cuarón's veritable portrait of a saint does not lend itself to good drama. Nor does presenting the supporting players at a decided distance add to the overall verisimilitude. Cuarón's cinematography is beautiful so see the film for the visual and auditory elements. Don't expect much in terms of character development-as Cuarón is unable to craft all his memories into a compelling, suspenseful plot."
ROMA,24 February 2019,8/10,"'Roma' is the heavy favourite to win the Best Picture award at the Academy Awards ceremony tomorrow and I can understand why. I don't think it's the most entertaining or perhaps even the best of the eight nominated films, however it does have a lot going for it. It's unquestionably the most beautifully shot film of the bunch. It also has an incredible amount of symbolism and is a film that could be studied by film students for years to come. Then add in the little nods towards cinema (every Best Picture winner has to have them and Alfonso Cuarón's best friend Guillermo del Toro knows that better than anyone and you can bet he had an influence on those otherwise pointless settings being in the film) and I think you do indeed have a Best Picture winning film.Yalitza Aparicio, in her debut film nonetheless, has been nominated for Best Actress in a leading role. She was superb and the fact I had no clue until reading about it after the film that this was her first performance says a lot. Marina de Tavira has also been nominated for the film in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category. She was still impressive in her limited chances, but didn't quite shine to the extent Aparicio managed to. I can't see either getting the win but they are well deserved nominations.'Roma' is a very intelligent film. There are so many little moments that could easily seem innocuous, but in hindsight actually had incredible amounts of depth behind them. There is also one masterfully crafted scene that will go down as one of the most hard to watch and devastating things I've ever seen in a film. There are a couple of other films I would prefer to see win the award over this, however I'm not going to be upset when the name 'Roma' is read out either (like I was last year with 'The Shape of Water'). This is a very fine film no doubt about it. Also, are Mexicans taking over the cinematic universe or what? Every film they make at the moment seems to be at least considered gold."
ROMA,20 December 2018,7/10,"Roma is a long and emotionally draining film. Yalitza Aparicio is the Main character and she is terrific. She is the housekeeper in an upper middle class home in Mexico where she takes care of four young children; two boys and two girls. Mom and dad are professionals who leave almost everything to the young domestic. The black and white scenery are spectacular but the screaming children and barking dogs frankly wore me out. I admire the artistic merits of Roma. Cuaron is clearly a genius. Unfortunately, at the end of two hours and fifteen minutes I was happy that the movie had finally ended. Children of Men was a better movie by the same director from back in 2006."
ROMA,20 July 2019,6/10,"6/10 - certainly an artistic achievement, but for me at least, it wasn't the most entertaining"
ROMA,24 February 2019,10/10,"A year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City in the early 1970s. The most personal project to date from Academy Award (R)-winning director and writer Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Children of Men, Y Tu Mama Tambien), ROMA follows Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young domestic worker for a family in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City. Delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him, Cuaron draws on his own childhood to create a vivid and emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil of the 1970s. Cuaron's first project since the groundbreaking Gravity in 2013.Alfonso Cuaron only graces us with a film every so often, but every time it is so worth the wait. Returning to his routes after several big-budget outings, Roma is a simple but effective slice-of-life drama destined to go down in history as one of the masterpieces of foreign cinema. Featuring phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and non-actors, led by an especially heartbreaking turn by Yalitza Apricio, this is easily Cuaron's most personal film to date. It's a piece of cinema that, whilst mostly grounded in the mundane, finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment. Cuaron's beautiful black-and-white photography is gorgeous and features some of the best shots in cinema this year, and that beauty that makes it so tragic that most audiences (myself included) never got to see this on the big screen. On the plus side, Roma being a Netflix film means you have little excuse to miss out on it. Put aside some time, sit back, and experience the potential cinema still has as an art form. Roma is emotionally powerful from start to finish and I simply can't recommend it enough."
ROMA,19 December 2018,6/10,"Cuaron really should have brought in another writer as the resulting screenplay is rudderless and unfocused. Apparently it is intended to be a slice of life, a year of a upper middle class Mexican family in the 70's but it lacks narrative drive and emotional heft. Films are not life and one should only go so far trying to replicate the experience. Too many of the fundamental dynamics of the story are left unexplained. Worse of all to give the film something resembling tension Cauron repeatedly uses cheap tricks of chance to provide dramatic shape. The act of nature that defines the climax is largely out of left field; it is simply devoid of dramatic meaning as a result. Many of the characters and several of the scenes showed a lot of promise but the overall story is a mess of underwritten so-called realism.Nonetheless, the film is worth seeing once. The acting is quite good and it almost sells the narrative. But best of all the simple minimal direction presents an ""objective"" look you often don't get in period pieces. Moreover, the cinematography is gorgeous, moody black and white. The film is Cauron at his visual best. It is just enough to make me like the final film.This is worth seeing if you have Netflix. It is not worth getting Netflix for."
ROMA,29 December 2018,8/10,"The story of a domestic worker's life and the family she works for at a time of civil unrest in Mexico culminating with the Corpus Christi Massacre in 1971.It is actually quite difficult for a non intellectual to articulate why such a simple story, which is often very slow, is completely absorbing from first frame to last. In many respects it is a very classy soap opera, but made up with so many absorbing scenes which mix high emotion, humour, even shock and great tension that by the end you know the characters so well and empathise with their hardships that you yearn for more.A great film - so clever - shame he doesn't make them very often"
ROMA,4 January 2019,8/10,"(Flash Review)I was drawn to this film from the massive marketing blitz for it so I gave it a shot. Glad I did. The film lulls you into the way of life of a mid-upper class Spanish family and their two servant woman and everyone's immediate life struggles. You tend to watch scenes play out at a distance. The upper class mother of four kids has her husband go away for long distance durations, cheats and lies yet he is not really on screen much. At the same time the primary servant woman, who is the main character, gets pregnant and the guy refuses to be a man when he learns the news. This doesn't paint the men in these women's lives very well and for good reason. There is not an obvious plot yet lots of daily life activities that give the viewer time to digest current circumstances and the rich depth and secondary stuff going on within each scene helps this feel very real. I love the smooth panning and tracking camera movements that give the film an engaging visual appeal complimented by very nice black and white cinematography. Much of the story is conveyed through visuals and atmosphere. This is a great film that allows the user to connect the dots themselves a little; doesn't spoon feed anything. I wish I was a bit more emotionally connected to the characters as there are a few heavy emotional moments."
ROMA,25 May 2020,10/10,"I have seen well over 15000 films; some of them more than once. There are only a handful of films that compare to this masterpiece. Director Alfonso Cuarons is head and shoulders above every other director of the 21st century. His writing and cinematography (which is magnificent) are unequalled. You are not even aware there is a camera filming the scenes. The performances of everyone in the film are perfect. The performance of the actress who plays Cleo is electric. If you don't cry at this film, you better get your body checked for having a heart.The film is harrowing and heartbreaking at the same time. It is even BETTER than the heretofore impregnable bastion of neo-realism films of Italian cinema from 1945-1955. I wrote a book on those films and I always thought they would NEVER be equalled.. This film does the impossible; it equals Italian neorealism with Mexican neorealism.There have been other great films from South of the Border before such as the brilliant City of God by Meirelles Lund of Brazil. This had been the reigning champion of foreign films before Roma. Now, it is still a great film, but Roma is the first neorealism film that captures BOTH the day to day problems of the poor AND the upper class. Of course, we are more sympathetic to the poor working class girl, Cleo, than we are to the unfortunate wife and children of the rich doctor. But that tragedy comes right through the screen as well as Cleo's trials. If there is a more tragic scene in cinema than the birthing room scene of Cleo, I certainly have not seen one; and I have seen almost all of them. Welcome to finest film of the 21st century (not just FOREIGN film) and one of the top ten films of all time."
ROMA,7 September 2020,5/10,"There is a lot here that is good. But at the end, I wondered what was the point? The main character, Cleo, played very well by Yalitza Aparicio, who was not a professional actress, has a lot happening to her, but in the end, she remains as enigmatic and taciturn as at the beginning. A subtext seems to be the social stratification between the Caucasian looking upper classes, and the very Indian looking lower class. In reading up on the film on this site, I see that it is an ode to the director's memories of his childhood. OK, but that's not enough. I also find the black and white presentation an annoying affectation, particularly since it is portraying a time when films were in color. Sorry, Sr. Cuaron, but it bored me."
ROMA,4 December 2019,9/10,"A visceral wonder of filmmaking that I hope to rewatch many more times in the future. There's so many new things I caught on second viewing that I didn't before thanks to watching it on the big screen with a good sound system this time around. The cinematography is to die for and everything from a technical standpoint is perfection. Alfonso Cuaron has easily cemented himself as one of the best directors working in the filmmaking business today and I'll be there front of the line opening day for his next project.Also, Borras is a good doggo.A+"
ROMA,15 February 2019,7/10,"Roma is a critically acclaimed drama by renowned director Alfonso Cuarón that has autobiographical elements and is also a homage to the housemaid he grew up with. It tells the story of young maid Cleo who works in the suburb of Roma in Mexico City in the early seventies. She works for an upper middle-class family who is on the verge of falling apart when the father never comes home from a business trip and has secretly started a new life with a younger woman. Cleo has some issues of her own as she is pregnant with a child she has never wanted and the child's father vanishes as soon as she tells him about it. At the same time, civil unrest increases steadily in Mexico City and has profound impacts on the entire country. In this time of change, Cleo tries to make it through and find out what she really wants to do with her life.The movie has several strong points that justify its great reputation. The camera work is calm, intense and precise. The movie is shot in black and white which gives it nostalgic depth. The acting performances are authentic and especially rookie lead actress Yalitza Aparicio has a raw natural talent. The movie deals with several profound topics such as family, friendship and trust. The film isn't moralizing but the viewer can't help but think about the characters' at times debatable or controversial actions, decisions and thoughts. This movie invites you to analyze, discuss and think about it.The film also has a few downsides. The pace is particularly slow and at times dragging for no justifiable reason. The film would have been more concise, entertaining and intense if it had been shortened by at least a half hour. While the plot is intriguing, it starts without a proper introduction and also ends without a conclusion which underlines a somewhat unfocused script writing. The movie basically exposes a slice of life but fails to wrap up its loose ends.In the end, Roma is a good drama that convinces with authentic acting performances, great camera work and profound topics that offer food for thought. However, the film isn't as great as its reputation and suffers from a slow pace and unfocused script writing. If you like emotional dramas or Mexican culture, you should watch this movie. Everyone else can however ignore it and shouldn't get too excited over the exaggeratedly positive reviews. Shoplifters, another foreign drama nominated for an Academy Award, is clearly the better film and should have gotten the attention Roma has received over the past few months."
ROMA,9 May 2020,4/10,"The storyline is your average life movie. It's hard, unfair and mostly sad, but some better moments keeps you living for. Anyway, this movie does shine in a few scenes, especially ending, but majority of movie felt boring and long."
ROMA,27 December 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuaron's best film. A slice of life beautifully filmed in black & white. You feel like a fly on the wall watching this family. Excellent cinematography! (esp at the beach wow), and yes it won an oscar for that. A gem. Personal and memorable."
ROMA,11 February 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cauron's Oscar nominated film is a tribute to the nanny who raised him during the 70's in Mexico. Shot in glorious black & white (by the director acting as his own d.p.) this sense memory put to film aligns a time when a middle class family was breaking down (the doctor/husband has abandoned his clan under the guise of a business trip to Canada) when revolution & political discord was rearing its ugly head upsetting the status quo which continues to this day. The story is told from the vantage point of the young servant named Cleo who bides her tongue & does what she can to survive as an unexpected pregnancy soon becomes the focal problem in her life even though her duties seem to take precedent over everything. Adopting almost a CCV esthetic (the camera seems to be at a distance constantly panning back & forth as the action unfolds before it) w/myriad details happening within the mise en scene of the frame. Cleo takes a bus trip to confront the deadbeat who knocked her up & as she disembarks from the bus we're engulfed by a vista recently visited by a downpour (inhabitants are using wood planks to cross over muddy pot holes) w/an incongruous shot of a carnival taking place in the background as a cannon fires sending its occupant into a waiting net. This constant detail layering works wonders as one is compelled to rewatch this feature for all the minutiae one might've missed upon initial viewing. Will it win Best Picture? I don't think so since the film is also up for Best Foreign Language & if memory serves the same scenario played out for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon almost 2 decades ago (it was dual nominated) & they only came away w/the lesser award (which isn't a dis)."
ROMA,26 January 2019,9/10,"Roma is the best movie of 2018 and the best movie Alfonso Cuaron ever made. Story is heartbreaking and very inspirational. I don't know where he found the lead actress but that performance was phenomenal. Uhh don't let me start about cinematography. Cinematography is so amazing and it is one of the best this decade. Cuarons details and long shots makes this visual masterpiece. The black and white are used so well in this film in a way you couldn't even imagine.
Oscars Roma should get:
1. Best Picture
2. Best Foreign Film
3. Best Director
4. Best Cinematography
5. Best Original Screenplay
6. Best actress (but it will be close with Close :P)
7. Maybe Best supporting actress but I haven't seen The Favourite"
ROMA,10 January 2019,8/10,"Roma starts out as a very long-winded, dull and very boring story. The distance the audience journeys with the story is justified with what the story becomes. The patient viewer will be treated with a very special experience. Alfonso Cuarón shows us the raw nature of Mexico. At times, the setting showcases the blink existence of these characters. You need to search long and hard to find any signs of hope. As we witness Cleo's struggle, we begin to understand what the movie's intentions are. Roma is a foreign film in more ways that one. Many viewers are unable to sit through this movie. However, those who find a connection with Cleo, will find themselves redeemed as the closing credits appear. Roma is an experience worth feeling."
ROMA,12 February 2019,1/10,"I really had to force myself to watch this movie on Netflix, in three times, each ""session"" lasting as long as I could, before I started to drift off. I knew I was in trouble from the opnening scene of a symmetrically tiled floor being washed. Interesting it wasn't, but for sure it lasted a very long time. The unexciting opening credits were followed by disconnected episodes in the life of a large family and their two maids. Apologies to the politically correct police, but for a while I could not distinguish one maid from the other. After a while I learnt one was Cleo and the other Adela.We focus on Cleo, who gets pregnant by an ""inconsiderate"" lover (understatement of the year). In the meantime, Sofia, the lady of the house is dumped by her doctor husband for a younger model. Sofia must take care of their four kids on her own, but does not seem quite up to the task. All this slightly soap-opera drama is seen from a distance, dialogues are boring and few and far between. There is no building of tension or plot development.Other than this being filmed in black & white to offer a political statement of some sort, there is nothing that strucks me as genuinely moving. As a commercial operation, it's certainly the perfect Oscar bait. Yet another Mexican director will bag the big prize and everybody will be righteously happy that justice prevailed.... I mean, that the best film won the prize it deserves...or whatever"
ROMA,25 July 2019,9/10,"Art is subjective. When you first look at a piece of art you bring with it your whole person. You bring everything you've thought and wished for, everything you've imagined and dreamed, and everything that you've seen that has helped to shape you into the person you are when you see it. When you approach artwork, be it a painting, a film, a book, or a piece of music, you aren't a blank slate, you yourself are a complex and emotional work of art, one that changes and evolves based on where you are in your life and what you've experienced. Your experiences, and everything in you, gives you certain unique worldview that will affect how you see something vs how the person standing next to you sees something. I can look at Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and understand that it is a masterpiece, but it doesn't stir in me a wonder at the majesty of the universe like when I look at van Gogh's Starry Night. With that out of the way, let me say that Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It is a technical marvel in every sense of the phrase; it's one of the most human films I've ever seen; it's utterly gorgeous as far as its production design and crafting of the world. But... out of all of the Best Picture nominees that I have seen this year, if I'm being honest, I will be least likely to come back to this film. Why? It's a masterpiece, yes, but it's not the kind of film I want to sit down to watch over and over again.

ROMA,17 January 2019,6/10,The artistic depiction of evil is admirable in a low key underplayed black and white way. I wasn' quite moved but the depiction of Mexico in 1970 was quite accurate..
ROMA,18 December 2018,7/10,You allow the movie's sights and smells to envelop you in a world surrounded by turmoil and tragedy but held together by love and loyalty.
ROMA,21 December 2018,8/10,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Extraordinary camerawork make the memories linger in director Mr. Alfonso Cuarón's Roma.JIM'S REVIEW: Roma may be a neighborhood in an area of Mexico City, but in Alfonso Cuarón's vividly realized film, it is a bittersweet series of recollections about his childhood that forever dwells in his creative mind. His autobiographical film takes moviegoers on a journey to his past.Set in the 1970-71, it follows the life of his live-in housekeeper and nanny, Cleo (a winning Yalitza Aparicio), whose unconditional devotion to him and his well-to-do family becomes the main story told in a stream-of conscientious approach. The film's storytelling tend to meander depicting a series of true events that happened during the director's teenage years. But visually, the film is stunning throughout. Even if the narrative becomes monotonous, and it does, the imagery is so artistically rendered that one need only focus on the photography to envelop the true moviegoing experience.Directed, written, co-edited (with Adam Gough), and lensed in glorious in black & white by Mr. Cuarón, the film has many moments beautifully captured (a jet plane reflected in sudsy water, a house overstuffed with macabre taxidermic animals and beloved dead pets, children's toys scatter in disarray on a kitchen table, a student protest seen through a store window, a wedding photo shoot with happy bride and recent divorcee yards away from each other showing the martial extremes, etc.) Just observing the labor of washing a tile floor becomes high art in Mr. Cuarón's lovely camerawork. Pure genius.While his screenplay is too leisurely paced and rarely approaches the director's level of technical excellence, the characters and their situations are interesting enough to hold one's attention. We meet the naive and overworked maid named Cleo. She is the uniting force in the household which consists of a self-centered Sofia, mother of four young children, her philandering husband, Antonio, Sofia's mother, Teresa, and another maid, Adela. Cleo is also dating Fermín, a man of questionable means. Vignettes of various events throughout the year intertwine to show the changes in these character's lives. Yet the film doesn't really build to any clear-cut narrative or compelling message. It merely states these oft quiet moments in time matter-of-factly, with no real emotional impact or pay-off. The artful images will linger, the story does not.Roma may not deserve the gushing accolades it is receiving, but this is still a remarkable tribute to a woman who nurtured this talented man through boyhood. Some scenes are more powerful than others and the overall effect of the storytelling may be less than thrilling due to the mundane daily existence of the characters' lives. But Mr. Cuarón's sincere attempt to share his personal valentine with the world is a testament to behold. Roma is a memory play told in cinematic terms, a loving portrait of days gone by, never to be seen again."
ROMA,16 December 2018,1/10,"My Rating : 1/10'Roma' is a very personal film I understand, Alfonso Cuaron the director wanted to recreate some of his childhood memories and it took him years to finally make it.I found the movie to be slow, mundane and aside from 2-3 scenes it is simply too bland for my taste. Also, they've used CGI in a lot of scenes (yes, the final beach scene as well) but who cares when it's this boring. Suffice to say it is perhaps one of the most boring movies I've ever seen."
ROMA,22 December 2018,5/10,"Overrated.
Overlong.
Good cinematography, art direction and choice of songs.
Fermín (Cleo's boyfriend) sets the movie on fire, but he is around too little. He is the Wolf, the Monster, and the Terror of Underdevelopment. He even symbolically kills his own daughter.
Kids are always kids, and so are old people, they steal scenes, etcetera, as the heroic WonderGranny who takes Cleo to the hospital through a street riot.
Premonitions are cinegenic, especially in New Year, in a forest, with a few pines on fire and a Nordic guy (sort of) posing in front of the camera and singing...
There is even an earthquake alert and someone playing Profesor Zovek training a group of martial arts freaks (including Fermín).
As in most Mexican melodramas, everything is solved with a good weep.
But the scene on the beach verges on the ridicule. Caramel coated solidarity (see the poster).
Cleo the servant becomes SuperCleo for a while. Then she is a servant again.
In the end credits, some links are included for good measure, in case you want to join the fight for the rights of women and servants, and for the cause of maids in the USA."
ROMA,6 March 2020,9/10,"This film is unlike any film I have ever seen, and that's saying A LOT because I've seen a lot of movies. The cinematography is probably the best ever, but the movie is so much better than that. Just watch it."
ROMA,7 February 2019,5/10,"This movie is amazing... in terms of cinematography and sound design. I watched the first 30 minutes, and based on that and some other reviews I think its safe to say that nothing happens in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie for aesthetic purposes, but if you're looking for some fascinating story to enjoy, look elsewhere."
ROMA,10 February 2019,8/10,"I have so far seen four of this year's Best Picture nominees, and there is no doubt that 'Roma' is the very best of the bunch. It is the only of the four nominees I have seen that is able to reach true greatness, and it is able to do so through subtlety and atmosphere. I'll admit that I am a fan of melodramatic films when they are done well, but there is really something special about a film like 'Roma' that is able to incorporate some scenes of such emotional intensity and impact in what often boils down to a slice of life look at the setting of director Cuarón's childhood. Every scene has a quiet nature to it, making the few sequences that depart from ordinary life and instead burst with action all the more impactful while still remaining tonally consistent with the rest of the film. Add on to this a clear central arc and you have yourself what, in many ways, borders on being a masterpiece. Not to mention, the cinematography is some of the most gorgeous I have ever seen. In stunning black and white, most of the film consists of extremely wide shots, the mis en scene often filled with characters and props, making even the most mundane of things take on greater power, greater beauty. The sound design immerses the viewer even further into this nostalgic and cinematic world, often bursting with the surprisingly meaningful sounds of daily life. On a technical level, the film looks, sounds, and feels like an epic on a grand scale, but, at its core, it is an extremely intimate and slow moving drama. Even when historical events interfere with the central storyline, they serve as something of a backdrop helping further express the main character's internal conflicts. It does not seek to make some grand statement about the historical or political, and it does not need to. Sometimes, merely observing the lives of seemingly ordinary, ""unimportant"" people is more than enough, and the way 'Roma' contrasts with many of this year's award-winning films proves this."
ROMA,20 April 2019,1/10,"This was just garbage! After about 30 minutes of watching the lead actress do mundane tasks like washing dishes, making up beds, turning out lights, and listening to dialog that was just meaningless, one knew that the whole Oscar nomination was just pure hype. The film goes nowhere, has no message, is a self-indulgent fantasy, and is just a pointless exercise. WARNING: If you watch this, you will lose 2 hours of your life that you will never get back!"
ROMA,27 January 2019,5/10,"This film was meant to be a work of art and a nostalgic tribute to the women of Alfonso Cuaron's youth. It excels in all its technical aspects, and has been rewarded by critical and award attention. It's setting and title are to evoke a neighbourhood of the Colonia Roma district in a turbulent period of Mexican politics. The storytelling is painstakingly natural and realistic, meant to keep the audience in the everyday, unedited minutiae of the moment. The cinematography is all about casting a panoramic view of the moments, inviting the viewer to explore each detail of the rolling frame of the camera lense. The camera is the storyteller. Knowing all this to be true, I didn't care for the film. The choice of black and white eliminated all the colour of Mexico in the 70s - a time and place of rampant colour - which made no sense in a movie dependent on the audience being lost in the detail of real life. I did not find myself lost in the slow pan of the camera - I found myself bored. Many reviewers said they found themselves helpless with weeping - I was not caught up in the pathos or struggle of these women for I felt I was kept at arm length by the distance of the camera. Of the 10 Oscar categories of nomination this film garnered (Best Picture / Actress / Supporting Actress / Cinematography / Director / Foreign Language Film / Production Design / Sound Editing / Sound Mixing / Writing Original Screenplay), I am most bewildered by Best Original Screenplay. For me it seems, at best, the writer drew a loose outline that set the parameter but then, beyond putting people in a place with an objective, just let the cameras role, like a improv, which also made me question the nominations for acting. This will not be a popular review but in many ways it feels that to be unimpressed with this film is akin to calling out the nudity of the Emperor. Well, call me a philistine, but I rate this film a 5 (meh - with some technical excellence) out of 10. {Drama}"
ROMA,24 February 2019,1/10,"Was this a joke? After nearly two hours of my life i stopped it. Nothing and really nothing happened in this movie.
The only thing that I agree is one point concerning the human dramtical side. But to show the story in two hours and 15 minutes in black and white it could have been cut for at least two hours.
This movie is a good way to fall asleep and not for one reason more. How is it possible that it has been nominated for best direction? Stay away you won't regret it. too overrated. Read carefully all the critics here and you will understand.
1 star just for the pregnant wife who played her role perfectly."
ROMA,24 January 2019,8/10,"A Mexican-American drama; This film set in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma in Mexico City is an artful tale about a domestic servant, an emotional portrait of domestic strife and social hierarchy amidst political turmoil in 1971. The notions of family and friendship are delicately observed and the performances are strong, especially the part played by the lead, Yalitza Aparicio. Narratively, it is very straightforward and yet it is thought provoking and it has cinematic spectacle."
ROMA,27 February 2019,1/10,"This movie represents perhaps the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the Oscars and the Baftas. It's selection is entirely Political and political and like the ""times up"" and ""me too"" movement last year or indeed the under-representation of BME winners the year before its elevation to greatness is based on the latest or ""worthy"" fashion trend. I am disgusted and betrayed that organisations whose raison d'etre is to recognise and promote excellence in the film industry would allow themselves to be so hood-winked and tainted by this calumny.I will now analyse this movie in detail under 7 headings.1, The Memories, The Director Alfonso Cuaron states the movies is a collection of his memories and the women who reared him. For this approach to have any meaning for the viewer the memory recalled must be either of emotional or historical significance to the formation of a specific character. No character had discernable definition, no emotion was conveyed and a memory of dog excrement or bad driving, disappearing bookcases or fireworks is of insufficient weight to convey meaning. I would go further that in the mundanity and rambling progression of this movie the ""events"" inserted were so contrived to provide a catalyst that I laughed in exasperation.2, The Characters, there was no character definition to define any specific character, there was no script to speak of to attach to any character that would display an emotional inner world, history or future. Moving from room to room cleaning and turning off lights is not acting, if it were so I would have earned at least two Oscars this morning. We were just shown the mundanity of feckless acts by ugly people who we cared not whether they lived or died. I vote for the latter. I had to laugh when the Director stated he went through countless villages auditioning thousands of women to find his ""Cleo"", my cleaner is available anytime WTF!3. The Corpus Christi Massacre, this was handled as a side-issue or even a non-issue, there was here finally a chance to say something by the Director, and yet the whole event was diluted by shopping for a cot and Cleo's waters breaking. If I were to choose a comparator perhaps it would be the absence of the French Revolution in a Jane Austin novel despite it occuring as a backdrop. The device of inserting incidents, the fireworks, the abandonment, the near drowning were introduced as catalysts for plot development but literally nothing followed, leading to frustration for the viewer. Any successful drama is the compression of reality over conflict here the drama was displayed practically in real time and therefore there was no compression and hence no drama.4. Toxic Masculinity, wow the same old cards, all men are losers, all men abuse and abandon women, the ""fictional"" sisterhood in a domestic setting (no such thing), the underpinning of a pseudo-reality where only women can be compassionate, only women own up to the responsibilities of child rearing. Give me a break, this is not toxic masculinity but strident feminist misandry with an agenda. There was nothing new here in this movie that wasn't said 20 years ago, and what there was handled badly. This movie was a setback for any feminist principles and they should be ashamed.5, The Cinematography, the black and white just underpinned a dreadful black and white world. Yes the tonal qualities of the images were good, but cinematography is a vehicle for the story and drama before us, much of its was delivered like a series of postcards, the camera moved with a lack of variety. Overall this was style over substance and certainly not worthy of an Oscar when compared to the Favourite or Bohemian Rhapsody.6. The Simplicity, we had lengthy views, panoramas, cleaning, driving , marching, water, the seaside, fireworks etc etc. So what! How does this entertain me in of itself, the answer is it doesn't. There was no tension or dramatic impetus, it had the feel of a screensaver or watching a spider build a web. Interesting for a minute and then what next. Within a movie every image much add to the plot, this series of images had no meaning or profundity and thus we just didn't care.7. The Score, these was no score we just had the irritating and haphazard sounds of humanity.In our age film is the new high-art of the 21 century, when news and opinion cannot be trusted film becomes pre-eminent in its power to shape and form public discourse. The Oscars and Baftas matter and the selection of this movie for honour brings these organisations into disrepute at a time when we all need to believe in the honest intentions of ""experts"".If there was an Oscar to be handed out it would go to Borras the dog as he told us in the yard repeatedly what he thought about this movie and he was right."
ROMA,8 August 2019,8/10,"After his excursion into the fantasy / science fiction genre, Alfonso Cuaron makes with ""Roma"" a good, versatile (but not brilliant) movie. ""Roma"" is about a lot of things, but essentialy it is about women (in different social classes) keeping things together when their men let them down.In some films the housekeeper belongs to a different world (""Gosford Park"", 2001, Robert Altman). In other films the housekeeper is nearly a member of the family (""Fanny and Alexander"", 1982, Ingmar Bergman). ""Roma"" is somewhere in between these extremes. For the children the housekeeper belongs to the family, for the parents she is in the first place an employee."
ROMA,22 December 2018,3/10,"This film is sold as a glimpse of ""middle class"" life in Mexico. In fact, there wasn't much of a middle class in that era, not that there is much that passes for it today. I spent a year living with in a very similar household in Lima, Peru, when I was in an exchange program at university in 1980. This film brings back bad memories of the sad lives that domestic servants have in Latin America (I can't speak about other places).I'm way too much of a socialist not to be sickened by this ""nostalgic"" look at this demeaning way of life in which one group of humans are superior to another. The families treat their domestics like property. This same ruling elite have denied reproductive rights to their citizens ensuring that the cycle of ignorance and poverty continue, providing a steady flow of cheap help.If I were the king of the world (quite an irony for a socialist) I would force everyone to at least clean their own toilets every day. I don't care who you are, we all need to understand that we're all filthy animals. Bill Gates and Donald Trump included--especially Trump.The film was WAY too long for my tastes. Why are almost all films clocking in at over two hours these days?"
ROMA,14 December 2018,,"The title refers to the neighborhood in Mexico City where Director Alfonso Cuaron grew up in the 70s. It could just have easily been entitled 'Libo' for the movie is the filmmaker's reflection on the woman who helped raise him - his family's maid. The fictionalized story renames the woman Cleo (a lovely natural performance by newcomer Yalitza Aparicio).ROMA takes it's time developing its story-line. It's less a series of events, as much as an observation of a year in the life of Cleo and the family she cares for. It has been described, somewhat incorrectly, as Neo-Realist. Shooting in Black & White and having a story involving the poor does not automatically denote Neo-Realism. The movie is Cuaron's ode to his childhood. It's a memory movie, told from HIS perspective - not of Cleo's and the underclass. What makes the movie work is Cuaron's careful attention to the smallest details - simple eye contact, the food, child's play and washing dog droppings on the driveway. Important events happen to Cleo and the family, but, they are presented in the unhurried manner that feels truer than in most contrived screenplays.The aforementioned Black & White cinematography is by Cuaron himself (his regular cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki was unavailable). The camera-work feels very much 'directed'. At times, you can almost feel Cuaron steering the camera to capture exactly what Cuaron, the Director, feels is critical. The effect cuts both ways. On one hand, it becomes a true Auteur project (Cuaron also writes and is the co-editor!). On the other, it further emphasizes that this is CUARON's story, and not that of Cleo and the other characters. In that way, Cuaron comes between the viewer and the action on screen.Much has been made about Aparicio's performance, and, it is a wonder. Much of the other cast are also non-professionals (in that way, it does have a connection to Neo-Realist cinema) and they perform ably. The other tech credits are solid, but, the main discussion has been on the 65mm Digital photography (a somewhat confusing moniker that has some believing it was shot on actual film). The larger sensor does give it a clearer image than traditional digital camerawork, but, seen in a movie theater on DCP, still lacks the richer black level and silvery white level of actual 65mm Film. For all the acclaim (and awards) Cuaron and ROMA's cinematography has gotten, it still resembled Grey & Greyer more than true celluloid B&W.ROMA is a lovely memoir. It isn't a movie to be dissected as one would normally do for its plotting. It is best to let it wash over you - just as the movie frequently does with water flowing and jets gliding above."
ROMA,20 March 2021,3/10,"The two things I most hated in this movie is that like in most oscars, too long time, and boredom because nothing happening. No action, thriller, mystery...just normal life. Also gray color. But I like relaxing landscape, nature, background sounds, which all so reminds me of life. Reminds me of personal events in childhood, environment, experiences, most of which are comfortable, unique, relaxing. Also nice presence of childbirth and sea and bit of negativity. But bit excess nudity and violence. So as a movie this is bad, but bit comfortable and humane, reminds us of typical life."
ROMA,12 January 2019,9/10,"Movie night with Iris.Plucky underdog Netflix may have made my film of the year.Some may find this pretentious. I found it truly affecting, upsetting, glorious, and beautiful. The shooting party, forest fire, shopping trip and beach scenes stand up to anything in the last 20-years.Cleo's dignity shines throughout. And i loved this from beginning to end."
ROMA,1 February 2019,8/10,"Early 1970s: In the Colonia Roma district of Mexico City, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is an indigenous (Mixtec) Mexican. She is one of two live-in domestic servants who reside with a well-off family whose patriarch is a doctor. As the troubles of Cleo's personal life escalate, it is also clear that there is trouble within the family who employs her. ""Roma"" is based on childhood memories of director/writer Alfonso Cuarón.Cuarón certainly knows how to use a camera effectively whether it is movement, stillness, what to include in a frame, or how long to make it linger. His attention to detail is very evident. His scenes are wonderfully enhanced by his own beautiful black-and-white cinematography. The scenes on the downtown streets of the city truly stand out.The first two-thirds of the film seem somewhat ordinary although their subtleties are rich. The attitude of the family to their servants is sometimes condescending while at other times, it is clear that the servants are a part of the family. There are also some fascinating sidelines to Mexico's history of the time including indigenous land disputes, student protests, and a violent counter-protest movement.While the beginning and middle are good, it is not until the last third when the film really takes off with climactic scenes that derive strong emotions that linger well after the film. It was a challenge on whether to give the film a rating of 7 or 8 as its first two-thirds would have earned only 7. I settled on 8 as its last third is so powerful that what precedes it could be considered a build-up. Besides, the feelings last well after the movie's conclusion.And it's also worth noting that Aparicio more than lives up to the responsibility of the central role especially in a scene that takes place in a hospital."
ROMA,19 January 2019,10/10,"My expectations were low given its Netflix pedigree but, wowsers, what an absolute masterpiece. Not easily said but truly excellent.The cinematography, the direction, the script, the acting. Amazing. Faultless.Such a delight to be able to leave a rave review for a change.Emotionally tense, raw, real. Such amazing insight into the lives of both the servant girl but also the family. I found them all to be deeply relatable.I can't tell you how I dreaded a tragic ending amidst the many tragedies and tension but we were spared that thank goodness.Highly, highly recommended!!"
ROMA,19 March 2019,5/10,"This one is the type of movie that shows you the character go downstairs, but ""gifts"" you the chance to see her/him every step. All 20 steps.
It's that kind of (unnecessarily) slow movie.It's never completely boring, because the story is interesting, about a poor and not pretty character (something we rarely see). It's often one or the other, so this is a change.Having said that, by the hour and change, I was ready to move on. We got the most heartbreaking scenes from the movie in the last 30 minutes (three consecutive great sequences), and they were awesome and awful, but by the time they came, they just didn't land because I was ""out of it"".I really don't get the love for this movie.
It's not good in my opinion. Even if technically well done."
ROMA,19 February 2019,9/10,"Roma is a work of art. More specifically, it's a tapestry. Love, devotion, tragedy, grief and hardship in a tumultuous 1970's Mexico. This the film that Alfonso Cuaron never wants you to forget that he made. Fortunately, we won't. A technical visionary director in an intimate setting, with a story close to his heart, is something an audience from all corners of the world can look in wonder at.I realized I was watching something truly special within the first few minutes. We follow Cleodegaria, the indigenous maid, as she cleans around the sprawling upper-middle class house of a wealthy Mexican family. The camera follows her every movement and shows every last detail of her routine. In gorgeous black and white, Cuaron takes many of his cues from French New Wave cinema, and it's storyline is reminiscent of that era as well. Cleo is separated from her employers through class and race. But the human commonality of compassion, as we see by the end of the picture, pierces through those barriers. Cuaron also paints a dire picture of 20th century Mexico, through it's political turmoil that eerily resembles the upheavals we are seeing worldwide today.But make no mistake, Roma doesn't exist as a celebration of Mexico. It's rather, a celebration of humanity and all that binds together. We bleed the same blood, we cry the same tears, we love the same way. Nothing but love from me. Gracias, Aflonso."
ROMA,24 November 2018,8/10,"I know this is coming to Netflix in a few weeks but the rave I've heard about it and being that this is Alfonso Cuaron's next project, I had to make sure to see it on the big screen. I loved Cuaron's last film. Gravity for me was a fantastic visual experience, as well as a emotionally gripping experience. Cuaron's handiwork behind the camera was on full display with that film. Here he comes with a Spanish spoken, black and white, Mexican film that is semi biographical. This film is fairly amazing, from start to finish. I think it excels its expectations and goes to show that Cuaron is one of the best directors on the scene.The film takes place in Mexico City in the early 70s, and is about a Mexican housemaid who takes care of a family of four children, along with their parents and maternal mother. The film shows her routines as the housemaid, her trials and tribulations at work and love, and ow her life changes when she becomes pregnant. The film stars a relatively unknown cast but has a primarily fantastic performance by Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo, the housemaid.From the opening scene of water washing tiles with the credits overlaying, you know you are in for an immense experience. Cuaron utilizes cameras set in place and slow pans to encompass the entire scope of the visual experience of the household and the daily tasks of Cleo. It seems routine at first but the build up throughout is an experience that keeps you watching every second. Cuaron has to be a contender for Best Director at the Academy Awards again as the camera work, cinematography, and sound effects are extremely vivid. Especially, the scenes with the wives in the films climax, lord.The film becomes an emotional experience as the film builds along. You can't help but have strong responses as we see what our protagonist must deal with. The film is set in a time with political unrest and that backdrop adds to the chaos of what occurs in Cleo's life. The film is full of themes and symbolism that could be analyzed in greater detail in a separate entry. There is just a lot that goes on in each sequence of the film. I think Gravity is my personal favorite, but Cuaron's best film has arrived, and I think we have a clear favorite this year. Watch Roma on the big screen if you can, its a cinematic experience tailored with passion by Alfonso Cuaron.8.5/10"
ROMA,14 March 2019,6/10,"Don't get me wrong. I like Alfonso Cuarón's films. I liked his films before I even really knew who he was as a director. If anything, he's shown that he's the master of cinematography, especially in long takes that seem to pan through almost the entire film. He first showed this talent in Children of Men (2006) and continued to impress with this technique in Gravity (2013). While he's shown he has mastered the long take, his signature style is still on display in Roma (2018) through its numerous pans. That being said, I found the content of Children of Men and Gravity to be much more interesting than that of Roma.Cuarón pulls us into his Mexican roots in this film, choosing the early 1970s to set this ""slice of life"" tale. The problem is, while the film looks quite artistic, with the black-and-white aesthetic fusing nicely with the expert camera work (along with that weird costumed singer bit near the middle), there isn't much substance there. Put in another way: I didn't care for the characters. In Children of Men, humanity's survival is on the line. In Gravity, the impetus to return to Earth safely drives the story. In Roma, events just happen, and life goes on.I understand that there are some broader themes likely present in Roma, but I didn't particularly care about them, either. Perhaps it was the simplicity of its presentation that failed to grab my attention. Sure, I liked the little visual setups that led to somewhat amusing changes later on in the film. However, these felt more like a famous comedian winking at the audience without saying a word and expecting everyone to laugh. Perhaps I'm just not close enough to the culture represented here, but I didn't particularly care for this movie, and I instead look forward to whatever Cuarón's next project might be.An artistic film that uses Cuarón's talents to say very little, I give Roma 3.0 stars out of 5."
ROMA,16 January 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuaron - the magnificent Director from Mexico who directed such big Hollywood hits as HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (the best HP flick, IMHO) and GRAVITY (one of the best films of 2013, IMHO) has made a little ""personal"" film that was financed and released by Netflix. Netflix, in their wisdom, realized they might have an Oscar contender on it's hands, so has released ROMA in limited release to Theaters (mostly Art Houses) and...in some instances...you can catch a 70mm print of this film. Or...you can watch it on your TV via your Netflix subscription.I would highly recommend checking this film out at your local movie theater house and, if you are lucky enough to have a theater that is showing the 70mm print, I would tell you to run...don't walk...to check this out.For ROMA is a beautifully filmed Black and White film, in Spanish (with English subtitles) that tells a very personal story of a family in Mexico City in the early 1970's - as seen through the eyes of their house maid. This story is based (according to what I have read) on Cuaron's own childhood and he has lovingly, beautifully recreated this world and populated it with some interesting characters/experiences.It is also languidly paced (read: slow) and - if I am honest about it - not much happens. So if you add languid pace with black and white photography with Spanish language (and English subtitles) with not much in the way of plot or action, your attention span will be stretched and, I'm afraid, if you're home, you will be tempted to be distracted by your phone, the dog, the dishes, a magazine, etc...And that would be a shame, for I fell in love with this film, the beauty of the cinematography and the slow pace of it all and I think you will too if you give it a chance.Cuaron, most certainly, will be nominated for an Oscar for his writing and directing of this piece - and I am sure that this film will be nominated for Best Picture (and deservedly so), but it is in two other places that I was entranced by ROMA. I have mentioned the first - the Cinematography. This film is a shoo-in for a Best Cinematography Oscar, the black and white is lush and rich throughout the film and adds to the memory-style idealized world that Cuaron has put on screen. So, the Best Cinematography Oscar should go to...Alfonso Cuaron.The other area that I am surprised to say worked very well for me is the performances of the cast, all Mexican actors, unknown to U.S. audiences. Standing out most notably are Marina de Tavira as the matriarch of the family, Senora Sofia and, most surprisingly, Yalitza Aparicio as the focal point of this film, Cleo. Her part is mostly mute (or at least mute for me, for I don't speak Spanish) so the emotions I felt coming from her were brought forth through her facial features, looks and reactions, much more than what she says. I would be fine with either of these two getting an Oscar nomination.Despite a slow start - and a slow pace throughout this film - and not much going on, I was entranced and enthralled by the world that Cuaron put on screen. A world that exists, mostly, in Cuaron's memory and that, now, exists for us to see in this wonderful film.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
ROMA,12 March 2021,9/10,"I thought this was a good movie. As someone who likes foreign films (particularly ones in Spanish) this a must watch. I heard a lot of good things about it so naturally, I had to check it out myself. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed in what I saw.The pace is slow but it works well. Everybody's acting's on point. It's done with the right amount of emotion. The black and white give it a unique feel in terms of the times it takes place in. The main character Cleo is interesting. The movie focuses on her job as a nanny and her role in not just the household, but also Mexican society.Most of the dialogue is either funny or heartfelt. I remember laughing a few times at what the kids were saying.I don't have much else to say other than this's a great movie. I will say that the slow pace may not be for everyone though. If you like Spanish language movies than this's a must watch."

There's a giant blue crab in Mexico called Puerto Ceiba - Cangrejopolis ,
what about the name of film - Colonia Roma a neighbourhood in Mexico-
This film is like watching paint dry and the only savour is the fact the maid gave birth to a stillborn, which was unpleasant to watch and a the girl Clio almost drowned. You could cut the film and combine the shower pole martial arts scene which was very strange «Full Frontal Male Nudity"" with the moment she tells meets her boyfriend doing martial arts and tells him she's pregnant thus cut out all the pointless scenes of her going to hospital and boring family stuff. --------------------------------------Main plot: Mexican girl servant to white people meet guy who does martial arts and is part of resistance in Mexico in 1970. The guy then leaves her and she tracks him down only for him to say he will kill her if he sees her again. Then later in her pregnancy she goes shopping with the mother of the houses mum and see him involved in riot where people are shooting inside a bed shop and she goes in to labour as she noticed him and he her. Then her water breaks on the floor in bed shop and she is rushed by the grandmother of her house and gives birth to a dead baby and you see doctor saying 123 ventilate about 4 times baby's dead. ............................................................................This is not the end a few month or weeks pass and she goes on holiday with mother and children and a there is a sub plot is the father has left mother I think you only see father about once. The children love the ocean and the maid does not and is forced to go in the sea to save the girl called Clio and on doing so manages to release the pain she had and breaks down crying in the arms of the family bonding with them. Now in the film she seem to have a new zest for life and that the end. The film is not challenging but rather dragged out and really does not tell the story in the usual way, but maybe that why people like it. I don't feel I care for the servant girl by watching this film or the family. -----------------------------------------------------Did any else think why is that guy dressed as a porcupine near a forest fire an accident waiting to happen, did he catch fire?. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About 30 minutes of non-sense or more and I did not know why there was a riot in Mexico in 1970 nor why the guy needed to do martial arts when I was watching this movie, I thought maybe he did it to give himself a faster swing. I never look at a shower curtain rod in the same way again. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just found out on line that this film is political about the corpus christi massacre and the united states alleged involvement training people. her boyfriend fermín trained by usa gringo at martial art scene with bamboo canes in movie is that why he could not be in serous rellationship with her against hes training.
Why so many films secretly about anti-America propaganda, what next this film wins an Oscar."
ROMA,10 January 2019,3/10,"This film is about her boyfriend who joins a radical organisation Los Halcones in mexico in 1970's and because of this can't stay with her but she hunts him down and he tells her he will kill her if he see's her again. Fermín is a supporter of Luis Echeverría Álvarez and hes initials are seen in hill in scene where they are practising matial arts.In this sene three americans are seen and posibly on in c.i.a uniform. Then they switch to Zovek who was seen on t.v earleir in movie pulling car with teeth this guy was famous in mexico at the time and tells them the power of the mind over the body and shows them how to stand on on leg. Latter in movie Fermín is seen in student riot in Mexico City which was the Corpus Christi festival a sad day in mexicos history. This festival is the main plot of movie and makes this movie political story. The white family really don't mater and the fact she looses the baby seems to overshadow the film along with a her boyfriend naked doing matial arts with a shower rod. Their was also another side story of family of the house splitting up. The baby probably would have died regardles of her boyfriends action and this sene was shocking to watch and all this film will be remembered for, but as she said she did not want the baby. The family bonding over girls near death was a great sene and camera angles were good but this is just a side show.
The best scene was the car being parked in small garage trying to avoid dog mess.

He's obsessed with kung fu, but we don't see him in gainful employment. This rat splits early from the movie theater where they're on a date after she tells him she's preggers. He tells her how great that is, kisses her, stands up, walks out and never looks back. The mistress of the house she works in watches HER husband walk out, too. He leaves her with four children to raise but he is not sending much money to raise them with. Instead, on a night out with the kids, they all see daddy out with his assistant in his doctoring. Men.

ROMA,25 July 2020,10/10,"Award-winning director in Netflix film presentation? The award winning director is Mexican Alfonso Cuarón. Director with a filmography that includes such varied and interesting films such as Y Tu Mamá También (2001), Gravity (2013) and Children Of Men (2006).This film is presented in a digital black and white that may be off putting to mainstream audiences but when you watch the film you will understand why it is used.The first few minutes of the film had me thinking such thoughts but the film grew on me.It is loosely based on Cuarón's childhood in the middle-class echelons of Mexico City. The film is set in the district of the city or Colonia Roma hence the title of the film.The film is a picture of Cuarón's memories that includes his family 'maid', family breakdown and the streets of his childhood.The film is set in 1971 and follows a period of a year in the life of said live-in maid Cleo (untrained actress Yalitzia Aparicio) and through her story of class difference in terms of language difference (Mixtec) and physical appearance compared to the white Mexican middle-class Antonio and Sofia and their four children.Cleo is shown falling pregnant, the father Fermín dumping her when he finds out and becoming more engrossed in the paramilitary group Los Halcones (The Hawks) who are shown in one scene repressing a student demonstration in Mexico City.
The stress of one such battle causes Cleo's waters to break and an emergency labour sequence.Antonio leaves Sofia with the children for a new life with a mistress.The detail that Cuarón puts into each scene is a joy. He had several roles in production including a Director of Photography credit.Some of his vision is lost when watching the Netflix stream on a small screen and the film ideally needs to be viewed on a cinematic projection.The film only had a limited theatrical run at mainly film festivals as it is a Netflix stream production for home viewing.If ever this film gets a theatrical run near you, get there!Winner of several Academy Awards and nominated for several more. Quite rightly to."
ROMA,10 March 2020,9/10,"Roma is an outstanding film that speaks volumes without being ""loud"" at all. Roma is deep, moving, and beautiful.This film is so extraordinary by how ordinary it is. Day-by-day life becomes portrayed in meticulous fashion. No one looks like movie stars here. Everyone looks like, well, normal people.Yet, this is more of a story of a maid and her employer's family. It's a story of Mexico City as a whole. How often have we overlooked the lives of everyday passersby without thinking more? This film goes into those stories we forget to think about.Shot-by-shot, the film recreates 1970s Mexico in perfection. The sounds, sights, and actors make the audience forget that they're watching a movie. The artistic direction the film takes draws the audience into the film and its world. The lack of color and use of black-and-white exemplifies this even more.Be aware, this film moves slow and will turn away some viewers. But those who sit through the film will be pleasantly surprised.4.5/5. I've rarely had a film draw me in as much as this film did. An absolute masterpiece."

ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"Movies that are simply about life don't seem to come around often enough, so when one makes it into the limelight, it feels like something special if done correctly. Being in Spanish throughout the majority of the film, the sad truth is that most English-speaking American and Canadian citizens will probably be turned off, but if you're someone who doesn't mind watching a foreign film, I honestly don't think you'll find many films that are better than Roma in all of 2018. This film explores the story of a family in ways that I haven't seen present on the screen in quite some time. If you're a film fanatic, here's why (especially to you) I just can't recommend this movie enough.Following a family, as they deal with the hardships of dealing with the harsh realities of what some families go through, Roma focusses on their housemaid in Cleo. Becoming a very good friend of the family, her story is chronicled through the time she spends with them, just as much as she spends time with her friends as well. With a side story that had me sobbing throughout the third act, I truly can't remember when movie left my jaw on the floor in terms of an emotional impact. This is a film that cares solely about these characters and I was completely invested in each and every one of them.Written and directed by the incredibly talented Alfonso Cuarón, this film is showcased in a way that has the audience feel as though they're peering in on a family in crisis. This movie is an observation of family life and how rapidly it can change. Throughout horrible consequences or brief, happy moments, Alfonso Cuarón is able to display breathtaking cinematography that makes the movie itself feel like a character telling its own story. When a filmmaker can accomplish something like that, with long takes to further deepen the story, you know we have a gem on our hands. This man doesn't make enough films as far as I'm concerned and this is just another piece of impeccable entertainment that he can add to his resumé.Having never seen Yalitza Aparicio appear in anything before this appearance as the leading lady in Roma, I can confidently say that she should absolutely quit her day job if it isn't acting. Not only did she sell herself as this character in a way that stuck with me, but her expressions that range from fear to sadness, joy to love, and even devotion to commitment, her performance had my eyes glued to the screen for the full 135 minutes. Even though it may seem lengthy to some, I didn't think a single frame of this movie was wasted. Even throughout the slow moments, there were multiple levels of storytelling going on. When such a simple premise can be made to feel this epic in scale, I have nothing but unrequited love for it.In the end, Roma doesn't just have it all in terms of writing and directing, but those aspects are taken to new heights throughout these performances and the overall film that has incredible emotion throughout, ultimately builds to a couple of different climax's, and each of them feel either earned or absolutely shocking. As I mentioned, there was a specific moment toward the end of the movie where I just couldn't help but open my jaw wide. The payoff of one of the storylines is absolutely nothing what I expected. Roma is emotionally powerful from start to finish and I simply can't recommend it enough. Now streaming on Netflix of all places and probably up for many awards in the coming months, Roma is a true gem."
ROMA,21 February 2019,5/10,"My Review/ Or really a mini essay on a film I just don't get?I can't remember ever seeing an Academy Award nominated movie, TEN in fact on a television screen a week before it probably will win all the major awards?I watched it again on Netflix tonight and wondered how it's even eligible? Netflix gave Roma a very limited theatrical release in November 2018 then began streaming it a month later , that must be a first for an Academy Award nominated best film.
I wanted to watch it again to see if I'd missed any of the great cinematic praise Roma has received.
I'm still of the opinion that its Netflix money and marketing that has catapulted this Netflix property and its director and stars to the dizzy heights of The Academy Awards to be held at The Dolby Theatre next Monday.As The Emperors New Clothes fable tells us if you're told by enough people that something is great or true you begin to believe it.I can see why director Alfonso Cuaron has been praised for recreating the experience of his childhood growing up in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood in Mexico City but he's not even a character in it? I give credit where due as the camerawork is impressive , especially in the street scenes , on a television screen anyway.BUT! let's get real here ,does an Upstairs Downstairs tale of a young servant who spends her days picking up dog shit for her disgruntled surly Very unpleasant employee and on her day off goes to the Cinema, sleeps with a guy on the first date and isn't fazed by this Willy waving martial Arts maniac dancing around the bed before sex enough to say no thanks and is understandably distressed when the idiot takes off and rejects her.Of course she gets pregnant on the first date and without giving any plot away, I can't really as I truly lost the plot in this movie.The acting is convincing Yalitza Aparicio plays Cleo the servant and is nominated along side Glenn Close and Olivia Coleman but it's her very first movie and is this movie acting or a documentary star turn first effort?
The Political climate of the time in Mexico obviously was very volatile but none of this is explained and the Guerrilla training scenes only explain what a drop kick Cleo's taste in boyfriend is.
The violent scenes that follow in the department store are ironic and improbable to say the least.I'm very tough on this movie I know because I realise my taste in movies can be very different to others and I respect people seem to love this movie .
At least I'm saying why I find this 135 minute telemovie unworthy of the Best Picture, Best Director , and definitely not Best Actress Academy award next Monday I wouldn't even give it Best Foreign Movie , The Polish movie Cold War to my mind is a superior movie."
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"I admire movies of this kind; movies that feel simple and spontaneous, and have unrestrained plot. But I prepare myself before watching a movie of this kind; simply because I usually don't find myself connected emotionally with these movies. And I was ready to watch one of these art-house movies that I appreciate from the artistic and technical standpoint more than truly enjoying them. But Roma really took me off guard. Because I found out that Cuarón took this artistic approach in making this movie just to tie the somewhat loose plot of an ordinary story into an emphatic and heart-wrenching force.Cuarón's audiovisual motifs find their way across the film, not for the sake of showing his masterful skills, but to represent metaphorically, or sometimes literally, the characters' feelings, characteristics, nature, express their relationships to each other, and to mark major turning points in the story. When he doesn't use metaphors, Caurón plays, literally, with the contrast between background and foreground, and therefore allowing us to witness the currently unfocused on characters. This give me an opportunity to experience what all characters feel at every moment, and not loosing touch with any one of them at all. Furthermore, this gave the movie some kind of vividness that elevated the experience of watching it even more.By doing so, Cuarón didn't just give us a phenomenal piece of cinema, but he also subverted the art-house film genre, and proved that films can be as technically flawless and outstanding as they are thoroughly accessible and absorbing.The first act is a combination of simplicity and innovative visual storytelling.
The third act showcases Cuarón at the top of his visual craft, and that's when his signature long takes were prevalent, and each was as masterful as the last. But there's one in particular that sent chills down my spine, and kept me on the edge of my seat.
The second act, however, is more artistically enthralling than emotionally. Flawless from the narrative and technical, of course, aspects, but it's more ""Arthouse"" and meditative than anything else. It has some of the most beautiful shots, and moments, of the movie, though. And I really can't say that the movie lost me even for a split second.The story isn't the most original thing you'll ever encounter. Actually, the characters arcs are quite familiar, but that doesn't take away even the slightest hint of greatness from this masterwork due to the completely unorthodox and refreshing ways the film narrated, structured, shot, and edited in. That said, I couldn't help notice the stereotypical character arc of Sra. Sofía (Marina de Tavira's character) at the end of the movie. Cleo, on the other hand, has enough genuine nuances and twists in her character arc that breathed new life into the character, let alone Yalitza Aparicio's spellbinding performance. Nevertheless, Marina de Tavira's committed performance is nothing short of stellar.I hope Roma will jump start a career for Yalitza Aparicio. I already knew that many critics praised her performance in this movie, claiming that she gave one of the best performances of the year, but I really didn't expect that her performance will fascinate me like it did. For as much as I admired Hamilton Morris's performance in Sweet Country, or Brady Jandreau's in The Rider, I appreciated them for their naturalism and authenticity more than anything else. But as for Yalitza Aparicio, I really can't make up my mind whether her performance or Emily Blunt's in A Quiet Place is the best performance by an actress I've seen this year so far. And the same goes with these two movies they starred in as well.Alfonso Cuarón doesn't go with the flow neither by giving priority to politics over anything else, nor by squandering his creative vision for the sake of making Hollywood cash-grab blockbusters. He stays true to his idiosyncratic vision, and faithful to his jaw-dropping trademarks. And here he is making yet another masterpiece that is captivating, poignant, personal and subversive all at once. And easily one of the most accessible art-house films ever made!(9/10)"
ROMA,17 December 2019,6/10,"I was excited to watch Roma, as I love black and white films. This one is beautifully shot, comprising mostly long, slow, meditative pans. The moral of ¨the story¨, to the extent that there is one, seems to be that the world would be better without men. Seems like a strange message, and it probably would not have worked if the film had been directed by a female, who would have been accused of being a ball-busting man hater. Since Roma was directed by a man, however, people seem to be ignoring this aspect of the film altogether.I enjoyed watching this creation as a piece of visual art. Even the omnipresent matte gray dog poop in the foyer failed to look repulsive, as it does in technicolor. Each screen shot was like a well-composed photograph, but the story was considerably less compelling. This is a world in which color and men have been removed, and the survivors are happier as a result.I am somewhat surprised by the avalanche of awards heaped upon Roma, which may have something to do with the currently fashionable ¨me too¨ movement. I predict that this film will undergo critical reevaluation in the decades to come."
ROMA,31 December 2019,7/10,The first hour and a half is mundane but the final half an hour is nothing shorter than masterful.
ROMA,14 December 2018,8/10,"It was a nice personal story by the brilliant Alfonso Cuaron. A personal tale that invites us to Mexico in the 70s and showing us two different lives that dont seem to be too different from each other, although on the surface they appear to be.
To be honest, I liked the film but I dont think it is the second coming of Christ like many folks treat it to be. You can perfectly soak into that world and kind of spend the year with the characters but I think I related less to it than most people did.
The acting was very solid, especially lead actress Yalitza Aparicio is great and gives a touching performance that really goes under your skin at times. Marina de Tavira was also memorable.
The true star of the film is Cuaron himself tho. A multitask talent who was involved in most aspects of the film. The screenplay was very well written and the characters development good. The direction was quite solid as you really never knew where the film is going to.
The best aspects were the cinematography, which is among the best of the year and the production design which was amazing as well.
There were some lengths in my opinion that hurt the experience a little. But as an homage to Cuaron' s youth it is a film you can easily respect."
ROMA,23 December 2018,8/10,"Roma is a drama film written and directed by Alfonso Cuarón (Gravity, Children of Men). Told primarily from the perspective of a single housemaid, it is a touching personal story from the acclaimed director.In 1970, Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez (Yalitza Aparicio) works as a live-in housemaid for a middle class family in the Mexican suburb of Roma. Despite the family's ups and downs as well as her own personal problems, Cleo is always there to help out and put other's needs above her own.Poignant and down-to-earth, Roma's realistic approach to story telling leaves a lasting impression on the viewer thanks to director Alfonso Cuarón's own personal take on the source material. If there's one thing we can learn from Cuarón's filmmaking, it is that he is master of cinematography. The beautiful lingering shots of the 1970s Mexican streets and beaches firmly establish the atmosphere of that particular era and they help give the film a unique artistic integrity not often seen nowadays. In addition to this, the film is shot in black and white, which gives it a somewhat documentary-like feeling. Overall, this may not be for everyone but anyone interested in films about Mexican life from decades past will surely be entertained.I rate it 8/10"
ROMA,26 December 2018,8/10,Its surprising how a well thought out and cinematographicaly solid black and white film can be so colourful. Expect a slow boil in this long hard road of a film that so well represented life in Mexico city.Also expect lots of dogs and men behaving very badly.
ROMA,26 February 2019,8/10,"Say what you will about Roma's story, but the filmmaking behind it is simply stunning. The long takes sprinkled throughout are undeniably impressive and help suck you into Cleo's bleak situation. This is clearly a very personal story for Alfonso Cuarón and he treats it as such. Yes, Roma doesn't have the most immersive story, but the camerawork makes up for it in some regards. It almost becomes a character itself in the film. While Roma likely won't go down as an all time great among screenplays, its cinematography and direction will be long remembered."
ROMA,28 December 2018,7/10,"Roma may have been the most beautifully filmed movie I have seen this decade, let alone this year. Whether I was watching someone park a car or fight a fire or wade into the ocean, it was absolutely breathtaking. In many ways, that was enough to keep me watching and caring. The protagonist's journey mattered, and the city's journey mattered. The care with which the movie was shot made that impossible to miss. But I always stayed slightly distant too. I was observing how the story was told rather than being sucked into the story itself. There were literally central characters whose names I never learned and whose fates felt less than important as a result. Was it well done? Unquestionably. But was it a great story? I would say mostly. The people in it felt real. Their city felt real. The moments felt real. And every scene was shot like life depended on the outcome. The end result was gorgeous, even if I wanted a bit more drama."
ROMA,28 December 2018,8/10,"This year, the director of Children of Men and Gravity, Alfonso Cuaron, made a film in his homeland of Mexico entitled Roma. What makes this film pretty notable amongst his other work is that this is a very personal flick for the guy, considering that it is set in the 1970s, the decade he grew up in. In fact, the film is named after the Colonia Roma in Mexico City, so one can tell how nostalgic this must have been for the director. But how does it work as a whole?The film revolves around the hard life of a live-in housekeeper named Cleo, who works for an upper-class family. That's mainly it, and truth be told, the non-linear narrative works in its favor. At its core, Roma is about the hardships of living poor in a country that went through many struggles and riots around said time. Cleo is a very sympathetic character given what goes on in the feature, and Yalitza Aparicio did a great job selling her intentionally insecure presence to resonate with the tumultuous tone of the feature. Even at that though, there are as many humorous moments as there are somber ones, making any given scene appropriately played out depending on the situation.The cinematography is another added bonus, even with the film being shot in black & white. In addition to the calm and brisk feel of the town, there are plenty of long establishing shots that help convey what is going on much better than if there were a quick cut every ten seconds. Probably the highlights in terms of the filmmaking aspect are the scenes with so much activity going on, especially when the family visits their caucasian cousins where so much personality bursts out of the screen. For a film made on a relatively low budget, the amount of effort that was put into it really makes us feel like we're experiencing pure Mexico. It's great when the atmosphere elevates the film's story much more than expected, especially when there is no cohesive plot.All in all, I definitely give Roma a recommendation for its simple albeit unpredtitcable non-linear narrative that details the life of people growing up through numerous trials and tribulations. Whether or not you can get into unconventionally crafted films like this, it's at least worthy to view the emotions of each given character, especially the children, whom are very endearing when they need to be. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for a feature that's mainly meant to show more than necessarily tell, it pulls off the job quite well."
ROMA,2 January 2019,9/10,"When I see films like this, it makes me wonder why they ever bothered inventing colour film. There's so much depth, the frame just sucks you in. The camera movements simple, but so effective as they drift around suburban Mexico City, it's streets and it's slums. There's no hurry, in the story, the camera, the cut. It's a breath of fresh air. Time works differently here and it's easy to be fooled with the lack of colour that this was shot in the 70s where the story is set instead of today. It's a work of cinematic beauty depicting social and political upheaval, but there's a purity to it, with a feeling that nothing's added without purpose. Music only if it's in the scene, otherwise only voices, sometimes raised, but often calm. Dogs barking, birds singing, the camera lingering on both the good and the inexplicably bad. Heart warming and breaking. Good things happening to bad people and vice versa, but it's the grey area in between that offers hope. The world is not black and white. This is beautiful."
ROMA,9 September 2021,9/10,"Alfonso Cuarón is one of my favourite filmmakers working today. He displays such flair with the camera and the stories he tells. With Roma, he has made his most personal and honest film yet.Roma shows us a year in the life of a middle-class family's maid in Mexico City during the early 1970s.What I genuinely love in Alfonso Cuarón's films apart from the story is the way he uses the camera. Not only do the long takes he does look incredibly impressive but it feels like a character itself. Cuarón focuses on the immersive quality of films and the way he blends the camera into scenes of action and emotion brings us into the film's world and leaves us entranced till the very end. His latest film, Roma, is a prime example of this. Being his own cinematographer, Cuarón uses stunning long/medium shots panning around the location without breaking the take for extended periods of time, providing a transcendent experience like no other. Told through the perspective of Cleo, Cuarón takes us through her struggles and hardships as well as the family's she works for and the city in general. His moving camera here takes upon the role of the audience and guides us through the scenarios as if we were witnessing it first-hand. What adds to the immersion is the amazing sound design. The sounds heard from the background of every shot builds to create a natural environment that captures the raw intensity or drama displayed by the visuals. I wish I saw this in cinemas to get the full effect of the sound design because it's that good.There's no doubt that Roma is one of the best shot films I've seen. Aside from capturing the troubles these characters go through and the turmoil the city is in, the intricacy of those shots are impressive in itself. There are scenes involving hundreds of extras with stuff going on in the background and it's such a feat for the eyes. It's no wonder Alfonso Cuarón won Best Director. Every single performance in Roma is fantastic. Yalitza Aparicio is phenomenal as Cleo. She gives such a natural and believable performance that it's crazy to think that this is her first time acting. There are some scenes that demand a lot from her but she pulls them off brilliantly. Marina de Tavira was fantastic in the supporting role and the children acted very well.Roma is yet another fantastic Alfonso Cuarón film. It's a nice change of pace from him and felt very special considering how intimate it felt to him. Cuarón displayed top-notch filmmaking once again and gave another reason as to why he's such a great director."
ROMA,23 December 2018,9/10,A true movie lover deserve a movie like Roma. Splendid performances and cinematography. Hats off Alfonso Cuaron.
ROMA,15 December 2018,7/10,"I feel very similarly to Roma as I did to Dunkirk, though they are extraordinarily different films and subject matters. Both are made by directors I love, and both I appreciate the constant technical brilliance shown in each scene. Ultimately in both cases I was emotionally detached and thought it was a good movie but not at all a memorable one. There is no doubt that Roma leans entirely on Aparicio, and she knocks it out of the park. The subtlety to her acting and her body language and uses of silence are excellent. As is Cuaron's hallmark, the cinematography is excellent, and particularly the 360 pan with Cleo turning off the lights was well shot. The childbirth and ocean scenes were enrapturing and tense. The scene in the furniture store was my favorite of the movie - the intersection of the small private world we've seen with the family and the student protests outside was well shot and executed.
I can intellectually appreciate all the things Roma has to offer, and can understand why some think it's a masterpiece and the best of the year. If it emotionally connected with people and had them crying at the end, I just didn't have that experience. It's a very well done slice of life movie that focuses on appreciation for a maid who does everything for a family, and in going through her daily life we see other major events unfold. But despite consistently great acting and cinematography and several really good scenes, the vast majority of the movie varied from smart but detached filmmaking to mundane, every day life. Maybe the black and white and Spanish elements also contributed, but I just didn't particularly enjoy most of the individual scenes. Reflecting on it as a full piece and the motifs that we see throughout allow me to enjoy and appreciate it more, but while watching it I just wasn't invested. I'm glad most love it and think this is just me not connecting with the film, but while Roma is a technical marvel, it was just a fine story."
ROMA,16 January 2019,6/10,"This was a decent film that had some beautiful shots. I can't stress that enough, it looked great. That said the pacing was really bad. I was bored throughout half of it. It was a pretty sad story of a maid in Mexico who lives with the family. It follows her life and she had a pretty rough go the year of taping it. You did feel for her but it was just a bit too boring for me."
ROMA,28 July 2020,9/10,"When it comes to a movie like this, one does not know where to even start, to describe the impact it has. Certainly if you are a fan of Iron Man, Transformers, The Fast and the Furious, Avengers or Black Panther you're not going to enjoy this film, most likely. It's just too close to the truth and it cuts too close to the Bone. It is just too realistic.This is a stunning character study, this is a film that completely captures a time and a place, this is a great bit of story telling, with a tremendous production that looks and feels like 1970 - 1971. This film is a great achievement. It is slow paced. It is
not a happy film. To the naysayers, I say stick with the Avengers. This film is not an amusement park ride, it is a slice of life, shot arrestingly, and with great power."
ROMA,24 February 2019,3/10,"Kept asking myself ""What is going on here""? When will the storyline kick in? I gave it 40 minutes and turned it off. At least I gave it a chance. Slow and storyless👎"
ROMA,26 January 2019,6/10,"The movies that I really enjoy are movies that, should I come across them on some cable station once I've already seen them, I could watch at least in part again. ""Roma"" is not one of those movies. Yes, the film-making itself is wonderful and the acting, especially by the inexperienced lead, is impressive, but most of it is rather boring. There are some emotional moments toward the end, but many viewers may not make it that far with their eyes open. Movies about 'normal life' are generally not very exciting, as 'normal life' is rarely exciting. And the way this film is edited, you often feel like you missed something because of the quickness with which scenes change. Perhaps one has to be part of the Mexican culture to really enjoy this, but I have to wonder if the current state of politics in the U.S. didn't have something to do with its nomination for an Academy Award. Frankly, I don't know that it should even have been nominated for best foreign film. Neither my wife not I felt this film lived up to the hype."
ROMA,10 January 2019,8/10,"Roma Review:Roma is a Mexican film directed and written by Alfonso Cuarón depicting a year for a maid and the middle class family she works for in Mexico City in the 1970s. This is the foreign film that everyone has been talking about. I haven't heard this much buzz about a foreign film since Pan's Labyrinth and Amour. I saw this for the first time about a month ago and just recently watched it again. I think this is an excellent film with a great story and wonderful performances. Yalitza Aparicio is absolutely amazing with her first acting performance ever. She's been getting Oscar buzz but I don't think she'll make it into Best Actress. She shows so much emotion and there's so much development through her heartbreaking story. Yalitza is the main star of the movie and everyone is talking about her. Alfonso Cuarón does amazing with this movie. He did so much with it consisting of writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and producing. He will most likely win Best Director for the Oscars as he did for the Golden Globes. Screenplay is hard to say but I don't think he'll win. The cinematography is beautiful! It's all in black and white but every shot was thought through carefully and shot beautifully. It will for sure win Best Cinematography. The story conveys so many emotions with a heartbreaking final act. I don't want to give much away because it's so good and shouldn't be spoiled. The movie is a little long and some scenes could've been shortened down a bit. If you have time and have Netflix, check it out. Definitely check this one out before the Oscars.My Grade: A"
ROMA,31 October 2019,1/10,"Nowadays, very little in the filmmaking world is more pretentious than making a black and white film. Granted, there are some who use it very well by reserving it for flashbacks, highlighting the most important items on screen using extreme color contrasts, or to draw focus to a significant event. But Roma isn't any of those. In fact, it's even the opposite of that, with the worst case being the only flash of drama in the entire script barely visible in the pitch black foreground while our eyes are drawn to watch a movie screen instead of the actual important events. Roma is in the pretentious category of directors who aren't capable of defending artistic decisions, so as soon as they receive any criticism they automatically default to attack the critic by saying they're too inferior to appreciate black and white. No, you're just a bad director.Not only is this director pretentious, he also strongly believes he is an artist. This is all too apparent as he constantly shoves ""art"" in our faces with incessant long shots and rotating pans. Long shots aren't impressive for the sake of being a long shot. They're only impressive when a considerable number of choreographed events take place during the long shot. Roma has exactly zero of those because every long shot has virtually nothing happening on screen. The horizontal rotating pans are also terribly choreographed with the object of interest continuously on the verge of being panned out of the shot. Also, so many of them in quick succession is enough to make anyone watching on a big screen sickeningly dizzy. Every scene in this film makes it painfully apparent how proud of himself the director is, like a child proud of their stick figure drawing.Enough about the director, let's talk about the plot. Nearly nothing of interest happens for the first half of the film, and to make matters worse, it's written so badly that it never piques even the smallest bit of interest. Then in the second half, far too much happens way too quickly. It was as if the writer realized the first half was terribly boring, but he didn't know how to fix it other than throwing in random ""exciting"" and edgy events with complete disregard to how the events fit into the plot. The horrible writing speaks volumes about the screenwriter's talent. Unsurprisingly, the director is also the screenwriter. Surprisingly, the director/writer is Cuaron.If I didn't know any better, I would have guessed this movie was made by a brand new director who doesn't realize the arrogance he has in his talents is very undeserved. Literally the only good thing about this movie is the camera picture quality, which only requires money and no talent. I'm honestly surprised that Cuaron was even capable of making such an all-around horrible disasterpiece."
ROMA,12 February 2019,2/10,"A film that definitely needs to be embedded into any film school curriculum for it's sheer making and nothing else but as an audience, oh please spare me.The writing was more of a visual medium of a book. The conversion from the bookish story to the film needs elimination of detailed characteristics or moments. The screenplay is average if not good but definitely not excellent and the story is so very cliche that I feel the Hollywood is going down with selection of films into the Oscars. But wait, the film itself is of a maid and every little detail matters but if so, that should have been a documentary and we have seen, read, heard such cliche stories in the past. What's new in this film is nothing. Watching this lady's daily life is like anyone watching their daily life from another point of view. Why would you do that.Show Hollywood a bit of dirt from South America or Asia and they'll go gaga over how bad the life in these places are which in fact was made by the lust of the dumb Europeans who messed up the sanctity of the world.This film is very overrated as a film but in individual departments like cinematography, lighting, art, and costumes it excels well but making such a big deal of it is a tad too much.10 minutes into the film and I couldn't already bare it anymore. Horribly wastage of so much of money. Skip this film and you will miss nothing. Though it was a very plain below average emotional journey, it was in fact a torture of a boring kind."
ROMA,29 June 2021,6/10,"Typical routine for a director to waste the film because he or she aims it for Oscars not for the audience. Cuaron's last five or six movies drew many viewers and were critically acclaimed, and his next goal would be an award. However, 'Roma' is unbearably slow-paced. I understand that abstract images and symbolism are critics' favorites, but they are just means, not the goal of the movie. For example, 'Minari' and 'Frances Ha' share similar characteristics with this one. The whole movie follows ordinary life of a person or a family very plainly, does not have many dramas or ups-and-downs, and embodies images and scenes that inspire bigger stories or messages. So, I become patient even though the movie is a little slow because during those times my mind and thoughts just flow endlessly to understand what the director intended. However, scenes in 'Roma' which is supposed to be artistic (I guess) seems sudden, unfit, and extra. For example, scenes like Cleo singing looking at the camera, Cleo cleaning the dog poop, and a wrestler doing yoga, and even the forest burning (which is huge event) does not mean anything or connect to something in the movie even though those scenes take a long time in the movie. Every scene and image matters and tells something in great movies, but gosh, 'Roma' wastes a lot of them.Cuaron uses water as as a tool to signal the negative things, which is very unusual and unique. Water often symbolizes the beginning, birth, refreshment, and something positive. In 'Roma', the city is filled with puddles, and it rains in the city when the bad things are about to happen. In contrast, when the family and Cleo went to country for Christmas, the woods are burnt down. Immediately fire is associated with destruction and disaster, but Cleo says it is the sight and the smell of her home. All the water expressed in the movie feels sticky and muddy, for example, in the scene where maids clean the roads in the beginning because of the sight and the sound. Therefore, when I see her water broke, and the camera focuses on the water (this one feels very sticky too), I can predict some bad things will happen. At the end, yet, water becomes the catalyst for stronger bond and emotional cleansing, and the feeling of water changes to be fresh and strong again. Paradoxical juxtaposition of water and fire and of begging and the end is interesting to watch."
ROMA,23 February 2019,9/10,"If you really want to know the truth about person, ask the apparently insignificant. It's said that legendary British football manager Sir Alex Ferguson knew the names of all the staff at his club - cleaners and all - and greeted them by name when he passed them in a corridor. Hence the fierce loyalty to him found throughout the organisation. Those we may not notice, notice much,Roma is a film about the people and the things we may not notice - but who notice much. On the face of it, this is a simple story. A year in the life of Cleo, a domestic worker for a middle class family in Mexico City, 1970 (the film's title is taken from a district of the city). The director is Alfonso Cuarón (he also edits, writes and is cinematographer - it really is his film), director of Gravity, the best Harry Potter film (Prisoner of Azkaban) and Children of Men. It's his first film set in his native Mexico for many years, and he's said that much of the film is taken from his own childhood memories; the maid he knew growing up is a significant figure in his life, who appears in bit parts in some of his films.This is an apparently slow, patient film - but there is a good reason for this. The pace allows us to see what Cleo sees - Cuarón's camera lingers on scenes for longer than would be normal, allowing us to observe details that would otherwise be overlooked. We see the long process of Cleo switching on all the lights in the house, an essential process, but one otherwise unobserved and unnoticed in the execution.This is also a film about women picking up the pieces of men's lives, literally and metaphorically. The man of the household scolds Cleo for not picking up the mess from the dog - another member of the house starved for affection and begging to be noticed. Cleo grows close to a man, Fermin, who is training in martial arts. The morning after a night together, he is training in front of her, naked. Afterwards he sits on the bed, back turned to her, pouring out his childhood suffering to her. It becomes tragically inevitable later that she is left to pick up the pieces of his relational failures alone. As the woman of the house pointedly says to her ""No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone."" Again, the camera lingers, long and patient, the better to heighten the impact - like happens in a much later, even more tragic scene; forcing us to watch we wish would never happen. It's achingly moving, and strikingly intimate.Not unlike Moonlight, it seemed to me that water is a key part in the connecting tissue of this film; we open on a long shot of a tiled floor being washed by the soapy water of Cleo's work; the film's revelatory and emotional climax is a sea scene where unvoiced shame is finally given expression. Is it a rebirth? By the end it certainly feels as if Cleo, and the family for which she works, has undergone a kind of rebirth - but the implication may be that, for her at least, little actually changes.Roma is a rich, eloquent, beautiful film that settles gently in the memory, shots and feelings and ideas taking up long-term residence. It seems likely to repay repeated rewatching, enabling us to notice more that we would otherwise have brushed over. It's slow, lingering pace allows us to feel as if we are walking with Cleo, learning from her, seeing her, truly noticing her.Roma is transcendent experience that invites to notice those we hurry past and take for granted. It is not a film to be forgotten or ignored."
ROMA,2 March 2020,8/10,"The camera is the third person. It watches the whole scene, knows what will happen next and already moves to the next spot. Always slow, never too much hurry.The whole film feels like a documentary. Slowly narrated and fantastically filmed. It moves on and on and in the first half you feel like in a dream. An then suddenly the tempo oushes forward - a fes shocking moments, that makes you cry, gives the whole thing a majestic touch.This film is special. Nothing usual."
ROMA,22 December 2018,10/10,"There's a reason Roma has received more praise than any other film this year. Every shot is beautifully shot and is full of details that make it feel simultaneously real and poetic. That's the real magic of Roma I think, how Cuaron has created a realistic experience that is also highly stylistic. It's incredible. From the start, when we see water spill over the floor and a plane reflected in it, we know we're in for a treat.Cuaron's characteristic long takes are a big part of what makes the visuals so special. They allow you to marvel at the framing and the detail of the world. There are few close-ups. This type of visual storytelling doesn't tell you what to look at or what to think. Some, used to Hollywood hand-holding, might not like this. One of the most powerful scenes is seeing Cleo give birth to a stillborn child. The whole thing is presented on one shot, with no time jumps, immersing the viewer with its realism. The still shots also heighten family drama to another level. The mother telling the kids their father isn't going to come back is such an emotionally engaging scene in part because of the fact that it is a several-minute scene in one take.Most beautiful are the scenes simply showing the city and the landscape, such as where the camera tracks Cleo walking down a sidewalk. The dirt, the bustle and the atmosphere are all captured perfectly in these slice-of-life scenes, which display a great attention to detail. You can see so many things as the camera moves past, a woman shaking out an awning and so on. You also see social disparities communicated through the details.While the political turmoil is not the main focus, it is present. The Corpus Christi Massacre is shown with horrible realism. There is no graphic violence here, just a display of what this chaos had on ordinary people. This is far more distressing than watching graphic gore.It's not just the visuals that have led to Roma's praise. Cuaron has a way of expressing his memories of Mexico in a way that is realistic and objective, yet poetic and personal. The wide shots don't tell you what to think, yet they give you so many things to think about. The character drama is purposeful in its build-up, regularly refusing to be sensationalist and soapy. Someone used to lesser films might expect more outbreaks of violence and shouting. Instead, the character drama is handled in a defter way.The forest fire scene is one of the most controversial in Roma. It's undeniably well shot, lodging itself into your mind. What is the meaning of the singing man in the suit? Is his apparent lack of care about the destruction going on around him a symbol of the zero stakes he has in the rich world he isn't really a part of? Cleo joins in fighting the fire while the man is the single person who doesn't. Not only does this scene tell us about the unnamed man but it also tells us about Cleo.And Cleo is undoubtedly the focus of the film. She is the character whose story sweeps you into 1970s Mexico. It is remarkable that despite her status as a servant, she is a bigger part of the family than the father. Many scenes show her special qualities, yet she is a nuanced, remarkably fleshed out character. The conflict between her role as a part of the family and her separate life is the main source of tension in the film. This conflict is itself used to comment on inequality in Mexico as the father of her child abandons her at the first opportunity, leaving her in a desperate situation where if she has her child she will be unable to continue her job the same way as before but as a result will be unable to care for it. The fact that it ends up being stillborn allows her to evade the full implications of that question, but the fact that she had been hoping for it to be stillborn is a twisted commentary on the harsh reality of life if you are poor.Despite the tragedy, Cleo's failure to build her own family makes a resolution to her inner conflict possible. It doesn't happen straight away; at first she is at a distance from the kids at the beach. But in the powerful climax, when she is needed, she makes her choice. It's a masterful ending to a masterful character study."
ROMA,29 December 2018,9/10,"I nearly cried during the first shot and it was the credits over a damn floor. Cuarón's direction is exquisite in its patience, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail with long tracking shots, intimate close-ups, busy backgrounds, and remarkable soundscapes. Beyond its aesthetic beauty though, it's poignant in its ability to tell a story (Aparicio's great turn helps of course)-this one being a powerful character study about finding strength and peace amidst chaos (see Cleo's one-leg stand)."
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"If you were asked to tell a story to a bunch of strangers, what would it be about? A colourful and grand tale of adventure, or a more somber and subjective story you would rather not talk about? Mexican writer/director Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is one such story where ordinary characters find themselves in situations so commonplace, you could say these situations occur to a million people every day. But if a thing of beauty is a joy forever, Roma will be remembered for a long time, simply due to the immersive nature in which this story is told.Known for his sweeping long takes, Cuaron's opening shot is just over four minutes long of a driveway being washed with soap and water. For a Netfilx release, there is an ever present danger when watching this film on TV or a handheld device, in that viewers could be tempted to fast forward seemingly unimportant segments through the course of the film. A little bit of patience will go a long way in rewarding the viewer with not just one, but two incredibly emotive moments that are both staggering to take in. For this to achieve full impact, we are first conditioned by the mesmerizing nature in which the story unfolds. When the camera finally lifts up, we see the person cleaning the driveway. She is the domestic help to an upper middle-class family in the titular Mexican city. Though indigenous, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) is very much part of the family she serves, yet her place as the help is clearly defined. Cleo's Caucasian employers are Sofia and her husband Antonio, their four children, and the children's grandmother. But there's trouble brewing in the family. Antonio's unexplained and lengthy travels (as a doctor) often leaves Sofia and the kids in a state of dysfunction. From regularly cleaning up dog poop to comforting the kids when they fight, Cleo is eager to help out in every way possible. All this changes the day Cleo learns she is pregnant. Worse, the egocentric would-be-father wants nothing to do with it.From Children of Men in 2006 and Gravity in 2013, Cuaron's nuance is in the way his characters are subjected to an impending crisis and the chaotic nature of said crisis. Roma has a lot of that crisis, but this time Cuaron is invoking a very personal story in what has been referred to as a semi-biographical episode during his upbringing. There is both a clear adoration and tribute to the women who raised him, but it's the manner in which they are presented that makes this film more of a memoir than a conventionally told narrative. After an hour or so of runtime, it becomes clear that there is not much of a plot, but a series of events strung together like sequences from a dream. This is where the film gets its heft. Circa early 1970s, Mexican socio-political events unfold in several frames, but mainly in the background. Like a renaissance painting, there is so much happening on almost all corners of the screen that it's easy to lose track of the strong bond forming between Cleo and the family she serves - Testament of which lies in the last fifteen minutes of the film, or the second of two powerfully crafted moments in the story; Powerful and moving, and all without a musical score or even the expressive sound of a violin.Presented in crisp, clean, 65mm black and white, this is also Cuaron serving as cinematographer for the first time. The result is a rich, visually stunning array of compositions filled with jaw dropping texture and depth. Coupled with Cuaron's signature long takes and stupendously juxtaposed satire, we are drawn into an entire world made with gorgeous micro-macro detail. But it's a world we watch objectively and from the sidelines. Perhaps that is part of the point of this film - a monochromatic introspection that transcends stereotypical bias on gender, class and race. Aparicio (in her debut role) conjures this feeling in Cleo with remarkable realism. It's in the way she looks, talks, and nurtures the family. It's in the way she mothers those kids as her own. It's in the way she is needed but also taken for granted. Yet, when it's her turn to receive help, all she has is us looking back in awe but also suffering with her. In any other film, all this would be mere melodrama but with Cuaron's as the auteur, Roma is a beautiful film crafted with meticulous detail. With limited release in cinemas, most people will be limited to watching this film on a Netflix streaming device. That shouldn't be a problem when the best part of this film is its soul and not its size."
ROMA,16 December 2018,,"Through this technical and narrative wonder, Cuaron proves again that he is the best and the most complete contemporary filmmaker. Large-scale set pieces that are deliberate for others just look like a piece of cake for him. The angle and focus of the camera are so accurate that a simple long take would solve everything. Emotionally this film is a tribute to women and mothers. The fate of the central figure Cleo attracts the attention of audiences towards the last frame of the film.In some sense, Roma is a mixture of Gravity plus Children of Men, and is even better than either of them. It was unfair for Gravity to lose to 12 Years a Slave. This time, however, Roma would not lose to another black film Black Panther."
ROMA,23 March 2019,7/10,"Underdog stories are always a hit with audiences. In Alfonso Cuaron's 'Roma' - a tale of the hard times for a housemaid in 1970s Mexico City, this comes through loud and clear, as we follow the trials of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) as she experiences everything from heartache to sexism to loss.Despite all the many accolades it's received, 'Roma' is not for everyone. The story is very linear, and it feels sort of like a home movie. Cleo is seen as an important yet hardly respected member of an upper-middle class family, as she does everything from clean the walkways to hang the laundry to take care of the young children, all while trying to have a life of her own. Of course, things take a downward turn (why wouldn't they, given the serious subject matter), and we see Cleo needing to overcome nearly insurmountable obstacles.While the story is somewhat basic and the acting is strong but nothing spectacular, 'Roma' is special thanks to the film techniques Cuaron uses. The Oscar-winning cinematography is amazing, showing the rustic beauty of Mexico City, and the fact that it was shot in black-and-white also gives the film a dated feeling.'Roma' is a Netflix original film that shows there is a lot still to come from the company."
ROMA,9 January 2019,5/10,"In the light of today's BAFTA nominations I had to pull my socks up and watch Roma.I started it before Christmas but I wasn't in the mood, it seemed a little dull at the time. But that was probably the time of year I thought.Nope.Tonight I endured its full effect. All 135 minutes of it.The first 80 made some of the French New Wave's slower stuff seem like Prodigy videos.But it got better.Seriously, I have had more fun in my first job, in which I spent 72 hours extracting staples from booklets.It is colossally slow.Literally NOTHING happens.We see a lot of planes fly overhead and we see a lot, and I mean a LOT, of dogs wandering aimlessly; farm dogs, stray dogs, domestic dogs, stuffed dog heads (that was a good bit). The star dog defecates in an unprecedented manner.It takes us through Cleo's - the main protagonist - pregnancy, seemingly in real time.This is not new territory for Alfonso Cuaron. Here's what I wrote about his previous feature, Gravity, in 2013.It is exciting from time to time. But in between the exciting bits (whisper this) it's a little bit boring.Just a little bit. But. It. Is. A. Little. Bit. Boring.But Roma takes boring to Golgothan proportions, to an art form that has no equal. We're talking stumbling into monochrome art films in art galleries that you walk out of, relieved that you aren't obliged to sit through any more, after about 12 seconds.But, heavens above, after about 75 minutes suddenly a great 50 minute featurette emerges from this torpid cocoon and transmogrifies into what a cinematic treasure.It's bewildering.We're talking games of two halves here like no other. It's like a football match that's 0-0 at half time with no shots on target, no corners, throw-ins, bookings.No anything,.Followed by the first third of the second half with more of the same, until six substitutions are made simultaneously and the match ends 7 all.The transition really is that dramatic.I won't bore you with the plot (there is none) or the technical details (Cuaron did everything except dolly grip operator - and I'll tell you what, the Dolly Grip was a busy bunny as Cuaron has more pan shots than a series of Jamie Oliver TV shows).Cuaron LOVES A PAN SHOT!So, do yourself a favour. Fast forward to 70 minutes and start watching from there.You've only missed a pregnancy."
ROMA,8 March 2019,9/10,"""Rome"" expresses in its technique the purest freshness of cinema by demonstrating the magnificent magnitude of the conidian intertwined with drama and despair, it is a punch in the stomach that gets stronger due to its intrinsic beauty, an artistic expression financed by Netflix and directed by Cuaron, Mexican director multi awarded by other works, such as ""gravity"" and ""Sons of hope"".""Rome"" has a surgical script and almost imperceptible, since we are placed under an unusual point of view of the film, the domestic maid, and from it we form our painting of the work, we gain experiences, absorbing the dramas, shocks and ecantos, always with a linear narrative that cares little about rhythm or entertaining.To speak about the moral of his script and work is almost inadmissible, since Rome contemplates a vision and several ramifications and in this point he can be magical, because we do not feel the lack of deepening on plots touched, since we are confined only to the eyes of Cleo and his little world, that is, Cuaron's proposal to explain his past memories works perfectly, and we are so delighted with the film of life that little details no longer matter.In technical terms, ""Rome"" is exquisite, and it is difficult to speak of all its virtues in a single text, but we can not fail to mention the most imposing points, beginning with his photography, which can exhaust something unique and almost philosophical, since greatness of the same contrasts in simple scenes of the daily life, it is like expressing the grandiose of daily life, an odyssey of something mundane, and how often are we just taking care of our lives while magnificent things happen around? the photography of Rome overcomes the barriers of technique by highlighting such points. other points, such as its soundtrack, its composition of scenery, characterization of the 70's that are impeccable beyond the exquisite design of production.Yalitza Aparicio enchants everyone in her first pro-cinema performance, the young woman is able to transpose something real to her character, her little experience but very professionalism causes a sensation of recognition to the viewer, who then joins in mourning, compassion and love. Mariana De Tavira is in the moments that are required, and makes a character centered and completely desperate and combatant when it is accurate, its beauty contrasts its anger that result in great subplots throughout the work, in addition to moments of comic relief. Jorge Antonio is another good character in the film, since he is the pivot of some events and his character is extremely striking, even without having 5 minutes of screen.In the end, cuarón gets something unique again, the union of feeling and technique that blossoms in the best film of the year, a film that has everything a great work needs, and still causes reflection and conflicting feelings, the biggest injustice of oscar in 2019. But it is a film that deserves to be watched and contemplated by all."
ROMA,18 December 2018,10/10,"When I look back and think about the movie, this is just a movie about life. It's about how normal but abnormal, how joyful but cruel, how predictable but also unpredictable, how unfair but also fair among other things life is. The movie portrays these opposites so well that it's breathtaking. You don't necessarily have to know about what life was like in Mexico at that time. It's more or less the same struggles people deal with everywhere around the world and it's very easy to relate certain things to yourself.I was always a fan of Alfonso Cuaron's signature single shot takes and there are a couple of amazing ones here as well. There is no score music in this film and it's just music coming out of certain sources which is a direction I personally love. It makes the movie much more realistic for me. And there is no better way to accomplish this than recruiting amazing sound designers as Skip Lievsay and Craig Berkey (No Country for Old Men) in your team.Story of a maid named Cleo in 1970's Mexico."
ROMA,13 February 2019,2/10,I hate and loathe subtitles and they seem to appear more and more on Netflix. I just will not watch a film with subtitles. More over a slow moving thing about nothing much at all.
ROMA,22 December 2018,10/10,"When I saw ""The best picture of the year"" in the trailer, I really didn't think much of it; as people love to overhype movies. So I went into this blindly, not reading a word from the description, and most of the time I was puzzled with what was going on. Roma is one of those movies where you really have to think about the moral of the movie. There's no exact motive in the movie, and that's why it's so great. All of the movies I've ever seen always had an exact motive to drive the story and the characters. Roma just feels so realistic about peoples' emotions and actions.One of the biggest factors that make's this movie feel so realistic is that the story really doesn't go anywhere, like it's just going by, just like life. I see all these movies where the motives feel so unrealistic or unrelatable, which isn't a bad thing, but watching a movie that's so realistic and relatable is what makes Roma special. I've read some reviews saying ""I don't understand what's really the point of this movie"", and that's why it's such a great representation of life, because, ""what is the point of life?""The characters are by far the best part of the movie. Not only is the story realistic and relatable, but so are the characters. A wife stuck with her children because of an unloyal husband, a woman who was left by her partner due to an unplanned pregnancy, and children who are stuck in no man's land with a dysfunctional family. Yalitza Aparicio, the woman who plays Cleo did a fantastic job; it was her first big movie and she nailed it. The acting in general was amazing, it really made the movie more emotional and believable; even the kids who played the children were believeable.The movie is on the slow side, being over two hours, which is mostly because of the long panning shots. I know some people who hate long panning shots, but it makes the movie feel more real, like it's being told right in front of you, like live-action. I loved the black and white, it makes the movie feel like it's in it's own time period. One scene, where a car was pulling up in a drive, and with the black and white filter, it looked so beautiful; I never thought that you could make someone pulling into a driveway cinematic. Alfonso Cuarón direction was so cinematic; I really think he deserved the AACTA nominee for best direction.
There was no music in the movie whatsoever, it was quiet, lonely, and even more realistic.2018 wasn't a standout year for drama movies, there really wasn't a movie where it's picture of the year, but Roma is closest to it in my opinion. Everything about this movie represents life so perfectly. For me Roma wasn't a tearjerker, but it's a great drama. I really hope Roma gets picture of the year, I think it's easily the best movie of the year so far."
ROMA,27 December 2018,1/10,"Sad to see more people don't have the guts to admit this was a bad movie. Heard so many raves about it, finally got around to seeing it last night. I'm sorry, this was just a bad movie, nothing redeeming about it. It's not art, it's lazy film making. Easy money for the director and people involved with it. It's much harder to make a movie with a story that is entertaining. Anyone can do this. It's not art, it's more like a home movie with actors paid to be there. No stars out of four. There's a reason it went straight to Netflix."
ROMA,30 January 2019,5/10,"ROMA is an artsy-fartsy film by Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. It is, by no means a ""commercial"" film. It is however eye candy for the film student: wide panning shots, elegant cinematography, scarce dialog, etc. ROMA (named after the middle class neighborhood in the heart of Mexico City) takes place in what seems to be 1970. Mexican society was still reeling from the Tlatelololco student massacre of 1968 (carried out with the blessing of the US government, in an effort to repress any form of leftist social revolt), the nefarious Luis Echeverría was the next in line to be president, the economy was still rather healthy, etc. Instead of anchoring a storyline to such an interesting time in Mexican history, Cuarón decided to focus his story on a crumbling, middle class family and their house maid, going through a stormy divorce and trying to keep things from falling apart. The style of ROMA is a cross between French noir, documentary style and found-footage. Cuarón decided to make Cleo, the family's ""chacha"" (a termed used for house maids here in Mexico), the film's main character. Cleo (played very convincingly by Yalitzia Aparicio) is the embodiment of the typical Mexican house maid: decidedly Indian looking to the point of speaking in her native tongue in some scenes. Aparicio certainly looks the part, unlike the house maids in Mexican soap operas who look like Scandinavian princesses and are devoid of any sense of reality.
ROMA moves at an excrutiatingly slow pace. At 2:15 hrs, it feels longer than ANY Godfather movie. It is indeed a technically stunning film to watch but nothing more. It starts and ends without really saying much and I find it hard to believe the Academy has chosen this movie as a main contender, but I think I know why: this will be the very first time a Netflix produced movie is nominated for an academy award (here in Mexico, ROMA has been on Netflix for over a month and was never shown in theaters), so the Academy is breaking new ground here if this movie wins ANY oscars. Also, it would be the first time a Mexican movie wins best picture. Although Cuarón is a recognized Hollywood star, his previous movies have been American productions, not Mexican ones.I really wish ROMA the best of luck. It is a boring movie that's been beautifully made. If you're into artsy fartsy films with almost non existent dialog then ROMA is for you!"
ROMA,9 November 2018,8/10,"Many films use a sense of nostalgia in portrayals of times gone by, but few do it in quite as powerful fashion as Alfonso Cuarón's Roma. A deeply immersive film at every moment, perfectly capturing the time period and pulling you in right from the start, Roma is a slow and patient drama that you just can't take your eyes off, something that's furthered by exceptional cinematography, wonderful performances, and a slow-burn but deeply emotional story throughout.Now, when I say nostalgia, I don't just mean that Roma is full of 70s clichés to make the setting look convincing, I mean that a deep passion and personal attention to detail has gone into every single frame of the film, something that lends it an extraordinary depth of emotion and beautiful authenticity in a way that I've very rarely, perhaps never, seen before.As a semi-autobiographical story written by Cuarón himself, the film is clearly influenced by the director's memories of his childhood, as we see loving attention paid to the smallest of details throughout, yet it's that very practice that makes Roma such a moving and genuine film. Whether it be the small quirks of the family dog, the awkwardly tight driveway next to the house, or the everyday arguments between siblings, it's evident at every moment that this is a film with a deeply personal core, and through all of those tiny details, it helps you to relate all the more to the story being played out before you.And then we have the story of the maid, Cleo, played beautifully by Yalitza Aparicio. Once again, the portrayal of her dedicated, kind-hearted and loving character is something that very likely comes from Cuarón's own experience, so tender is the presentation and appreciation of Cleo throughout. That, combined with Aparicio's wonderfully understated yet endlessly likable performance, allows for Cleo to really stand out on screen, even if she is a woman of few words.You may think at first that Roma is a little slow and a little too quiet, but it's the patient and elegant build-up over the course of the film that really makes it worth it, and particularly in the case of Cleo, we see someone who you may think of as perfectly ordinary, but the film does an incredible job of showing how extraordinary she can be at times.On the flipside, the film isn't without its darker moments, and while the nostalgia and very intimate portrayal of the family is undoubtedly Roma's most moving element, the story further emphasises the importance of familial bonds through its portrayal of the more difficult moments in life, coming to a head particularly towards the final act.What's great about Roma is that it isn't a showy drama. Like I've said, it's all about the little things that add up to make it such a moving watch, and even when we do witness some deeply heartbreaking moments, the film keeps its feet on the ground and allows you to retain the same connection with the characters, no matter whether there at the highest of highs or lowest of lows, something that the screenplay does absolutely amazingly.The other most noteworthy part of Roma is its incredible visuals. Black-and-white cinematography is always used for a reason nowadays, and crafting a nostalgic vision of the past is one of its strongest suits, as is clearly proved here. What's more, however, is that the rather bright and stark contrasts of the black and white on screen are clearly indicative of the joys and suffering in both this family and the wider community's lives, and the use of that simple yet striking colour pallette from the start really helps to establish an atmosphere that allows for both immense joy and deep heartbreak to really move you.Also, in keeping with the understated tone, the film features some beautifully elegant camerawork that further immerses you in the setting, with slow yet dynamic pans across rooms and city streets, starkly powerful long take sequences, and a continual focus on Cleo, keeping her in frame for the majority of every scene she's a part of, further deepening the emotional connection with her that makes the story so engrossing.Briefly, if I were to have one problem with Roma, it would be that it's not the most widely accessible film. As a very personal and intimate piece, Alfonso Cuarón puts a lot of focus into the little things that make up the family in the story, however there is less attention paid to the wider socio-political context of the time, something that can occasionally leave you a little confused if you don't have a strong knowledge of modern Mexican history and culture.Contemporary politics and culture of course play a role in the story, however Roma is a film that focuses on a more normal story that ends up passing through moments of wider significance. Overall, it's far better that it does exactly that, as it cements the deep intimacy you feel with the characters on screen, further immersing you in the time period, but (like me) if you're not of Mexican heritage, or are rather unaware of what was going on during the early 1970s in the country, then the film can often prove a little inaccessible to really get to grips with.On the whole, however, Roma is a truly wonderful film that surpasses so many others in its use of nostalgia and memory, totally immersing you in its time period, and allowing you to develop an unbreakable emotional bond with its main characters, particularly Cleo, played in beautifully understated fashion by Yalitza Aparicio, and furthered by endlessly elegant visuals, the film is a deeply engrossing watch from start to finish."
ROMA,26 January 2019,7/10,"I watched this with my wife and my step son. Step son has a philosophy degree and he saw lots of allegorical connections with religion, which, when he explained them to me, kinda made sense. Personally, I was more interested in the superb choreography and direction - incredible attention to detail. I'm terms of the story, for me it was a bit hit and miss. Basically several vignettes based around the plight of Cleo - a maid for a middle class white family in Mexico City. Some of these vignettes were gripping - but to say much about them would spoil it. Others, I found myself switching off. Still, a remarkable visual and technical achievement shot in beautiful black and white. 7 and a half out of ten"
ROMA,26 February 2019,5/10,Before I quit. Angles of shooting are good. Detailed the everyday life of the family and the maid. But no apparent story life. Like a virtual show which I never watched.
ROMA,7 November 2019,9/10,"I applaud when filmmakers attempt to narrate a story by highlighting the visual aspect, enhancing technical efforts to construct a much applied version of their product. This is what happens with Roma, where Alfonso Cuarón knew that he had a very simple plot in his hands, and looked for
different resources to make his film even more appealing and artistically relevant. Some may say pretentious, some may say boring and that's okey because different people have very different takes on what constitutes as art, or something that desperately tries to be artsy. I thoroughly appreciate Cuarón's more than valid intention to tell his story using every resource he could to make his product unique, by fabricating through the use of black and white cinematography, his native language and culture, a historical context in his home country, heavy use of camera movement, employement of non-professional actors particularly leading lady Yaritza Aparicio who gives an exquisite and realistic portrayal of a middle class family's maid from Mexico, covered in shyness and willing to do a good job, emotionally attached by the lives of the family she serves.I enjoyed pretty much every aspect of this film, particularly the writing and how characters relate to one another; human interaction is greatly fascinating to me so I cannot help but to be immersed in some of the simplest stories ever put on film, as long as is met with emotionally relevant substance and heart-felt performances in order for the actors to transmit effectively their feelings through the screen. A bad script with wooden acting is the worst combination of all, that's how awful movies were historically made. You don't need to worry about that with Roma, because no matter how many bad ratings it has, it is still an excellent film that should be viewed by anyone."
ROMA,21 January 2021,7/10,"Probably it took me way too long until I finally sat down and watched Roma but I have absolutely no regrets that I did. From the very first minutes the movie hits you in the face with almost palpable realism with the help of slowly following the actors steady camera which is a big plus for some scenes and a huge minus for others. Alfonso Cuaron is a fantastic director but as a director of cinematography he's fine at best, same goes to his editing skills, although these duties he shared with another person but it still doesn't cancel the fact that Roma needs more cross-cutting and less longer scenes and shots for us to be able to really feel the drama; I think would the director cut some unnecessary and expository scenes down to 100 minutes of total runtime the movie would've benefited a lot. No matter how real and suspenseful the movie feels overall the dramatic component is the most important one and it's been omitted in the movie multiple times and in the most relevant scenes too. Yalitza Aparicio's debut (and so far the only) role didn't break grounds either - her character stays more or less the same throughout the whole movie and I wasn't really moved by her performance as well. The story itself feels a little rough around the edges, slow at first it goes to full speed by the middle and touches upon many pertinent topics such as first love, unexpected pregnancy, marital affair, divorce, family values while playing against the background of 1970s rural Mexican city. Very interesting piece of art to say the least, filled with some graceful imagery, lovely black and white cinematography, very authentic set pieces and the whole 70s vibe and a thoughtful story but I wouldn't want to get back to it again due to the reasons mentioned."
ROMA,11 December 2018,,"Sorry but if anyone familiar with French and Italian cinema of the 1960's and 70's is going to feel like they are immersed in a one long utterly unoriginal and plagiarized view experience.From a technical perspective Roma is quite well done. But it is otherwise very trite and frankly mundane for people who have actually lived life. There was a review on the radio that noted people who live sheltered lives, ""safe space"" lives will see Roman as some kind of revelation. But people who have actually seen life and death, or worked though adversity will see this as overwrought and shallow in its overwhelming melodrama.If you read Spanish there are actually plenty of critics in Mexico who do not think Roma is near top five of 2018 Mexican films and I agree."
ROMA,16 October 2020,8/10,"Deep, and natural with really lush cinematography. (The street scenes in Mexico are especially remarkable.) Just a wonderfully told story of relationships broken, the social divide and the social united. Ultimately it is a love story. That of a family towards their housekeeper, and hers towards them. Highly recommend. One of the best films to come out in the last few years, in my opinion. A few scenes cause a slight drag or lack of flow, but they are minor issues."
ROMA,16 February 2019,6/10,"What makes a good film? Do I understand what makes a good film? These are the questions that are darting around my brain after viewing Roma in preparation for the 2019 Academy Awards. Roma is currently nominated for 9 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. This obviously led me to believe I was going to enjoy, or at the very least appreciate the film, which simply was not the case.At first I thought that perhaps I just do not enjoy dramas, and the bells and whistles of thrillers and superhero films have changed the way I enjoy cinema. This cannot be the case because of my recent love for The Kindergarten Teacher and Green Book. Which leads me to believe that I truly do not see films the same way that those at the Academy do. Roma was INTENSELY boring for the first hour. It was able to pull me into the world in which it wanted to tell a story, but then it failed to tell any meaningful story. By the end, I did feel like I was starting to feel something for the protagonist and her struggles, but it was far too late after suffering to stay seated for an hour and a half. Through all the weeds is one shining light, however. The cinematography, specifically the camera work and chosen still shots, was some of the best I have seen in 2018. I would advise against seeing Roma if you have limited time and must choose between 2018 Oscar nominees."
ROMA,5 January 2019,8/10,"First off, let me say that ""Roma"" is a very good film. There's absolutely no way around that. It is a very good film.I first saw this on Netflix, and all I could think was, ""I would love to see this in a theatre with a large screen"". Tonight I got my wish. I got to see Cuaron's film in glorious 70mm. The cinematography is that much more impressive on a large screen. The simple composition of his shots and his use of mostly master shots with little to no movement seems ordinary on even a big screen TV, but in a movie theatre, it is breathtaking. This film will easily win best cinematography and maybe best editing.But a masterpiece? I'm not so sure. I had a hard time getting into the film until around halfway thru it. The story of an average family trying to get thru the troubles of everyday life as well as the political upheavals that were going on at the time, did not particularly hold my interest. While i found the story of the people who worked for the families more interesting, their stories, other than what is seen, are not explored.I also do not know exactly what makes up a masterpiece, I think that's subjective, and I don't want to be pretentious about my views. But again, other than the look and camerawork of the film, I wasn't really moved all that much.See it on a big screen if you can8 out of 10"
ROMA,20 December 2018,8/10,"Based off of a killer track record from acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón-and considering I will and always be a die-hard Children of Men (and maybe even a tad slice of Prisoner of Azkaban) fanboy-you could suspect that I had feverishly awaited this new period-piece alluded to as, Roma.First and foremost, let me get off of my chest what E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y has been saying about Roma: ""It's a technical masterpiece."" This movie detects like it's one cohesive flow of topography wrapped up in a handsomely pragmatic package. And that sound design obliterates so hard that it-more or less-KO'd me out of my seat a number of times. Not because I had my volume up at 100, but because it was just that psychedelic. My neighbors are filing complaints as I write this. Worth it.The first two acts of this film predominantly attributes bonafide power-cohesive storytelling which (to be honest) is although not supremely bloggable nor lucid, eventually makes up its justification when the film, in the fullness of time, offers a finale of such watertight evolution that it sanctions you into an emotional pit of such almighty, heartfelt corollary.Roma is an imperative telling of how behind the depravity of madness is always sparks of grace, and sometimes you'll-like humans stubbornly do-power through those sentences of unadulterated hell just to score those few moments of beauty because beauty, well, is just too dang worth it. Even a tough life is sometimes worth flourishing, you know? To all the hardworking, invincible, single-parents out there, this film is dedicated to you. I condemn you with such utter and unfiltered reverence. Salut. (Verdict: A-)"
ROMA,24 January 2019,7/10,"What was the Seinfeld pitch: ""It's a movie about NOTHING!"" except this one is in black and white. Go sit outside and watch the paint dry on your siding and you've seen this movie. This is how I felt the first time I tried to watch this. It was excruciating to sit through due to the slowness. I fell asleep halfway through.But I gave it a second try the next night, and I was able to finally get into the second half of the movie. It did improve in the second half and had some good qualities to it. This is heavy handed art for the sake of art. It's very in your face. To that extent, it is what it says it is and has its merits.However, this is probably not a movie you would ever sit through more than once, just because there is nothing of value that would make it worth seeing again. The girl is excellent in the role and overall it is well done in that artistic way, but unless you are a student of film, there's nothing you can take with you out of the viewing experience if you were to watch it more than once (or twice if you want to see it with someone who hasn't seen it yet).I would give the technical achievements in the movie a 9/10 and the acting I would give a solid 8/10, but as far as a classic overall story, it is only fair- about a 6. It's impressive art, but not something I can see anyone revisiting to the point where it would be considered a classic or anything. Many scenes are cringy and unnecessary placed in mostly for the sake of shock value.6.8/10"
ROMA,9 January 2019,9/10,"I am one of the few so-called millenials who appreciate and love these types of films.Roma is set in 1970 to 1971 in Mexico, and we follow the life of a young maid working in a middle-class home.The cinematography is so beautiful. I am simply captivated watching this whole movie. It is not for everyone because it is slow-paced, but that's not my problem. I don't know but I really love these kinds of movies."
ROMA,15 December 2018,6/10,"Honestly, I found this movie pretty boring. I don't want to hate on it though, as I've mostly boiled it down to just not ""clicking"" for me. Alfonso Cuarón does have some beautiful cinematography and nice long rotating shots done masterfully, and there's nothing wrong with the performances, but I just found myself unengaged for most of it. Sometimes the subtitles were difficult to read with the black and white colours blending together, but this has always been a problem for me with foreign movies having to focus on both the picture and the subtitles. Not going to dock the movie for it, just being honest.The pacing of the movie went by pretty quickly and there's a small handful of scenes that did hit me emotionally. Like I said, I don't feel bashing it is fair and I think it boils down to just not being my type of movie rather than being weak. Truthfully, I'm not a Cinephile, mostly a ""Normie"" film person who likes watching a lot of mainstream/blockbuster movies, but I do like to give films like this a chance and time of day rather than completely ignoring they exist at all. If only Netflix showed more movies like this rather than no nearby showings at cinemas.6/10"
ROMA,19 December 2018,2/10,"What an incredibly boring movie! Bad enough that it is in black and white, and bad enough that it is in sub-titles, but to be so boring, with no discernible story. We are subjected to cars driving through dog excrement, routine washings of floors, the interminable turning out of lights, and then assaulted with full frontal male nudity by an idiot martial arts samurai wannabe. The incessant use of long shots began to hurt my eyes, as did the countenance of the apparent main character. I had to stop watching this thorough waste of time after about thirty-five minutes. I was glad to get away from it."
ROMA,22 February 2019,6/10,"In a year full of staggeringly original films and new surprises, Roma was honestly not in the category for any of those in my opinion.
Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film by any means, but it certainly doesn't deserve even half of the praise that it's getting. The cinematography was pretty, the acting was solid, and the story was ok. But to me, the film felt patented and groomed to bait in awards and the critics totally fell for it. It drags on way too long, the drama feels a little over done towards the end, and it simply just didn't sustain my interest at the second half. I think that I felt more irritated that I paid $8 to go see a slow and melodramatic ""art"" film that I could've easily watched for free on Netflix (I don't pay for it so it's free). Like I said, Roma isn't bad, but it really doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. Even out of all of Alfonso Cauron's films, this is by far his dullest."
ROMA,30 October 2019,6/10,"""Roma"" is a movie made for a certain audience. For viewers who love art films, geek out over cinematography, art direction, and minute details, it's a godsend and a masterpiece. For viewers who want action and story that moves, they can give this one a hard pass.To say certain parts are dull would qualify as a massive understatement. Most scenes are puzzlingly dull. I say puzzling because you might find yourself wondering if you missed something during that 20-minute stretch of nothingness. I can assure you that you did not.The entire film contains two worth-watching scenes and 100+ minutes of emptiness.The film constantly lingers on shots for so long you'll begin to wonder if the wonder if the camera operator fell asleep. Then the next shot usually consists of something similar, as the camera holds for an unnecessarily long time once again.Other choices in the film are flat out bizarre. A naked sword display partway into the story serves no apparent purpose other than to encourage many Netflix viewers to stop watching and start streaming something else.Other times the camera fixates on closeups of dog poop. For a really long time. And then we see more dog poop. I really tried to understand the purpose of these shots, but I have no answer.To the film's credit, the two worth-watching scenes I mentioned earlier are both truly remarkable. They give director Alfonso Cuaron a chance to flex his filmmaking muscles. He masterfully makes use of long scenes with no cuts, which gives viewers no chance to breath and really makes it feel like we are there, present in the moment.But two great scenes don't make a great movie. The boredom overwhelms the snippets of brilliance, yielding a dull final product.If hardcore art films are your thing, give this one a try. If not, spare yourself from hours of boredom and the horrifying naked sword display scene."
ROMA,25 February 2019,1/10,This boring film was up for Movie of the Year? This movie won Best Foreign Film? It just proves than the film industry is nothing but a bunch of pretentious snobbish bores. Do NOT waste your time on this 2 hour + movie about nothing!
ROMA,1 October 2020,7/10,"I was not ready for that intense last half hour. It is engrossing and beautiful to look at. Like watching a collection of home movies or looking through a family photo album and seeing love and strength, weakness and cruelty in human relationships. A unique vision to be applauded."
ROMA,24 February 2019,10/10,"So I watched Roma for the second time on Netflix. I really wanted to watch the movie more than once before I tried to write a review. The movie really is a poetic cinematic achievement that reminds me exactly why I love film. It truly is one of the best films of 2018 and a new marker for what to expect from Netflix.The central plot of the film follows a maid and the family she works for as they navigate their seemingly ordinary life in 1970s Mexico. All the while the family and its security is put to the test as life happens and conflict occurs around every corner. The simple, yet poignant narrative tells a deeply human story about the struggles of the human condition and coping with loss and tragedy while keeping a family together. It's the kind of story you just don't see being made in Hollywood any longer. It's not a flashy story, but it is one of the most emotionally moving films I've ever seen.The beauty of the film also comes from its depth and complexity. The film acts as a slice of life case study regarding the existential insecurities of blue collar life and just how easy our world can collapse. The film in a lot of ways is a time capsule of 1970s Mexico. The setting acting almost as a driving character that constantly pushes the film and its conflicts forward. The meticulously well-chosen settings all paint a vivid picture of the deeply divided social landscape of the era and the difficulties of a working poor lifestyle.Through the use of its detailed characters the film examines issues like social class, political violence, sexism, oppression, and ethnicity. The film and it's underlining subtext reminded me of great classic naturalist authors and how they crafted intricate stories and characters that acted as social commentary on the conflicts of their time. The movie does not pull any punches when addressing socio-economic conflict, but at the same time never comes across as preachy or manipulative.All around the screenwriting of the film was excellent. Not only did Roma tell a poetic narrative about both the beauty and tragedy in life, it also acted as a complex examination of a number of social conflicts. On top of the rich narrative all of the characters and their dialogue felt so real and perfect for the film. Even the structure of the story arcs played with viewer expectations as this is not the kind of film that tells a traditional Hollywood morality tale. Some moments will remind you of the simple beauty of life, while others the stark reality of loss and tragedy.Of course it would be impossible to not talk about the technical achievement that is Roma. Alfonso Cuaron is certainly known for his directorial style. I can't say I loved his last film Gravity, which I found to be a case of style over substance. I really walked into Roma expecting an overrated art house film that critics were too afraid to criticize. Fortunately I was absolutely incorrect. Roma is a film of technical filmmaking at its finest.This isn't a movie that relies on special effects or gimmicky camera techniques, but uses meticulously well-thought-out shots that push the story forward. There doesn't seem to be a wasted shot in this entire film. Every scene has some meaning and conveys quite a bit of subtext. Of course the choice to shoot in a stark hyper realistic black and white paid off perfectly. In everyway the directorial decisions of this movie only served to enhance and further bring life to the stark and human narrative of the film.Acting wise the cast was perfect for the film. This isn't the kind of movie where a single actor dominates the film. I'm amazed at Yalitiza Martinez who absolutely deserves praise considering she has no formal training. She brought a genuine sense of vulnerability and realism to the role that would be hard to replicate.I loved Roma for a number of reasons. That being said this is a slow burn slice-of-life film that isn't simply trying to entertain. The movie is full of rich dialogue, but it's also full of the ordinary monotony in life. Just like in life some times it's boring and slow, but it's also unpredictable and can swing in an instance. Yes, the film has a slow start, but that was by design. I'm really having a hard time thinking of a genuine criticism for the film. No film is perfect, but Roma has all the makings of a film classic that could impact the very core of modern filmmaking.If you walk into Roma expecting the kind of film put out by most studios nowadays you will be disappointed. Roma requires patience and an ability to recognize the beauty and tragedy in our human existence. The movie appears simple on the surface, but ultimately tells a complex story that deals with a number of important social conflicts. It's at times painful to watch, while also providing a very human experience that will leave you moved. I highly recommend everyone to see this film as it certainly is not only one of the best of 2018, but also one of the best films I've seen in years. A 10 out of 10."

ROMA,24 February 2019,4/10,"Do you like great camera work? Do you love camera panning? Do you like cameras moving slowly left to right and zooming in and out? Because that is about the only thing that Roma has to offer: good cinematography and exceptional camera work. Sometimes I just wish that people would get their own opinions and stop listening to the critics.I LOVE indie films, I enjoy black and white movies, I watch independent and low budget, I even like silent films and I tried really, really hard to enjoy this one but it is simply not captivating. Instead of picking one direction, Netflix and Cuaron simply couldn't decide if they are trying to be realistic, emotional or indie. Yes B&W is ""retro"" but this is a movie, not an instagram filter.Production and cinematography are first class and Cleo clearly loves the children but where is the plot? Where are the acting and music, where is the message or any kind of take away from the film? The director fails to convey emotional moments or make the audience care for the characters. Driving around Mexico, taking a bunch of scenic videos of completely random events and then throwing a family with a maid in the middle of it all does not constitute a movie. Yes it is art in looks but mediocre in storytelling and every other aspect of cinema."
ROMA,14 January 2019,10/10,"A spandex strongman pulls a car with his teeth.
A dude seduces his date with a naked martial arts demonstration.
A guy gets shot out of a canon, cartoon style.
Fear not, ""Roma"" is not a surrealist comedy about silly male behaviour. It's better.After ""Gravity"" defying Hollywood, Alfonso Cuaron delivers an astonishingly moving ode to his youth, carefully stalking a family with a widescreen, smoky black and white lens. Endurance testing long, lava fluid, trance inducing, intoxicatingly delicious, cardiac arresting, ""Roma"" is the year's best movie. And it's not even close.The anti-Hollywood action flick we all so desperately needed, Cuaron's masterpiece plays as a distant, voyeuristic, peek at complicated family strife in astonishingly realized 1970 Mexico. It's all moving photographs, long, panning, beautiful takes of life's ugliness, revolving around the generous glow of beloved maid Cleo. Yalitza Aparicio is an understated wonder in the lead, evoking a spectrum of summer sun warmth to horrific tragedy, with a minimum of dialogue. Simply fabulous. And fabulously simple.At well over the dreaded two hour mark, ""Roma"" will test some impatient movie fuss-budgets, but once the spell takes hold, this movie won't let go. Cuaron tackles some hefty subjects - class, sex, political and relationship struggle - in a deftly subtle, background delivery. Watch locally, think globally.If there's no big ass theatre around, project this stunning Netflix beauty on a wall for the full experience."
ROMA,3 June 2020,5/10,"A reviewer below said this.. in reply, no Tarkovsky was better. The core subject of Tarkovsky's movies was interesting, overlaid with more artistic film making than this.. better use of colour, sound, verticality. This movie Roma is boring at heart and overlaid with tedious and pretentious film making techniques.. always side to side, always squashed and claustrophobic. A director who has let it go to his head a bit I think and needs less refinement and production going forward. I also never got to the end of a Tarkovsky movie and said 'is that it'?"
ROMA,10 May 2019,5/10,"I appreciate Cuaron's past art. He is one of the best directors today. The cinematography by Cuaron is the only greatness in this film. Other than that the movie is a bore and overhyped. I'm happy he was able to reproduce nostalgia on film but what a hum drum remembrance. Poor Cleo has to scoop up dog doo. Big deal. I've done that my entire life after walking my dogs. It certainly isn't worthy of film. I get it. The boyfriend leaves, the father leaves, the turmoil. It's just expressed in such an uneventful and unimaginative way. If you want a slice of life in the 70's, with some actual life to it, investigate "" City of God"". Whether the movie is so very accurate and brings back fond memories to so many as far as life in Mexico City during the 70's , the bottom line is this isn't Cuaron's masterpiece. It's his lame duck."
ROMA,11 December 2018,10/10,This film is an emotional roller-coaster. It is beautifully shot and directed by Alfonso Cuaron. It is about a family in Mexico in the 1970's. They have a nanny named Cleo who is at the heart of the film.We see the family has love for Cleo but it at first always a servant. The opening shot of the film is so beautifully crafted you wonder how the filmmaker did it. You at that moment i think know your in for something special. The sound and music in this film so moving and evokes a real feeling inside you. The black and white photography is done so well and it times you forget your watching a film in another language. I dont want to say too much more about this because I dont want to give to much away. But do yourself a favor and watch this on the biggest screen you can find and not on a computer screen. You owe it to yourself. This film reminded me why I really love movies and went to film school and studied film.To go and see something different from what you have seen before. To get a slice of life from a family you wouldn't otherwise ever see in every day life. This is one of the best films of the year if not the best. I still of others to see. This film deserves serious Oscar consideration. I highly recommend this film.. .
ROMA,25 February 2019,4/10,"Well I knew from the start this movie would be painstakingly slow but it wasn't as boring as I expected. With that being said there was absolutely no excitement. The videography is also very overrated the black and white color scheme along with the era it's portraying (The 70's) tricks your perception into thinking it's more artistic than it really is because the camera is topnotch and very clear and by utilizing computerized wide angle panning it keeps everything clean and crisp adding to the realism of the film. Yes this flick was too long but do I feel like I wasted 132 minutes of my life, not necessarily. Do I think this film was worthy of winning an academy award, not by a mile. Whoever's rating these films needs a complete overhaul. These old institutions controlled by these pompous hypocrites with poor taste has become obsolete and doesn't hold the weight and or garner the respect of winning an award like they use too."
ROMA,12 January 2019,6/10,"I don't understand the discussions about the film. The film is well counted. it describes social problems very well. The maid is very hardworking but
they still chastise him. Woman i's rich, but still dependent on her husband. there are political conflicts and murders. There's a hopeful finale. There are lots of similar good movies."
ROMA,4 December 2018,10/10,"With this title I'm not trying to sound utterly overwhelmed, but to acknowledge the fact that I feel unable to describe with simple words this film.Let's start by saying that it is indeed one of Cuarón's best works (though I still consider Children of Men as my personal favourite), also probably the best film of 2018 (I couldn't see The Favourite yet, the other film of the year that I believe has serious chances of winning the title). It is a very slow film, has a pacing that reminds me of Tarkovskij films. It is not very introspective scope: the viewer mostly might feel physically distant (also due to the frequently wide-angled photography), but yet can be emotionally connected to the characters and the story.There's a very abudant apparatus of subtext: much is implied, and this is particularly true with Cleo's thoughts. Another element that suggests that much is implied is the presence of flying airplanes, that occurs in specific scenes, suggesting a meaning to it.
Mind, unlike Nemes' Sunset, this film isn't an allegorical story but a realist story. Frankly, it reminded much of Inarritu's first films (21 Grams, Biutiful, etc.) due to the realist factor.This film sets an interesting directoon to netflix films: easily said, it is the best Netflix original. It is also an arthouse film, and very clearly so. This film could start a new tendency (especially if awarded at the Oscars) for arthouse films to be produced and released by netflix, a company known for providing creative freedom to directors. In the past years, this had mostly a negative impact, with several 'bad' netflix originals, but this allows genial filmmakers (like Cuarón, but potentially others aswell) to create their works without boundaries. Let's hope this tendency continues."
ROMA,24 January 2019,7/10,"The oscars reflect hollywood persona more than exemplify peer review of film making. Maybe it's always been like that I don't know but this year is no exception because 10 nominations for this kind of film is unjustified. IMHO Mr Cuaron produces the most complicated scenes on film of any director I can think of, past or present. But his films don't have a level of story telling that I would expect from his professional tier. Even 'gravity', which is his most commercially successful movie to date doesn't have much story to it and 'roma' has even less of a plot. This movie is wonderful to watch from a technical perspective. The scenes are long with no cuts. The scenes have very complicated cinematography. They have a lot of actors and extras that are perfectly choreographed. But, this movie has very little story to it. If you took away all the complicated cinematograpy and staging, it would be colossally boring. And it's not because I can't relate culturally to the characters or settings in the movie because one of my favorite films (series) last year was 'my brilliant friend', an italian tv series hosted by HBO. I have nothing in common with this production either. I'm not italian. I didn't grow up in italy in the 50s. There are parts which are incomprehensible from my cultural perspective but it's nonetheless a beautifully told story. Two completely different non-english film productions that are amazing to watch but one is a very simple production but very full story told wonderfully and one is a complicated production with almost no story to it. If 'roma' is worth 10 oscars, where are the accolades for making 'my brilliant friend'? BTW, if you haven't seen 'roma', it has nothing to do with italy and it has nothing in common, storywise, with 'my brilliant friend'. I only mentioned 'my brilliant friend' because it's a wonderful non-english film (series) that hollywood would never make and with respect to productions, the two films have a lot in common."
ROMA,18 January 2019,9/10,"The only other Alfonso Cuaron film I've seen was Gravity (2013) which I thought was absolutely stunning, but in quite a different way than Roma, which is almost its polar opposite in subject matter and style. If there's any common factor, I'd put it down to simplicity and vision. Everyday life in and around Mexico city in the 1970's lives and breathes in Roma, portrayed in a very methodical, unhurried way, but the whole thing has a kind of cumulative power that is rather hard to define. It's all in the way it's done.Cleo (played by Yalitza Aparicio) is at the heart and soul of this story, as one of two domestic workers (the second one is the cook) in the household of an upper-class family with 4 young-ish children. The parents, and others in their upper social class, basically do what they like and it's left to their hired staff to pick up all the pieces at home to keep things running. In Cleo's family the parents are out at their work much of the day and it seems to be expected of Cleo to do just about everything around the house: constantly look after the children, fetch and carry, laundry by hand, errands --- she's on her feet all day long. But far from being a 'slave' she's a loving and loved member of the household: she and the children have strong bonds. Apparently, Roma is an homage to Cuaron's own childhood nanny, so it's a very personal accomplishment.Everything about this - the settings, the street life, the household, the close ties between Cleo and the kids -- is all utterly realistic. My wife and I both travelled a fair bit to Chile (Santiago, Concepcion, La Serena) for work purposes in the 1970's and 80's and it all looked and felt like that. Any well-to-do household had someone like Cleo working for them: the family would typically be of white/hispanic stock and the hired workers were aboriginal, sometimes (like Cleo in this story) from small hardscrabble villages. Life in the town happened on the street, not inside the houses. The streets are always filled with people going every which way in and out of small shops, chatting, and ducking fast-moving ramshackle old cars. There are always dogs roaming free -- lots of dogs. Random marching bands playing badly go by on the street for no apparent reason. Soccer fields where young men gather are just dirt and dust. ""Roma"" sets up this ambience without making any particular point about it -- it's just there.None of this background gets across the peculiar effect of Cuaron's direction. The strength of human love and community devotion shine through here, but also the resilience, love, and self-reliance of average people. We see everything from Cleo's point of view -- not just her family but also occasional major events ""out there"" that just happen around them and that she simply witnesses: an earthquake in the city, a brush fire, a student demonstration and subsequent deadly riot. None of these necessarily fit into any coherent plotline, but I take it as just Cuaron's building of a comprehensive picture of life then and there.Through most of the film there's also no musical score, which was a clever choice that I thought drew us in closer to the characters. Like other viewers I was really struck by Cuaron's camera technique here. Often it simply sits steady as a rock while the scene develops. Equally often it pans, very slowly and very steadily, to give a broader perspective. The culmination of all this comes at the end, when Cleo, the mother, and the kids are all at the beach for a picnic. Cleo, who can't swim, ultimately has to wade very far out into the gathering surf to try to pull back two of the kids who've gone too far. The camera simply follows her slowly out, farther and farther into higher and higher waves, with absolutely nothing else on the screen to look at. Without giving away how it ends, I'll just say that the simplicity and raw power of this scene make it, somehow, one of the most remarkable I've ever seen in a movie. Any director who could envisage this and pull it off has my admiration. That scene is worth the whole price of admission, but you need to see everything that comes before it to get its full meaning."
ROMA,5 February 2019,5/10,"I have to praise all the technicians aspects of the movie, mainly your direction, off course, is amazing staying the camera stopped and see the characters in motion, the photography is beauty, see this in black and white didn't me bother, but I have to admitted that the plot is not great, is so simple, and in the end your understand that is a just simple story filmed in the wonderful way."
ROMA,10 February 2019,6/10,"This usually doesn't happen but by the time Roma ended, I wasn't sure how to rate this. I thought I was bored, yet I was completely captivated it; working as a slow burn. Many have said it is amazing from a female point of view and not that, that is a bad thing but as a male I can't relate on the same level as a woman would watching Roma. However I did sympathize with the main character... see what I mean? This movie left me so lost for this review. I absolutely despised Fermin which is an incredible feet for a character who only appears in probably 15 minutes of an over two hour film. There is so much symbolism in this movie, that maybe I do need a second viewing to really like it, but for now I'm going to give it a 7 because it did keep me captivated and the cinematography was gorgeous. I'll probably update this if I watch it again."
ROMA,26 November 2018,7/10,"Alfonso Cuaron depicts the life of a young housekeeper in a prosperous family household in Mexico in the early 1970s in this heartfelt, slice-of-life drama. He does so with a stellar cast, black-and-white filming and crisp cinematography that includes wide ranging geography within Mexico.I was impressed by how well this film held my attention from start to finish. It isn't always the smoothest narrative and there are occasional lulls in the storytelling but it slowly lifts you into a state of wonder. Some scenes are quiet and deliberate. Others are Fellini-esque. The film covers a surprisingly broad landscape as we watch this woman seek out the young man she believes is her destiny as well as cope with the goings-on of the family she must tend to where not all is well. There is also a sense of the strong social unrest in Mexico during that era.Cuaron has made a deeply personal film, one that harkens back to the Mexico in which he grew up. It is seen through the eyes of a young woman with a modest job. The black and white filming actually makes you forget that this took place in decades past. Instead, it feels very contemporary. There are some profoundly poignant moments here even if the pacing is a bit inconsistent. At times, you'll be holding on for dear life. At the center is a quiet, reserved but very genuine performance and one that lights up the screen. Gladly recommended."
ROMA,8 February 2019,8/10,"Beautiful film by Alfonso Cuaron. Clearly cutting the lines in the sand of 1970's Mexico City. We follow the very kind Cleo, a house help in an upper middle class family being torn apart by infidelity.My wife and I discussed this movie and agreed on it being quite slow but still intriguing. This is so as our lead actress gives us an Oscar worthy performance with her conveying of emotion, and director Alfonso Cuarón does an excellent job at depicting 1970s Mexico City. In my opinion there are three very strong and emotional scenes in the film only captivating me more so.Cinematography is absolutely beautiful in black and white monochrome. There are several instances and even scenes consisting of one shots reminiscent of the cinematographic style of Alejandro Innaritu.Overall a recommendable and beautifully constructed film."
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuarón has made several brilliant films, but he has truly outdone himself and made his true masterpiece with this searing, thoughtful drama set in Mexico City in the early 1970s. ""Roma"" is absolutely stunning, and the best film of the year. The film is an ode to Cuarón's childhood and what he perceives to be a Mexico of a somewhat distant past. It is a drama that primarily surrounds Cleo, a maid, and the family of the house she cleans, yet the film's depth is so much more than a simple one-sentence synopsis could provide. Once you see this film, you will not be able to forget it.Cuarón clearly intended the tone of ""Roma"" to be deeply rooted in realism, which is evident by the film's extraordinary black-and-white cinematography. The film is a technical marvel, with cinematography that helps each frame stand out. While the film does not really have a score, viewers won't miss it, as Cuarón's sound design is expertly constructed to an almost intoxicating degree. Even though I love many of the scores of films I really admire, this movie makes you appreciate just how much emotional power is delivered through the characters, cinematography and sound design that the absence of a score actually enhances the film in many parts. The film's third act is extremely powerful and a true roller coaster of intense emotions, yet each and every emotion Cuarón brings to the frame is truly genuine. Every sight and sound in the film has a purpose in tandem with the narrative, making the film's plot structure seem meticulous. The film's realism is present in its inherent motifs as well. For example, while the film certainly provides commentary on the deep-seated inequality present in Mexican society, its worldview is also pluralistic and universal in that lines of unity rather than division between characters are often emphasized. I particularly took note of this during the scenes with both Cleo and Sofia (the household matriarch,) many of which are incredibly poignant. The movie also pulls off an incredible feat of depicting social and political unrest around this time in Mexico City in considerable detail, without ever feeling overtly political or preachy as a film as a whole. (The story is didactic, but never preachy or melodramatic.) The film is lighter on dialogue than many dramas, but this is certainly not detrimental to the story given that the screenplay does a brilliant job communicating as much as possible in as few lines of dialogue as possible--which is, of course, what master screenwriters always strive to do.As a family drama, a slice-of-life film, an ode to Mexican society and culture, and an epic, ""Roma"" succeeds with flying colors. 10/10"
ROMA,22 November 2019,8/10,"This movie is as boring as it could get.
forget there will be blood forget no country for old man if you can get through this movie you are great man and just like I other two movies I mentioned it was good movie"
ROMA,5 September 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuarón created a totally unique, poetic cinema experience inspired by his own upper middle class childhood in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City in the 1970's. The POV is centered on the Indigenous woman who was his family's beloved live-in domestic housekeeper and nanny to four children; she was the quiet backbone to the family during a year in which their father, Antonio, left their mother, Sofía, (as they were so-named in the film).Alfonso auditioned actresses for a year before finding Yalitza Aparicio who - in her first ever acting role - inhabits the role of Cleo with a humble naturalness that allows the audience to be swept into a yearlong slice of her life as a young woman during personal and political upheaval.From the opening moments when we are drawn into a black and white shot of soapy water being repeatedly slopped and rinsed over floor, the audience is asked to let go of the mind, be patient, be present, and surrender to this ride.Their world is centered in a home of structually open design with a beautifully-railed staircase that Cleo trots up and down spritely and alternatively laboriously on in her daily service to the family, on a street on the more run-down side of town. A rambunctious dog oversees everyone's comings and goings to punctuate the jumpy upheaveal in their lives. The garage is either too narrow or the boat-of-a-car too wide, and each time the vehicle is manuevered, (carefully or not), into the confined space, I could practicaly smell the smothering exhaust as the conflict of desiring more than is possible or appropriate, and the resistance to seeing another way, knocked against me as the car was dented by contact with the claustrophobic walls.Quiet moments are interspersed with both lively and chaotic noisy city ambiance. Wide yet nuanced shots in black and white capture intimate details of Cleo's life caught in the throes of classism, racism, sexism, and a crude, patriarchal society. Her boyfriend for a brief time, Fermín, turns out to be a no-good gang member who physically and emotionally abandons her in her time of need. An emergency visit to a hospital is brilliantly shot to detail the impersonal and cruel reality Cleo experiences.As Cleo is mourning a devestating loss that she is wracked with guilt over, Sofía invites her maid to join her and the children on a trip to the sea. Cleo's relationship with, and love for, her charges and the instinctual sacrifice she makes without question for them made this film memorable for me; although the journey was wrenching at times, I found it a rewarding one that leaves me with lingering images to savor and grieve.To put it mildly, this film is a marvelous work of art."
ROMA,22 December 2018,9/10,"There are not many films out there that can, slowly but surely, invoke the feelings that Roma does within you.
The acting is all around great, and the directing by Alfonso Cuaron is just on another level here. Every scene is so well detailed and so captivating, from the sound to the dialogue. It all just feels so real, and that is the word I would use to describe this film, real.
However, going into this film I must admit that I was expecting it to be perfect, and it is still very great, but I did not get that finishing touch I was expecting, and that may very well be my own fault, but in re-watch I might love it more than I did the first time due to false expectations.
This is definitely one of the better films to come out this year. an emotional gut-punch all throughout, with important lessons to be learned, and incredible film-making to behold."
ROMA,24 December 2018,6/10,"Do not get trapped by the hypes and fanfare, it is a black and white movie focusing on the scenery where events take place, all resources were invested in the graphic messaging to convey climate. The story goes about the domestic life of an upper middle class family in the Mexico of the 70 s, in the foreground the personal life of the help. Ending not in line with movie, left me frozen and dissapointed"
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"Begin rant: Netflix to me is the bane of the art of filmmaking. It's where art goes to die. Watching Roma on a computer screen, where most will eventually watch it, is a crime. In part because Netflix encourages such poor viewing habits, and laziness: people will invariably pause, stop, or half-watch this film in a fragmented manner, often with with lights on in their room, or other screens, and they will miss the details which make Roma so sumptuous. Most will hear this film through their laptop speakers, missing the lush, enveloping sound design, while they peruse Amazon on a competing browser tab. Many will no doubt fail to make it to the end, finding it 'too slow' or wonder why it is in black and white.This is the main difference between the cinema and Netflix: Netflix you can control. The cinema on the other hand controls you; you pay, you sit and you are subjected to a film, and be damned if there's anything else you want to do. You're stuck there and you're going to experience it full on.The bitter irony is that Netflix is also one of the few places filmmakers of great artistic import have left to fund their personal projects, or anything that doesn't involve 200$ million plus in CGI or superhero makeup. Netflix, having sucked the entire market into its gravity, has the megabucks and as a result is willing to take the risks that studios won't anymore. And that reality, for a cineaste, is a tremendous sadness.But that is where we are. And what we still have are artists like Cuaron who have a vision and will find a way to deploy that vision no matter what it takes. The result is breathtaking. And, whether Netflix likes this or not, we have the viewers who bought up every single ticket of this film at my local theater (it played in a single small theater in Montreal) in a matter of hours, knowing that they will only have a week to watch it before Netflix yanks it and makes it exclusively available on their platform. I hope somebody at that company notices.Roma is an intimate, personal film told simply, with the utmost attention to detail, and it contains a great deal of humanity, empathy and beautiful imagery that is completely worth your money. If you get a chance to see it in a theater- do it. That is all you need to know."
ROMA,1 April 2020,8/10,"A wonderful movie. Slow-moving, yes, but well worth slowing down for. In the end I found the genuine emotional connection that was made across barriers of class completely believableï¿ 1/2""and that is really saying something."
ROMA,21 March 2019,9/10,"Roma, the best major motion picture released in the last few years, will unfortunately go down in Oscars history as the Best Foreign Language Film of 2019, but not the Best Picture of 2019. It's unfair to compare Roma to Green Book, of course, with one movie being a cinematographic masterpiece depicting stark contrasts between the haves and have-nots, and the other being a road-trip movie which does little more than trigger memories of better road-trip movies.From the opening scene of water washing over tiles, to the closing scene of water washing over life, Roma weaves a beautifully fluid narrative that exposes the unjust bases for classism, sexism, and economic segregation, seamlessly stitched with the needles and threads of unspoken love which can emerge at the most inconvenient times. Life would be simpler if we could avoid foreign entanglements, but despite what any fans of Ayn Rand would have you believe, people need other people.Alfonso Cuarón's choice to produce the stark contrasts of black and white was essential, but it seems predictably unfair for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to punish Roma for being filmed in Spanish. Roma was not the just the Best Foreign Language Film of 2019, it was simply the Best Picture of 2019."
ROMA,4 January 2019,4/10,It's art with no entertainment like his previous film gravity and critics love boring art movies like this but still if u r an art fan this one is definitely recommended for u
ROMA,23 April 2020,9/10,"Roma might fool you into thinking it is one of the dozens of small, pretentious, art house awards baiters that critics dutifully praise to the heavens every year. I myself braced for the worst, expecting a slow, pointless, slice-of-life bore set in 1970s Mexico. In actuality, Alfonso Cuarón's autobiographical cinematic love letter is a grand, sure-handed classic. It forgoes gritty realism and sociological posturing (As if often the case for such awards contenders) in favor of beautiful black-and-white cinematography, exquisitely drawn characters, and masterful direction from one of the great living minds in Hollywood.Roma is based loosely on Alfonso Cuarón's real life upbringing in middle-class Mexico City. But the movie is not about young Alfonso. It serves as a portrait of a side character in Cuarón's life, his family's loyal housekeeper, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio). Cuarón finds in her story, a sweeping odyssey. No, she isn't commanding armies or leading a revolution, but her journey through life's familiar stresses feels just as harrowing. Credit for this feeling of grandeur has to go to Cuarón, who projects immense emotional power onto recognizable facets of everyday life.A lot of Roma is dedicated to small, intimate moments: the cleaning of a driveway, a family outing gone awry, a stop at the furniture store. Such scenes can be insufferable in the hands of a director without a strong artistic point of view. But Alfonso Cuarón has a strong artistic sense, and he makes Roma feel big by putting us in Cleo's shoes. We experience the journey through her eyes, meaning that we recognize the importance the small moments contain, and we're floored by the heart-rending drama of moments that are relatively huge. Add to this the political turmoil always bubbling on the outside, and you have a movie that brilliantly translates the enormity of a common life to the big screen.The genius of Roma is in how it captures the towering emotional power intrinsic even in an unassuming, ""normal"" life. The real-life Cleo was simply part of Alfonso Cuarón's background. She was no Great Man of History, but behind her modest facade, portrayed excellently by first time actress Aparicio, she endured trials deserving of reverence. Roma knows that every extra in our lives has a story. We all careen through this world on thrilling, profound, beautiful journeys, whether they look that way from the outside or not. For all Roma's technical brilliance, its cinematic beauty, the film's greatest contribution is in how it reframes our ideas of heroism. It helps us appreciate the Cleos in our own lives, the Great Men and Women we see every day.93/100"
ROMA,18 December 2018,5/10,"For the most part, watching Roma was about as interesting as watching paint dry...but not just *any* paint, but the most perfect, precious, beautifully applied paint imaginable. And not just paint in any room, but a room designed to be the best room with the best lighting and the best layout...and, oh, this was paint drying under high humidity conditions so you needed to watch the paint dry in a single, long-flowing take to appreciate the reflective nuances of the paint in all its evolving glory and often from unusually low angles of perspective since that yields special visual treats. Best Director. Best Cinematography. Best Paint Job. Ultimately not engaging."
ROMA,19 December 2018,9/10,"Roma is perhaps the most ambitious film of 2018. Cuaron is already known for his path breaking cinemas but this time he has transcended almost every known yardstick of making beautiful cinema.
Roma breakthrough fences of language, culture and time. It tells a timeless story of betrayal, love and core intimate human emotions.
Being a autobiographical movie, it tries to deliver the story as raw and real as possible.
It surely a memorable film and also a strong contender for upcoming award shows."
ROMA,28 June 2020,8/10,"During the Mexican government's crackdown on the revolution in 1971, amid violence and gunfire, a pregnant young nanny lost her child because of delays in getting care. It would have been a very good story, and the confluence of social unrest and individual destiny at a single point in time would have been enormously powerful"
ROMA,28 January 2019,7/10,"The cinematography was very good. I love black and white. It's one of those artsy movies where they use a lot of symbolism. Here the symbolism is fairly simple and easy to figure out, unlike art study class. How this movie got rave reviews is mysterious to me. It just seemed to try so hard, but I didn't feel there was substance, or honestly, any true effort and talent. Maybe, it's a movie for the critics and the industry, but not for me."
ROMA,30 January 2019,4/10,"What a relief it is to come onto IMDB and discover that many reviewers feel the same way that I do about the underwhelming nature of this film.It's the same process every year, when I sit down to watch a stack of films that initially went under the radar, which 'must' be seen in order to have a valid opinion, and Roma sat somewhere in my list of top views for 2018.Well, nothing happened much for just over two hours except obviously great camera work and interesting parallax scrolling for the purposes of more depth, but so what? And I understood a good part of the Spanish commentary too due to living in Brazil, which made it even more strange.This film appeared to be the director's opportunity to indulge himself, and he did so splendidly at the expense of a cohesive and interesting story. I didn't hate Roma at all, just found it largely uninteresting.Additionally, I'll be absolutely horrified if this picks up all the major honors at the Oscars this year. It's a classic example of when all the technical categories such as cinematography, editing, lighting, etc., are ticked, but confuse people into thinking it's a great story and wonderfully entertaining film, which it isn't."
ROMA,6 September 2019,1/10,Movie only for pretentious posers who think they're laughingly sophisticated to get it. No they're not. 5 minutes and skimming through the rest is all it took. If your life is so empty and boring that you could actually enjoy this then I feel sorry for people whose company you keep. A celluloid abomination of the highest order.
ROMA,17 December 2018,8/10,"Roma is a great movie with an amazing cinematography. Every scene of it is qualified. I really liked the scenes which is camera turns its own axis. There are some sharp scene transitions, they look cool. Also, black-white composition is a great choice. But If i talk honestly, my expectations were bigger about it. Because every critic and YouTuber I listened were saying damn great things about Roma. For me, this movie cant tell its intensity of emotions in very important times. Let me give an example, when Fermin said ""Never call me again, you fu*king maid...(or something like that)"", camera didnt go back to Cloe and we couldnt see her reaction to this bad situation. And while I was watching the movie, I was continuously waiting something big which could make a big change on story. But I didnt find something like that. Movie goes slow, especially in first hour and thats the reason. Of course there were some events which has touched my heart, has made an effect on story but like I said before, I expected more. Another point is I couldnt hear any music during the movie, I think thats a wrong decision because if they would make clear choices about music, it would fit perfectly on composition. Anyway, I liked Roma, it is a great art house movie and Im excited for Alfonso Cuaron's next film."
ROMA,20 April 2019,5/10,"And so not worth the effort. But I managed it on the second attempt. First time around I gave up at thirty minutes. But, because it's supposed to be a masterpiece I thought I'd better try again, and managed the whole thing in two sessions.It could have been dramatically improved if they could have afforded colour film. In black and white it all looks so cold and drab.Most annoying features include the unnecessary dogs (either stray or ignored) and the irritating, out of control, spoiled children. There's a vague plot of sorts, but only one vaguely sympathetic character. Having said that, I only felt sorry for her rather than empathising in any way.If you're unsure about watching this, my advice is to not bother, unless you're a pretentious intellectual."
ROMA,23 January 2019,3/10,"I find it funny how easy it is to trick critics into loving a movie. This recipe works perfect here. It goes like this:break as many conventions as possible(doesn't matter if it is telling the story backwards, choose just one camera angle or shotsize or like here panning A LOT)silence: make it very quite, the less dialog the betterdrag out a scene: have scenes where someone does something that you as a viewer get in seconds like pouring a glass of water or cleaning the floor and drag that out for minutesleaving room: leave as much room for interpretation as humanly possible because than every critic can interpret cool stuff into it that never was there in the first placelink it to a historical event: self explanatory. something with war is always good, doesn't matter if its a between countries or civil warone trick pony: this is the only hard part: one thing has to be exceptional. usually not the story but more something technical. beautiful landscape shots, moving camera or something like thatOh and like here it doesn't have to be black and white but it always helps! :-)"
ROMA,4 June 2019,8/10,"Rome chronicles the life of a middle-class Mexican family through the eyes of its Mixtec employee, mainly set in the early 1970s.I can understand the negative criticisms about the film, being one of its most mentioned complaints the fact of a lack of narrative or constructed argument, without more investigation of characters or a clear development of these, and yes, the truth is right, however I believe that this is the main point of Rome. The film is not centered on the characters, but is centered on Mexico, its environment and events, its evolution through history and the living movement of its citizens and landscapes. I believe that the fundamental aspect of the film is to show us the most beautiful images possible of a nostalgic memory, trying to transmit us completely the beauty of the decade of the 70s in Latin America, which is why I consider that this film is not made for everyone, since its lack of dialogue or linear narrative make it very different and even boring for many people, however, people who appreciate cinema in all its fields can find a certain sweetness and definitely a lot of beauty in Rome.As a Latino, I have to say that I am completely captivated by the realistic images and representations of Mexico during the 70s, the history of Latin America itself is related by multiple factors, especially the political and armed, with a very strong and violent history that can stand out in our memories, a certain scene in Rome shows us the particularity of those times, the constant fear.Rome is a beautiful movie, it has one of the best shots and camera work I have ever seen in any film, totally exceptional, despite its lack of characters or argument, some people can admire and feel the beauty of this work. I believe that especially those Latinos who lived those times, will appreciate the images and feel a stroke of nostalgia as they enter the streets of Rome, portrayed with beauty and realism."
ROMA,20 January 2019,10/10,"This is an amazing piece of movie making. The black and white cinematography is astounding , with every frame composed like a piece of art. The direction is beautiful and flows lyrically from scene to scene, and the acting is very poignant. I just loved it. Best picture of year!"
ROMA,25 February 2019,6/10,"The film missing a lot of things especially emotions I find it disappointing in a way. It lacks many respects of a dramatic story, merely dull and I'm not even exaggerating.
There are some meticulous cinematographic moments, but it lacks essential aspects that should be found in a decent story as I stated. Lacking the ability to make an interest to the events or bestow on a deep dimension to the personas as a matter of fact, it's frustrating how muzzy the portrait we have of the family, It's not totally terrible movie but it lacks the artistic side so if you are overly artistic this won't be much entertaining for you the scenario has nothing special it was mediocre it's more about the editing If you're the type to watch movies every once in a while, then weed out this film from your list or you will not watch films anymore."
ROMA,23 February 2019,5/10,I feel like this was a lesson in the long continuous shot and epic scenes. That's why Hollywood likes it. It reminds me of My Brilliant Friend there are so many extras hired to make each and every scene seem like a slice of real life. As for the plot there is none. It's beautiful but no plot so I give it a 5.
ROMA,27 February 2020,9/10,"""We are alone. No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone,"" Sofia(Marina de Tavira) tells her maid, left dazed in the aftermath of her employer's inebriation-fueled meltdown. Cleo(Yalitza Aparicio) is unaccustomed to being addressed as a woman of equal distinction. She's the help who picks up dog poop in the white Spanish-speaking family's driveway. A Galaxy 500, Sofia's philandering husband's car, has seen better days, after a night of drunk driving. Cleo says nothing about dents on the car's body in the driveway wall. The maid is not Sofia's confidant. This temporary intimacy will pass when her employer sobers up. The sun will rise again. The dog will poop again. The maid will be summoned. Master and servant, segregated by stairs; that's the map of the house, in Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma"", which is not so dissimilar from Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"". Set in Mexico City circa 1971, the difference between Cleo, an indigenous servant, and her employers is less about race than social class and language. Pepe(Marco Graf), the youngest of the brood, despite loving Cleo the best, tells her to stop speaking Mixtec with Adela(Nancy Garcia), the cook. Spanish, not English, is the language of hegemony.The periphery, always the periphery, Cleo stands, Cleo straddles; her familial status in flux. Most days and nights, Cleo remains on the margins, a well-received servant who is unconditionally around, just short of real love. She's a live-in maid, a preferred stranger with permission, but that permission can be revoked in an instant. Standing upright behind the family, she crashes family hour, smiling politely, catching the afterglow of the black and white TV and laughter, while they guffaw at the comedy hijinks of a variety show. Antonio(Fernando Grediaga), the runaway father, is home for, what will be the final time, unbeknownst to Sofia, who feels empowered having her husband around the house. Very discreetly, Cleo sits next to the sofa's end, buffered by Pepe, who drapes his arm around the maid's neck. The mother, however, has eyes in the back of her head. She knows that Sofi(Daniela Demesa) and her youngest son adore Cleo, like a second mother. To maintain her primacy, she lets Cleo know who's in charge of this family. Sofia evicts the maid from their living room, under the pretense of fixing Antonio a cup of chamomile tea, with a pleasant voice that masks her authoritarianism. How much does Cleo know? This bourgeoise family, bred a certain way, doesn't allow for its servants to eat amongst them at the dining table; they take their meals in the kitchen, seemingly without complaint. Ignacio(Andy Cortes), the driver, makes his own living arrangements. But Cleo and Adela share sleeping quarters in an adjoining loft within the family compound, even though the main house seems large enough to accommodate both women.It's false equivalency what Sofia forces upon the maid. Cleo's heartache is her won, but the employer co-opts this proletarian angst and makes their shared pain implicitly about her struggle, since from Sofia's perspective, she has more to lose; a breadwinning husband and father of their four children, whereas Fermin(Jorge Antonio Guerrero), Cleo's beau, was just another poor Mexican with no future. In all likelihood, Sofia never bothered to learn his name, let alone, be invited to the estate. When Cleo informs the boss about her pregnancy, Sofia reassures this distraught young woman that, rest assured, she'll stay on as their housekeeper. And yet, there can be detected the slightest emotional sterility beneath this compassionate outpouring. No questions are asked. Cleo needs the catharsis of telling her story. At the movie theater, Fermin gets up and leaves, forgetting his jacket and leaving Cleo behind in one fell swoop, upon notification about looming fatherhood. Sofia has no time for sob stories from the help. Sure, Cleo can tell the cook, but Sofia is a mother figure, who could help stop the flow of tears sooner rather than later. Visibly crying, Pepe asks his mother instead of Cleo about her state, as if the maid was half a woman or dog. He rubs Cleo's stomach, just as you would as some cherished pet, after the mother uses ""tummy-ache"" as a cover story. Later in ""Roma"", as a matter of underscoring the maid's otherness, Sofia orders Cleo out of the house, not wanting a servant to see this authority figure at her most vulnerable, after catching Pepe eavesdropping behind the bedroom door, in regard to Antonio, who is leaving the family without saying goodbye. Cleo can be remade into a stranger, on a whim, on a dime, on cue. How would Sofia respond if her maid uttered these comforting words: ""We are alone. No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone?"" Not with appreciation, that's for sure, since Cleo lacks the gravitas to be taken seriously. The comparative story goes like this: Cleo tracks down Fermin, who threatens to kill her and the unborn baby if she interrupts his training with Los Halcones again. In the near-future, this paramilitary group will be responsible for killing hundreds of student demonstrators in The Corpus Christi Massacre. Those stories, however, are Mexican stories, both current and future, local matters which have no relevance to Sofia and her children. How men are, regardless of skin color, remains the same; it's the women who they couple with, that makes the difference. Cleo is a maid; she lacks agency. It makes no difference if she's in a home in her homeland, or away, afar, aghast.Singapore circa 1997, that's the setting for Anthony Chen's ""Ilo Ilo"", another film about masters and servants, which like ""Roma"", addresses the hierarchy of skin. Straight from the airport, Teck(Chen Tianwen) arrives home with a woman, obviously, in shell shock, made worse by the smallness of the apartment. Why does this Singaporean couple need a maid? It's been a whirlwind. In a matter of hours, she metamorphosed from having a full-fledged persona to being a blank slate. Hwee Lang(Yeo Yann Yann) shows the new maid where she'll be sleeping. Her cot folds out from a child's bed. Theresa(Angeli Bayani) lets it sink in; her roommate is a boy. Jiale(Koh Jia Ler) bullies her, without mercy. Theresa's first meal with her new employers is an experience in humiliation, when the boy dictator moves his plate into another room. The very idea of the maid having a seat at the table fills him with revulsion. The parents scold Jiale, but not harshly enough; not with the same vigor, surely, if Theresa was Singaporean like them. This unchecked abuse continues, until finally, the boy's jejune behavior nearly puts Theresa's work visa in jeopardy, when Jiale slips unpaid items into the maid's shopping bag at a store that sells stationery. At home, the maid asserts herself as the adult, pinning the boy to his bed while she lays down some much-needed ground rules. Jiale is the child, not her; a twenty-eight-year-old woman, the mother of an infant son she had to leave back home with family. Arguably, in ""Roma"" the adult/child binary is never established. When Cleo accompanies the family on a road trip, the youngest boy complains aloud that Cleo has gone mute. The maid is there to entertain him. If it was up to Cleo, she would have stayed behind, but a servant has no choice in the matter. She recently delivered a stillborn baby. Nobody offered their condolences. Also, during the political uprising. Fermin aimed a gun at her in a furniture store above the melee. The grandmother(Veronica Garcia) was purchasing a crib. Out of fear, her water broke, triggering a premature birth. Cleo needs to mourn, in private, not on the beach, with fair weather family members.Jiale starts to love Theresa as a second mother. The maid, not Hwee Lang, is there to watch his public caning at a school assembly. It's only the threat of deportation that keeps her silent.Cleo can't swim. Without hesitation, she pushes against the waves and guides Tono(Diego Cortina Autrey) and Sofi back to shore. Sofia thanks her, effusively. An emotional hug takes place on the sand. But when they return home, the regular rhythms of segregated life never misses a beat.The maid returns to the loft.Cleo was just doing her job."
ROMA,22 February 2020,3/10,"Netflix movie has one common characteristic: slow, lengthy and boring. I watched the first 20 minutes and absolutely got nothing from the movie. Had to stop watching. Maybe Netflix always makes movies like TV series so to keep people stay with their subscription service?"
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,Cuaron is back and one thing I knew was that I am never going to be disappointed. Roma is a simple but powerful story about a maid set in 1971 Mexico City. This film is an essential viewing in big screen but sadly we didn't get the opportunity. Even the opening credits is so beautiful and gives us an idea about what this movie is going to be about.I wasn't surprised when I heard the Cuaron was gonna shoot his own movie like Paul Thomas Anderson did last year knowing that he edits his own movie it was only obvious that he is gonna venture into new territories. He does a brilliant job at it & the B&W colour and frame were perfect.The film moves a bit slowly after the first hour but nevertheless keeps you hooked. I personally feel it could have been if they narrated the film in the form of Acts or Chapters like Tarantino does considering the movie is about an episode in the life of a young maid. The misogyny and oppression faced by women are shown in 2 different forms in the lives of Sofia and Cleo.The performances were impressive with Marina De Tavira being the most impressive performer. She captures your attention completely in every scene she is in. The kids were amazing too and the scenes where the brothers fight are so natural.PS: The best part of the film is the last 15 minutes.
ROMA,26 February 2019,10/10,I love storytelling and children and 1970 and Libo and Cleo and mom and grandma. I love how Cleo try to struggle life raise cut and get marriage. The casts are all Hispanic but Trump tried border Mexican outrage many people . Heartwarming though happen father desert the family hurt children sadly. Good thing mom Sofia treat Cleo like real family and showing care Cleo sympathize to hear how bad time she suffer pregnancy from her abuse boyfriend. It really showing Sofia and Cleo have bad husbands. At the end Cleo save children thanks to her gratefully.
ROMA,17 December 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuaron take us back to his childhood in mesmerising cinematic journey of Roma.Set in 1970s Colina Roma, the life of a maid: Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) working for an upper middle class family who live and survive in Mexico City. Surrounded by riots and demonstrations, the dark and wonderful surfaces to the city are explored in this visual tale. Based off Cuaron's life growing up in Mexico, the director brings his cinematic talents back to his roots, not since his 2001 road movie: Y Tu Mamá Tambien. Cuaron demonstrates how intact and important his childhood is and is magnificently captured in a personal song to his past.In an episodic fashion, we follow Cleo through her life cleaning the floors, tending to the children as if they were her own, and going to the movies with her marital art practising boyfriend Fermin (Jorge Antonio Guerrero). Selected beauty scaping moment, that move, distress and horrify, Roma dives into moving and shocking.Roma is wave after wave of emotional and cinematic beauty that washes over you with personal entanglement. Cuaron's vision of his memory feels photographic. With astoundingly comprehensive sound design, detailed to the last drop of water, the sound and life of Mexico is breathing an surrounding embodiment. The grounded prospect of Cuaron's direction, is filled with his homestyle traces of Y Tu Mamá Tambien with the similar sentiment of Children of Men (2006), and then topped with the overpowering ecstasy of Gravity (2013) brought back down to earth.Using first time actors, Cuaron takes excessive realistic and minimalist approach to bring his memories alive. Yalitza is a sensation for her first screen appearance, a loyal maid, loving guardian to the family children, one sequence contains one of the most convincing hugs I have ever seen on film. Sofia, the mother of family is played by Marina de Tavira who roams the screen with lucid emotional intensity, highly strung as she keeps her family together through their trials. The intimacy between the characters is an infectious and heart throbbing, Cuaron's heart and soul are clear on screen.Shot on 65mm, Cuaron creates a landscape embracing experience, enhancing the world of Mexico City to full virtual effect. The black and white cinematograph add closer texture striking lighting, which is impressive to see alongside Pawel Pawlikowski's smoky Cold War (2018). Although it's unfortunate to see another truly worthy masterpiece of cinema release (unless seeked out) Roma wide release on Netflix will hopefully bring something extraordinary for subscribers on the popular screaming service. Made of wide pans, the smoothness of Cuaron's hand is to precise delicacy not to disturb the authentic motion.With award season gearing, voters would have to be blind not give this film the attention it deserves. As arguably the most powerful cinematic journey of year Alfonso Cuaron fresh masterpiece should not be missed."
ROMA,27 December 2018,10/10,"This film was such a refreshing breath of air from everything that's been put out like the last 4 years or so. The story is touching, it's visually and aesthetically pleasing, and the acting is superb. The powerful scenes in the film can really grab a hold on viewers' emotions, especially from the female perspective. While the film takes place in Mexico, I think it's message is relevant to all Latin America. The symbolism that the director added in to foreshadow the events to come were amazing, done in such a subtle way that you're left thinking about it after the events they warn about take place. I've heard many say that one has to familiarize themselves with 1970's Mexico to fully understand this film. While I'm not up to date on my knowledge of this subject, I still was able to grasp the message and story the director was telling. It's the human experience for many really at the end of the day. Love this film and highly recommend it, worth every minute."
ROMA,8 February 2019,8/10,"Forget Alfonso Cuarón's smooth camera work and his technical attention and his ability to wreak havoc in the background while his foregrounds remain calm and focused. Instead, watch ""Roma"" and pay attention to Cuarón the photographer who can bring beauty and life to a million shades of gray.Filmed in a black-and-white palate that is more beautiful than the colors of Las Vegas, ""Roma"" is Cuarón's love letter to movies and to life. Cuarón is already a master filmmaker, known for his sweeping battle action from ""Children of Men"" and his zero-g wizardry on ""Gravity"". With ""Roma"", he presents a story of a smaller scale, that of a simple maid with her base desires and human dreams. His craft remains deceivingly technical. Cameras pan through the corridors of the family house, up stairs, and down driveways. Frolicking on the street with zooming VW Super Beetles and wide Mercurys. Surf crashing on an empty beach. Cuarón's scenes are perfectly set with a peaceful focus while chaos erupts all around, be that the happy noise of life, a sob of regret, or the fury of a riot.However, it is the world happening in the background that is entirely more appealing than the quiet existence of Cleo, the worker/nanny of the house. Yes, ""Roma"" is Cleo's slice of life tale, but the day-to-day intrigue of the family's dissolving, not to mention the political underpinnings of Mexico City circa 1971, are tempting and raw in ways that Cleo's polite smile are harmless and safe. Safe, in the end, might make for a nice happy ending, but not always a compelling movie.Obviously Cuarón wants to showcase such documentation as proof that workers like Cleo or his own nanny, Libo, are not silent; that their tale is just as important. As a narrative, Cuarón fails in this regard. The audience might like Cleo, and perhaps even understand her, but her meandering storyline is a small shadow on an otherwise rich tapestry."
ROMA,7 March 2019,8/10,"Beautiful, vivid images, some spectacularly arranged scenes. At times reminding of Fellini and monumental films. Slowly told story, with much attention to detail. Keeping the distance from the protagonist, as if she was not really living but also only observing her own life. Very impactful culmination, the viewer is thrown right inside. Very moving resolution."
ROMA,4 August 2021,7/10,"For some reason I couldn't see this much hyped and much awarded movie earlier. I can understand why a large number of reviewers have found the movie slow and boring. The plot is about a teenaged girl house help Cleo and her mistress Marina of a middle class home in Mexico. Both women are maltreated by their partners and have forged a bond.The movie has a number of long scenes relating to household activities like sweeping, washing, cleaning. The film opens with the credit titles against extended scenes of swish of water for washing the floor. Mundane scenes of household chores follow. An attractive feature of the movie is the Band W format which gives it a realistic look specially in the scenes of the muddy roads in suburbs, the fire in the woods, the childbirth in the hospital and the student protest. But can Mr Alfonso justify showing the help cleaning dog pooh in the name of art ?In some ways the movie appears to be an artistic exercise of self indulgence by Director Alfonso Cuaron. He is the writer, director, cinematographer and editor of this movie and hence fully involved in its making. Nothing wrong here but every film director has to to ensure that the film he/she makes must be interesting and absorbing for the common audiences. Director Alfonso fails in this aspect. In every movie there has to be a balance of "" form"" and ""content"" but Alfonso appears to leaning heavily on the ""form"" aspect .( I also feel that maybe the voting members of the Oscar and BAFTA committees who have reviewed and selected the film for an award do not represent the common audiences.)
The movie however is a delight for all lovers of cinematography, editing and sound recording. The signature style of Alfonso is there in every frame including the long duration static shots with the artistic use of light and shade, the highly mobile camera with the beautiful panning shots and the superb tracking shots ( Dolly, Robotic arm, steadicam). The tracking shots in the streets are stellar. Full marks to Alfonso for designing and framing these shots each of which can be appreciated by freezing the frame. The continuous long duration shot at the beach near the end of the movie with Cleo and the children is a visually a masterpiece. All these scenes are a feast for the initated but mean nothing much for the common film goer who is looking for entertainment and is now bored with the scenes of domestic and mundane issues throughout."
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,"We heard the hype - saw the nominations - heard that it was a groundbreaking work of cinematic excellence , , , so we watched it. Actually I watched about 20 minutes and my wife watched a little more. I was a tiny bit interested when the Dad comes home and fits his oversized car into his undersized garage (where was the space for the lawn mower?) But I had to really stretch to be interested in even that scene.At about the 15 minute mark, I was thinking: ""Does my wife like this? Is that possible?"" Little did I know that she was just wondering how long it would take for one of us to spring up and yell ""This is crap - I'm done with it."" Fortunately I did not have to display my cinematic ignorance by doing that - I was saved by a call from a telemarketer - I saw that the call was from Waukegan Illinois - so I turned to my wife and said:""I have to take this."" 45 minutes later I finally left the telemarketer off the line and was relieved when I went back in and saw that the film had disappeared from our tv.When the ""signature shot"" is clothes drying on a line, you know you are in trouble.All I can say is a movie has to have something going on beyond panning and great cinematography - on it is just a travelogue. This one has little to offer - if you like this film - hurry and watch ""boyhood"" and boring piece of garbage which took 12 years to make. Both of these films are painful to watch and a monumental waste of time."

ROMA,28 June 2021,6/10,"Everything about this film was great: directing, performances, scripts, and most of all, cinematography. I feel like this movie was a celebration of life and all its ugly truths and comforting consolations. It was moving, but the plain storyline and heavy reliance on the main character just wasn't enough to ellicit a strong emphatic response from me."

ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,"Maybe it's the way the non-story sucks you in? Or, maybe it's subtle acting; subtle directing; writing? Or the lack of a specific topic?There is so much going on in this film: a tragic social movement, a tragic family event, a tragic personal loss, and dog poop, lots of dog poop and airplanes-sort of sending a message that even the complexities of the most personal AND most public events occur among the same mundain regularity of our pets and the long, seemingly slow flightpaths of jets filling and emptying our communities of more and more sources of personal/social/technological drama. There are stories in each of us. Drama too. And consequently, art. What beauty or order do you bring to your own personal drama? How do you direct it? Percieve it? Embrace it? Love it? Even the most tragic aspects of our lives are beauty when percieved as art."
ROMA,7 October 2019,8/10,"After giving us 2013's 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, Alfonso Cuaron now gives us 'Roma,' a semi-autobiographical take on his childhood but with their housekeeper Cleo as the main character. Set in the 70's in his neighborhood Roma, Mexico (if you thought Italy, you're not alone,) Cuaron shot on location for the most part which added to the authentic feel the movie wanted to convey, alongside the impressive storytelling via the composition of his shots (he's the Cinematographer as well!) wherein the camera pans from one side to another following a character's movement giving you the experience that you are inside the movie as an observer rather than outside looking in. Between 'The Favourite' and this, I'd be hard-pressed to choose which will win Best Cinematography, especially after seeing the tracking shot taken for the beach scene which leads to the movie poster of the film: all of them embracing with the sun just behind them all in their black and white glory. If there's a Best Scene Award that captures a magical moment in movie 'Roma' will win it hands down.Another possible magic moment for the movie is it can become the first ever to win both Best Picture and Best Foreign film simultaneously, and first Best Picture win for streaming service Netflix. Other nominations include Best Director (possible win!), Actress and Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Production Design, Sound Editing and Mixing. Last year's Best Director and fellow Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Torro was all praises for the movie, highlighting how Cuaron exerted epic effort for an intimate story: ""In these, our troubled times, he speaks about characters that are invisible and dramas that go unspoken, and thus he provides us with the most urgent of antidotes: empathy.""For all intents and purposes I do agree with Del Toro, and my only minor critic is the screenplay. The story of 'Roma' is something I have seen over and over and over again in different permutations by way of telenovelas and movies in the Philippines, mostly because we share the same class structure with Mexico, middle-class families can afford to hire housekeepers some stay on for a long period of time leading them to become accepted as part of the family. We even have domestic helpers working in different parts of the world whose stories are very similar to Cleo's. In the end though, I appreciate that 'Roma' taught me that even if a story has been told a million times over, it can be retold a million and one way more as long as there's a sense of purpose in doing so, which is what set Cuaron on this journey: a way to honor her nanny Libo, a woman who gave her life to caring for him and his family, another woman that made his life better just by being in it. That's what extraordinary cinema is all about."
ROMA,19 January 2019,2/10,"I watched this movie late last year and will try to recount it the best I can. The movie is set in 1970s Mexico, I believe, with rampant class inequality. A few maids work for a well-off bourgeois family, one of whom is the focus of part of the story. She works very hard and without much recognition by her employers, this bourgeois family, who demean her, as does her boyfriend who is an ass to her. She is almost a slave to this family. Almost in a sick way the movie focuses inordinately on her pregnancy, including on her stillbirth and saving the children of the bourgeois family. The movie ends with little change in her life while she (or any of the characters) supposedly don't take part in the turmoil in the country for the most part. All in all, this movie was a waste of time.I guess what annoyed me the most about film, apart from what I said in the previous paragraph, is that it was in black-in-white. In general, in this age of color film, it makes no sense to make a movie in black-in-white about the 1970s when if the film had come out at that time then it would have been in color! So, that's a major error on the part of the director and all those making this film. While some people liked this film for one reason or another, it obviously was over-hyped just like the recent report by special counsel Robert Mueller as the Democrats shout ""Russia! Russia! Russia!"" and have nothing to show for it, just grumbling along the way.In the end, this film was more depressing than not. I'm not saying the film has to end with a happy ending with everyone smiling as I've watched enough Ken Loach films, like Kes (1967), Raining Stones (1993), Ae Fond Kiss (2004), The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), and I, Daniel Blake (2016) to know that films do not have to have happy endings. But, there should have at least been a ray of hope provided to the viewer. Otherwise watching the film or even recommending others see it is a waste of time as the impact of the film fades away like pedals falling off a flower. With that I end my review and stand with my rating of 2 out of 10."
ROMA,29 December 2018,5/10,"This film is mostly for cinephiles and film students and of course film critics
as the cinematography is fantastic and the camera work/music score also so be prepared as otherwise you might be shocked at the snail pace of the film.The story itself is rather dreadfully lacking with over 90 minutes of painfully nothing except odd non emotional characters almost like a Fellini film on prozac instead of acid and at the end you leave with some emotional shifts due to obvious issues and some quirky characters but the rest of the movie is so devoid of emotion it makes you almost wonder if this slice of life of Mexico in the 70s is totally unrealistic and specific to only the directors microcosm. Latin people are emotional with flare but this film has them all on anti depressant pills except maybe the Mother. It is definitely shocking that it is nominated for best screenplay as that is plainly absurd so be prepared for exceptional minimalism and an almost Terrence Malick-like beautiful flowing panning images that are stunning yet one might fall asleep wondering what is the point of this film. Is it about irresponsible men, womens struggles, loss of children, or the director really wanted to send a big thank you to his Nanny for saving his life from drowning and stretched it 135 minutes with other fillers. A wonderful tribute and it captures Mex City in the 70s with great details yet not a masterpiece like his film Gravity that was quite unique or even as creative as Y tu Mama tambien. And please be prepared for an endless amount of time spent on bad drivers trying to park in tight spaces, garages that are almost too painful to watch. The poor cars need some serious TLC.Regardless a wonderful film if one is prepared for a slow moving almost paint drying dull 2 hours and then suddenly something happens and some might feel connected while others might feel there is a reason indy films ended up losing so much money and theatres closing as few of the general public will pay $15+ to watch an esoteric 65mm film like this.. and thankfully Netflixs takes on such artistic films - so kudos to them and to the director for putting out there such a private film that takes big cojones - even if rather dull it is a skilled auteur master that surely will make more stylish films to come.I give it a 5 as hard to imagine so many people giving it a 10 or 8 except to inspire other filmmakers to make some quality films in Hollywood that are a bit more entertaining with decent storytelling."
ROMA,16 December 2020,9/10,"Director Alfonso Cuaron has made English language hits of which 'Children of Men' and 'Gravity' received my standing applause. He returned to his home language for 'Roma' and won the 2019 Oscar for best foreign movie.I deserved to be whipped for taking a year to get to it because it's one of the best.It's a movie within a movie, a household falling apart within a country falling apart. The common thread is class war.Whereas 'The Chambermaid', also from Mexico, affected me with its sparseness, 'Roma' is rich despite being shot in black and white. It becomes one of my favourite movies. I'm CLAPPING."
ROMA,16 December 2018,5/10,"'Roma' is certainly not the worst movie, but it's definitely not the best people are claiming it to be. its plot (or lack thereof) made for a grueling experience. full disclosure: i am latina. my mom is from mexico, my dad from costa rica. this film felt like watching a very boring home video. the hype must be from americans because i looked up reactions on social media and latinos ARE NOT IMPRESSED. There's not really much i can say about this film except a 5 is being kind. maybe if cuaron had made a movie about the riots, and a personal story within that, the film would have felt like it actually had a purpose."
ROMA,18 December 2018,9/10,I am not big on subtitles but this movie was great. Life happening in a stylized way.
ROMA,25 February 2019,8/10,"The first half hour of this film I wondered why I was watching it - very slow film and the main character's face is lacking expressions most of the time.
However days after I saw it I kept going back to the film and thinking about her life, the life of the family she worked for, the loss of her child, the timing of the events and tragedies. I feel that when I have seen a movie and weeks later I am still thinking about it - then it is a good film.
I know that this took place in the 1970's and in some ways there are still things like this happening in some countries.
My problem with it - the blandness of the main character - she so rarely showed any emotion. And that was probably due to the way it would have been - apparently the director based this film on a maid who cared for him growing up.
At first I did not like the parents in the family she worked for and since then I have come to appreciate the mother and her struggles more.
An interesting film - not my favorite of the year."
ROMA,18 December 2018,10/10,Just a fantastic film in every way. It is easily the best film of the year. Forget about the rules this time.It is better than the rave reviews said.The cinematography is Kubrickian wow.true to life. Amazing
ROMA,30 August 2020,3/10,"There was this movie called ""Men Who Stare At Goats"". It wasn't good, but it was far far better than ""Camera That Stares At Nothing"".
I guess netflix thought that the fact that it was set in Mexico City and has long, long, long tracking shots and the mother is one of the world's worst drivers and most of the people do ridiculous things would overshadow the fact that it isn't about anything but the people and the people are boring and do a lot of ridiculous, but boring, things.
There are 4 or 5 scenes with emotion or tension. Otherwise. BOREFEST.
But hey, at least the have twinkies and might go to Disneyland."
ROMA,20 January 2019,7/10,"Good writing 3 stars
its slow but the writing is good because its believable and it puts you in 1970s mexico in the life of the characters. It just takes for ever for anything exciting to happen. If your not a fan of artsy movies, skip the first hour.Great Production 4 stars
The cinematography, sound, art, acting and location are what really make this movie something special. If you study cinematography, thats why the movie is special."

ROMA,6 September 2020,8/10,"After being on my watchlist for a long time, I finally got a chance to watch it. From the opening scene, the camera work draws you in and doesn't let go. Cuaron has his trademark long panning shots and they do a fantastic job of giving the viewer an intimate look into all the lives of the characters in the movie. The actors are great in their roles and feel natural"
ROMA,26 January 2019,10/10,"Roma is essentially beautiful unique of a film. Cuarón has demonstrated creatively innovated way to tell a story. The direction, cinematography, production design, sound and sound mixing are in compass to make a beautiful harmonious work of art. There's not an original score for this film which it makes it stand alone, instead Cuarón has used pieces of radio hit songs from that era, as part of the environmental scene. It's well crafted screenplay perfectly works with the acting of every cast in Roma, especially with the two leads in the film. Aparicio and Tavira are magnificent portraying a passage in the life of 1970's middle class Mexican family. It's simple, and real.
It's 10 nominations for the Oscars are truly deserved it, and my hopes are that is given at least the two top awards for this masterpiece, best directing and best picture of the year.
Note: if you are a superficial cinema watcher, this is not for you."
ROMA,17 January 2019,5/10,"There were two great stories in this movie, both of which were done a disservice by Alfonso Cuarón's misguided belief that visual storytelling is a replacement for screenwriting craft. Roma had way too thinly drawn a script to properly service the multiple plot threads and themes at play. Cuarón wasted too much screen time lingering over shot, after shot, after shot, instead of fleshing out his script.I enjoyed the story of the poor indigenous maid, an empathetic Yalitza Aparicio, even though the story was thin and drawn out. I was genuinely affected by it. So that aspect of the film worked. What didn't was the story of the upper middle class white family and leftists being oppressed by the Mexican government, or government sponsored militia. The latter subject matter wasn't given a thorough enough treatment. There was a lot of screen time wasted on the rich families drama. Didn't need it. Didn't care. The film would have been better off using that time to flesh out its bigger ideas.But I must admit that it's a beautiful looking film with one terrific performance (the aforementioned). And I learned a few things, so it was totally worth the watch. It just wasn't as great as it was built up to be."
ROMA,23 February 2019,1/10,"What is ""beautiful"" about this pretentious, slow, boring load of rubbish?
In what world is this tosh better than The Avengers?
I'm dumbfounded by all the praise. I could not finish watching it.
JUST TERRIBLE.
If i could give missus 10, I would."
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,"This is the only movie where I decided to view the trailer, and switched the trailer off due to boredom after 30 seconds.
However I decided to watch the movie, thinking it may be better than the trailer. I had to switch off after 10 minutes. This is another one of those arty-crafty movies that tends to surface at Oscar Awards season each year. One of those movies, like La La Land, that makes you wonder HOW did it receive so many awards.
I have had more satisfaction watching paint dry on my wall, than watching this pretentious junk.
Save two hours of your life and avoid this movie."
ROMA,3 May 2020,9/10,"Roma is, at times, painfully realistic. It captures the chaos of the world around the main characters and uses it to enhance the story beneath the surface. Every frame is packed with detail, sometimes to the extent that one loses track of the main characters for a while, enticed by the peripheral yet exigent events of the greater world.From a critical perspective, I look favorably upon any work of art that tells a story with more detail than I can absorb in a single viewing. The best movies are those that can be seen over and over again and offer a new experience each time, a cornucopia for those willing to look closer. This film does not demand repeat viewings - it tells a clear story, with a clear end - but it will entice the critic to zoom in, to examine every shot and every scene, foreground to background. This film is an exhibition of stark realism, such that few filmmakers can capture as adeptly as Cuarón."
ROMA,6 August 2020,5/10,"On a technical level, the shots, the cinematography, the acting the sound etc it's all fantastic.On a story level... It's a 20 minute story dragged out to over 2 hours. It's dull, little happens and it ultimately leaves a hollow and unsatisfied taste in the mouth."
ROMA,30 November 2018,6/10,"This in an art house movie in every sense. Minimal dialogue, slow paced, not much plot, beautifully styled sets and great b\w cinematography.There are some genuinely touching moments in Roma, the birth scene and how Cleo is practically ignored as if nothing has happened while her employer is in fact dealing with her own issues whilst trying to put on a face for the kids.I'm not quite sure how the word masterpiece or Oscar has been used in quite a few reviews. Maybe it's because I couldn't really relate to it, this is despite my mum doing 3 cleaning jobs to bring me up. It's just way to slow and boring"
ROMA,7 January 2019,2/10,I can't understand the hype! For me this is a very long and very boring film with nice pictures and a very flat story! What am I missing?
ROMA,21 January 2019,9/10,"If you are looking for a preplum of a movie set in Rome, Italy, your are at the wrong place. The Roma from the tittle refers to a district in Mexico City, where director Alfonso Cuarón grew up and to whom he gives and ode with this cioinema masterpiece.A black and white movie always gets our attention nowadays and if it is a Cuarón one, even more. the story takes place in the 70s and it expands through one year in the life of wealthy family maid. But if you are eager for some soap opera kind of movie forget about it. This is not that kind of movie. This is just a movie where things are very real and where things just happen, because the characters are just human beings and life goes on for everybody, one way or another.This movie is really a good piece of art and if you like European or Latin American cinema, you will definitely love it. But if you are expecting some kind of drama and action filled movie, just turn away. What makes the experience more fulfilling is watching it in its orignal version. It is music for your ears. A disfrutar!!"
ROMA,24 February 2019,8/10,"I don't know what it is, but something about this film made me feel like I was dreaming. The way the director recorded this is almost like seeing reality with someone elses eyes. I was skeptical after hearing about the main actors performance, but she is so natural and real that it almost felt like I was watching a documentary. I say, give it a chance."
ROMA,11 February 2019,10/10,"I sat down to watch this movie with on Netflix with no expectations, not even aware Cuaron was behind it. And I'm glad I did, because I was able to form an unbiased opinion and to fall in love with the movie on my own terms, only to be surprised later with the story behind it.The movie is beautiful, epic, breathtakng, completely fresh and different than anything before.I can't even begin to explain how good the camera work and photography are, how authentic the sets feel or how the wideness of the shots makes sure that you never have a dull moment, always feeling the need to explore with your eyes. Cuaron doesn't frame the screen so you know what to look at, and thia leads to some great payoff, as the scenws with the newspaper stand, where you really feel like one of the characters, lost in the bustle and not knowing if they really saw what (or who) thry think they saw.The story is so interesting and complex that it feels difficult to believe that it was based on a real story, much less one from Cuarons own life.The emotional wallops land with full force, and you really feel how the characters feel. The inclusion of an unknown actress in the leading role is genius as a famous actress would simply distract you and take you out of the experience."
ROMA,5 November 2021,7/10,"Well.. the only one thing that makes this movie great is just the camera works. Camera positioning, camera movement and screen framing is top notch, but the rest is mediocore.I think this movie want to contest some classic movie such as ""Citizen Kane"" or some Stanley Kubrick's movie. Also, it really try hard to be appear as classic movie, as it use black and white picture. But i should say, a word ""Classic"" is not just camera works. Classic movie must consist of good and original storyline, creative art direction, and charismatic acting, but none of them exist in this movie. It failed to contest to classics. The director too ambitious and too optimistic.And one more thing, why would this movie got 96 rating from metacritic ? Why would this movie rated on par to classics such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca, City Lights, Schindler's List, etc ? Well.. This is a joke."
ROMA,19 December 2018,1/10,"Awful, plodding, pretentious, empty.Netflix are 12 billion USD in debt, and currently have 145 million subscribers. They are yet to make a profit so new subscription growth has to be continuous for some years otherwise the whole operation might go up in smoke. Part of their strategy is to produce ""must see"" films and to do that they think they must win Oscars. I don't have any proof, and of course art is subjective, but I strongly suspect a lot of these positive reviews are simply part of the marketing strategy mentioned above.Not a worthwhile experience."
ROMA,16 February 2019,8/10,"You won't find a single shallow depth of field shot in the whole film, instead Cuaron builds a multi layered composition in each shot, with everything in focus, all beautifully choreographed to create constant movement and adds real life to the scenery. Acting is superb. Aesthetically it's among the best looking films I've ever seen. Story is touching and layered. A wonderful experience, I really hope this film wins all the awards so Netflix sees value in continuing making films like this. Bravo!"
ROMA,24 January 2019,6/10,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It is very nice looking but that's about it. It feels wrong to say that with some of the extremely dramatic events that take place in the film but I think it's the truth. The story was just boring. It shows the life of a maid and what it's like for her to go through a few traumatic events and I mean really traumatic events. The problem is that I could recognize how terrible what happens to her is but I didn't empathize as much as I feel like I should have. The emotion of the film doesn't match the emotion of the events taking place. Cleo never really comes off as anything other than something to be pitied and I don't think it should be like that. She is clearly an incredibly strong and dedicated woman but the film doesn't show us that. We have to use logic to deduce how strong this woman is. Her story is interesting and dramatic but it isn't portrayed in a way that keeps the viewer occupied. Mostly, nothing happens in the movie except for a couple moments of intense drama. The visuals are nice and there are some legitimately fantastic looking shots but most of the appeal, for me, comes from the fact that it's filmed with such a high resolution camera. I'm not sure why it's in black and white either."
ROMA,11 February 2019,3/10,"This movie was incredibly boring. I am mystified at all the hoopla over this. It has just won a BAFTA award on that venue. My spouse grew up in Mexico .She loved the people in Guadalajara.Her life there, 50s-60s, was far more interesting than this film. She thought it was boring too. Not our cup of tea I guess."
ROMA,26 December 2020,7/10,Certainly interesting take on a year in life of a Mexican. Loved the attention to detail in every scene. Feels very much life-like.
ROMA,8 March 2019,3/10,"This film was two hours of straight boredom. There was no plot and it was so slow. So monotone. And again, so boring. It was a true movie torture and I don't know how I managed to watch it till the end."
ROMA,12 February 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuarón has clearly had 'Roma' rattling around his creative head ever since his film-obsessed childhood in Mexico City, which forms the basis behind this masterpiece of filmmaking. The film is entirely black & white, with a stripped-back narrative that excels in extracting beauty from mundanity.Cuarón has always ensured his films such as the masterful 'Children of Men' and 'Gravity' are shot impeccably, usually with the help of expert Emmanuel Lubezki. For 'Roma', however, he takes over DP duty himself. In doing so, he showcases his considerable skill by focusing on gorgeous slow pans and improbably long takes. This really is one of the most aesthetically pleasing films I've seen: any given shot could be framed.The minimalist plot - essentially a series of delicately-constructed vignettes chronicling the relationship between a Mixtec maid and the family she works for - allows for deeper exploration of character. Schoolteacher Yalitza Aparicio had never acted before this, but you wouldn't know it from the astonishing degrees of pain and love which she exhibits. The family she lives with is one of the most natural ever put to film, featuring a group of children free of the cloying sentimentality displayed by trained Hollywood child actors. Marina de Tavira is equally impressive as a matriarch struggling with her marriage. Every small event which the characters experience feels monumental in the context of the story, due to the effort which has gone into developing the characters in a realistic, fulfilling manner.The film's dialogue is also consistently grounded in humanity, and the script even gets the chance to explore some absurdist comedy during a martial arts scene. The lasting sensation of the film, however, is one of melancholic beauty. I was left overwhelmed by the intensely personal nature of it: it is at times akin to reading the diary of someone detailing intimate family secrets. The film also manages to evoke tears, and is one of those rare pieces which can do so without sweeping, moving music or heartfelt dialogue.This is by no means a film to be watched lightly, and is not conducive to casual watching: many people will be understandably put off by what is essentially watching exquisitely beautiful paint dry. For me however, 'Roma' is a true artwork of a film, peerless in its elegant, graceful tranquility. 95/100"
ROMA,4 January 2019,10/10,A movie simple and authentic.Imposible to imagine Hollywood can do something like that.All the actors play brilliant altrough only one is pro.It's obivosly a direct movie.The making is amazing.The fact doesen't have an end is the icing on the cake
ROMA,21 December 2018,7/10,The visual and details is outstanding. No need to be dramatic to show the real drama.
ROMA,27 December 2018,7/10,"There are a few undeniable things about 'Roma.' It's amongst the most gorgeously shot black and white films on record, which is all the more impressive considering Alfonso Cuarón serves as the film's writer, director, AND cinematographer. There's also no distinguishing between fiction and reality. In particular, the actors in the movie make this slice-of-life film feel like it's a biography. And finally, if 'Roma' indeed goes on to win the Oscar for Best Picture--right now it's certainly a contender--it'll eventually be saddled with the reputation of being undeserving of the honor, much like 'Crash' or 'Shakespeare In Love.'The bottom line is that no matter how vividly shot a picture may be (*cough cough* Terrence Malick), without an engaging plot, everything else is just cinematic masturbation.Lastly, a point of privilege: one reviewer fawned over Alfonso Cuarón's camerawork, setting expectations rather high. However, while a number of sequences are indeed wonderfully shot, basic left-to-right or right-to-left pans aren't exactly innovative. For comparison, watch 'Shoplifters' while paying special attention to camera placement and movement. It's nothing short of extraordinary and likely the best camera work of any film this year."
ROMA,14 December 2018,,"First off, believe me, I tried to see it in theaters but it just did not play near me at times that were doable.
I will try to see it if there are more screenings during awards season or anything, maybe that could happen.Now to the good stuff, the film.
It is truly incredible and I'm glad I kept my hopes and dreams in check and did, like usually, not even look at a trailer or anything. That was the best thing I could do. This movie for sure works best when you just jump right into it and give yourself to it.I'm not sure where I should start with this piece of filmmaking but I think I'll just start with the performances which are absolutely brilliant and feel lived in. I truly believed in all of them and they did one hell of a job.Now to the direction, the pretty much flawless direction. It is insanely intense and you can feel the deep passion of this project and all its meanings. The execution of this whole experience is one that can't be praised enough.The main reasons why this remarkable movie works, in my opinion, are not its story but its characters that are so wonderfully brought to life by a dedicated cast, alongside the very naturalistic camerawork and of course the direction which is so personal and truthful in a way that is exceptional.I am sure there is much more to unpack, talk about and praise about it, like for example the remarkable sound of it, but I'll leave it at that for now.This is almost perfect to me, almost because there were some moments where it did not fully click for me just yet. Maybe it will completely do so after a second viewing.Roma is obviously a must-see and whether you see it in the comfort of your home, hopefully on a 4K TV at least, or in a cinema, this is going to affect you undoubtedly and that is what huge films can achieve."
ROMA,6 November 2018,9/10,"I watched Roma at TIFF ( Thessaloniki International Film Festival). The whole theater was full and the expectations from the general public were high. The opening scene was so imersive and could feel that this film would be unique. And,as usual, I wasn't wrong.
The way the film is shot adds so mutch to the experience. There are hundreds of shots that are hardly forgotten and the way certain scenes are lighted is truimphant. The whole movie is a painting, a feast for the eye and you must watch on the big screen to enjoy it
As for the story, Roma is a philosophical, emotional film that uses symbolism to talk about themes such as the ups-and-down of life, the meaning of family and loyalty to eachother and the people that come and go in our lives.
The way certain characters are introduced is so genius (pay attention at the parking scenes). Also, some hints in the backround say a lot about the flm's themes (the constant appearance of airplanes inthe sky). The first too acts are slow and built up for what's to come, because the third act isa total tour de force!
The sound editing andsound mixing is well done really well too! It uses 360 sound effects to immerse you in its painful, but beautiful world. The sound of the water and of the waves is awesome too.
My only issue is probably the fact that if you are paying attention to the film and understand the symbolism, you can easily understand th arc of the main character and that leaves you kind of unenthused.
Overall, Roma is a mature, profound and extremelly well-shot film by a director who has left his mark in every movie genre and I wouldn't be upset if it won the Best Picture or the best Cinematography.
It is a piece of art dedicated to the ones we love and the oneswe miss and shows that even the worst of experiences can mae us wiser and offer us an opportunity to a better life.Must-watch

ROMA,28 October 2018,9/10,This film is going to tear your innards out emotionally. But it'll do it so slowly that you won't see it coming. And then it'll do it again. And again. Till you have no more to give. And it's a bitter sweet joy and pain. This film could end up being the cinematic equalivalent of what grapes of wrath is to novels. Don't miss it for the world.
ROMA,17 December 2018,7/10,"I'm gonna be short with this one.
The cinematography was one of the bests I've ever seen. That's for sure, but somehow the whole movie wasn't as good. The acting was ok, the story was ok and interesting but the outcome and the way it was told was not.But it should win the Oscar for cinematography, editing and directing. No question about that."
ROMA,25 December 2018,9/10,"No matter what someone tells you, women are always on their own"".. this line sums up the whole movie; a beautiful movie about women; normal, not so successful or special and yet strong and independent women. this movie is full of beauty whenever it comes to filming techniques or the characters and if you think it's boring or meaningless I won't really tell you anything except, watch it and use your mind because it's not the kind of movie that offers itself to you easily it's not that banal or shallow, it needs some reflexion. but if your goal in watching movies is to put your mind on off mode then this movie isn't for you."

ROMA,9 February 2019,10/10,"Roma does something impossible: it captures a normal life and makes it into a brilliant movie. They pull this off by reinventing the art of film itself, bringing you so close to its characters, you just get hooked. Where do I begin?The story is about a maid working for a big family in Mexico City in the 70s. Basically, it's not special. At all. But the audiovisual portrayal of her life is so vivid, you get sucked into the screen. How? Well, it pulls two amazing tricks.Visually this is a stunning, stunning film. That's the first trick, best described as actual 'screen-glue'. The shots are gorgeous, wide, perfect sepia colored and almost painterly-like. They have a Van Gogh like quality. It's hypnotizing.Trick number two is: there is no film score. The lack of music means we get the feeling we are experiencing real life instead of a film. In real life, even in its most emotional moments, there is also no music. Which makes the films dramatic - and even its mundane - events seem even more real.It makes you wonder why so few have thought of this before. It all combines into something that can only be described by the word real. I don't think I've ever been closer to characters in a movie. Just because of how it is filmed. That's why the critics are gasping over Roma: it raises the bar.The general public is a little bit less impressed because the story seems like nothing particularly special. But I have to disagree. It really is quite heavy. But the drama stems from real life, which makes it like a gut punch.That's the whole point: apparently we can make films about real life that can leave us utterly mesmerized. For that alone you should watch it. I'm still struggling to put it into words exactly. It's hard to put your finger on it. But ultimately, Roma is epic. By not being epic."
ROMA,25 July 2019,6/10,"A cuanto corre el coche ?
Tuxpan en Veracruz.
What can I say?
1971 was long time ago.
It could be a family in Italy, Portugal or Spain at the same period.
Protect or alert about working conditions?
Not done.
If you knew the real bad cases you would laugh at this movie like a frustrated political attempt about rising some kind of awareness.
The use of gray tones was not such a good idea, although, some beautiful takes were shot, like returning, inside the Galaxy, near the end.
Not really a failure, it was something a little bit different...
Congratulations for the ensemble also about showing a culture."
ROMA,24 February 2019,9/10,"Releasing movies about the chronicle of a family, is unique to explore how the main characters would be close with each other. For the bond that would not let them be separated by anything, neither from the most tragic happening to be even shocking. Most of these stories are told in the point of view, of one or more characters who would build the stories. To see then which decision the main characters would take in the end, either to stay with their family or leaving them to hope by finding a better life. The auteur filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón uses this element for his new project, but set in Mexico where he is from. In 2018 came out Roma by Alfonso Cuarón, which is his eight movie. The movie's plot: the chronicle of a middle-class family's maid in early 1970s. The movie is filled with Mise-en-scène, which would make the scenes poetic like a painting. Especially when the camera keeps rolling for some of the long takes, to catch the audience attention without let them be distracted. The black and white color would create scenarios, by making them emotional and unforgettable. The editing has been specifically elaborated, to maintain the narration of the story without ruining the rhythm. The movie is spoken in Spanish and Mixtec which make the movie realistic, to see how the main characters would express their emotions. Usually is expected to hear soundtracks, to feel the emotions of the scenes. Instead the movie does not have any original soundtrack, but uses the sounds to feel the realism of the story. The actress Yalitza Aparicio did an excellent performance, as the maid of the middle-class Family, Cleodegaria ""Cleo"" Gutiérrez. Cleo would build the story as it is told most of the time in her point of view, as she is the one who would be so important for the family to take part of it. Roma is one of the best 2018's movies, also one of the best Afonso Cuarón's masterpieces."
ROMA,18 August 2020,8/10,This movie have a good from every aspect except the story.. i dont really get the meaning of the story and the point of this movie
ROMA,7 May 2019,2/10,"BORING with a capital B.! If this was the winner of an Academy Award I can only imagine how bad the other movies were. This movie is a waste of time. In the first few minutes you are subjected to a car running over dog turds, a naked ninja wannabee that resembles a bad porno movie, crappy dialog, and it only goes downhill from there. If you are really in need of watching something, put cloths in your dryer and watch them dry as that might be more exciting. Hated it!!"
ROMA,23 March 2020,8/10,"This movie is based on Alfonso's childhood and revolves around Cleo who is based on his maid Libo. Transforming memories into the big screen never looked this good. It's a heartwarming story that will leave you in tears. Yalitza's portrayal of the main character is brilliant. With incredible set designs and innovative camera work, 1970's Mexico is portrayed flawlessly.The director Alfonso Cauron is a genius, the same mastermind that shifted the tone of the Harry Potter movies from childish to haunting. He later went on to make ""Gravity"", another masterpiece."
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"Lord knows how much we owe to Alfonso Cuarons achievement as a filmmaker. Starting as a curiosity, then a flash in a pan, but then all of a sudden a critical darling, all of his efforts evoke a bold, minutely assembled quality. Paired with elaborate one-shot sequences, pseudo-veriteé dialogue, indulgent moments of artistic symbolism, and bits and pieces of socio-political commentary, he's willing to take the independent film scene by storm.So it's no surprise to see ROMA currently leading the Metacritic charts of 2018. And it often deserves that high praise; it's gorgeously shot, wonderfully acted, achingly heartbreaking yet sympathetic, full of memorable scenes, and holds a great sense of visual and symbolic filmmaking. Cuarón seems to have a lot of his mind while making this movie - about class, miserable mothers, war, protest, and dwindling innocence - all while taking notes from other acclaimed movies of the past decade to culminate it together.And yet there's just a small thing missing from it. Even as I nearly loved all the shots and moments of emotional ballast, I felt as though Cuarón is trying too hard? Maybe it's how often his camera lingers on some scenes, or how he clutters a lot of extras and action in one pan shot, or how there's one outlandishly grandiose moment after another in tandem to Mexican socioeconomic commentary.There's a lot of heart into this movie, but I just wished it relaxed a bit and stop trying to be, well, perfect? The scenes that mostly stick out to me were when Yalitza Aparicios character Cléo goes through their relatable and stripped-down character journey. There's no flashy panache or anything, just a maid doing her best to do her job while life flings at her face.Maybe I'm asking for too much. Maybe I should be grateful ROMA gets the recognition movies like these need, especially during these harsh times. And for the record, it does outright look like a masterpiece in some cases - that beach scene will stick with me for days. But sometimes it just slightly pales in compared to the captivatingly raunchy Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the action-movie-with-big-ideas charm of CHILDREN OF MEN.But please relax, guys. I liked it."
ROMA,4 May 2021,10/10,"Roma is a movie that I feel a person will either love or simply be bored by. Depending on your specific taste of movies. This isn't an action packed blocked buster (which many peoole prefer). Not by a long strech of the imagination. CGI isn't the selling point here, which is common in modern film making. Neither does heavy verbal exposition push the story along. Which is also an uncommon route to take, but the Mexican Director Alfonso Cuaron decided to take this route because he felt it was best to truely create a beautiful piece of cinema and tell it in a visually unique way. (A film that was based on his own memories of childhood in mexico city)First of, the film is in Spanish, so this may be off putting to some, there is dubs (but I feel emotion is always lost in dubbings) It's probably best to read the subtitles if possible. Or if you speak spanish. Watch in spanish. Also the film is filmed in black and white which gives it a unique look that isn't chosen by many directors of modern cinema and it helped a lot bring us back to the age that the film was set in, the 1960s.The film follows a girl called Celo who is the helper of a middle class household and it followers her life from the mundane to the more intense parts. Some of the more intense parts being her pregnancy. Visually and audibly are taken into her world. Tiny little details that wouldn't be deemed important by some directors are of the upmost importance here. The sound of dogs barking, the sound and sight of planes flying overhead. All add subtle layers to this world that cleo lives in and we are following her as she does. It makes the world feel truely alive and the world that the director was trying to create. So when emotional things happen in the film. They're very impactful. We don't need to hear words so much as listening and observing the environment can touch our soul more than words can.The film is free to watch on Netflix in a variety languages. I personally watched the film in spanish but I'm sure it's nearly as good in english too. I give this film a strong 10/10 and it deserved every award and good review that it recieved. The director was excellent. The cast were also amazing."
ROMA,5 February 2019,9/10,"This film was absolutely beautiful . I hope this film dominates the Oscars. It has been nominated for ten Oscars, and this films deserves to win every award it gets nominated."
ROMA,3 December 2018,,"Before I even start my review, I must say that despite how good this film may be, Roma may be one of the most overrated films of all time. It was so ridiculously overhyped that I think it affected my experience just a smidge. I mean, come on people, I did not start to levitate after the credits rolled. I would almost call this the Infinity War or the Dark Knight of overrated foreign films.With all of that being said (lol I don't mean to trash the film, just the people who are overhyping it), I sincerely enjoyed Roma. With such pristine cinematography, editing, and long takes, I couldn't believe how Alfonso Cuaron dedicated so much time and effort for his very simplistic story. The story follows a domestic worker who works as a maid for a mother of four children, where she deals with the struggles of the job and her own personal troubles, amidst a troubled period in Mexico during the 1970s. Despite the simplistic story, I was incredibly moved by the main actor and all of the supporting cast, who most have surprisingly only starred in this film.There were several scenes in this film that deeply moved me (in positive and negative ways); one involving a pregnancy and one during a trip to a beach, in particular. Even when the film is not moving you, there are tons of moments that are full of laughter, especially a couple scenes involving narrow spaces. From laughter to emotion to even really uncomfortable weird scenes, Cuaron does an extremely great job at conveying all types of feelings for the viewer.The two pinnacle components of Roma that really caught my attention were the long-takes and background characters. The long-takes were extremely well done, when they were not done in an attempt to show how many long takes the director can fit into one film. There are so many scenes in this film that are all filmed in one-take, and whenever Cuaron pulls it off in the right way, it really conveys many amazing feelings. The one on the beach is unforgettable. Even the long take during the opening credits is spectacular. Many of the takes are extraordinary, but it is worth noting that some are just done just because, and really have no merit. Like, do I need to see our main character walk up the stairs for two minutes? No, I do not.The other thing that really caught my attention were the background characters because every single individual person in the background had their own story. A scene in a theater was done so well, that you could look at any person or couple in the audience, and they would all be doing something so unique and different. Any scene throughout the film that had background characters were all doing something special, and it makes me feel like Cuaron gave direction to every single individual. It felt like I was watching real people, and it was amazing.As for complaints, the film does go a little style over substance in some cases. Like I said, the story is simplistic, well-done, and I did care a lot, but the long takes do become a little over-indulgent. I just wish that instead of the director having the need to praise his own skills, that we would just get back to the story at hand. Also, not really a complaint on the film or anything, but people, this is not the best movie ever made.Regardless, the film is a very high eight out of ten. I really do love Roma.PS: It is worth noting that The Chambermaid was trying to pull off a lot of what this film was trying to do, but the latter exceeded in every possible way."
ROMA,23 March 2020,7/10,"A bit too long a movie. I also expected more bad things to happen, like the drowning of the children at the beach WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN.I was surprised that Cleo was treated as well as she was and made a part of the family, even if she was required to work long hours. She did have some time off, enough to get involved with a bad lover.The father's love of a big big car that could not get into the garage without damage was amusing, but how likely in a supposed professor?While the family, minus the absent randy dad, was nice the movie still made me stronger than ever in my dislike of LATINO culture."
ROMA,16 January 2019,7/10,Nicely directed film with some cool cinematography. And Yalitza Aparicio's performance is simply WOW!!! Deserves an acting nomination at the Oscars. Probably this year's Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film.
ROMA,5 January 2019,9/10,"Now I know what it was like (to a degree) to have lived in Mexico City in the early 1970's. The first shot where the tiles are getting cleaned and the water reflects the sky above and a plane flies through was amazing. So simple, yet so cool. Just like the movie."
ROMA,21 September 2018,9/10,"The most stunning and poetic-beautiful film I have ever seen. Every single shot of the film feels like a character. The continuously-long shots show so much is going on in the backgrounds from the sounds and images of crowds of people, dogs barking, birds chirping to even planes flying by. These don't feel like distractions because the way Cuaron shoots them (also as his own cinematographer this time) makes them feel like they are these moving pieces of art. As the camera slowly pans through the inside of the family's house and the outside of the city and landscapes of the Mexican country, Cuaron's ability to show-not-tell immerses you into family's daily routines but also into the political climate where it reaches a boiling point in a very climatic scene. The digitally-shot black and white imaginery makes Roma feel like you step into old photograph get re-mastered and then was turned into a moving picture.But it is what's in the foreground that is what really captures our attention in the main character Cleo (a great breakout performance from Yalitza Aparicio). She is the maid to this family that lives next door and takes of their house and children. She has become so accustomed to her work routine that she practically cares and looks after the kids as if they were here own family. And family is definitely the theme to best described this film. Throughout the story the father is rarely ever there as though he does not exist. And the lack of one parental figure has certain affects on Cleo's relationship with the kids and the mother, for better and worse. As the audience watches Cleo and become more invested in her personal life throughout the story, the changes in her emotional state begins to affect you.Roma is a film packed with so many tones and emotions. There are many moments that are awkward, funny and quirky. These moments allow these characters to feel comfortable enough to show their spontaneous and optimistic sides. And then there are some where the story takes dark turns that deliver one hell of an emotional gut-punch. And by the end you feel just went through rollercoaster of emotions.I saw this film at TIFF this month and while this film is produced by Netflix to be part of their streaming service, I highly recommend you see it in theatres first, if it gets a wide theatrical release this year, because it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with great sound quality enveloping a large room. Don't let the first time you watch Roma be on your phone or tablet."
ROMA,18 February 2019,2/10,"Some beautiful photography but then again my Aunt Martha's photos of her trip to the Grand Canyon were also beautiful. That doesn't mean I can sit through
2 hours of them without wanting to fall asleep. At least I have a small amount of interest in Aunt Martha since I know her. I had no interest at all in the boring lives of
these people."
ROMA,13 December 2018,10/10,"I went to my local cinema to watch this film, it was around 4 pm, and when it ended, it was around 6:15. I live in central Mexico, the sunset was setting with beautiful yellowish-red clouds, the elote-guy was there, serving ""esquites"" or ""chascas"", and the local camote men passed through my house later that night... It was, refreshing, reinvigorating how for the first time in my entire life, a movie made me look my usually boring and small hometown, in a different but really, really beautiful way. It was the first time, that I felt really proud, really happy to be in the place I was, that showed me how my country is enriched with culture, struggle, aesthetic and paraphernalia you won't find anywhere else in the world. Close to the cinema there are some old offices with that aesthetic of the late 80s, kind of similar to the ones presented here. To me, going into the cinema theater and then going out to the real-life scenario, for the first time, I felt how it was merged and enhanced. My perspective was intensified, everything was more vivid and beautiful to the point I just wanted to cry.After this introduction to my own personal experience, wow. The movie... The film was just, in a few words: extremely captivating, mystical, beautiful, raw, sad, aesthetic, poetic. Basically, a truthful and real portrayal of the urban post-modernist Mexico, with a main story of the lives of 2 Mexican woman with different backgrounds that share similar struggles.My only critique, to be honest, is that, I would really loved if the movie showed us and enhanced, a bit more of Cleo's indigenous background, because that's a huge part of Mexico's enriched cultural personality; but I guess Cuaron's intention was not to get too deep in this aspect of the country, but instead to show how us how a urban-middle class family woman helper gets intertwined with very intense emotional struggles in the late 60s.The director not only stays there, in the depiction of the strength of the Mexican housewife and help woman that we sometimes undervalue; But also, he show us the less appealing component of Mexico, where violence and corruption is omnipresent every-single-day in our lives. In here, he recreates a glance of this reality, where to be honest, I got torn apart by its intensity and rawness, representing one of the most important political and infuriating scenarios we've had in quite some time: the 1968 student's protest that ended up in a slaughterhouse. I also saw some slight critique to the neglectful aspects of the medical care system of the country, the IMSS, but I don't know, maybe it was just my interpretation.And beyond all of the madness, chaos and sadness, to contrast we get the surrounding in peaceful and aesthetic scenes of the whole drama, with beautiful shades of the urban Mexico City, of the rural Estado de México and the stunningly poetic woods in (i think) some small ranch in Michoacán. Everything in this piece of art is magnificent: to the acting of the indigenous-rising star Yalitzia Aparicio, superb directing, captivating camera work, photography and of course, the script! I just think it was an amazing portrait with astonishing execution. Left my eyes peeled towards the sky, and towards my heart. Deserves all recognition it's currently having, do not be deceived. It deserves it.
I cannot believe Cuarón went from the plain one dimensional hollywood production in Gravity, to this. To Roma. To a masterpiece of Mexican cinema.You're a cabrón, Alfonso!"
ROMA,22 December 2018,7/10,"Film shots, sounds and acting are very good, but the script does not tell anything except the main character is pregnant. So much deeper and better scripts of technical capacity could be done. Believe this script is too cliché.⭐ 100/70"
ROMA,18 December 2018,4/10,"The film is missing one thing. Humanity. A lot of people are comparing it to the neorealist films of the 1940's and 1950's, but it's only a superficial comparison. While the film is about a nanny (based on Cuaron's own experiences with his nanny), Cuaron's style is overly technical, dry, and often, just boring. It has no sense of shared humanity or poetry. The Bicycle Thief, La Terra Trema, and Umberto D had these qualities in droves. Another complaint is that the 3 neorealist films I mentioned were shot on black and white FILM. This was not shot on 65mm black and white film, but the digital Alexa 4K. While that looks nice, black and white video does not have the same depth and soul as b/w film does, and Cuaron should have known that. It gives a dystopic feel to the proceedings, and I don't think that was the intention.This is mostly a technical exercise in neorealism. I think many people want this film to be great, but it really isn't. It looks nice, but it's very shallow and too ""aware"" for its own good. It desperately wants to be an art movie, and many critics say it is, but it is not."
ROMA,26 May 2019,6/10,"I respect the craft. I respect the cinematography, BUT you do not have to sacrifice entertainment for aesthetics. I watched 20 minutes of this film and fell asleep internally. Why torture the audience like this? Why does it have to be so slow? What's the point of art if it's not entertaining?"
ROMA,12 December 2018,10/10,"This astonishingly photographed and acted black & white from one of the greatest filmmakers from the last decade, Alfonso Cuaron, will get through your senses as if you were living there, in that troubled age in Mexico.Amongst the intense drama that define the whole movie, you get to laugh once or twice, but always focusing on a thin and not forced sense of humor, handled as a veil that covers the proximity to the climax.I had the opportunity to catch this flick on a local cinema in my town (in Mexico), a great detail from Netflix to release it in the big screen before it's plataform launch, and oh boy, I gotta tell you, it was like a christmas present, please watch this marvelous film asap, because it will be talked and discussed for a long time from now on."
ROMA,14 January 2019,7/10,"I'm a bit confused as to how I feel about this one. Many reviewers have said they felt bored, I didn't but at the same time I wasnt engrossed. It was beautifully shot and the characters and their stories held my interest but in the end I did feel as though I still didn't really know them. Some scenes(the protest, the fire, the training) felt as though they were shoehorned in so the director could showcase his talents.
I did feel sympathetic towards Cleo and her employer and their respective struggles but not to the point that I actually found myself caring what really happened to them.
I get that this is a beautifully made film and I can appreciate it for that but it is not perfect. I'm glad I watched it but it's not one I'll be rewatching in the future."
ROMA,5 May 2019,2/10,"In the interests of full disclosure I must admit I only made it half way through this movie. Perhaps that makes my review unfair but on the other hand an hour is surely sufficient time to expect some sort of payback.We immediately know this is an arthouse movie because a) it is in ""black and white"" and b) its opening credits are possibly the longest and most boring in cinematic history. Perhaps this was just a cunning and thoughtful ploy to get all the non-arty people out of the movie theater in the first few minutes thereby saving them two hours of wasted time.Inexplicably other reviewers praise the cinematography. I could not agree less. First there IS no cinematography in the commonly accepted sense. It seems to me that the cinematography is limited to pointing the camera in the general direction of the ""action"", something that is done adequately for sure but not exactly the height of sophistication and innovation. Second, the movie is in ""black and white"". There is a reason I put ""black and white"" in quotations. Real black and white is what people used to make with black and white film, and if you want to see what this looks like, and some REAL cinematography using all the finesse and effects that black and white film allows, you could do a lot worse than watch ""The Third Man"", a masterclass in the use of lighting. ""Roma"" has evidently been filmed in colour and someone has clicked the ""convert to Black and white"" button on some software to produce this insipid parody of black and white. It has such a limited dynamic range there is virtually no contrast and it should more accurately called ""grey and white"". I found it incredibly difficult to watch and impossible to pick out any detail. Technicalities aside we might reasonably ask why a film set in the 70s should be made in ""black and white"" at all. What exactly was the point in this decision?We might equally well ask the same of the plot - was there actually any point? We are presented with about a dozen characters none of whom we get close to. They are all just cardboard cutouts that we see as props rather than characters than we can empathize with and root for. I really don't care about the Doctor and his wife's problems because I don't know who they are. Ditto, the two maids. Where did they come from? Why should I care? We see them go through their daily routines but, well, so what? One of them suddenly finds herself in a hotel room with a virtual stranger waving a curtain rail about. Of course she gets pregnant. But who is she? Why did she just jump into bed with a stranger? We will never know because we don't know her as a person. It is all very intellectual and distant.Roma is not a ""bad"" movie as such but it is extremely pretentious and seemingly made for the gratification of the director rather than for an actual audience."
ROMA,6 June 2019,10/10,"Rome is one of the most impressive movies of this century. Meticulous, grandiose and thrilling, the direction and cinematography of Alfonso Cuarón achieve the feat of re-creating the culture of the 1970s in Mexico City under the simple-minded perspective of a faithful domestic servant without losing a single important detail.Although the camera follows all the moves of Cleo, also nanny of the four children of the couple António and Sofia, the view that we have of the large-format open plans is always from the bottom up, as if we shared with one of the children (probably the director) the admiration of monumental scenes, like the waves of the sea, which constitute, for an adult, dayly ordinary facts.Roma was a middle-class neighborhood with luxurious homes and staffs of maids, cooks, babysitters and drivers. From dawn on, when she wakes up the children to school, until dusk, when she turns out the lights, Cleo seems to attend to all desires, serving meals, cleaning the dog Borras' droppings, washing all the clothes and whispering with the cook Adela in the Mixtec dialect.The meticulous and safe way in which the master introduces the powerful Galaxy 500 into the tight hallway that serves as a garage is a phallic symbolism that indicates a patriarchal and masculine predominance in all the conflicts of the plot. Abandoned by him, Mrs. Sophie will say about women ""we are all alone.""Interchangeable in the daily routine, there are defining moments, such as the father's trip without return, an earthquake, a broken window in a fight, a fire at New Year's party and the (almost) drowning of children in the Tuxpan sea. One of the most poignant scenes, Cleo's delivery by real doctors and nurses, comes just after one of Mexico's greatest tragedies, the Halconazo, when dozens of students were massacred by paramilitaries in 1971 Corpus Christi.At the end of the film, the family returns to the house once more. Cleo expresses for the first time a desire: she did not want her baby."
ROMA,27 March 2020,8/10,"It is quite an accomplishment, in my opinion, for a movie to achieve beautiful artistic cinematography AND a narrative that captivates the viewer, and about a third of the way through, I thought it was going to be a film that only did the former. I'm happy to report that I was quite wrong. This is a beautifully, thoughtful movie that is visually challenging and captivating all at once. You care about the characters and are interested in their goings. It has a lot to say about the exploitation of women and class structure doesn't discriminate in that regard. It also speaks to the resilience of a mother, which resonated in a striking way with me who has an incredible mom. Beautiful movie."
ROMA,21 February 2019,8/10,"Roma is a very personal film to the director, it is apparent from the way the story is told. The protagonist 'Cleo' is the heart of the movie and one year in her life makes one hell of a gorgeous, poetic, haunting movie. The cinematography is stunning, the story is poignant and left me with a sense of melancholy and hope."
ROMA,20 December 2018,9/10,"A rich family, a large house, a bunch of kids of all ages, a chaotic household, a dog and chiks and birds to complete the anarchic life, Roma tells the story of a maid whose life is woven around the family, who is loved almost like a family member and the kids love her too. She is made pregnant by a passing through irresponsible young man but loses the baby. The mistress of the house loses her husband to another woman. The employee and the employer suffer fate of love in separate ways but the distinction between the rich and poor doesn't count. This rich, placid almost uneventful and yet eventful life is what makes Roma so different and so cinematically unique. The camera watches from a distance but watches it closely.
The movie begins with water poured on the entrance passage and makes it reflect the sky where a plane passes overhead in the sky. The credits roll in the end against the sky between tall building structures when you see planes one by one passing overhead in the sky. This passing of aeroplanes in the sky repeats in many frames. Does Alfonso Cuaron want to convey something through this? I don't know. The rumble of passing plane is creatively used in the soundtrack which is minimal, unobtrusive and yet significant.
The pace of the film is measured which makes it grow into you. The tragic events are not overbearing and yet significant in the lives of maid and her mistress.
The monochrome photography enhances the effect of the images which colour would have taken away the thoughtfulness behind them.
Roma is a masterpiece and I won't be surprised if it wins the best foreign film Oscar."
ROMA,16 March 2019,10/10,"A splash of soapy water on the floor, scrubbing, more water, and more. A reflection of a window in the puddle. More water coming in like waves lapping at the beach. A reflection of a plane flying through the reflection of the window. That's how Roma starts. And that's the way it stays. Every single black and white shot is a work of art. Never pretentious or artificial, but alive. The tension is palpable. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but always real. Whether it's Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) running through the crowded streets in search of her naughty charges. Or the mother (Marina De Tavira) trying to squeeze the giant sedan into their very narrow driveway. Or the grandma (Veronica Garcia) crying at the hospital reception desk. Or... If I don't stop, I might end up retelling the whole movie. And there's no way I'll be able to do it justice."
ROMA,2 March 2019,9/10,The imagery and symbolism are beautiful and poignant. Some say Cleo is too stoic to convey emotion but her repressed emotion is palpable. So while there isn't a lot of action plot wise there is always two or three images to process and appreciate how they complement portrayal of cleo and the family. It's a masterpiece. My only complaint is sometimes it gets manipulative and heavy handed. The wedding being celebrated behind Sofía's family after she just told them their father is leaving is an example of this. So is the car that is too big for her to drive so she downsizes.Which is supposed to show how overwhelmed her relationship was and how much control she possesses with him gone. Those type of symbolic themes seemed forced and contrived.
ROMA,10 December 2018,2/10,"Don't het me wrong, I'm not saying that Roma is a bad flick. It's just that Alfonso Cuaron has so much potential and we gat this sappy family drama!?!! I mean he has Spielberg/Cameron level potential. Children of Men is one of the best movies ever made. Azkaban and Gravity are also extremely excellent. I mean studios would be willing to give out a high production cost to him for a blockbuster and he chooses to make this!! Other directors are always complaining that the studio isn't giving them enough money to make their movie. Cuaron would not face that problem. And meanwhile Nolan keeps putting out these over-budget condescending narcissistic movies and is receiving high acclaim. Star Wars has been ruined. Alfonso Cuaron would have been an excellent Star Wars Director."
ROMA,9 March 2019,8/10,"Amazing way of telling a simple story and keep your attention till the end. A 2 hour 15 min story which never bores you. Characters grow beautifully. Cuaron as cinematographer, writer and director is the STAR."
ROMA,6 December 2020,4/10,"The kind of ""artful pretentiousness"" that Hollywood loves. Yes, parts of it were interesting, but some problems: 1) some scenes that are ridiculous and do nothing to move things along (like the drunk singing during the forest fire, or 10 minutes of martial arts class), 2) the family's kids are annoying as heck, 3) the lead generates some sympathy but has all the acting skills of a cardboard cutout. And what's with the jets? In sum, the most sympathetic characters are the family dog (despite the fact that it craps constantly) and their poor Ford Galaxy, which gets treated LIKE crap.Glad I didn't spend $15 to see this in the theater."
ROMA,25 December 2018,10/10,"After utter disappointment with super hero movies, I went back to my favorite genre - Drama. Roma is an outstanding movie with a great message - simplicity and love."
ROMA,31 March 2019,10/10,"A theater of memories inside the filmic textures. The camera almost feels like a ghost's eyes wandering across an exaggerated reality. So I emphasize the piece as 'heightened theater'. It hijacks us inside the magical banal. Cuaron being hollywood is just bizarre for how he sees versus coverage by committee. Though we should not take points away for his abilities to 'connect' rather examine how he serves every strata. Always these films, once they get going and time passes, we fall in love. But the restless cinema here points to a film of the future that a lot of his contemporaries are leading as well with the sheer variety and methods in seeing. It is not satisfied with itself or smug. I like how he is not like Malick who tries to reinvent seeing. Its foundation is theater making it extremely pleasing, and spoils us in black and white. You live inside it. He is too human to be the machine-like filmmaker so the tour is not of space, or the time, or across memories; all of which it hints... rather it tricks you with its texture, he shoots blockbusters afterall, so hangs the film on the protagonist's interconnection. This is where it steers oddly via the class divide, in my opinion avoiding there being a brutal disconnect through its wisdom. But this maid is so morally at highground that her position is unavoidably a powerful symbol: when she is unhappy, I despise these people. When she is happy, I'm happy. The undercurrent of her contentness betrays our yearning for this underdog revolution, it can be argued there is an abuse of the filmmaking power how it does not give her any sort of victory. Inherently, it can't avoid me thinking of this. You can't point the camera to this and not see it's about have's and have nots. Of course it is Cuaron's memory summation achievement ala Truffaut, Fellini, Jodorowsky as every auteur is entitled, but via his sheer amount of industry power brings a certain luxuriousness that I thought it is too wise to ring true. How it clicked is when I realized he knows this; he is the boy looking back on a neorealist fever dream; meaning he is aware of every gray area, is guilty and with us wishing better for her, in agreement with every outrage. Your discomfort is his accountability. Roma is a future holographic cinema of conscience and consciousness. A love letter with scale to a faltering medium, a Picasso on screen."
ROMA,25 November 2018,10/10,"ROMA is so not much the luminous recollection of the past stressed by many as a neo-realist panorama intensified by an raptuously detailed recapture of things past. It differed from most neo-realist masterpieces --BICYCLE THIEVES, LA TERRA TREMA-- not only in the radiance imbuing every detail because of obsessive recollection, but in the the social range of its vision, which encompasses all social classes and addresses issues of patriarchal and racial as well as class injustice. It not only delivers on the neo-realist concern for the the details of the physical environment -- the street scenes and work places -- of the social world, but invigorates the neo-realist language with spectacle -- the sportsfield, political demonstration and its police repression, the roar of the sea. One apparent precedent for this combination of rapturous memory, social realism and spectacle is John Ford's HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, but ROMA is free of the Ford film's sentimental excesses - singing miners that seem ready to parade their way into a Broadway musical, familial intimacy belied by exclamatory performances.Immersive, instructive, and heartbreaking"
ROMA,25 January 2019,7/10,"I liked Roma. Obviously it looks great, it also has elements of an epic family saga, although it doesn't quite hit that note fully, kinda wish the film would have been longer for a bigger impact in that regard. More importantly Roma has a liberating aura - life's a chaos where undesirable things happen, but in the end you'll survive. For me, the film had the potential to be a grand study of life, but it's more of an essay the way it is, still good.I've yet to see a masterpiece from Cuaron, but have immense respect for him for tackling different genres - versatility is highly admirable, whether we're talking about directors, actors or film buffs for that matter.Rating: 7/10"
ROMA,16 December 2018,4/10,"Sorry but I just don't get it? I realize the depth of it, but unfortunately it dragged on to the point of boredom. Yalitza Aparicio is excellent in it & a serious actress, but the movie just left me wondering what all the hype was about? It was emotional yes, but a great film...not!!"
ROMA,7 January 2019,10/10,"Cuaron's Roma is undoubtedly one of the best realistic films throughout history, I say this because you'll find yourself lost in Roma, so immersed with how things are happening in a tedious way, much like life itself, that aspect of realism is fully captured by Cuaron as he presents us with an insight so vivid and so clear and raw you could swear that you're watching a real-life events happening in front of you, it gives you the chance to observe and asses and more importantly feel and relate to strong emotions from pain to love and in a manner that is very genuine, in all honesty, Roma is something really special, I can't start to describe how into it I was, I loved how Cuaron chose his camera angels, to provide the maximum presence, it just flows naturally, again at times it feels all too real, and that right there is near impossible to capture in such manner, it takes and lot to make something so simple.The acting is spectacular, almost half the film we're presented with articulate shots that speaks volumes and doesn't need any dialogue to explain it, an also, Cuaron's attention to the background which is a story in and of itself.What I'm trying to say here is Roma is as pure as they come, it's like an untouched part of nature so beautiful and so wild, it demands admiration, so ultimately, Roma is a fine piece of craft and an extremely rare gem, I absolutely, completely, utterly, fully enjoyed and loved this film, the power of film doesn't get stronger than this."
ROMA,19 February 2020,5/10,"If you're someone who can appreciate undeniably amazing cinematography, then give Roma chance. That is something this movie deserves awards in. It has a very unique style utilizing a lot of long shots and has so many details in every scene. It's subtle storytelling is so well done.
That aside, I completely understand and share people's gripes. However, giving the movie a 1/10 is the sign of a shallow and unappreciative viewer. Yes, the story here was not very compelling to me and was outright boring for long sections. Pacing is very uneven and there litteraly is not even a plot point until the 40 minute mark.
I also understand that foiegn films have different styles, but I still think there's something fundamentally wrong with giving me as much or more screen time of people going about their daily tasks and transition shots, rather than y'know, a movie.
Just bizzare, it's something I and anyone who appreciates movies (instead of just mindlessly absorbing them) should appreciate, but at the same time, nobody should expect you to enjoy this movie for the sake of entertainment."
ROMA,22 November 2020,6/10,"Beautiful images aesthetic great!
Ordinary life of a poor Mexican woman in the 70...
Really the best movie of 2018? Except for what Slavoz zizek said except for the small moment where the girl admit she didn't want the baby... kind of statement about her status for a minute.
Maybe for everything that she is keeping for herself. Clostrophobic at some point.
But two hours really? Slow motion submissive women etc.. if you don't know that Roma is a district of Mexico .. no really a waste of talents
And poor story line"
ROMA,20 December 2018,9/10,"I knew very little about Roma before the week it dropped on Netflix. Most of the information I had heard about it was from articles about Netflix trying to get it to play in theaters. I know that there were reports of the company trying to buy out theaters to show this as big as they could. Most film people were talking about it as this epic film from Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity, Children of Men). I was intrigued by the fact alone he was having a new film debut. He's a fantastic artist who does some very interesting things camera wise and storytelling wise with simple stories. I didn't want to read too much into what Roma, only glossing over a byline and hear minor details.This film is his masterpiece. It's also intimate, autobiography tale of a time in his life. But he's never really mentioned by name. The story follows a maid and the family she cares for in the early '70s of Mexico City. The story spans a year in her life. As the saying goes a lot can happen in a year. The film does start off slow. There is some excellent camera work and a lot of one takes that immerse the viewer in the story. About the 30 minutes in the story picks up. Cuaron does a magnificent job of investing you in these characters. IT doesn't feel like a film, it feels like watching these characters in their everyday lives. We go a window into what it's like to live in this era. He fully takes advantage of that.It would be a shame if lead actress Yalitza Aparicio who plays Cleo doesn't get some award recognition. The film is full no stars, just many actors and they all are on their game. Aparicio stands out above all. You feel for her, are scared and happy for her. The emotional range and depth she brings to the Cleo is astounding. If by the end of the film you are cheering for her and shedding tears then you might need to seek help. But the entire cast feels real, not like they are just playing parts. My favorite of them all is the youngest son who tells some fun stories to Cleo in their interactions.Cuaron proves that he is the Oscar-winning director that still has much to show us. His camera work is so good here. The long takes, tracking shots, it all fits so perfectly with the story he is telling. He even shot this film himself. Not collaborating with longtime partner Emmanuel Lubezki. It is a beautiful looking film entirely in black and white. I couldn't see this film in any other way. There is a scene during the holiday season where a group of people is trying to put out a fire in the woods, it's gorgeous. I'd be shocked if he didn't win the best cinematography award at the Oscars.Roma is all around a masterclass in filmmaking and storytelling. The cast is excellent, the story is simple but will suck you in. It's beautifully shot, heartwarming, endearing and hopefully. I would be shocked if this film didn't take home multiple Academy Awards in 2019. For sure it should win for best cinematography and best director. I would hate for this film to get relegated to the best foreign film category. This film should win for Best picture easily. And if I was on the committee it would have my vote."
ROMA,29 April 2019,10/10,"Watching ROMA yesterday made me think about both the complexity and beauty in creating this true masterpiece of art. It makes you think you are watching a kind of documentary, but after a while, in case you are able to open up your mind and your hearts, you realize that it's a piece of highly realistic fiction, where every single frame, every picture, every actress and actor, and especially the sound causes the impression of reality itself, as if you weren't watching a movie at all. This seems to be simple, but it's an extremely difficult task, and the result is overwhelmingly successful.
There seem to be a lot of people around feeling irritated and bored by the experience of watching this movie. I know one has to understand that not everybody is able to appreciate a true work of art, but people proudly documenting their lack of empathy with what this movie offers to an open minded human being is in my opinion just a sad document of increasing ignorance, nothing else."
ROMA,2 June 2021,7/10,"Piece of Art This is an exceptional movie Better than expected Nicely Directed Film with Some Cool Cinematography Oscar for cinematography Beautiful cinematography, amazing cast, weak plot and por carácter development."
ROMA,7 February 2019,2/10,"The camera pans watching someone do chores.
The camera pans watching someone clean.
The camera pans watching someone washing clothes.
The camera pans watching someone washing up.
The camera pans watching someone walk around.
The camera pans watching someone etc
The camera pans watching someone ad nauseumLooks pretty, but wow is it boring with nothing happening. Ever.Alfonso Cuarón please return to REAL film making!!!"
ROMA,18 December 2018,1/10,"Cuaron's reputation precedes him, which makes this snoozefest even more disappointing.As for the cinematography, check out the goofs and inaccuracies. It's a film, filled with mistakes, just like any other. Except it's in black and white to please the art film crowd.And the audience suffers through by watching it, which means Oscars next year because viewers need to have some meaning for the wasted 2+ hours.An indulgent film that people will give 10 stars to when they review it because they have been told how great it is.It's not."
ROMA,21 December 2018,1/10,"Seriously, i was dying before the opening credits had finished. That splashing sound was killing me and the sudsy water was turning my stomach, making it impossible for me to swallow my formerly delicious eggnog.But i doubted my own doubts, i kept watching even though i wasn't sure if it was the bracketed subtitles that i was supposed to be reading, or the unbracketed ones. I lasted about 25 minutes and then decided to read some IMDB reviews because i still couldn't trust my own unsophisticated views and had to get confirmation from some other slobs. Which i did. I felt vindicated! You're not alone!Anyway, i'll give it this... it's a beautiful looking movie, smashing cimematography. The actors seemed excellent too, i thought i was watching a documentary. But i was bored. The word pretentious comes to mind but maybe i'm just a dullard and unable to glean the finer things. I've been called worse."
ROMA,9 May 2019,8/10,"The storyline is pretty simple. The movie follows a maid who stays with the family she is serving for about an year.The breathtaking screenplay and the effort behind some of the scenes is awesome to watch. The old vintage cars, people with old 70s clothes and the black & white styled movie is well worth a watch."
ROMA,7 March 2019,8/10,"Roma is the place where this story happens (Mexico) and so the movie name ""ROMA"" ; first of all i thought it was Cleo's real name. Applause to the director/writer/Cinematographer - Mr.Alfonso Cuaron for giving such a natural and rich movie. This movie is based on the story of Alfonso's family servant ""Libo"". When i mentioned the word ""Rich"" which means the movie is rich in its perfection of shots. Cinematography has struck me and blew my mind as each and every shots are magnificent and i paused at many instances to see the photography and was pleased by the beauty of frames.
And i knew that the movie will be a slow moving but i never felt bored as i fall in love with the DOP from the beginning itself. The Story is simple and not an extra ordinary one but a simple story has portrayed in such a way that it has evolved into a great cinematic experience. I was touched by the few scenes at the hospital and the climax. ""The Car parking shots, the cleaning shots,hospital scenes, frames at the beaches especially the climax and many "". Cleo was excellent and the other main actors were fine in projecting their characters. Over all a beautiful experience and full marks to Alfonso for his impressive efforts (especially DOP)"
ROMA,25 February 2019,9/10,"If you give away 15 million dollars to a good director and say, ""no worry about box office, we are at behind you, just fallow your dream"" then you will have a beautiful film like Roma."
ROMA,15 December 2018,1/10,"This was not made for the public, but for the sole enjoyment of the director. Congratulations for getting Netflix to pay for it. But then again, Netflix pays for anything. This might explain why the movie has a scene with dog feces being squashed by car's tires and a nude martial arts scene."
ROMA,24 December 2018,8/10,"Alfonso Cuarón has officially earned the title auteur after delivering his latest film, Roma. Serving as director, writer, producer, editor, and cinematographer, Cuarón painstakingly crafted virtually every aspect of this film, himself, to match his vision. For that reason, Roma should be considered a triumph of a film. However, while watching it on Netflix, I found myself a bit detached from the story and the atmosphere that Cuarón had established. Interestingly, it is the authenticity and grounded nature of Roma that make it both so brilliantly crafted but also so hard to relate to. Although I was dazzled by what Cuarón did as a director, I felt Roma lacked in accessibility for a general audience. Roma is less of a film and more of a recreation of true life. We are never given character introductions, telling us who they are or what motivates them, just as you wouldn't if you were to meet someone for the first time in real life. Over the course of the film, the audience is given pieces here and there that give hints of backstory and motivation for the main characters, but nothing is ever brought into focus, allowing the viewer to fill in the gaps themselves. This bold technique of presenting human beings rather than movie characters is one of the ways that Cuarón constructs life as genuinely as can be done in film but also makes the movie a bit hard to relate to. Although for me, Roma didn't come together to become more than the sum of its parts, I think it is an absolute masterpiece in filmmaking that will cement Cuarón as one of the greatest living filmmakers."
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,"The writing, acting and directing were great but the cinematography and audio really stood out to me. It was so easy to imagine being right there with the characters. A complaint is that some of the shots at the beginning seem like they're taking a lot of time showing us nothing, but the movie really picks up and earns the 2 hour runtime. I advise anyone to see this film. My thoughts may change when I rewatch it."
ROMA,21 December 2018,6/10,"Rome has the particularity of being a meticulously crafted movie, with great cinematographic moments, but it lacks essential elements: a good story to tell and interesting characters. It's a film made by someone who knows the technique of cinematographic works of art very well but is incapable of bringing interest to the events or giving a deep dimension to the characters. In fact, it's frustrating how blurry the image we have of the family is, there's virtually no close-up or any emotional or revealing dialogue. The maid's character barely stands out, although due to her natural introversion and submission, her role does not grow in importance. It's not a bad film, but it lacks the artistic and intellectual honesty that the Italian films of the 50s and 60s had, to which it refers openly or veiled on several occasions. Having said that, there remain some anthological scenes, of great cinematographic power, but which are small treasures hidden in a rather conventional and scarcely entertaining story. It is enough to review a film like Pasolini's Accatone to notice the enormous difference in intensity, honesty and artistic level of the cinema to which Cuarón pays tribute."
ROMA,22 January 2019,8/10,"Visually Stunning in black and white. It would be awesome to have another b&w film win best picture .( The Artist)
The emotional breakdown of Cleo on the beach is Oscar worthy.
Roma must mean- men are scum . The women are the center of this movie.
If you like subtitles..you will love this movie."
ROMA,17 February 2019,4/10,"This would have been better as a series of photos in a gallery, then it would have been amazing. Does not suit its medium as a piece of art.Yes, the critics love this. But it's emperor's new clothes. The audiences do not like it as much. Here's why.I had no interest in this film after seventeen minutes, no investment, no motivation, because there's nothing at stake. It seems to be a voyeuristic look at ""how maids live."" My husband said, ""if she makes breakfast in the next scene, nothing's going to happen and we can leave."" She did. So we left. We then compared what happens in other movies that have been up for awards at the seventeen minute mark. It was amazing. Try it. Beast, for example, has its whole first act over with.Netflix, get some balls with directors. This is getting silly. There's a thing called plot arc. It's needed. Find out about it. Replace the director's ego with it. The films you produce will be better received. Very underproduced and badly conceived all round. We aren't forgetting these things as a paying audience, however many people you pay to praise your movies."
ROMA,1 January 2019,7/10,"Black and white Spanish language drama with English subtitles. It's a story about a middleclass family in which the father leaves the mother and four kids, and the housekeepers who work for them. The film follows the characters for about a year that starts with the happy family, bounces through the husbands departure, and adds an out of wedlock stillborn baby by the one (of two) housekeepers. It's a super high-end artsy film with great lighting and sound, but it plods for more than two hours. All that attention really demanded a more compelling story. The film was produced by Netflix and released in theaters for a single week before streaming, apparently so it would get Oscar votes. I spent $8 to see at a proper theater (where I was the only person in the room), rather than $7.95 to see it at home with a month long Netflix subscription. I'm glad I made the effort, but the film was a disappointment."
ROMA,19 December 2018,7/10,"Hmmm... i got a mixed feelings about this one, i think it's a well-executed film but i just don't feel it. let me decipher itinteresting things:
i love the how details in the film were presented, the way the father park his car, two character pretending to die, etc, also how some events like the riot and the aftermath entangling with the delivery scene were very good indeed, those elements made the film really feels like an authentic scrap of memory from Alfonso because it's a personal film for him. i love seeing the settings because it's kind of the same with where i live. and the cinematography is quite gorgeous.not so interesting things:
the story and the plot are average at it's best, simple is great but uninteresting is not great, by saying that doesn't mean that Alfonso Cuaron's and his childhood maid's life is uninteresting, i just feel that he could find a better formula or maybe dig a little more deeper into his past or his heart or his writing. the taste is kinda bland for me.it could also be because of the expectation that i have for the film which is very high, but i don't know, i might rewatch it another time."
ROMA,23 December 2018,3/10,"Biggest problem for me was almost a complete lack of three dimensional characters. I guess the main woman the film follows around was the main protagonist, but I felt like I was watching paint dry. There was an emotional void in the performances and the film's basic lack of any sort of story or direction. Lots of dramatic scenes came off rather silly, generating more chuckles than any sort of real feelings.I gave it 3 out of 10, giving it one point for cinematography, one point for it being a finished film, and one point just because people seemed to like it. I have to wonder have A. Cuaron was thinking when he shot this screenplay (if there was an actual screenplay - maybe it was improv?)."
ROMA,28 January 2019,8/10,"I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch Roma. Yes, I knew Alfonso Cuaron is a talented Academy Award-winning director, but a black and white movie about a maid-I had my doubts. Well, let me tell you, this film is not for children or even the average teenager. It's not for dudes looking for a Marvel action movie, or those who love a romantic comedy. It's my guess, the best audience for this film are for those who like to be entertained by thinking, appreciate art, and are aware of two important points-this film is about the director's life while growing up. And that the title of the film, Roma, is the name of the neighborhood he lived in as a middle-class child in Mexico. That's all you need to know. From that point on you have to be patient and allow the director, who is in total control of the film, to tell you his story through vivid photography, terrific composition, detailed pacing, and touching performances. This is a small personal story told, at times, in an epic way. It's a film that if you look at it in pieces you might find yourself wondering why is the director giving so much time and focusing so much attention to the mundane. Then another sequence can be intense, another brutal. All along Mr. Cuaron is offering hints and nuances again through superb work with the camera and composition to fill in the gaps. Once you look at the film as a whole, you'll get the message. Now the core of the message has to be intellectually analyzed and absorbed-but that's the true entertainment of this brilliantly conceived film."
ROMA,24 December 2018,8/10,"At first glance, ""Roma"" looks like an endless 2h15min movie where nothing happens. But it is in the drama of life that lies the strength of the new film by Alfonso Cuaron.In the one-year history of the life of a middle-class Mexican family, Cuarón was able to grasp and understand that the essence of everything is in the details. She is in the expansive pain of Sofia (Marina de Tavira), whose husband changed her by the lover leaving her alone to take care of the four children. Or she is in the silent pain of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a young housekeeper who finds herself involved in a problem when she becomes pregnant with a man who has just used her.The journey of love, care, pain and respect unites Sofia and Cleo, mistress and maid, worlds so different, fragments of their families that unite to maintain sanity while following the course of this often painful walk that we know as life.From the beginning Cuarón breaks the signs of this story to show the union of two women so different that they try, in a certain way, to find forces in each other as they deal with the absence and inoperability of their garbage men who left behind.""You're always alone,"" Sofia warned, at a gutter moment when she got home drunk and crashed the huge car across the walls of the narrow garage of the family home. A clear contrast to her husband's caring at the same time he did not show the same zeal with his own family.In a time of great success in the work of Elena Ferrante, the tetralogy that begins to come alive with the HBO series and tells a story of empathy and rivalry between two friends, ""Roma"" is also a story of two women so different they need support to maintain sanity. Although in this work there are not moments of rivalry, but the pain of each one that crosses the other and that empathizes on both sides.When it is expected that the film is going to show the difficulties of the maid in the face of the lack of compassion of the bosses, Cuarón shows that its film will go by another slope. It is in the reception of the mistress in front of the employee who is afraid of losing her job when she discovers that she is pregnant, which strengthens the relationship of these two women.Cleo's journey, however, is nevertheless the most interesting. As much as she feels embedded in that family, that is never her family. When you walk through the house, your steps are marked, your eyes are self-guarded, your discomfort is evident, because your home is not your home. She just feels comfortable with her sister.Maybe that's why she tried to find a love like her sister. And the association with Fermin (Jorge Antônio Guerreiro) was the worst possible, as he turns out to be someone who is not trustworthy in every respect.Cleo also finds herself in a deep discomfort with her pregnancy. She does not like it, guilt only consumes it. And only the sea cleanses her soul to the point of finally letting it out, in the midst of tears, how unwanted that son was.""Roma"" has a huge force, but it's not an easy movie. There are many slow scenes where nothing but life happens. But there is a lot of beauty in Cuarón's work. And in this journey of life, with different turning points, deep marks and the need for resignifications is that ""Roma"" is so great."
ROMA,19 February 2020,1/10,"What happened to movies? Why are so many award winners movies today so horribly boring or stupid? Because critics are all mostly judging films for political reasons and nothing else. This is one of the most pointless and boring films that has ever been made but I can only assume critics felt they couldn't criticize anything ""Mexican"" so here we are, another pointless, eye crossing bore of a film getting rave reviews and awards. I'm moderately liberal but the far left (extreme) are mostly the ones doing film reviews today and they all parrot each other on everything and once a couple of reviews come out everyone else follows, give or take a few. Other than some nice cinematography, Roma is completely and totally pointless. It's like a documentary where a camera follows someone of no interest for a year. That's it. There is nothing else. Okay I'm going back to sleep now goodnight."
ROMA,28 January 2019,10/10,"BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!!!. I have no words to describe this. Thank you Alfonso Cuarón for having given us such a wonder of a cinematographic experience. Technically I cannot imagine how a film can be better. But this is not the whole story, actually technical aspects are just a complement of what is one of the greatest stories ever shown on cinema. Sadly many people here say things like ""it has no story"", ""it's boring"" and so on, how unfortunate it must be to lack the sensitivity to appreciate and properly understand a story which is as compelling as the most intricate imaginable plot. The personage of Cleo is one of the most moving, elaborated, complex and realistic in cinema history, and the interpretation of Yalitza Aparicio is of eleven out of ten, perfection made intrepretation; each of her facial expressions throughout the film describes a whole inner world so precisely that you can actually read her soul. The story may seem simple at first sight, but it is full of details of deep meaning and complexity, from the small stories of every personage to the Mexican society and urban life in a particular historical time (amazingly recreated down to the most intimate details). It's many years since I had not seen people applauding at the end of a film, today it happened, and I was touched. BRAVO!, again."
ROMA,17 March 2019,3/10,"Many other reviewers have said what I'm about to say. While the technical aspects of the film were impressive, most people don't go to see a film for its sound and video editing. It's highly surprising this even made mention at the Oscars. Significant events of grief experienced by the main character definitely had merit but those moments total maybe 20 minutes at most of a 135 min film. In this case the very beginning of the film had an irritating whole lot of nothing scene which from the start leaves the viewer with a bad first impression and doesn't do much to prove otherwise as it goes along. I have seen many amazing international films, most of which are not Netflix ""originals"" like this one. As far as international films go - this is far down at the bottom of my list."
ROMA,26 September 2021,1/10,"This film is incredibly slow,
Fantastic for a Sunday afternoon with a hangover but don't invite people young you like to watch this film or they'll never Speak to you again."
ROMA,11 January 2019,9/10,"It's fitting that Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is available to stream on Netflix - into the living rooms and bedrooms of its viewers, where the exactness of its depictions can allow quiet introspection in the setting of home. It's personal, but as epic as any film of war, or revolution. Roma enlightens me that we are all a cacophony of struggle, laughs, cries behind our closed doors. Whether it's breakfast, the laundry, a car coming home, dog poop - the everyday against the backdrop of an ever evolving world is what Cuaron remembers for us in his film - no meaning needs to be gleaned, no narrative constructed, just to see, smell, feel, touch - is enough."
ROMA,13 December 2018,10/10,"Ignore the hype. Ignore the awards. Hell, ignore this review--just sit back and experience this film for yourself.Simply put, Roma is among the richest examples of what cinema can offer.Over the brief 134-minute runtime, we grow into a family in a patient and natural way as we live and breathe their day-to-day lives in 1970s Mexico City. The film is essentially a sequence of episodes, big or small in its impact on a family, affecting characters in different ways, and told primarily through the perspective of the housemaid, Cleo (Yalitzo Aparicio). We experience hardships, love, anger, tragedy, bliss, and even the smallest of human emotions, such as childhood naïveté. And like children, we once again embrace the details of life, from collecting hail from the ground by hand as it falls from the sky to sharing a hug as last night's rain can be heard still trickling down the gutters.Written, directed, produced, filmed, and edited by Alfonso Cuarón, this is as much a personal work as it is a testament to an artist's vision and talent. It is a historically-grounded film that comes alive with Tati-esque significance reaching every corner of the frame, with camerawork so intentional that it fills our hearts with a mother's pain, an Ozu-like story that ranges from lighthearted to cathartic, and a brilliant pattern of recurring, cyclic, familiarizing setting elements that appreciates and brings into light the reality of everyday life.Perhaps one of Roma's strongest thematic undercurrents is the perseverance of women within the societal stronghold of men. With its unapologetic display of evil deeds at the expense of women going criminally unnoticed every day, Roma is, in a way, a love letter to say that Cuarón did not forget the multifaceted strength of the women in his life (it is dedicated to his nanny and, like Fellini's Roma, was inspired by his own childhood).The film's end felt like awaking from a dream. As the lights turned on, I looked around the theater, as if we have all just transported back to our own lives. Cuarón has accomplished something extraordinary here. While much of Roma comes from the memories of childhood, it is also a film that will bring each one of us back to what movies are about. And that is the greatest mark of an exceptional film.Greatest Movies of 2018 - #130 Greatest Films of All TimeDFF41 Closing Film"
ROMA,22 December 2018,6/10,"I simply loved Children of Men, which surely wasn't a fast paced movie, but this one is so painfully slow that i have to skip about half of the movie, reading the plot on Wikipedia. Don't take me wrong: i can understand why it is considered a masterpiece and i got the reasons behind the movie, but definitely it didn't take my attention in any way."
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"This will be for many people a type of black and white film they have never experienced. Shot with all the modern digital tools but evoking the neo realists after WWII, this film is like a sheet of transparency held up to the sun: like a memory being intravenously shot into your cortex.
Cuaron has been very open in stating this is essentially an autobiographical snapshot of his childhood growing up in Colonial Roma, a neighbourhood in Mexico City but it is also a clear nod to Fellini's Roma and the other neo realists especially Bunuel. Though Curaon's memories, the film is about Cleo, played by Yalitza Aparicio,
the maid to the middle class family he grew up in.
The film thematically matches very well with 2018. No matter your colour, class, nationality - men are assholes and it is left up to the women to band together and weather life.
My issue was that Cleo seems underdeveloped for the main character of a film, passive both in the film and life, which I assume is a result of this being Cuaron's story in many ways and not hers. This is shown in the way Cuaron shoots - nary a closeup but wide frame, camera panning or sliding more typical of a documentary. This all keeps the viewer at a distance.
Cuaron has made a masterpiece but it is called Children of Men."
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,"First, I think Alfonso Cuaron is a good director. But this is one of those films that tries to impress you with how boring it is. Even my Mexican wife, who loves any film, actor, character, or TV show having to do with Mexico, was bored to tears by this.It's textbook pretentious filmmaking. Nothing to grip you. Nothing to keep you interested. No mystery. No wonder. No real characters. No real tension.It looks no better than a higher budget film school experiment.No one will remember this film in five years. It will not be talked about. It will not be seen. It will become one of the many, many forgotten films that some pretentious director suckered a bunch of pretentious people into thinking they liked because it's slow and boring...but that's artsy, I guess."
ROMA,10 February 2019,1/10,There was no story coupled with far too much Male nudity.
ROMA,14 December 2018,7/10,"In the world of ratings and marks I give this film a solid 7. Not more. Why?Because it's not a film I want to see again. As simple as that.To analyze a bit: The film does have great photography and as others have commented , it's in general great as far as technique. The strongest part of Roma is undoubtedly its -OCD level- of accuracy of 1970 Mexico city. There are little details that the director chose to include so as to pass as 1970 even for those sneaky observers who want to find a blunder, an error "" hey he missed that , or that car model wasn't made then etc.."" I don't think they'll find something not 1970 in it.Also I haven't seen a better earthquake captured in film making. That felt as legit as it gets. The riots where amazingly realistic as well. And so on and so forth..So yes I give this film 10/10 for its depiction of 1970 Mexico city and its level of reality. You are transported to 1970 Mexico city to put it simply. Which is an achievement. There were hard scenes to shoot. But a viewer doesn't care about such technicalities. A viewer wants a good film. Which is a subjective thing I know but still who'll say "" The Terminator "" or "" The Fisher king"" aren't great films? So there is a level of objectivity , things that should be there for us in a film to make it great.I want warmth , or entertainment or some kind of magic thing that makes a film work for me and makes me want to watch it every year or so. This film isn't one of those.After returning from the cinema I looked up the trivia and learned how Roma is a neighborhood in Mexico city ( I didn't even know that , I was asking myself why is it called Roma but who needs background info to enjoy a film?) and how it involves the memories of director Alfonso Cuaron from his childhood. This is very admirable and astonishing what he's done , it really is. But again , it doesn't mean I ll like the film because it's the director's childhood. A flawed film that comes to my mind is ""Boyhood"" , that does another thing altogether but I think that the reasons one person may like the one film are very similar to the reasons people liked Roma (Boyhood was shot in a span over the years as a kid really grew up , and Roma was shot of scenes really out of Cuaron's childhood being the loose comparison ) . I think that those who sincerely loved this film either hold on to the idea that its the director's childhood what they re seeing , so I guess it gets a plus because of it , or they are Mexicans who grew up in that era , or they are children of such people and know how real and true the scenes included are.But for a viewer who goes to watch Roma , with no prior knowledge whatsoever , a viewer who doesn't know why it's called Roma , or even such basics as who the director is, then I think such a person may indeed appreciate its realistic tones , its great detail and meticulous inputs on every scene , and even the great craftsmanship of the director ( whoever he may be). But the film isn't a grabber. It's not one that the clueless viewer will say "" wow this goes on my favorites films.While watching the film- midway through or later- when I knew that it doesn't do it for me that it's ok , I can watch it , its good and all but it doesn't have the magic for me, I tried to think of black&white films that did do the magic for me. Films like ""Paper Moon"" , ""Dolce Vita"" , Demy's ""Lola"" , or the great ""Rocco and his Brothers"" or even the one that should come to mind first , Pasolini's ""Mama Roma"" , and if I have to be mean ( and fair ) , Cuaron's Roma is inferior to those films not technique-wise , but as a film as a whole.
Not bad but not great for me."
ROMA,17 March 2019,3/10,"I can't belive that this movie got an Oscar. They only thi g good is the look of the movie but no story. Halfway trough the movie my wife and I where asking ourselves, what was the point of the movie. We couldn't come up with an answer."
ROMA,24 February 2019,1/10,"I don't get the appeal of this film. It is slow moving and boring. The black and white cinematography is good, but that's about it. Some great closeups of the tile floor she is mopping, if that's your thing."
ROMA,28 January 2019,8/10,"Roma was one of the most beautiful films of 2018. The cinematography was stunning, with many great camera movements and long takes. The monochromatic palate of the film perfectly matched its tone. Not only were the visuals beautiful, but the story and characters were as well. The story is told through the eyes of a housemaid, Cleo, who with the family she cares for, goes through a great deal of pain and suffering that depicts the real social and biological pressures women deal with. This translates into a story that feels genuinely real. The emotions felt by the characters felt real. This realism reels you in as you get lost in the story. Cuarón proves again that he can write and direct a film with such precision and emotion behind it."
ROMA,17 October 2019,10/10,"At last an Oscar winner that truly deserves to win. A beautiful, human film. Understated but powerful. To those who say nothing happens in it, perhaps you were expecting car chases and explosions, but the drama shown here is more compelling than anything I've seen for many years. A brilliant work of art."
ROMA,24 February 2019,9/10,"Hardly twice or thrice in a year you watch a movie and can say movies are life. They don't know anything about movies who says movies are fake. Alfanso Cuaron's Roma is an art made in the perspective of an almost ignored unhappy life. This drama is deep and neat. Tales within tales made Roma a one of the best art of recent times.The story is about a mexican maid named Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) works in a family with four children, their parents and grandma. She has a helpmate too. The film is about a year in the life of this maid. Set in 1970s this movie is edited black and white just to make you feel different or nostalgic or maybe to feel for them. I can't say the specific reason. Roma connect with your soul slowly. The moments like that guy singing in the burning forest, or at the end when Cleo went to save two children in the sea even she didn't know how to swim or that standing in one leg with the eyes closed make situations that you have to discover something about one specific life.10 academy award nominated this movie is about love, life and emotions. This is artistic, honest and beyond imagination which is to experience only. Alfanso Cuaron's superb direction made this more delightful to watch. This is even maybe one of the best film direction I've ever seen. Awesome cinematography is a resource of this film. There are no background score in this movie but the sound design is awesome.The special thing about Roma is one need experience of movies to watch it. You just can't go watch Roma if you are not a normal movie person."
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"I expected so much about Roma, and I got the unexpexted: Simplicity! The film is a visual and emotional immersion to the simple Life of that family, with their maid. Roma simply captivates, the story told is that kind of story that can happen in real life, in a real family ... It shows humanity and reality! Yes it is not like those extraordinary stories who won Oscars (The Shape of Water, Birdman, Three Billboards ...) It's simple but Magic, it will make you fall in love with ... love, life and make you conscious to share love to everyone around you. Technically, Roma is just ""Perfect"", beautifully shot and edited. Thank God we have Cuarón in our lives to make those beautiful movies."
ROMA,17 February 2019,10/10,"The oscars are coming up, and there were a lot of controversial nominations that were announced. Black Panther, A Star is Born, and Bohemian Rhapsody got nominated for a bunch of oscars, including Best Picture, and a lot of people (including me) were scratching our heads on why those movies got so much recognition. A lot of people think First Man got snubbed. I didn't watch the movie, but I can somewhat agree on it because of all the praise it got. I am pissed off about how Hereditary, one of favorite movies of 2018, didn't get a single nomination. Maybe because it's an artsy movie, and everyone knows how the oscars hate those. But I do agree with the academy on one thing, which is giving Roma a bunch of nominations, and that is the movie I will be reviewing today.Karsten Runquist said that Roma is his favorite movie of 2018, and of course I had to check it out. It was on Netflix, so I watched it one night, and I was blown away. There are too many great things about the movie. To be completely honest, I don't see a flaw in it at all.Alfonso Cuaron directed this movie, and he is a director known to immerse the viewer into the movie using his cinematography. That goes for all of his movies except Gravity, because that movie is stupid. This movie is immersive not just for the fantastic cinematography, but for the interesting story that is being presented as well. Every sound in the movie makes me feel like I'm there with the characters, and I can feel what the characters are feeling as well.The acting in this movie is so damn good. Yalitza Aparicio is the lead actress in this movie, and this is her first acting role ever. It blows my mind how good she does on her first role. She got nominated for Best Actress at the academy, and I really hope she wins. All the other actors in this movie also give great performances, and I hope these new actors will have a good career ahead of them.This film was shot in black and white, and it really gives a old school feel to the movie. Some shots are really contrasted and vibrant, and it gives a shiny look even though this movie is in black and white. The plot is like a rollercoaster. There are so many ups and downs, and it gave me a variety of emotions throughout the film. When the movie ended, I thought to myself, ""I wish it was longer."" When I want a movie to be longer than it is, I know that I like it very much. This movie is a masterpiece, no doubt about it, and I hope it wins Best Picture. 10/10"

ROMA,7 February 2019,1/10,"Absolutely zero plot and wholly unlikable/uninteresting characters. The main character had no spine, and clearly, no drive to succeed. Also, possibly the most boring movie I have ever seen. Not sure how it's up for a Best Picture Oscar, as it wouldn't be in my top 30 of this year."
ROMA,4 March 2020,10/10,Not sure what else to say. Still trying to process what I've seen. I found myself wanting to live in the world created by the Movie Roma. And I was sad when the movie ended.
ROMA,7 January 2019,7/10,"I was originally going to give this film a 5/10, but then bumped it up another couple of points for NOT being a ""Hollywood Blockbuster"". So it made me appreciate the absence of fast cutting and bombastic score (this film has no score) and that American penchant for ""punching up a scene"".But the main character was a little bit one-dimensional, hitting many of those stereotypical points of being the stoic, altruistic, humble, noble servant.Also, there's this one scene with a bunch of party-goers spontaneously trying to put out a fire in the woods, and somehow a bunch of buckets materialized. That whole section should have been edited out... it had zero to do with the story, and there were no ramifications of this fire, and the whole thing stuck out like a sore thumb, which I have right now by the way, so I should know."
ROMA,12 February 2019,5/10,"#Roma 6/10 in a nut shell this is one of those wanky films knobby critics wet themselves over. It's beautifully filmed but not for me not on a par with other films up for awards eg a star is born, green book even black panther."
ROMA,10 January 2019,4/10,"Seriously? People thought this was a great movie? What did I sleep through...
Does anyone think that maids in Mexico have a fun life? Was this eye opening for some? This movie hardly had a pulse. It was as slow as pouring molasses. It would have been just as dreary if it were in colour but I suppose black and white was befitting of this drab movie. Yes I felt sorry for the maid who's life is nothing but work. At least she had the love of the family she was working for. How many maids do absolutely everything for a family and they are not shown any love or compassion in return? The world is not a level playing field. Either you're born into a family where you can grow and accomplish as much as you want or you are born into poverty with no hope for education to give you a better life."
ROMA,29 December 2019,10/10,"I'm forever going to be bitter that this didn't win best picture, because this is one of the most beautifully shot and lovingly made films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's easily the best movie of 2018."
ROMA,19 December 2018,7/10,"This is a good film, a very good film. The obvious strength is it's visual beauty and authenticity. Cuarón has an eye for magnificent shots that other filmmakers could only dream of, and the black and white only accentuates it further. He didn't need color for the visual storytelling. All the acting seemed genuine, like this was simply a documentary following these people around and I was definitely impressed by that. I understand the unbelievable praise this film is getting by fan and critic alike, but I can't help but think the beauty in the cinematography and the acting is making up for the simplified plot and predictable story. Cuarón and Aparicio deserve endless praise, but I just can't put this in the upper echelon of films I've seen this year."

A few good scenes, maybe... but a maid who cannot scoop dog poop? ... or reach for a condom... this does not a masterpiece make. Icky premise, men are pure evil, women are victims, life is tolerable sometimes? Nothing to see here..."
ROMA,2 January 2019,10/10,Really got sucked into this and actually forgot I was watching a film. Amazing camerawork that made the whole experience totally absorbing.
ROMA,22 November 2019,10/10,"A Foreign language film (Spanish), shot in black n white, with no star studded cast, presented in netflix --- that doesn't sound appealing but alfonso cuaron's creation will hook you from the opening shot. The movie is an emotional roller coaster ride, with stunning performances and masterful cinematography, all of these elements makes roma - a flawless , near perfect masterpiece which wraps up socio-political construct of a society. The movie in it's purest form is a deconstruction of our society."
ROMA,27 January 2019,7/10,"I acknowledge that my high expectations over this movie perhaps ruined the experience for me.In my opinion, Roma has a breathtaking cinematography, and that's about it. I gave it a 7 basically because of it and because of the decent cast, but if it only depended on plot wise, it'd be a mere 6 or perhaps 5.It's obvious that Cuarón is a master when it comes to cinematography and capturing beautiful scenes in new, fresh ways that surprise us. His long, distance shots pay homage to the classic Italian movies - the scene where Fermín is practicing martial arts among a big group reminded me of La Dolce Vita and other Fellini movies, and that was breathtaking and beautiful to watch.I also think Cuarón wisely chose the black and white color to make the movie look less mundane and more spiritual, in order to enhance the content of the story. But, unfortunately, plot is not that amazing.I understand that the whole story is about Cleo and her struggles, but if it was supposed to be this way, I was expecting more focus on Cleo and on her internal turmoil. That's not what happens. Cuarón was so obsessed with showing a normal family life in 70s Mexico that he was too distant from Cleo to make us know her well. The character, yet good written in its subtlety, makes me wish I knew more about her, but unfortunately she barely speaks in the movie and there is little to none character development. Unfortunately, this is a beautifully made movie in which the plot falls flat, making the whole work lose substance in the end."
ROMA,17 December 2018,10/10,"Roma motivated me to journal my life again. We live life within a narrow minded existence without appreciation of the many wonderful things going on around us. Actual life is fill with cultural diversity, historical moments, and opportunities to care for others. Roma eloquently portrayed this with Cuaron's life as the backdrop and the common tread of life's traumas which can be only be subdued with love, forgiveness, and unity. I loved this movie because it presented ""life"" with incredible cinematography. It engages one to the point of experiencing tears of anger and of joy. My hope is that many will experience the same feelings and will be encouraged to write their own life story. Viva Roma!"
ROMA,16 February 2019,10/10,"This movie is very artistic. I read a review that says that you can take any screenshot of that movie and hang it on the wall, and thats is absolutely right. The set design in every shot and the camera moves are perfect. Cleo's eyes are the most important element in the movie. Everything happening domestically and nationally in this movie is commented on by Cleo's eyes only, you feel its effect on her without a word being said. Perfection"
ROMA,11 January 2019,5/10,"There is no question that Roma is a beautifully filmed work of art. Every scene is beautifully photographed. But otherwise it is a film that only a critic can love. It is excruciatingly slow -- something critics just love to characterize as lovingly casual (and I've got no problem with slow films as long as there's a good payoff in the end). There is very little in the way of plot -- something that critics just love to characterize as atmospheric or free-form.Sadly, it's hard to care about any of the characters as the movie meanders along.But it is beautifully filmed. On a scale of 1 to 10, the cinematography is a 12. And while the film is technically well done, it lacks any soul, anything to really move the viewer. I'd venture that about 30 minutes are actually interesting or gripping. I would very much discourage anybody from seeing this opus unless they really love great cinematrography and technical expertise."
ROMA,24 February 2019,6/10,"This movie is over rated
boring boring movie
6/10 being generous"
ROMA,18 March 2020,7/10,The cinematography is very impressive and all but I'm just not blown away. One more proof that critics and I don't usually go along.
ROMA,27 December 2018,10/10,"I have waited to watch it until I could give it my full attention and it did not disappoint.This is Alfonso Cuarón's follow up to Gravity (i can't believe he hasn't made anything since then). You can tell it's a very personal movie from him, I really love that it is shot in black & white, I think it fits the themes of this movie very well.set in the 1970's in Mexico City with the city's political war as a backdrop. It's not the easiest watch, it's a long film, slowly revealing what is happening within this family, and this young maid that finds herself in an unfortunate predicament.For this being Yalitza Aparicio's first time acting, I thought she did a phenomenal job. You really felt for her, what she was going through, and you see how just important she is to this family dynamic. From the mom to the grandma to each kid, they all have a unique personality of their own, and the character moments that Cuarón chooses to show is what really makes you connect with these characters - like how the youngest kid in the movie keeps trying to tell his family that he remembers this past life that he had.It is beautifully shot and since Cuarón grew up in Mexico City, he knew exactly the story and the look he wanted to tell.just like with most movies this year, it's not for everyone, critics will love it and anyone that appreciates a slow build in movies. just give this one a chance, let it wash over you and soak in all it has to offer."
ROMA,21 April 2021,7/10,"This isn't a bad movie but neither great either .Does not really worth the title of best movie of the year. It's rather a movie about nothing especially, just an year in the life of a middle class family in Mexico. A few days ago I was thinking I haven't seen a movie set in Mexico that wasn't about drugs or immigrants. This is a movie that's about something else. It's pace is slow, at some point I was really expecting something tragic to happen. But this is not the typical Hollywood movie so the plot had its peaks but not really something intense. It's an OK movie about the life of little boy Alfonso Cuaron."
ROMA,3 March 2019,2/10,"Filming dog excrement, or dog excrement on film? Those of you with Netflix, why not teach them a lesson--and please think twice about squandering two hours to watch this garbage. It would have merited one-star, but the cinematography caused me to double its rating. Films do not have to be commercially successful to be nominated, but it's nice when word-of-mouth drives theater sales. Here, there is no word-of-mouth necessary to view something in your homes."
ROMA,26 October 2019,8/10,"Finally got to watch this movie and it didn't disappoint. Fantastic Cinematography, script, and acting. Characters were believable and the story is great. The pacing was a little slow but overall pretty good. I like to see authentic Hispanic stories from Hispanic directors especially stories as beautiful as this one. Hopefully they'll have more opportunities to be able to tell their stories, especially in today's political climate that's tried to tell us that Hispanic people are not important. Overall, I'll give it an 8.5/10."
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"The way this movie made me feel is almost indescribable. Never had a movie made me feel like I was actually there like ""Roma"" did. The biggest thing that stuck with me was the scene at the end of the movie on the beach. Cleo fighting to go out against the waves was the perfect way to represent how she has felt during the entire movie. Yalitza Aparicio beautifully portrays a character who is a fighter. Through all of the hardships Cleo endures throughout the film, she continues on. The cinematography is marvelous, as is the story progression. The acting is just great from every character. This movie is so, so real that you forget that a genius actually wrote all of this on a script to be made into a movie. Do yourself a favor and find 2 hours and 14 minutes to watch this amazing film."
ROMA,29 December 2018,4/10,"This movie was boring and absolutely unintresting for me, if you wanna waste couple of yours, this movie is for you"
ROMA,19 January 2019,8/10,"Alfonso Cuaron has made a name for himself as a stellar director but his passion project, 2018's Roma, is an impressive feat even for this Oscar-winning heavyweight, who not only directs here, but writes, shoots and edits as well. Roma is an ode to Cuaron's childhood in Mexico City, told through the eyes of a young housekeeper, Cleo (newcomer Yalitza Aparicio), whose life we see unfold against the backdrop of political turbulence.
Roma is a definite exercise in artistry; this film is absolutely gorgeous, shot in vintage black and white (a pretentious yet oddly fitting decision), full of wide and detailed shots that immerse us within the world. As well as beauty, there's a phenomenal sense of authenticity to the film, whether it be in languid scenes that play out in real time or in the film's intricate sound design, which favours the ambience of street noises over a stringed orchestra.
The technical mastery of Roma, however, acts as both its greatest achievement and its pitfall. The film's design somewhat overshadows its plot, hiding a flawed picture beneath its glossy exterior. Much of this movie, in particular the middle, is rather mundane, struggling to reach the high emotional stakes one expects. The narrative rambles and there are numerous points where the film feels restrained by its luscious presentation. The factor that prevents Roma from becoming simply a parade of pretentiousness is the clearly deep personal reasons behind which it has been made; though the film is not always consistent, Alfonso Cuaron is an attentive director and his intelligent and gentle screenplay is one of the film's greatest strengths. In all truth, when Roma hits gold, it's a subtle, yet deeply moving film; scenes in the third act particularly are very well done, serving that desired emotional resonance that the rest of the film desperately fails to deliver.
Yalitza Aparicio gives a wonderfully natural performance as Cleo, but the real stand out performer of the film is Marina de Tavira as Sofia, the mother of the family. De Tavira produces the only performance that truly gripped me, never allowing herself to be overshadowed by the virtuous design of the film. Equally satisfying is Cuaron's clever inclusion of political context that provides for the most pleasing dramatic moments.
Roma is likely to find great success in the awards season this year; credit should be given to the sheer flair of the film's design and Cuaron's astute writing and cinematography. However, beneath the art of Roma lies a lesser film, that only sporadically hits its targets of emotion and excitement."
ROMA,11 December 2018,5/10,"There's no question that Cuaron's brilliance as a film director is on full display in this amazing film--almost every take is flat-out gorgeous, and some are jaw-droppingly stunning. He uses symbolism masterfully: subtly, almost unobtrusively, yet effective in its intended impact. My complaint is an essential one: where's the story? We know almost nothing about the primary character, Cleo the nanny. We don't know anything of her family or her background, and practically nothing about her dreams, goals or aspirations. Yes, she's presented sympathetically, and we care about her to an extent, but she seems little changed through the course of the film, even after going through some challenging experiences. The upper-class family she works for also has their challenges, but nothing terribly unusual. Profound peripheral events (a forest fire, a street riot, a martial arts display) are riveting in their presentation, but they're only momentary digressions--they appear to have no lasting impact on the main characters. This was a beautiful film to watch (I wasn't bored in the slightest) yet when it was all over I wanted more than just memorable images."
ROMA,27 December 2018,7/10,"Alfonso Cuaron has been one of the most impressive visual directors of the past 20 years, in which there is a lot of detail going on in the background, so it's no surprise that he assembles some very stunningly done scenes in ""Roma"". Very mundane endless scenes suddenly become filled with much action in the background, with coordinated movements of extras that invoke the great epic cinema of past decades. There are probably 5 or 6 of these moments in ""Roma"", which make it applause-worthy. It gets bonus points from me for more realistically depicting Mexico, unlike the Mariachi, narcos, and 'fresa' spoiled drama queens typically seen in Mexican cinema and TV. It even shows non-white Mexicans and depicts more than one language. Unfortunately, there are many scenes that lead to very little or should have required much more editing, as Cuaron creates homages not only to his childhood, but also to Bergman, Fellini, Buñuel, and the New Wave, with great skill but mixed cinematic products. Well crafted haunting and satiric images are intertwined with never-ending images so dull that make you wonder why you are not staring outside your window instead of the screen.The screenplay is another issue. The story is far too underdeveloped to sustain interest. At it's best,""Roma"" touches on themes of women being abandoned by men to manage families on their own, the mixed relationships of a family with its servants, class divisions, and the dangers to which children were exposed more easily in another era. At it's worst, ""Roma"" mixes in every single cliche of Latin American art cinema, essentially: ""let's analyze Latin society by showing scenes in the life of a family through the eyes of the [maid/children]."" Maybe this was groundbreaking in the Spanish ""Veneno Para Hadas"", but for the longest time, it's been every other movie in Latin American cinema, which are mostly plotless, slow, dull affairs by misguided self-proclaimed disciples of Goddard. I'm thus disappointed, as Cuaron is part of the movement to make Latin cinema more dynamic and interesting. Given this movie's accolades, I fully expect more of this same sub-type dull Latin art cinema for the next decade."
ROMA,28 February 2019,9/10,"If you're coming solely for a plot, you might be disappointed. The travails of Cleo and her employer could get mundane, but the cinematography (coupled with black and white) can remind one of a Kubrick or Fellini at times. Yalitza Aparicio is incredible, given that this is her first gig. The stillbirth scene is minimalist yet gut-wrenching. The attention to history is also fascinating, and led me to research more after the movie.There is some camp, as wrestler Latin Lover portrays a semi-mythical Mexican hero who trains the Halciones.You may have heard that the plot is dry, but this film is best enjoyed as the tremendous cinematic experience it is. Green Book was good, but THIS was truly the best picture!"
ROMA,23 February 2019,1/10,No masterpiece needs a campaign that costs 30 million to win best picture....
ROMA,12 December 2018,10/10,"I watched 'Roma' at the cinema a few days before its Netflix release and it was the best idea ever! As a Mexican, I was naturally curious to watch the film everyone has been talking about. I have always admired Alfonso Cuaron's work, particularly films such as 'The Little Princess' and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien'. However, it wasn't until the 2010s when he consummated his career after the 'Children of Men' and 'Gravity'. It is evident that he has made an impact in recent years and I truly believe he is one of the most talented filmmakers today.'Roma' is powerful in the whole extent of the word. It is not only different and captivating, but also very artistic and honest. It is a filming exercise that reminds us that style, narrative and emotion can be best achieved when excelling traditional cinematic language. The simplicity of this film was captured beautifully with highly skilled cinematography, which Cuaron developed himself. Every frame was methodically crafted in the form of a black and white portrait that perfectly reflects the nostalgia of a 1970s Mexico.I am extremely amazed by Yalitza Aparicio, an Indigenous Mexican young actress, taking the lead in this film. Her performance is of such greatness that she carries the whole film by herself in an exceptional manner. She is absolutely natural, brave and unique. I do believe that she deserves an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and hope she gets it.The reason why this film has to be seen on the big screen is to fully appreciate the extent of Cuaron's cinematographic work. Moreover, sound mixing, production design and editing are also best experienced in cinemas. Obviously, this film needs to be rewatched on Netflix at home.Without exaggerating, I believe this film will make history. I do not think Cuaron implements any new techniques or breaks any schemes. Nevertheless, he brings back the organic cinematic expression and therefore, 'Roma' will be remembered for long. 'Roma' is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. It's the intimate work of an extraordinary filmmaker, and it's worth recognising this masterpiece as a genuine example of 'the seventh art'.Score: 10/10FJ Medina"
ROMA,31 January 2019,1/10,"Right out of the gate Roma is an ""artistic"" movie - the overly long opening shot of water on paving stones (with airplanes reflected in the puddles) goes on waaaay too long. This set the tone for the whole movie.
It was shot in black and white (oversaturated) to be artsy, not because it added anything to the story. There were many added elements that were there as a self-indulgent artistic touch, but they fail to make up for NO plot and only marginal character development.
A movie should tell a story, this one doesn't . I can see why people would like it, especially people who think of themselves as deep. But in the absence of a plot then we need STRONG characters - once again it's a miss. The main actress literally has the same stunned look on her face from start to finish, it's obvious she has no experience. The supporting actors are a little better but not by much.
I had such high expectations and was extremely disappointed, give it a miss."
ROMA,21 December 2018,10/10,"Was I ready for this masterpiece, I think not. Quite possibly the film of the year, Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a beautiful, heartbreaking and gorgeously vivid film.This film has multiple strengths, first I must comment that Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo was absolutely stunning. I cannot believe that this is her first acting experience, her performance was visceral, layered, complicated and a class act. Truly an emotional role, and one I will not forget easily. The rest of the cast is also of the upmost quality, everyone has brought their 'A' game to this table. In particular I thought the mother, portrayed by Marina de Tavira was excellent. As well as the rest of the supporting cast, the children who never felt forced nor silly, the grandmother who was cold for most of the film but came rivetingly alive in moments of great tension and emotional weight.This film's narrative was truly incredible. The final half an hour is possibly the most impactful, masterful and cinematically incredible of any film I have seen this year. The whole third act from when the riots start, to the the end, is truly a masterpiece. It made me cry a great deal, which is exceedingly rare for a film to evoke that much emotion from me. Everything just added up, the depth of characterisation in the first two acts just gave the strongest release, of pain and eventually happiness and love. It was truly the work of a director in his prime, in his most effective. Certain words were inflected to deliver even more depth, (I can speak Spanish) and it just added more character, the names had extra suffixes, and more could be conveyed. This made what was shown, even more emotional, truly incredible use of language, something that couldn't have been achieved if it were in English.There was moments, even entire sections of this film where it transcended everything. Beyond language, beyond the frame, beyond its colours, beyond race, beyond its depth and emotion, beyond the narrative itself, it became something so pure, so encompassing, so real. It became something else, something words cannot describe. It is the purest and most beautiful form of cinema. This film is why movies exist, it is the benchmark upon all else should be compared.Alfonso Cuarón has given us a masterpiece, that we should all be thankful to be in the same world as. His direction, is simply beyond anything I have seen this year. It feels incredibly personal, his vision is pure and goes beyond simply a great film, this is pure humanity. he has written, directed, produced, edited and was the cinematographer for this film. In all those departments, he is a master. His work with the camera is like a legend's final cry, yet he is not an aged man, its like a lifetimes work crashing in two hours, its exquisite. The slow pans across all landscapes gives a detached, and yet so intrusive feeling. As if the camera is just watching these people, similar to Manchester By The Sea, but better here. The decision to grade this film into black and white, helps it to engross its audience, it truly is of aid to this film. In addition to delivering a timeless feel, one is not distracted by colour or if it looks real, it just is. Its so pure, it immerses the viewer more deeply.The editing is masterful, perhaps the years best, the tone is sustained, heightened and is some of the strongest work in this I have possibly ever seen. His screenplay, as I have said before, is just incredible. One just has to see it, my words do it little justice. Cuarón direction is so strong, his mastery of performances helps to carry this film into its astonishing heights. His control, this vision is untainted, unrestrained, an achievement to behold, to wait for, something that only comes in fleeting years. One that will go down in history.The film feels timeless, the setting is the 1970's, but it does not feel aged, or like its highlighting that. The set design and costume design are worthy of the upmost honours and awards, they set the atmosphere, give depth and love, and give coldness and fear too. They work so well subliminally, it feels real, tangible, like one could touch it. It gives no distraction, nor does it call for attention, it all compliments the rest of the feature perfectly.Although, I must state that I felt that in one place the film lost a bit of its pace. Many scenes play out very slowly to maximum effect, which I dare not specifically mention as to not spoil them. But some others feel a little too drawn out, particularly in the middle of the second act. And that's it, my only complaint about the filmmaking. Also, while this is no fault of the film, on Netflix the english subtitle's were not always perfect, they sometimes dodged the meaning of certain scenes a little, but luckily I understanding the language had no problem. Just, for people who don't speak Spanish, beware of slight mistranslations, but of course, this is no problem with the film as a film, only the service used.In the end, my complaint is that not enough people are seeing this motion picture. This is just the near perfect film, noting else this year comes close to its emotion, its masterful characteriation and consistent strength of performances. The sum of its part is a future classic, a film by which this decade may be defined by, in its art, its love, its overwhelming emotion, its perfect cinematography, its masterful score, its beautiful direction, its wondrous performances, and finally its perfect narrative and screenplay.It has taken me two days to write this review, much debate to wether a 9 or 10 is deserved. For I reserve a 10 for films that truly go beyond, not just in filmmaking but emotion, and how it personally impacts me. I am incredibly restrained in my ratings, and do not give out high numbers with ease, but here... here I feel it just about makes it. This film is near perfect, and it may just by the film of year, and the decade. 10/10"
ROMA,1 April 2019,9/10,"The story is set in the turbulent early '70s, a time of social change,student protests, Woodstock, Watergate, ""Deep Throat,"" Viet Nam, and Plato's Retreat. At one extreme were the selfishness and sexual experimentation of a pre-HIV, pre-Apple computer group of self-indulgent flower children and child-adults who appropriated the term ""swinger"" from popular music and jazz and applied it to ""free love"" in the Age of Aquarius. At the other extreme were those who suffered from the worship of youth and the thoughtless behavior of self-possessed males whose fixation on penis size stymied growth in self-understanding and empathy.Yet at such times cinema can serve as a ""criticism of life,"" helping expose the root causes of social unrest and spiritual stagnation. At the time depicted by ""Roma,"" many thoughtful, serious types were looking to the redemptive visions in the work of socially-conscious film ""artists"" such as Fellini and Bergman, André Bazin, Jean Renoir and Robert Bresson while European directors also looked to Hollywood directors like Wyler and cinematrapher Toland for the best techniques to ""show the world as it is,"" as opposed to some fantastical escapist version of reality.""Roma"" is a love-letter to such visionary film artists of the past as well as to the public that revered their films. Even before any story is under way, director Caron allows us to see for ourselves the characters at work and play, along with the outer circumstances that influence and reveal the characters inner selves and relationship with others. Rather than a cinematic ""construct"" that makes the film editor the most important producer and manipulator of what we see and feel, the first hour of the film ""preserves"" the continuity of space and time with carefully composed, steady and stately, camera work and deep focus that are antithetical to the intentionally shaky cameras and shock editing of modern filmmakers intent on exciting spectators and pleasing the sponsors who can fund their next project.The film loses its interest when it goes for some dramatic, even sensational, conflicts--the scene of a Dionysian party with the unfaithful husband, then of a widespread destructive fire, and shortly afterwards a violent demonstration that goes from the streets into a store, where the pregnant servant-maid and main character (Cleo), meets up with her faithless lover, who stays by her long enough to demonstrate his phallic power and pride but leaves when he impregnates her.Cleo is neither beautiful nor strong, but she's an ""over-achiever,"" whose empathy and creativity provoke her to ""play dead"" for the benefit of the children she's responsible for protecting and minding. And in the film's climax, she ignores her inability to swim and takes on the turbulent life-like ocean and its potentially lethal undertow by going into the waves--as deep and far as she's able--after giving birth to her own still-born child--to save the two children who have disobeyed their birth mother by not staying close to shore.It's an act that binds this little community--a grandmother, a mother of 3 children, and a heroic dark-skinned Mexican nanny--we feel their emotion and loving trust and, thanks to the composition of the shot, the strength of a new family bond. The director's composition shows the group on the beach and in the formation of a triangle, the most rigid, or strong, of all shapes (as geometrists and architect-housebuilders know well).The film uses moving objects--oversized American cars (Ford Galaxies)--to provoke the viewer to find life and meaning object soon seen as symbols--the car denoting excess, carelessness, male vanity and a sense of power. The film eschews a music score but compensates with images and sounds we trust far more than the contrived excitement of shaky cameras, jump cuts, and special effects. This is the kind of movie Bazin glimpsed in the work of Wyler and Welles, both indebted to the deep focus lens of cinematographer Greg Toland. The attention to a servant girl devoid of resources is close to the subtle characterization of Robert Bresson in ""Mouchette. And the focus on details exposing the dynamics of a family evokes Ozu's masterful ""Tokyo Story.""There's an important difference. The ending not only promises a loving household but allows the viewer to make sense of Cleo's ascent to the roof of the building via an outdoor ladder, or fire escape. There's a hint of danger as we look up at the mass of steel--a structure we see as more in line with Cleo's abilities to climb than anyone else's. And as Cleo disappears, leaving us with the structure and the sky, the sense of danger is mitigated by the hope we have in Cleo's ability to use a fire-escape not for its nominal purpose but to come closer to her dreams. Welles definied film as a ""ribbon of dreams,"" Fof Cleo that definition is contradicted by her experinece with boyfriend Fermin (a phonetic twin of ""Vermin"") in a movie theater. But it might be applied to the fire-escape--or to the viewer's experience of seeing Cleo through the lens of a camera we have learned to trust like that of the film auteurs of the last century."
ROMA,11 February 2019,6/10,"The cinematography in the movie is world class. That's where there traditional storytelling ends. There is no soundtrack, little music and little plot. There is a reason every successful movie has a protagonist with a goal and obstacles to overcome to achieve that goal - because it's interesting and has been the formula for centuries. This movie doesn't have it.It's stunning to look at but nothing Kubrick or Hitchcock haven't done. There would have been a full minute wasted trying to park a car in a narrow garage which was impeccably shot. Sums up this movie really. Stunning to look at, boring to watch. There is one heartbreaking scene which I won't spoil but even that didn't really impact the character. Did she change from beginning to end? Probably not. What did change? What did we learn?Overhyped. Reminds me of Boyhood in terms of a lack of story even though it's ripe for telling. The critics raved while moviegoers slept."
ROMA,18 December 2018,8/10,"What most people are saying is true -- this a heart-felt film, with gorgeous visuals (I honestly don't know how Cuaron got some of those long takes), innovative sound, top performances, drama, action, suspense and much more. Yes, the first hour is slow, but it pays off in the end, I swear. Ninety-five percent of people who like foreign language films at all will love it. BUT it is an Alfonso Cuaron film, which means it's sometimes on the sentimental side. If you've ever seen a film about a downtrodden maid, you could probably write the outline of this story yourself, including the climax, which is extremely well done, but also predictable. When the trip to the beach was discussed, I thought ""is he going to do that?"" And yes, he does. I think Cuaron intended some ironic commentary on that type of ending, but it's up to you to decide. There are also some significant plot threads left hanging, for example what happened to the mother who lost her land? Maybe it was cut out of the final film for time reasons, but I suspect more to preserve a fairly happy ending and keep the focus on the European family. Maybe that's a failure of courage, or art. I don't know. Regardless, this is a film worth seeing, and more than once, on the biggest screen you can find."
ROMA,19 December 2018,10/10,"Roma
Watched in theaters 12/15I woke up insanely hungover, that familiar ""I am never drinking again"" banner waved fiercely in my pounding head. Much like my mind, my phone was buzzing, Dana, my best and closest friend on this planet had text me a sobering proposition: ""Wanna go see Roma tonight?""I hadn't heard about Roma, I had zero idea what it was about, I just knew it was Alfonso Cuaron's newest film. But even if I had read a synopsis, I don't think it would have prepared me for the emotional toll this film took on me. I've sat with it for two days now and my feelings for it seem to get stronger.At first glance Roma's story hits you with the French New Wave vibe, oh we're going to be watching these people live, no real plot, etc. But as the film goes on I realized the ""slice of life,"" style the film presents itself as was actually much more involved and stimulating. A seemingly simple story becomes complicated, heart wrenching and captivating.
I really don't want to talk about the plot, you should just experience it. But be warned, it gets heavy and at times bleak and dark. But such is life, and Roma is teeming to the brim with it. And for as much heartache and pain the characters experience, there is also a contrasting beauty, an overwhelming sense of wonder blended with the natural hilarity of life. Roma wonderfully captures the peaks and valleys of about a year's time and compacts it into a 2 hour chunk, we're just along for the ride. The story and characters are handled with a deeply personal level of care and acute detail.Technically Roma, is astounding, and is composed with some of the most beautiful camera work I've ever seen. Many sequences left me wondering how Cuaron, who shot this himself, was able to choreograph and orchestrate such complex and breathtaking shots? I don't really have an eye for cinematography, but this film is so gorgeous and well composed it really stands as a marvel.Roma is such a complete taste of life, such a strong, confident film. It's story pulls you in close, and is unflinching it is depiction of loss and fear and love and joy. I feel truly lucky to have caught it in a limited theatrical run, because this film is made for the big screen. For the less fortunate, stream it on Netflix, now and be sure to send your ex a thank you text for their subscription."

ROMA,24 December 2018,5/10,"Alfonso Cuaron is surely one of our most gifted and also overrated living cinematic auteurs. He has made some pretty brilliant films full of insightfulness ... and also some pretty obnoxious films full of pretentiousness.What's the plot of Roma? Who cares - Alfonso Cuaron doesn't. It's just an excuse to design self-indulgent static slow-pans back and forth from some oscillating robotic omniscient point of view where people walk in and out of frame in either mundanity or hysterics. There's no intimacy with any of the characters psychology or what motivates their aims or aspirations. This is a piece completely detached from committing to an emotional point-of-view, and totally devoid of any moral conviction. Some see that as brave, but ""some"" are just spineless. It just sits - shinning in it's placid flaccid uselessness, as neither enlightening commentary or entertaining commerse. And that's not just a shame - it's a sin.Oh it's set in 1970's Mexico during some redundantly superfluous backdrop of political unrest. There's a young indigenous woman who is employed as house servant to a bourgeoisie couple - whose marriage is falling apart in front of their hoard of nondescript children with no particular autonomous volition to discern outside their proclivity to appear confused and cry. The husband is the kind of guy that values his car above his family. The maid has some turmoil over a pregnancy from a fair weather absentee father who supplements a devotion to cultish martial arts buffoonery instead of taking any semblance of moral responsibility. Prerequisite bar scene, hospital scene, and moving out scenes follow. Well, rough sketches of those type of scenes at least, as the camera never shows much compassion or interest. We climax with kids in supposed oceanic peril, and a group hug on the beach. Anyway, that's kinda the plot. there is no point. No music score. Some superficially nice enough camera compositions from Cuaron doing the cinematography himself - although none of the shots serve any particular storytelling purpose per say - in fact they're more of a disservice - save for possibly the genuinely captivating opener.This movie appears to have an R-Rating for the sole reason that Alfonso Cuaron wanted to have what must have been a 3 minute unbroken scene entirely shot wide in a brightly lit master within a motel/apartment, from where our protagonists maid (snuggled in bed sheets) observes her bare young hong-kong-phooey lover using a shower curtain rod to perform some absurd bo staff martial-art peacocking with his dingle dangling. Apparently it is vital we hold witness to this entire uncut (wink) display with full reference of the man's flapping phallus and the smooth hairless limbs and torso branching thereout, because obscuring the supple post-pubescent nubility of an ill-nuanced male youth by shadow, cropped framming, and/or underwear wouldn't be nearly ""artistic"" enough. Instead of this scene entrancing by the verisimilitude of his vérité, it rather distracts the mind to wonder of Mr. Cuaron's clandestine proclivities and motivations. There's no one to invest in or relate to in the film. But it must be a masterpiece, because it's in black and white and has untrained actors fluctuate between staring blankly and periodically putting their head in their hands in front of a dispassionate lens for long stretches where nothing happens.I'll give it 5/10 just because its opening shot reflecting a distant plane flying between building walls inside the swishing foyer floor mob water was a pretty clever establisher.A fruitless exercise in uninvested tedium. Don't believe the hype."

-Total absence of emotional depth. The writer made no effort toward an engage storyline.
-Flat characters. Everyone is like everyone else. Grey and shapeless.
-Lack of emotional arc. Why am I seeing this? Are there any redeeming features to this drivel? Why should I identify with any of the zombies in the film? Why are you torturing me for krissakes?This is vapid, self-indulgent eye-candy, totally devoid of life. And I'm being way, way too generous."
ROMA,5 February 2019,7/10,"This feature carries social and historical relevance through an emotional year in the life of Cleo, a servant in 1970's Mexico City. The cinematography is impressive and the story provokes empathy left and right. Though it isn't notably entertaining or uplifting, one should be able to appreciate how genuinely artistic the film is, and how well ""real life"" is captured. The director has earned deserved praise, especially considering the high volume of extras in many of the long takes (not to mention he also wrote and produced the film)."
ROMA,5 February 2020,1/10,"Most boring movie i've ever seen. I even remember when i could see movies with better quality on VHS, so it makes me very sad that a movie in 2018 could get this good reviews without having any good story, characters, picture quality, or even the realism which was spoken highly of. This movie had slow scenes with so many completely worthless scenes (""trying"" to be artistic). The sound and picture in the movie was incredibly dull, boring and sad, only giving you sad vibes eventhough you was looking at a family eating food happily. Probably the only reason easily influenced morons liked it.Why would seeing less color be more artistic? I believe i can come up with more than 1 million reasons why it's not and why only morons thinks art is best presented as simple as possible for example a plain circle with no colors, come to be a painting worth 800 000$.But i don't feel inclined to be a teacher of adults on IMDB. If you manage to see art in something just because it has less effects and less colour to it, that's because you're not able to use your brain very well. You can see the same things and more if you're at least somewhat creative. What you see as art, the director see as saving money and producing cheap crap for idiots to call art and beautiful."

At that moment, she was free and complete.As a maid, she does not have much right to speak. Many times, she just shuttles between different rooms and does day-to-day housework, which is tedious and boring. But that's all she has in her life, no complaints, no demands.The boyfriend abandoned her pregnant, but felt a small life grow in the belly, is it not the greatest comfort to her. However, even this tranquility has to be deprived of life, and the murderer is the child's father. In the store, facing the lovely wooden cradle, how happy she should be in her heart, waiting for the arrival of a little life. Outside the shop, where the gunshots sounded, the panicked crowd fled.

Fortunately, the owner's four children still need her care, and they are in trouble.She, who never knows how to swim, looked at the child struggling in the waves and ran towards the sea. When they hug each other on the beach, we know that she will survive. Because after her fatal loss, her quiet appearance still surging with a love instinct, a beauty that gives dedication. She is a woman, destined to be lonely, but due to her instinct motherhood, she is destined to be united by love, put together, and then move forward.The plane flew overhead again, it seemed that the director was expressing a dream and poetry that could never be reached. The reality is so heavy and helpless, but the little wings reflected in the water pool, the faint roar, like some kind of revelation from the heavens-you and me, bearing fate, can still yearn in a peaceful repetition life.In this black and white video poem, Alfonso Caron expressed his cognition of destiny, and at the same time conveyed a magical expression of surrealism. The singer who stood by the forest fire chanted, the boy who jumped into the open space, and the master who stood under the plane and said that he could take off. This is a kind of transparent and clear poetry, a kind of calmness of life.Perhaps no one can take off. But she can, because she accepted her destiny and suffered a cruel deprivation, she is still alive and still lovesThe body is heavy, but love Enron."
ROMA,21 December 2018,7/10,"This is a very good film, excellent sets and black & white cinematography, credible (but not really outstanding, in my opinion) acting.
But if you don't know the context (Mexico in the 1970s, from an upper, going on lower, middle class perspective on class relations, politics, etc.) it's really hard to rate it higher. What is happening? Why? You can guess a lot even if you don't know anything, which was my case before some research (and props to Cuaron on that) but it feels lacking in that regard.
There are marks of true cinematic genius: the car that is too big for a driveway full of dog waste; (had to change as per IMDB rules), the killing in the furniture store, the training of the ""elite squad"", the ice cream scene where Cleo is left standing, to name just a few (besides the ""Marooned"" reference on Cuaron's ""Gravity""). But, overall, I was not as impressed as other Reviewers."
ROMA,4 March 2019,9/10,"Roma is strange. It's like watching a bizarre hidden camera show (a-la Truman show) of Cleo's life, making for discomfort in the scenes. Even the camera inside the house mirrors the movements of a CCTV camera; panning right to left or vice-versa in a fixed position. My first introduction to Cuaron (other than Gravity, I was just a blissfully unaware child at that time) was Children of Men, one of my favourite films of all time. But, the theme I noticed after Roma, my third Cuaron film, is the surprising absence of happiness. This film will not make you happy. It is a depressing tale of a native Mexican house-worker in a wealthy family. I would have to rank it second in Cuaron's filmography that I have seen in terms of depressingness, not dethroning Children of Men, but leaving you far more empty inside when compared to Gravity. Also, in terms of quality. The film-making: Superb. The cinematography: Superb. The visual storytelling: Fantastic. My only gripe would be the first half-an-hour or so, being a bit of a drag. But having seen it through to the end, it all makes sense. The life of Cleo is monotonous, therefore the film follows suit.
In conclusion, watch this film if you have Netflix. If anything, it shows how the theatrical release of films is dying. Long live the streaming king."
ROMA,22 January 2019,10/10,It was a very successful film that left you feeling fascinating. blending pain and achieving absolute pain as a result.. life contains pain in itself but it continues on the one hand. I think that's what the film meant in general. the beauty of the script and the ability of the actors have taken the film to another dimension. this is a masterpiece.
ROMA,9 June 2019,4/10,"If you are expecting what I was expecting, a thought-provoking, violent and realistic look at the horrors of 1970s Mexican crime, you can lose all hope getting through this. I myself barely managed to make it to the end, and there were only two scenes which interested me at all, one involving a fire and another involving a raid and a failed birth. The other two hours are mainly just a family doing family things and talking about family issues."
ROMA,10 February 2019,2/10,"Did you all really like it so much?
First 30 minutes are literally about dog sh.t. Camera work is I teresting, but you can't look at the same spinning move and not feel dizzy. Maybe one day I'll try to watch the rest."
ROMA,6 July 2019,8/10,"There are movies which takes a realistic piece of life and places it on reels. Roma is that kind of movies. Starting from the pace of the movie, the location, the people, the events - everything is so realistic that you can really relate to it. The mundane actions that occurs day to day is as real as in this real world. One would feel that it is boring or it leaves something out - but that is because of the realism. Once you get it, you wpi;d find it to be a deep immersive film, perfectly capturing the time period and drawing you in. Roma is a slow and patient drama that you just can't take your eyes off."
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,"I don't get it. Truly. I'm not a cinema snob, or a Michael Bay junkie, or a Marvel Universe fan, but what exactly was I supposed to get out of this film? That life sucks? That men are jerks? That the universe is random? Seriously, I don't know what I was supposed to walk away with.Nothing in this film was exceptional, or even above average. It was average. Except in the duration department, where it was much longer than average, which resulted in me taking it down from two stars to one. If it hadn't taken up 2 hrs and 15 mins of my life, I'd have given it two stars.Some things in this world are a mystery. One of them is how this film has an 8.1 for a rating."
ROMA,15 March 2019,3/10,Within the first 10 minutes my expectations for this movie were destroyed. 5 minutes of water on concrete? It's high time these arty movies in which nothing happens stopped being glorified.
ROMA,29 December 2018,10/10,"OMG I am so stoked after seeing this. Alfonso Cuaron is a FILM MAKER. Period. Come Oscar time it will be interesting if he gets nods (Picture, Foreign Language film, director, screenplay, editing, cinematography) - if he doesn't it will be a surprise. He deserves all the praise and this fil deserves all the accolades it has been getting. The best part is the way he shot this film. It is pure, it is majestic, it is finite - it is as though the camera is like US - a quiet observer drawn in to and from the core of our being to the story unfolding before us. Simply BRILLIANT!"
ROMA,14 January 2019,1/10,"I really tried to like this movie. All those camera panning, black and white (obviously) and inexplicably boring dialogues make this a truly fantastic masterpiece. I was having lunch and I ordered my favorite pizza before watching this. I was eating my lunch and watching the movie and BAM!!! a guy completely naked, (you can see his dick swinging everywhere) took off the shower curtain pipe and started doing Kung-fu stuff!!! If this is not art, I don't know what is baby!!! A completely naked guy, doing kungfu in a black and white movie and telling how it is his purpose of life, that is the movie you choose as the best movie in any film festival!!!! TRY IT you will LOVE this movie! Needless to say I am not having that pizza again."
ROMA,3 January 2020,8/10,"Dont even read any 1 star reviews, they either don't know film or have short attention spans, theres no way this movie is that bad. This movie is not for everybody but it's undeniably a work of art. It's not a three act story, so don't expect that. Pay attention to the visual storytelling and impressive directing and you will enjoy it."
ROMA,8 January 2019,2/10,"Really I don't get the hype at all!
I'd rather watch Marie Condo fold another three seasons long some random strangers underwear than this pretentious boring montage of static camera and annoying sound recording.
And it's too clean for black and white."
ROMA,14 April 2020,7/10,"Although this movie is a presentation of the director's personal memories and emotions, I don't like his perspective on the whole story."
ROMA,17 December 2018,5/10,"I went into this movie with great expectations after seeing the wonderful trailer. But I ended up hugely disappointed.The cinematography and sound mix were impeccable. The staging seemed realistic. The story even had its dramatic moments. And yet the movie left me cold.Visual movies like ""The Tree Of Life"" and ""Baraka"" move me to tears every time I see them. I think what I missed in Roma was a gripping score and a story arc. I felt like I was watching a documentary without a purpose. And while much of the black and white cinematography was beautiful, I think HDR color could have made the movie look stunning. And I feel color would have contributed to painting a realistic image of Mexico City in the seventies.I was ready to be stunned. But for me, Roma wasn't enough. It did not grip me. I will not watch this movie again."
ROMA,29 January 2019,10/10,"This movie tells the story of a year in the life of Cleo, and it brought me to tears quite a few times. Not just for parts of the dialogue and drama, but also for some of the shots.If you like beautiful movies, you need to see this. It will be sitting with me for awhile."
ROMA,27 December 2020,1/10,"The most useless and pointless movie I've seen in last 10 years or even entire life.
At least now I know that today's critics are worthless as well."
ROMA,31 December 2018,1/10,If you are the kind of person who enjoys boring and meaningless movies then go ahead and watch it.
ROMA,24 February 2019,1/10,"Please, do not believe the hype!
I'm confused?
I'm a lover of cinema and understand beautiful pieces of work through movies.
This movie is pure rubbish. There is no story being told. No emotion. No connection with any character.
I'm very upset I took the advice from many articles about the Oscars regarding this movie ""Roma"".
2 hours of my life I will never get back.
Why Netflix, Why????"
ROMA,29 January 2019,3/10,"Many have praised this film. For me, only some scenes in the second half had worth. It moves slowly."
ROMA,19 January 2019,3/10,"Not so many years ago, a not so underground movie called ""Synecdoche, New York"" warned about the dangers of making art by recreating one's own life on a grand scale.Given that Alfonso Cuarón's newest film basically is just that - a bigger-than-life recreation of his upbringing in Mexico City - ""Roma"" should be, at least, a funny experience. Oh, I'd have bet that, after Charlie Kaufman's warning some years ago, I would have some good laughs over a bloated autobiographical film from a megalomaniac director. But no...""Roma"" couldn't even please me that way. It's just another sanitized production from a master craftsman, but poor storyteller. Afraid of provoking the audience in any sense, ""Roma"" doesn't fail because it doesn't even try to do something. And if it doesn't fail, it can't also be funny...just plain boring.""Roma"" is straight and sleek as the shaft of a broom: every nook and splinter, every aspect that could possibly startle the audience over what they are seeing was readily polished out of existence. The film is completely built out of memory, yet still, as you watch it, you cannot shake off the feeling that ""Roma"" is as hollow as an eggshell: historical recreations and social classes' conundrums are thrown in without any sort of explanation. What is going on beyond the soap opera plot? What's the cause for all the rioting in the streets? What's behind the tensions between landowners and workers at the hacienda?Cuarón decides to race past all the important questions in ""Roma"", consequently turning it into little more than a condensed Mexican telenovela. Touching politics or social dilemmas in the movie would mean raising some hairs in the necks of some part of the audience and, therefore, lesser chances to collect some golden statues at the next Academy Awards ceremony, probably.As big a treat for the eyes (and ears) as ""Roma"" might be, as brilliant Yalitza Aparicio's performance as the main character is, the story behind ""Roma"" is not better than your average Oscar-nominee Hollywood melodrama. Even though Cuarón seems to be back on Earth half a decade after releasing ""Gravity"", ""Roma"" still feels as airless and inane as the outer space."
ROMA,12 December 2018,9/10,It felt so great to get out of the mainstream cinema mindset and ran into this. Beyond raw masterpiece. The cinematography and color grading were so clever and beautiful it transported you to the time period. And the emotions were perfectly placed. It came it the right moment and nothing was forced. There's no twist no big surprises just life.
ROMA,31 December 2018,9/10,"Cinematic equivalent of Woody Allen's Manhattan , Roma is Alfonso Cuarón's love letter to his homeland, 1970s Mexico and childhood.Black and white cinematography is the most standout thing for me. Every frames of this is just a remainder of how passionate Cuarón is about the film.
It is so stunning and provok the feeling about past. Even the shots of dog poop looks so gorgeous. LolOverally love this. Story may feel simple but it is so captivating, script and performances really fuels it.
Not my personal pick for the year but deserved the praises it's getting. Really good."
ROMA,28 November 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuaron tells a very personal story. The fact that the film was shot in black and white makes it seem like a boring film. It's actually a really boring movie. It's a very stable movie, not a lot of events. Cuaron influenced the critics with the overriding technical aspect of the film, and the audience with the overriding social aspect. Since Emmanuel Lubezki was not there, he directed the film himself, which allowed us to watch a complete Cuaron film. He deserves praise. I think it's a movie that will be remembered for many years. But the downside is that many people will see this movie on the small screen and the bad headphones. Without a good sound system and screen, the quality of the film may not be fully understood."
ROMA,25 February 2019,5/10,"Even though the film looks beautiful it doesn't really live up to its reputation. I believe that this film is Oscar worthy, but for my taste I think it needed more heart and less tradgedy"
ROMA,20 December 2018,10/10,"Edit: I originally gave this artwork a 9 when I wrote this review but it had such a profound impact on me and I've been thinking about it for so long after watching it that this masterpiece from Cuarón deserves nothing less than a perfect score.This a slow burn but it is thoroughly engaging, beautiful and feels incredibly human and natural. Highly recommend."
ROMA,30 August 2020,10/10,"Jean-Luc Godard once said that an image is truth, and cinema is truth 24 times a second. Alfonso Cuaron has made a film that cannot be more truthful.It's not a regular film which uses a plot to progress. This semi-autobiographical work of Cuaron comes out straight from his life in Mexico in 70s. The film follows an year of Cleo, a maid in a rich Mexican family, and shows various events and their effects on her.The very first shot of the film, showing a plane's reflection on the washed tiles, reveals how much of thought has gone into this.The cinematography is spectacular with long and elaborate takes. Fewer cuts invoke a feeling of real time and simultaneously make viewers to find pleasure in small details. The camera always pans slowly and gently as it tracks the Mexico of 70s - recreated masterfully by the production design. This gentleness can be observed in Cleo's demeanour throughout the film.Something which strikes about the camera work is that it keeps us at a distance from the characters by minimising the close ups. This complements the use of wide angles to add more visual details about the things around and their subsequent effects.Roma is a film of astounding beauty and subtle intimacy. This is one such film where visuals say a lot more than dialogues, and thus, it demands many careful viewings to truly decipher its magic."
ROMA,4 September 2019,7/10,"This is the second time I totally fail to get the idea or the motivator that made these reality- detached critics give such movie a 100/100 rating !!Roma is a good movie with a maximum rating of 70/100 ..And of course regarding the Oscars it's clear now, Hollywood -unfortunately- became politically and financially motivated to a great extent.BTW ... the first time was Moonlight, I will never forget that horrible incredibly overestimated silly movie."
ROMA,24 December 2018,5/10,"I wanted to love this film. I have much respect and admiration for Alfonso Cuarón, and his passion for story telling. But with that said, I just couldn't into this movie. I didn't like that it was in black & white, and a lot of the time, I felt like I was watching someone's home movie. I'd rather watch my own, if that's the case. The performances were wonderful and I'm so happy for that it's doing well. It's just not my cup of tea. Also, can someone please let that dog outside to poop on the grass already?"
ROMA,10 February 2019,9/10,"This film really captures the human condition. The film is subtle, and nothing is without purpose. Cleo's character has very few lines in the film, yet by the end, you feel for her greatly. Although it wasn't crammed with fancy CGI or a densely complicated plot, Roma proves that it is still possible to captivate audiences without the flashiness of modern cinema."
ROMA,18 December 2018,10/10,"I know that many will believe that no film deserves the perfect score of 10 - obviously I disagree and will forever cite Roma as my argument.
From the first frames to the last we enter a special world of cinema that most filmmakers can only dream about, a delicacy and absorption of detail, light, humour and lifelike small joys and tragedies.
I was transported to Mexico City and lived, for 135 minutes in Cleo's world and the world of her middle class employers lives. They engaged me, they made me laugh with them and cry with them in both joy, despair and relief.
Like few films before the experience was one of 'transportation' - the film is a masterpiece of storytelling and like any great novel it will continue to live with me."
ROMA,4 March 2019,5/10,"As a documentary about Mexican families in the 70's it's great. As a film, though, it's terrible.
The Good:
I wasn't sure about a 2+ hours long B&W film, which are usually an eccentricity of independent film makers. But in this case, it helps to set the mood and the ambiance of the documentary.
Background, clothes and all the props are greatly selected and captured, and it did remind me of my childhood.
Photography is amazing and it's a beautiful film.
The Bad:
Like I said, i believe Roma is a documentary that depicts real life events and characters of the era. But it has No story, No main Characters and No plot. That's why I consider the film to be a documentary.
It's not the story of the maid, no the story of the family not the story of anything. it's random events that could happen to people in the 70's depending on social status. But there is no storyline.
The maid's performance is acceptable. There has been a great fuss about it because she is a pre-hispanic actress. One of the first. So what's the big deal? It may be the same fuss about the first african actor or woman director. The first always makes waves. And we know the Oscars are pure politics, but her performance is not worthy of an Oscar. Not even close.
Also nominated was ""the Mother"". I'm shocked. Her performance isn't bad... it's awful. Every time she's on screen you wish she wasn't. The only actors worse than her are the four children. Where did Cuarón find so bad actors?
The secondary characters are no better and when one of them is hurt or almost dies, you are relieved you might not have to endure their pitiful performances anymore. So, as a film, it's worth a 1. Maybe a 2 for photography.
The Ugly:
You are warned at the beginning of brief nudity. Turns out a whole scene is the maid's boyfriend jumping around like a fool completely naked. the scene makes no sense, is completely pointless and could have been erased all together. It brings nothing to the movie and brakes the PG13 rating of the rest of the movie. I believe that scenes like that are made to incraese their rating and make people think the movie is tougher then it really is or to create a ""Shoking"" effect that critics like so much. Absolute nonsense.Ina nut shell: If you want to see how people lives in Mexico in 1971 and the events that took place, you'll enjoy the film. If you're expecting a story, don't watch it."
ROMA,30 June 2019,2/10,"The only thing this film undeniably does well is realism. It absolutely feels like a perfectly realistic chapter out of a woman's life, just not an interesting one.Roma utterly lacks narrative. There was no attempt whatsoever to toy with a unique, fresh, or otherwise different take on a narrative structure, like countless films have done. Cuarón simply didn't want to have one at all. Oddly enough, this in itself does count as an artistic decision, just not an interesting one. Sure, there are no ""gimmicks"" that it relies on to tell its narrative, but there is also no narrative at all. It's just pure, honest, raw reality. Note that just because it has no narrative does not mean it does not have a story; there is a story, but without a backing narrative it's not interesting enough to be worthy of discussing.The black & white decision was a bit odd considering this film takes place in the '70s rather than the eras more commonly associated with a ""black & white look"", such as the '40s. But the decision was likely made to fit with the theme of being a mundane, drab slice of life. Indeed even the lighting and shading employed was intentionally bland and low-contrast. While it fits the theme, once again it does not make for interesting nor appealing visuals.In many ways this film did resemble ""Y Tu Mamá También"", especially with its trademark Alfonso Cuarón long continuous panning shots. However, the chief difference is that film had actual substance: it had plenty of comedy, drama, and human concepts to ponder over after the credits rolled, such as the female vs. male perspective on life.The only thing to ponder after these credits roll is, ""Why was this made?"""
ROMA,1 February 2020,1/10,"I've already wasted 2 hours of my life watching this film so i am not going to waste some 30 other minutes to explain why this film is so awful. just all the people who are trying to decide now whether or not to watch this film, please be aware that rome is boring, unnecessarily long and not a bit touching at all.there are so many successful films you can watch less than 2 hours 14 minutes believe me. dont waste your time. just dont."
ROMA,20 February 2021,1/10,After 20 minutes I stop watching this crap. I am glad I stopped it.
ROMA,18 December 2018,10/10,"The best thing to do if you haven't seen this movie is to stop reading anything online and just go see it as soon as you can.I didn't read anything about this movie before seeing it except that Roma referred to the Colonia in Mexico City. I highly recommend not reading anything about it. Just go to a theater and enter into the world Cuaron creates for you and watch what happens.I walked out of the theatre having difficulty breathing. It was so good, so powerful, it took about an hour for me to get it together afterwards.This is a masterpiece. I don't even want to say anything else because I don't want to rob anyone of discovering it the way I did. I can't wait to talk with someone who saw the movie about the movie. Despite wanting to write all about how good it was here, I'm just going to encourage people to see it, and hope we can talk about it in person. He did it. He made great art. Great art changes lives. Thank you Mr. Cuaron."
ROMA,12 January 2019,6/10,"The cinematography is simply amazing and almost every frame seems like a street photography masterpiece. Sadly the characters are extremely lacking in depth and personality. I didn't care about any of the characters and that is really a failing of the film. In particular the character played by the nanny was very dull Bland and boring, and where as I could see that this was possibly quite an accurate portrayal of a particular character I don't think it to be a character that is worthy of seeing in a film."
ROMA,23 January 2019,2/10,"I am shocked this film has 10 nominations in the 2019 Oscars.Yes, the cinematography is brilliant but the film itself is pointless and boring imo.Terrible wooden acting,particularly from the lead who is like a plank of wood.I struggled to get through the entire film.All I remember about it is badly behaved children and dog poo. If this actually gets anything in the Oscars other than Cinematography and probably best foreign film I will be thinking there is some kind of collusion with Netflix.I am a fan of Art house and Foreign films but other than checking out some of it for the Cinematography I would not bother watching."
ROMA,24 February 2019,1/10,"Was ready to see a great story beautifully told with the best cinematography. Started by being bored with 5 minutes watching water on concrete for the credits. And that more or less summarises the movie. No story, just scenes of this maid cleaning, getting predictably pregnant. Doesn't deserve a chocolate medal!"
ROMA,11 February 2019,9/10,"-Stunning as a painting, many shots from this movie will stay in Film History that's for sure.
-Very detailled as with the used tea bag in the sink.
-Nostalgia from a simpler Mexico City that didn't lack hassels.
-Mexico as real as it can get without being just a mirror to life, Cuarón is well known because of this and i find it like a breath of fresh air.However, this Film is definetly going to be more loved by Mexicans and that's okay."
ROMA,19 December 2018,10/10,"Hard to put into words what this movie means to me. One thing is for sure, there is endless color in this black and white film. Please find a quiet place without distraction while viewing. The subtitles are important. Highly recommend."
ROMA,25 July 2020,3/10,"As soon as I noticed this movie was black white and they had a 5 minute scene watching the soap go down the drain, I should have ended it right there. However, it was a mailed DVD so it was more of commitment than streaming so I gave it a go.There are some good things about this movie. I think it was a pretty good depiction of middle upper class city life in Latin America. I am married to a Peruvian and many things were very accurate about the lifestyle, and the house. I also like the nostalgia component since I was a kid in the 70s and even though this movie took place in another country, there were still many familiar enjoyable details. I also found the affection of the family endearing. I also like that they didn't kill any of the major characters, just to torture the audience, which these kinds of artsy movies tend to do. I was waiting for tragedy but it never happened fortunately.The bad thing about this movie is that it lacked any kind of real story or plot, and that it was often super tedious. I don't think claiming that this makes this movie like real life and therefore realistic is a good excuse. I think it's just plain lazy. I have real life already. I watch movies because I want an entertaining story or because I want to experience something new, or learn something. I suppose I did learn some things and have some new experiences with this movie, but watching soap go down the drain or watching a maid take every corner around the house is hardly anything new. It seems like the director is more in love with his camera work than actually caring much about the audience's experience. Can I label camera work pretentious?I feel that somehow this movie was a montage of subtle and not so subtle social statements. Maybe that is the real purpose of this movie. So I am going to list some of what I perceived, with a little sarcasm mixed in1) Clean up after the dog if you want your marriage to last. Well the only thing I remember the husband saying the entire movie was something about there being dog poop all over the place, and there were many shots of the dog poop in the driveway. I think he left because of the poop maybe?2) You can't trust people that do karate naked. Unfortunately, the one scene in the movie that I will probably not forget. Yuck. What is the point really?3) Men are bad. Every adult male in this movie aside from maybe the chauffer, who really didn't have a single line, were astoundingly cold uncaring people. One of the wife's most dramatic lines was something about a woman always being alone. The karate guy boyfriend was also awful.4) Never leave you maid who can't swim to watch the kids at the beach in pounding surf. Duhhh5) The life of a poor maid in Mexico is not all that glamorous. Maybe this is the big reveal. Ha haOverall a very forgettable movie aside from the ""karate"" scene."
ROMA,9 January 2020,10/10,"Cuaron is this generation director, but with this movie I call him Legend along with whom we usually call before generation great directors. Through out movie I saw only passion."
ROMA,28 November 2018,8/10,"I somehow feel compelled to write a review of this film. I'm not quite sure why, though, there are so many out there already... mine is not going to make a difference, but still I feel like writing... something. So, here it goes:The hype surrounding this film is not wrong, it is an exquisite film, in most (cinematic) regards. And still, I did feel that the hype has more to do with the fact that such a beautifully made film is struggling to find screens in the theaters of its own Director's-Editor's-Cinematographer's-Screenwriter's-Producer's country of origin. Don't get me wrong, I'm up for THAT hype as well, but the fact that I listed Cuaron's tasks in this film in a long-hyphened-one-liner is no coincidence. It is a statement on over-indulgence that kind of wants whoever reads this to consider that, maybe... just maybe... he should've entrusted some of these departments to someone else (ehm, screenwriting and/or editing), and the film might have just connected with me. I was constantly trying to find empathy with the characters. And I got very close, but sadly, by the end, I simply didn't. I was so astonished by how perfectly shot the film was, that it didn't really feel like a beautiful film, but rather, a beautifully made film. It's not the same. The first one refers to the story, while the second refers to the craft of making the film. It still got as close as it gets to being overwhelming, though. I think I'm even a little sad that it didn't. Not that Cuarón or anyone else cares.Anyway, watch it, in the theater, or at home, it doesn't matter. Yalitza Aparicio's performance alone is more than worth your time.Here's to my two cents on this Maestro's work of art."
ROMA,28 December 2020,7/10,"Great cinematography!
There is very little story, and it is very slow paced. However it give us a look into the lives of average people, living in 1970's Mexico. Its nothing grand, but that's life. Life sucks sometimes, but we keep on living and see what else the world has in store for us, and I think this film shows that.Definitely not the most entertaining movie ever, but it's a treat for your eyes, has some great performances, and heart breaking moments. Definitely recommend if you enjoy slower movies, or good cinematography."
ROMA,8 January 2019,8/10,"Very natural acting. Well directed and cut. It is a calm slow movie, very intriguing. All in black and white, it's 1970-1971. Lot's of work in the recreation of the details, like old cars, interiors, behavior, buildings, etc. First I thought not a recommendable movie, but then one gets more and more involved into the movie. Beautiful camera work."
ROMA,23 January 2019,3/10,"This movie started off with about ten full minutes of slooooowww credits. It was foreshadowing. Ok, great sounds & textures blah blah blah, what we actually have here is another one of those highbrow ""art"" films that doesn't inspire or entertaine, but people will oooohhh and ahhhh over it because they think they're not getting something that isn't there. I tried three times to get through it. All it succeeded in doing was make me sleepy & want to clean my house simultaneously which is not a good mix- just like this movie."
ROMA,16 December 2018,2/10,Nothing is happening. But this nothing looks good at least...
ROMA,9 January 2019,1/10,Please someone tell me....what was the point of this Empty Movie? What a BORE! What was the Point?
ROMA,12 January 2019,6/10,"I'm probably echoing some of the same points made in other reviews. Visually this film is fantastic. I really enjoyed the camera work and style of the film. That being said, besides a few key scenes in the third act of the film, I found myself pretty bored. I must caveat this by saying, typically this is not a movie I would watch, and isn't my cup of tea. So I would say, if you don't expect to like it, you probably won't."
ROMA,10 May 2020,1/10,It contains art and not suitible for having fun. So I closed after 15 mins.
ROMA,31 January 2019,2/10,"Anyone saying this is the best movie of the year/of the decade/ever is just a complete liar. It has absolutely no qualities to justify any acclaim. Does it have any positive points? Yes, it is beautifully shot, but nothing groundbreaking or to be studied in years to come. The plot starts at nowhere and goes nowhere. That simple. You can't even call it a character study because the characters are presented in a shallow and generic way, they too start at nowhere and go to nowhere. The acting is just average, definitely not worthy of all the nominations. The main character will never really let you know if she's happy, sad, desperate, in love, in fear... She just keeps the same face throughout the way dragged 2:15h running of this waste of life. This could be a short of 15 minutes and it wouldn't make a difference, it would still be pointless. Seriously, don't make the same mistake lots of us did. Do not waste your time on this one."
ROMA,21 February 2019,,"I really like this movie's style, but am I the only person who found it boring? Very little happens and it takes its time not happening. I think maybe the director just made up a lot of the scenes as he went along.There are really bizarre moments, like the dog poop scenes, the astronaut moment, the guy singing to the camera, and the naked guy doing martial arts, Mostly, it is really slow. There are long, extended shots of people walking up stairs, turning off lights, washing floors and dishes, and doing mundane tasks. The dialogue was mainly chit-chat. I don't understand why this won the Oscar. If this is ""Art"" I will pass. but hey It's a free country...:D"
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,I expected to love this film. The first scene scared me ... I mean how long can you look at water thrown on the tile floor? It never got better.
ROMA,12 March 2021,9/10,"This movie is so good, and the best exaple of an art film. It has amazing cinematography, the fact that its in black and white adds a lot to the tone and mood; It also had great sound design and the scenary in it was great. It was long, but it felt appropriate, even leaving me wishing it was longer. It's a sad story with no real ending but that's part of its greatness. The acting was very good, the child actors weren't bad at all, and Yalitza's preformance was outstanding, considering she wasn't a proffesional actress before this role. Overall, a groundbreaking film, and one of a favorite movies. It's a great look into the life that Mexico City has, and its working class. it feels alive."
ROMA,24 January 2019,8/10,"I get why the numerous nominations and I get why some people were disappointed by the lack of storytelling.First things first - the cinematography is stellar and poetic. You could pause the movie every 5 seconds and get a stunning photograph. The long takes simply got me.Secondly - yes, there is no epic story here. And you know what? That's exactly how things are in life. This is what this movie is all about - the silent drama of the boring lives we, normal people, go through as we sit on time's sidelines. In the grand schemes of things, we don't matter. Just as Cleo's drama doesn't matter to anyone except her. She's all alone with her struggles, just as we all are."
ROMA,21 January 2019,4/10,"Actually, over-rated really does not give justice to how not good it is but somehow awful, horrible or disaster just do not seem right. Plus there is one really great scene in a hotel room with a bow staff. Just kidding actually the scene and the only memorable part of the movie was the babies birth which was pretty fantastic. Yes, the ""cinematography"" was captivating but almost every other element of a good movie was lacking leaving me bewildered on the IMDB and RT scores."
ROMA,26 January 2019,1/10,"I Had to see it. Nominated, wow, for so many Oscars. I tried. Really tried to get into groove of it, but... Camera work is interesting, the angles, attention to detail, b/w, but that's about it. There is no story, no sense, no fragment is connected to another. I am really wondering if the creator of this ""masterpiece"" was severely stoned in the process. Even bigger question is what kind of substance the Academy has been on to nominate this thing for best picture. I lost 2 hours of my life. If I just stared at the dot in my ceiling for 2 hours, it would have been better."
ROMA,4 March 2019,3/10,"Quite a bit disappointed with Roma movie. It's extremely overrated move, for political reasons I guess. Cinematography is just a OK, this movie is way too long, could be edited to 90 min feature. It's hard to believe this film was even considered by Academy for a Best Feature. It's just another foreign feature film in 70s nostalgia style, it will be forgotten soon."
ROMA,4 March 2019,7/10,You can see why this film was a favourite for Oscar nominations. The directing was undoubtedly superb: shocking and delicate scenes were dealt with tastefully and artistically. The long tracking shots from the perspective of Cleo (the maid) were both well executed and well purposed to allow the audience to experience the film from her perspective. This contributed to a melancholic yet comfortable tone which carries the viewer with ease through a somewhat mundane plot.Overall this film is a good viewing experience which possesses some excellent scenes yet lacks much in the way of entertainment.
ROMA,11 May 2019,9/10,"Many people here are giving it a 1/10, maybe because they want to be different or feel as though the film is over-hyped, but it really is amazing. It's a modern classic, a modern La Dolce Vita, people here are complaining about how slow it is and the lack of story, watch any film by Andrei Tarkovsky, then complain. It's meant to portray real life and it does a great job of it, by far Cuaron's best work. He's definitely learned how to end a film since Children of Men (2006). At some points it is a little slow, but it makes up for it with the visuals and long shots in the most stunning parts of Mexico. Don't listen to the people giving it a 1/10, they write that review with hate, it's not from a place of sense. I believe that the people writing those reviews have never seen any classic film over 2 hours. No film is perfect, but damn is this close."
ROMA,3 January 2019,7/10,"Like Y Tu Mamá También and Children of Men, Cuarón's depth and attention to detail is outstanding. The grayscale makes you appreciate the choice of patterns and shades which enrich each shot. Cuarón has again written awesome and empowering female leads which emphasises how often Hollywood still fails to pass the Bechdel Test on numerous occasions. A film definitely for the enjoyment of its beauty and less on plot, however the final half-hour is incredibly gripping and moved me to the verge of tears."
ROMA,3 December 2018,,"The 10 Star Reviews Are Likely from People Connected to the FilmRoma first came to my attention from an onslaught of PR from Netflix. However, I've been watching the movie for the past 32 minutes and 26 seconds and I'm bored to tears. Where's the story? Where's a modicum of anything worthwhile to keep me viewing?Simply put, don't believe the hype.Sorry Netflix, bombarding voting members like myself doesn't buy you awards. Good films do. Stop throwing everything and the kitchen sink at us hoping that something sticks. You're asking for a negative reaction with such a misguided strategy.AN UPDATE AS OF OSCAR NIGHT:
It turns out Netflix engaged in a behind-the-scenes campaign to smear ""Green Book"", Roma's closest competitor in the race for the Academy's Best Picture award. I can only hope that this untoward and unprofessional behavior comes back to bite Netflix and the film's producers in the behind when the statuettes are handed out tonight.(And as an aside, from here on out, all Netflix screeners that I'm sent during Awards Season will he placed at the bottom of the pile)"
ROMA,14 June 2019,3/10,"I adore films about human. I like dramas. I like ultra slow films, and despise action movies. Yet, apart from the fantastic camera tricks and some very difficult-to-shoot scenes, I have nothing to praise about this film. Honestly speaking , it was simply terrible. Very beautifully shooted, highly aesthetic but pointless and extremely needlessly long scenes are seamed together to create a 2.5 hours long torture. It is obvious for me that the director could not (or did not) balance the cinematography with the content, which is ""cool"" and always well received by the festivals and Oscars, but I feel like I deserve some , tiny bit of content in something I invest 2.5 hours."
ROMA,16 December 2018,5/10,"There was not much of a plot to this film. It is basically about an upper class family in Mexico and their working class housekeeper. The lead actress is interesting but I would not characterize her acting as great or best actress worthy. I like the cinematography, but the lack of a soundtrack did not add anything to the overall quality of the film. I watch a lot of subtitled movies, as this one is, but that doesn't influence my average rating for the film."
ROMA,12 January 2019,10/10,"It took me awhile to get into the film. But it captured me in it's spell. The cinematography/videography is stunning as well as the acting. Beautiful, heartbreaking. Glorious. Magic that slowly casts it's spell."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"An average 8 rating! I'll admit the movie had good acting and good cinematography, but the story was bad, the pacing was bad, it was boring. I guess I am just not the artistic type. I saw all 8 Best Picture nominees and this one was with The Favourite as the worse."
ROMA,29 January 2019,3/10,"I've seen most of the Oscar nominated films - HATED ""Roma"" - an autobiographical film by a guy who grew up in an upscale household in Mexico City in the 70s with three generations of women (grandmother, mother, sisters) a housemaid and a female cook. Great cinematography. Great acting. Applied to a hyper depressing story. Only men in the film are an unfaithful, absent husband and a violent psycho boyfriend who threatens the life of one of the maids - who is pregnant and loses the baby in a long graphic scene in an emergency room.
My advice: skip it, unless your life is lacking sufficient drama."
ROMA,28 December 2018,8/10,Camera work is amazing. Story is very good. Captivating!
ROMA,29 January 2019,1/10,"Fine. Won't watch it.Blah, blah I guess my review is too short."
ROMA,28 January 2019,2/10,"When I heard that the last movie of Alfonso Cuaron was in black and white, based in his childhood in Mexico, in Spanish, I couldn't wait!!! Maybe it was on me, because I expect so much from this director. After all he is truly one of the best! But this movie is such a disappointment...I can't comprehend...what was the story? The sacrificed of the women? The pain of the children? Why the husband left? It seems to me that none of the stories lines were developed...kind of laziness to expect the viewer to look at the beautiful cinematography and be content!"
ROMA,20 December 2018,10/10,"Wow. From start to finish I watched this movie in its original Español sin subtítulos and it was powerful. From the cinematography to the direction and acting, this movie made me more emotional than any I remember watching. Alfonso Cauron's masterpiece in a long career of greatness. Best picture hands down"
ROMA,6 April 2019,7/10,"I had to put aside my expectation of a beginning, a middle, and an end. There was no ""climax"" to the story, which was very disappointing to many people. It was an experience, and the more I watched, the more I felt like I was there. It was artistic and emotional and just different. I'm glad I watched this movie, it was thought provoking."
ROMA,28 January 2019,2/10,"It's a really slow movie. There is not much of a plot, just a lot of things that happen that are tied together simply by the characters being around them - the awful school band marching down the street, earthquake, the forest fire, the weird dude singing while the fire burns, the rude young people at the movies, etc. None of the things that happen do anything to drive a plot or narrative but rather just seem to drag out the movie. Then there are the ridiculous things you see - all the pregnant women walking around in front of the hospital and several more just sitting in the acting room, yet Cleo gets to the front of the line without wait. The acting is pretty bad - with the exception of when Cleo gives birth, she has no emotions whatsoever. She's got the be the flattest, most one dimensional character not played by George Clooney."
ROMA,24 September 2019,10/10,The film really has this and that kind of concept. The fire extinguishing scene with happy new was marvel. Other than that yhaa thanks for efforts.
ROMA,21 February 2019,4/10,"Now...I am all for some good drama movies without the super hero or mega computer special effects but....and that's a big BUT...when a movie spends the first 10 min showing the camera slowly zooming out from water thrown over a patio in order to clean dog poo...o well, these kind of movies there will always be viewers who ""absolutely love a simple yet dramatic real life story being so beautifully portrayed, the stunning use of camera and the great photography effects"", for other is just a long bore,"
ROMA,22 May 2019,1/10,You know when a movie is boring when you don't care about missing some of the subtitles! Please don't waste 2.5 hours of your life!
ROMA,30 January 2019,10/10,"Truly a beautiful story, told with beautiful cinematography, that shows the beautiful scenery as well as using a colour palette that suits the film's tone, as well as amazing production design and editing, all being used in capturing the film's beauty and realism. The actors all did a phenomenal job as portraying their characters, with giving us incredible emotional moving performances, that helps capture the realism, all in all, creating a believable, life like performance.Overall, this film was absolutely beautiful, a masterpiece. I hope this film dominates the Oscars. It has been nominated for ten Oscars, and this films deserves to win every award it gets nominated."
ROMA,26 January 2019,3/10,"I second what has been written before. Meh, meh... ohhh no... yawn... G.reat acting... Excessive but excellent staging of events. Even with the Turkeys having sex - so yes, the cinematography and artistic value was great - like a painting where you are just staring at it and thinking: ""Wow, they put too much thought and effort into this, despite it being a whole lot of nothing."""
ROMA,25 February 2020,8/10,"I watched the firstv20 minutes of this film in Netflix twice....saying to myself I can see why it got an oscar.. I know what it's all about... I can chalk this one off.. but it was on at our local art cinema and I went out of curiosity to see what It looked like on the big screen.. funnily enough i preferred the cinematography of the first 20 minutes on the TV . But then i got it. And i am a convert... someone re viewed this and said his grandmas story would have been better.. and of course he inadvertently sums up this picture.. this is real person's story not a faux tragedy but a true tragedy... we see the tragedy of the domestic' s life and the tragedy of the self obsessed middle class wife's lives converge... while other narratives cross cross... the idiot lothario martial artist the selfish husband.. the riots, the violence and if you didn't get that from this film then what you want from cinema is the reason the US film industry make shallow dramas.. thank God for whatever political manoeuvres that the oscar academy realised this was a human story and that the director told it in a thoughtful way..."
ROMA,29 March 2019,10/10,"What sets Roma apart from Alfonso Cuarón's impeccable library of films is how flawlessly he's mastered his visual craft into telling his most personal story to date.His career has sailed high and mighty as one of 21st century's most enthralling visual storyteller, giving us defining and revolutionary films such as Children of Men (personal favourite) and Gravity. This time, Alfoson Cuarón grounds himself in a different reality, with a story that embellishes in his signature visual dazzle, rendering an emotional truth to a subject matter that can only feel but personally attached to the filmmaker himself.Spanning one year, from 1970 to 1971, Roma tells the story of a live-in maid working for a middle-class family in Mexico City. From the very beginning, Alfonso pulls you in, immersing the viewer into a real intimacy with the family that will last till the end credits. Through emotional highs and lows, the narrative takes on different directions as it sweeps, tracks and pans to give visually engrossing sequences and moments that will imprint in your memory.Roma couldn't have been told if not for a wonderful cast of actors led by the magnificent Yalitza Aparicio, who gives the story its core and melts it with a beautifully heartfelt ending. The ensemble are perfect, showing all colours of life in an array of platitudes old and familiar.It comes to no surprise that I give Roma the praise it deserves, with 10 Oscar nominations under its belt, it truly is the best picture of the year."
ROMA,23 April 2019,,"After sitting patiently through mop water and car tires navigating. I was just relieved it was over, and I wish I could get my time back. Artsy, but it ruined our night. The plot comes to a surprisingly uneventful ending that left us wondering what just happened. The answer is, nothing. I'm not sure which movie the critics were watching to give it such a high rating."
ROMA,26 January 2019,4/10,"It's just not good, and with nearly 60k people who gave it average 8 of 10, i can see my opinion is completely different than others.
It's difficult to explain, I didn't like it because:
facts are just unconnected, just keep happening, as if you're living that sad life - maybe that was the goal of the director but it's not something I choose to watcheven the scenes of most intense dramas are difficult to connect to, no empathy for the maid, or for the lady of the house or for the children or dog or for the deaths - they are just there, like many separate scenes being put together to fill the 2h time of the movieI gave it 4 of 10 and not less, as scenes, especially this black and white, reflect well the 70's."
ROMA,13 May 2020,8/10,"When Cleo gets the ""shaft"" from Fermi, gets pregnant, then dumped and then incurs a horrendous experience at the doctor's after suffering a psychological trauma-induced stillborn birth (without the comforting presence of her intimate lover), we are disposed to consider this whole experience as quite characteristic of ""low class"" morality. One can say that this is what low class people are expected to suffer and points to the unconscious warning that should motivate everyone to pull themselves upward into a higher level class. However, this movie only points out that regardless of class, the same despondency exists for ANY person when it comes to not being able to count on one's intimate partner to lovingly share and develop their relationship without imposing sudden abandonment and a carefree attitude about the repercussions of such abandonment, Such abandonment does not belong to a particular class and cannot be assigned to just the ""low class"". Sofi has several young children to continue to raise as a divorcee plus a new job, not to mention the crushing feeling of being cast aside by her husband. This relationship is far more developed and complex than the simple ""one night stand"" that Cleo experienced, yet both were victims of the same human despicableness. After the revelation of Sofi's abandonment, we are reminded that even her ""higher class"" status did nothing to protect her and her family. Even the government, as in the Mexican government's overreaching student demonstrators by killing them, shows the institutional abandonment of basic respect for human rights in countries not known for a totalitarian or dictatorial government. It seems ALL governments, North Korean, China, Russia, as well as the United States, Mexico, Chile have been known to kill innocent people. There is really no guarantee of certain favorable behavioral expectations of various class societies nor of the various governmental institutions when it comes to episodic human frailty interjecting its suffering onto people. Simply put, you can't guarantee you will not suffer human indignities by virtue of higher class nor by a democratic republican govenrment."
ROMA,3 February 2019,8/10,Synopsis: Life is a never ending pile of dog poo. Sorry my review is too short. But I was trying to boil down all the symbolism in this film down to the basic moral of the story. Well done and artistic.
ROMA,22 July 2019,2/10,"This movie is such a waste of time - literally nothing happens - except for ""beautiful scenes"" in black in and white - what a load of garbage. You want a movie with better cinematography and a good plot? go watch Road to Perdition with Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Judd Law and Daniel Craig."
ROMA,22 February 2019,9/10,"Rather than the story or performance, Roma is a good example how should a film be made, from shot composing to minor detail and execution stunted me.. Top Notch Movie."
ROMA,23 October 2019,6/10,"Tries way too hard to pander to post metoo Hollywood. Both male character total bad hombres, even worse in context of pure reportage style. Great crowd period scenes, but quite dull and slow. I could just accept the lack of a why in this without the heavy handed reverse sexism. But i am sure the Director gets plenty.l of attention from the ladies."
ROMA,29 March 2019,10/10,"Excellent direction, cinematography and acting. Heart and soul storytelling"
ROMA,22 December 2018,10/10,"Is this going to be a true first for ""Americans"", ya know, the first ones? She is captivating, spellbinding, absolutely transported me and carried this film. Technically, the film is flawless. Reminds me of Asian art in that the cinematography focuses on the perspective of harmony in the composition rather than promoting a sole subject. The objective in the journey isn't victory, but contentment. Everything, from the tilted painting and the hole in the tattered lamp shade, to just...EVERYTHING is epically placed and considered, cut, lit, and executed. Bravo Alfonso, bravissimo!"
ROMA,24 February 2019,2/10,"-said no one ever!
2 Stars:
1 for the cinematography,
1 because it was simply a movie!"
ROMA,23 February 2019,2/10,"I was very interested in seeing this movie, having heard a lot about even prior to the Oscar buzz. However, I just did not like this movie, as much as I tried to like it. It reminded me of one of a number of films in the 1970s that attempted to show ""real life"" and present it as a groundbreaking feat of filmaking.While the stark black and white photography was vivid and sharp, there was absolutely no connection established between the viewer and the film's characters.The only time there was any sense of drama at all came more than halfway into the film, which involved a riot and the main character's subsequent miscarriage. Even then, both events having been broadly hinted, the viewer does not feel a sense of drama.Even the ""rescue from drowning"" of the two youngest children, so prominently projected it bleeds any sense of drama or suspense out of the situation, falls flat as the woman simply strides into the surf, takes their hands and walks the children out of the waves.I actually stopped watching halfway through the film the first time I sat down to see it. My second viewing was hardly more positive, but I managed to plod through it.It is one thing to watch a film based upon the suggestion of an aquaintence, but another thing altogether when a film is universally praised and exaulted to the status of an instant classic. It is as if everyone jumped on the band wagon and nobody dared question the film's quality. Really not worth the attention it is getting and the praise it is receiving."
ROMA,18 February 2019,10/10,"Such a brilliant, brilliant, rich movie. There are times in life when you feel you just lost a few hours. There are also times when you were productive at something and feel good, or times when you were simply entertained and feel good as well. There are also times when you feel so emotionally charged that you just have to stop thinking for a second, take a deep breath and start to dissect and to make sense of the last hours spent. This is how I felt after I saw Roma. I feel I do not have time and energy to unpack the layers and layers of meanings and messages transmitted by the movie.Let me start by saying the directing was amazing. The image was amazing (and i do not like black and white movies). The screenplay was amazing. The movie shows the life of a maid and through it goes into questions of class, race, family, gender roles, death. I will not detail where all these things appear but just stop at two things I found particularly impressive. Although it was easy for the movie to fall into the more known narrative of the maid being working class, different race, badly treated and thus unprivileged and discriminated, it does much much more than this. The maid is actually well treated, to the extent that it becomes a second mother (or father?) for the children. When the dad is gone, she becomes even more part of the family. In the ocean scene she does arguably what only parents would do, sacrificing her own life. Therefore, we are left wondering if are parents truly the backbone of a family? Must you have blood relations to be called a parent or to have more rights to raise a child? What does 'your' child mean anyway? If you gave birth to it, what rights are you entitled to? Is the servant/maid worse or better parent than the father who is always away, and cheats on his wife?Another striking thing is the constant presence of death in the movie. One of the children tells about someone who got shot at the beginning of the movie, then another child plays death, the maid says that she likes to be dead when she plays, her child is born dead, in that protest a lot of people are dying. I was ABSOLUTELY SURE that given all these clues, the children will also drown in the ocean scene! But the director brilliantly does not allow this. He twists in a way the whole narrative, to offer us also hope and happiness, that go hand in hand with death anyway. Because Roma is in the end a movie about life, more than it is about death."
ROMA,3 January 2019,5/10,"Yes, the cinematography was excellent. And sometimes (most notably ""Boyhood"")
slice of life movies can grab your interest. But this wasn't one of them. Cleo, the
main character, was so plodding. Maybe true to life but meant for boring cinema. Fortunately we watched it on Netflix so we could take a break every so often. Had it been on the big screen I don't know that I could have made it to the end. Hollywood will love this movie. People like myself that really enjoy movies, not so much."
ROMA,13 February 2019,7/10,"Cuaron beautifully takes you through a journey of what it means to be a female, whether it is being a mother, employee, or a girlfriend. The acting is solid although I got to know that the main actress, Yalitza Aparicio ""Cleo,"" in the film is a teacher and this is the first time for her to act, which is very impressive, her Oscar nomination she received is well deserved. While Marina de Tavira's ""Sra. Sofia,"" acting was also great, I thought that the Oscar nomination she received is slightly un-worthy.The film could be slow in some parts and quite in other parts, but this factor, in my opinion, helps the viewer sink in the characters and the plot of the film. Interestingly, there is no main role for male characters in the film and yet the subject of the film revolves around the repercussions of decisions or actions that men take in their relationships.Overall, I enjoyed watching this film and will highly recommend it even if the person is not into watching foreign films."
ROMA,26 February 2019,7/10,"Elegantly directed, scripted, and shot by Alfonso Cuaron, Roma is the director's semi-autobiographical recreation of his childhood in Colonia Roma, Mexico City. Told from the perspective of the family housekeeper, Cleo, the film follows her and her employer's family throughout 1971, an emotionally turbulent year for both the family and for Mexico. While the story is interesting, it's unfortunately often relegated to the second or third most interesting aspect of any scene. Cuaron's cinematography is front-and-center, and deservingly so - it's gorgeous - and his shot composition, which is often comprised of filling the frame so full of characters and tactile movement that you'll actually believe you're watching real people going about their real lives, is also astounding. Yet while the craft behind Roma is certainly impressive, the film's lack of narrative structure results in an overall experience that is more-easily admired than is emotionally-affecting."
ROMA,1 December 2019,8/10,"Roma is the expertly made family drama, crafted together, piece by piece by the impeccable Alfonso Cúaron. The film serves as an account into a day in the life of Cleo (Yalitza Aparaicio), a maid to a middle-class Mexican family.
Roma is crowned by a wonderful sense of passion in the voice of its director, Cúaron. The sense of personality is felt strongly as much of Roma's account is drawn from inspiration of Cúaron's actual life.
In addition to directing Roma, Cúaron writes it very unconventionally and innovativley, and shoots it skilfully, beautifully using a wide range of excellent long takes and shots, and filming it entirely in black and white for even greater effect.
All around the level of effort is exhibited delightfully by the cast, most notably Yalitza Aparicio who, in a debut acting performance, impresses delightfully with a performance that exhibits a strong sense of emotion without the effort of Aparicio even having to execute much dialogue, she conveys and translates her feelings simply through mannerisms, facial expressions, and body language.
Roma also makes beautiful usage of its sound design, cleverly and loudly embracing the most unnoticeable background noises, and features stunning, effort-driven production design too.
The progression of time throughout the film isn't shown quite as clearly as it could be, however, Roma worked wonderfully for me, both in its craft and how deeply it effected me on a more personal surface."
ROMA,12 July 2019,8/10,"Emotional - a film about human fragility midst social and political turmoil. My favorite aspects of the film were the performances, cinematography, and the slow pace (which allowed you to more fully absorb the visuals). Highly recommend watching it."
ROMA,14 January 2019,4/10,"As a film buff enjoying a good landmark film, I was intrigued by Cuaron's attempt into creating an art-house film which is unusual for this director used to blockbuster films.
Given the high imdb rating for Roma and its supposed universal critical acclaim from professional film critics, I decided to give this movie a try... By the end of the film, I just felt numb and swindled by the people who gave this movie such high marks.
ROMA in many ways reflect our changing and decaying times, not in terms of the content of the movie itself which does portray a decaying Mexico city in the 70s, but with regards to the polarization of our society and in this case, the strange disparity of the ratings and reviews on the movie and its even more confounding universal acclaim among movie critics from the media - Note that most reviews are either 9-10 out of 10 or 1 to 5 out of 10 on imdb.
Cinematographically, it is well shot with many long tracking or gimbal shots, framed with a masterful intent and the B&W works well to a certain extent, though nothing out of the ordinary in terms of cinematography that we haven't before: Slices of an upper-middle class Mexican family life in the 70s and the mundanity of the trials and tribulations going thru their lives and that of their servants interspersed with the larger societal upheavals of Mexico city at the time.
Storytelling wise, it is really one of the dullest and most pointless slices of life ever portrayed with such great cinematography disguised as some sort of hommage to the director's childhood.
Chantal Ackerman's Jeanne Dielman - a movie about a lonely widow doing her daily chores - strikes me as a similar film with a very low budget and yet very little camera moves that is way more powerful and effective in conveying drama. Bela Tarr's powerful movies with long tracking shots such as Satantango also convey so much more than this dull exercise by Cuaron yet feel similar in style.
Don't get me wrong, I do like quite a few of Cuaron's movies such as Y Tu Mama Tambien, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban or Children of Men for what they are, as varied in style and form as they are. But here, I am baffled as to why ROMA gets such high praise.
In the end, I feel that ROMA reflects the times we live in, the unbearably mundane ways with which movies are released and reviewed by the media professionals and reviewers online whereby creating universal acclaim out of some of the worst movies while ignoring worthwhile great shows/films.
ROMA as an exercise of style and form over content is decent, however as a film, it is one that is unbearably hard to praise.
The main reason I feel it is worth watching is because decades from now, I think we will look back and use this movie as one of the finest examples of our decadent culture and the decaying influence of our media. ROMA's universal critical acclaim is the perfect reflection with how empty our society has become, whereby social media influencers are the most sought after workforce in society, whereby futile movies such as ROMA represent the finest of our independent filmmaker's spirit... as other reviewers said, our hollywood emperors no longer have clothes anymore..."
ROMA,5 June 2019,8/10,"Wow, I never thought I would see a movie with that cinematography again, that slow pacing like from an observer. No hectic of modern movies, no dramaturgy for the sake of pushing a plot.
The camera acts just like an observer to watch the lives of the spectators, the up and downs in their lives like a documentary without a narrator.
The last time I saw such simplistic but refreshing camera work was from movies from Akira Kurosawa, especially in the post war Japan.This kind of slice of life story telling got really rare these days, especially since the internet age were everything got accelerated and feels pushed, forced.
To appreciate this movie you do need empathy and patience and not expect to be entertained in any way. You go on a ride with Cleo and the household she lives and works in and that's it, period.
I felt with her all the time and felt almost sad as the credits started to roll as she and the household grew on me during the movie.
If you have trouble with the pacing of the movie, try to see it in chunks. But I think it is worth watching it. It was delightful to find such a movie like this as I do miss Kurosava very much and find that Alfonso Cuarón would make Kurosave proud with the quite similar style.
I look forward to see more from Sr. Cuarón."
ROMA,24 February 2019,10/10,"Roma was beautiful. So appreciate that an actual Indian actress was employed. -Yes, it's undertood that white/gringo people prefer the media's nomer, ""Native American"" - but Indians don't.Anyway, Re ROMA: Appreciate Alfonso Cuarón so much more after this movie, and cheered when he won ""Best Foreign Film"" for ROMA at the Independant Spirit Awards tonight.
Hope this movie wins Best Movie AND Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards tmw night. oK - and Best Cinematography."
ROMA,1 March 2019,1/10,"The ONLY reason we decided to watch a black and white movie with subtitles was due to the awards received. The ONLY reason we watched until the end was due to the awards, thinking that certainly it will improve. It's SO slow moving that anything that seems like it might turn dramatic, like a tire rolling over dog pooh, had us anticipating some kind of major drama. But it was just a shot of a tire rolling over dog pooh. That's basically how the whole movie goes. Mexico is so beautiful and colorful, not filming in color was a huge mistake.The dark video and very poor audio meant we were basically just reading a story while trying to decipher which character was talking.If this movie is worthy of any award, the movie industry is in very sad shape."
ROMA,23 January 2019,5/10,"After reading and listening to rave reviews of this movie, I decided to watch it, and respectfully admit I was so bored the first 10 minutes, I exited Netflix. But I gave it and me another chance days later and resumed watching. I know nothing about cinematography or any other aspects of movie making, so there's a very good chance that all that expertise fell on deaf ears and blind eyes. It was an ok movie; nothing spectacular. What I did find charming was the loving relationship between the main actress and the ""kids."" The way she tenderly put them to bed and awoke them in the morning was special. Other than that, so so. One thing that irritated me was that the subtitles were in white, and they went up against a black and white and gray movie, sometimes making it difficult to read. I wish everyone associated with Roma my very best wishes and congratulations."
ROMA,9 January 2019,5/10,"After 48 minutes I had to make a decision - weather or not to spend another 90 minutes seeing this film out, after all, it won the Golden Lion in Venice, Is in the favourites list for an Oscar, it is critically acclaimed. I wasn't hating it, it's just that I felt I would have enjoyed rerunning Arrested Development, Archer, The Good Place, or any amount of stuff on Netflix and got more out of it. Call me chicken (Cacaw, cacaw), but I was dreading reading overwhelming positive reviews telling me what a phillistine I was. Like other touted films over the last few years, If you liked Boyhood and Moonlight you will love this. But I didn't, perhaps it strikes a chord with some, but this kind of film is not as extraordinary as the life which we are a part of. Story and characters are the thing, and no amount of cinematography can make up for lack of them."
ROMA,27 February 2019,9/10,"Camera focuses on the floor, while Cleo starts cleaning up. We keep on staring down, while water starts covering the ground. Gradually, the overhead view of floor tiles reveals the reflection of the sky in the water. A plane is passing through it. You can almost imagine yourself on your knees, staring down, unable to look up. You can only see the sky as a reflection in almost still water, while cleaning up dog waste.In my humble opinion, the floor symbolizes the hard everyday life of the indigenous Mexican woman. Some have stated that it can also be a metaphor of life on earth (p.s. covered in faecal matter), while the plane symbolizes heaven. My interpretation is that the passing plane represents Cleo's dreams and ambitions; the woman she aspires to be. It doesn't necessarilly have to be something particularly grand. It can just be a desire to be loved and treated equally (as a maginalized native Mexican living in the early 70s, this is actually everything she could have ever asked for).Now, let's try to compare this magnificent sequence to the closing shot: Cleo climbs the stairs, while camera points to the sky, which we can now see directly. Our point of view makes it seem like Cleo can raise her hand and touch the plane that is once again passing through. These two sequences shine as a masterpiece on their own.Roma's images had so much more to say than a conventional voiceover would ever come remotely close to. Yet, some chose to give them a blank stare. What a waste. I mean, it's perfectly understandable when you're used to bad sreenplays that impose the films message upon viewers. But a picture is worth a thousand words, and Roma's rich black and white images are works of art that convey many different themes in the most efficient possible way.Roma is a fresh take on the genre of neorealism, and at the same time a trully unique coming of age film; a maturing process towards the fullness (and the full understanding) of someone's existence. Its narrative works in three different dimensions: It's the maturation of an indigenous woman; the maturation of a middle class family during the parents' divorce; and finally, the maturation of a whole nation (Corpus Christi massacre). Pain, suffering, loss and big emotions are the key to this process taking place.This film is, hands down, the greatest cinematic achievement of the year. It's crazy (and at the same time not surprising at all) to think that it lost Best Picture to the epitome of an ""Oscar bait"" movie (""Green Book""). Academy still has a long way to go in order to reach maturity; not unlike the average viewer (just give some imdb user reviews a go and you will understand)."
ROMA,5 February 2019,7/10,I've watched many drama genre movies over the years but believe me none of them is as boring as this one. Don't get me wrong but this movie is so f*cking hard to watch because it's so boring and that commentary is will make you kill yourself. it has a good story but I know a lot of people would come to watch this movie only because it has the most oscar nominations. I won't say don't watch this movie but if you have this much patience. even after my honest review? then go ahead and watch it!
ROMA,16 December 2018,1/10,"A Big snob piece of trash, so bad and so absurdly bad that it makes clear how Netflix continues losing credibility. this is a photographic project nothing more."
ROMA,26 September 2019,9/10,"Like watching a moving art piece. A stunning and engaging portrayal of the trials and tribulations of everyday mundane tasks and in general everyday life. With minimal in depth dialogue, the director turned such normality of life into beauty. Also great to see a snippet of the 70s in Mexico."
ROMA,8 February 2019,5/10,"Great cinematografy, beautiful shots...but at the end of the film.. all i kept thinking was... how does one dog manage to deficate so much in such a short time?.."
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,"A 70s period family story that masterfully melts together dramas of the upper class and the servants, women and men, all in the social microcosm of a Mexican family and macrocosm of the political turmoil of the era."
ROMA,8 January 2019,5/10,"I found it boring, but I understand, why got the Golden Globe. The directing is good and the cinematography is amazing. At the first time when I started to watch the movie remind me old Italian movies, like Fellini or neo-modern Italian and a little bit like European movies, like Eastern-European. If you like these classics you might be like this movie too.
The storyline pretty boring, the whole movie kind of negative. The characters are lovely, I didn't find any character I can relate. The main character just a girl, nothing else and the story did not add anything new to the character, which you saw many times, maybe the family loves her, which I never see before.
Roma about normal, ordinary people who live their life their own way."
ROMA,20 January 2019,10/10,I went into this movie skeptical of all the hype and prepared myself for a pretentious and dull art house piece. I could not have been more wrong. It is such a beautiful and engaging film. There is no real narrative so you're basically a voyeur watching a period of the maid and the family's lives unfold - the mundane and compelling events intertwined in such a realistic unscripted sort of way that you feel as if you're living it with them. It's a visual and technical masterpiece in its simple authenticity. I love when a film surprises me and this one certainly did. I recommend it highly.
ROMA,6 March 2019,7/10,"Difficult lives in rough times. Roma is a powerful, quiet movie that depicts the hard conditions of a family's maid. There's pain, sadness, tranquility and most important kindness and love. Without a fancy soundtrack and even colour, this movie takes us on a ride of simplicity. Thank you, Alfonso Cuarón!"
ROMA,3 December 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuaron's last film was quite literally out of this world yet his latest effort brings him back to Earth but with a story no less epic and profound. Roma is partly based on the director's life but is told through the eyes of the nanny/maid, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), whose experiences reveal the extent of classism and racism in 1970s Mexico.It's been almost 18 years since Cuaron made a film in his native language but he felt the time was right to return to his mother tongue and craft a revealing tale of class and racial struggle. The film is told through Cleo's (based on Cuaron's real maid, Lido) eyes and this unique way of telling the story gives the film a special insight into social issues in Mexico. Nanny/maid characters in films are usually bit parts in films, seen frequently but heard speaking only fleetingly. Cleo is always on hand to tend to the families every need, yet she is always on the outside. She is loved but never fully treated as part of family as she is ordered to do things only a servant would (it is always very uncomfortable when this happens).This is evident simply in how her treatment in plain for all to see. Cleo (and her co-worker) stays in a separate part of the house that's vastly different to the luxurious brightly lit interiors of the main house. Whether the entire family are together, she's always on the side whether its kneeling on the floor whilst the family watch tv or standing, nearly out of frame, as the others sit on bench eating an ice cream. That's not to say the family are uncaring or dismissive of her, the kids revere her greatly but her race and class separates her from truly belonging in the household.As we see the world through Cleo's eyes all these things become glaringly obvious even if the camera simply observes (like a ghost from the past as Cuaron said) life happening before it. As we see the world through Cleo's eyes we see her heartbreak, her pain and suffering in her most testing times (the most traumatic being the scene shortly following The Corpus Christi Massacre). Not only that we get a vital look at prejudice from someone who at the centre of it. Spending so much time with her, it's easy to notice the subtlest of prejudices. Oaxaca born Yalitza Aparicio restrained and moving performance is one of heart-breaking quiet poignancy as she provides a voice for the disenfranchised.Working on his first feature film since Prisoner of Azkaban without his regular cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki (if you can't get Lubezki you may as well do it yourself), Cuaron forgoes the long handheld take technique of Children of Men and the exciting fluidity of Gravity and instead adopts a slow panning technique that resembles a casual observer. Much like Tokyo Story, Cuaron's camera simply observes the family unit, taking a non-judgemental and objective view of upper middle class of Mexico thereby allowing the viewer to notice the subtle elements of racism without ever explicitly mentioning them.That said, Roma is not without its visual flourishes. The beautiful black and white cinematography transport us to the hustle and bustle of Roma region of Mexico City. The long, tracking shots reveal so much about the film's setting, taking us into the world inhabited by Cleo. The sound design allows us to experience the world in which the film is set. The chaos of Mexico City, the honking of horns and roar of plane engines above (hinting at an unreachable faraway world) makes the city feel alive and more than just a distant memory.The most important aspect of the film is that it gives a voice to the voiceless and oppressed. It was only when Cuaron began to ask Lido (the maid on which the story is based) about her life that he began to recognise her as a real person with a life outside the home. These talks were perhaps as revealing and eye opening to Cuaron as the film Roma is to us. Understated and moving, Roma is a slow-moving film where, for a while, seemingly nothing happens but it's one that rewards a patient viewer with a highly emotional experience."
ROMA,5 January 2019,3/10,"Poor character development, poor writing, no characters to like or hate, boring and overly hyped. Don't waste your time on this long, though well-photographed, banal flop."
ROMA,14 December 2018,9/10,This film started out making me feel that this is gonna be different. After 1hour of progression i felt the cinematography is top notch and surely gonna be a masterpiece in critic point of view. The next 1hour of the film is so painful and emotional with intense shots. The long shots are handled so well and you dont even notice the background score isn't in this film because such films can be affecting you emotionally without any background score.
ROMA,12 June 2019,10/10,"Roma is probably one of the movies that anger me it's not on the top 250 along with my favorite movie of all time JFK. This was nominated for 10 Oscars including best picture (won 3 including Best Director) and was universally acclaimed by critics. Yet, this movie doesn't make it into the top 250 where a bunch of Bollywood musicals make it in. Yes this movie requires you to have a taste for experimental art house films, but there is no excuse why this is not in the top 250. Out of this year's Best Picture nominees this is the most beautifully made film that truly deserved Academy attention.Roma perhaps is the most successful experimental film ever made. Many film makers failed to deliver realism on screen, but here Alfonso Cuaron truly delivers. Dogma 95, an artistic movement started by Lars Von Trier tried to bring realism to screen by using hand held cameras and decreasing the quality of the editing as much as possible. Though I have never seen his movies it is pretty clear from the trailers of his movies that this is not working at all since Dogma 95 films, or all Von Trier films in general seem to just be shot purposefully bad rather than being realistic. But here Cuaron delivers realism in the screen masterfully through the sound. There is such detail in the sound from the sound of the water dripping, the noisy streets, the waves it feels like being suck into the screen. Through out the film I was just locked in not because of the plot but because of these attention of details in sound. This all makes this film succeed artistically where no film in the past ever has been, and gave me a very unique beautiful experience.Not only is the sound phenomenal but in general this is a movie that is perfectly crafted. You can see Cuaron paying attention to every single detail possible. As I mentioned a paragraph earlier, there is perfect attention to sound in this film to achieve the artistic goal of realism. The same can be said with the plot. Cuaron finds every single detail that can be found in daily life. Not a lot of significant events happen in the movie in the first half of the movie, and Cuaron takes advantage of that. You can see Cuaron showing his artistic ability portraying daily family life and struggles masterfully. This is why when there is a important plot point in the middle of the movie you actually feel like actually being there because Cuaron made us sucked into the screen like we are part of the movie in the first half using realism. The climax of the movie in the beach is very powerful because of the establishment of realism in the first half. You can feel the experience the characters are having, the emotions they are having in the beach like actually being there. How Cuaron created a story that makes audiences get sucked into the screen is truly a cinematic achievement. The performances are all just perfect from the leads to even the child actors. It is not neccesarily the type of performance that will be remembered forever, but they're performance playing characters like ordinary people plays a big part on achieving this phenomenal experience. This is exactly why Roma can be described by only one word; perfection.Overall this is a phenomenal movie that deserves every single praise it is receiving. Regardless whether you like art house films or big blockbusters you will have a unforgettable beautiful experience. Cuaron will suck you into the screen with each beautifully shot sequences and a plot that is perfectly crafted. Though I don't give a lot of these out, I rate this a 10/10. I suggest you check this right away if you have a Netflix account. If you don't, do whatever you can to watch this masterpiece."
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,"Roma is a breathtaking masterpiece. I had been waiting to watch this movie for two reasons: the first was that I've been following the award season coverage and knew that Roma would be a mayor player this season; the second was that Alfonso Cuarón is one of the leading Mexican directors in the industry and me being Mexican I was dying to see a film that reflected the culture of this country.
The movie follows the life of a Mexican domestic helper who has a special bond with the family she works with. The main thing about the movie is how beautiful and cinematic it is. This is a deeply personal and intimate story, and the cinematography by Alfonso Cuarón captures that and more. I was a little worried the film being black and white, but the end result I can only continue to describes as beautiful.
The story itself was slow pacing, but that's the reason why the movie works so well. It's a slow burn that just keeps going until you realize you deeply care for our main character. The way the story builds is a really great way of Alfonso Cuarón showcasing how perfectly he can construct a story.
Unfortunately, the city where I live in had no theatre showings so I saw it on my tv. This is quality filmmaking at its best, and if your have the chance to see it on a theatre you definitely should grab the chance. Alfonso Cuarón has continued to show how much of a master he is with a camera and I can't wait to see what he does next."
ROMA,8 March 2019,10/10,"Gorgeously filmed in auteur vintage black-and-white with cultural vibrancy & a powerful elegiac critique of 1970's Mexico turmoil on a personal Cuarón semi-autobiographical scale, Roma is one of the decade's greatest films. 9.7/10....Review: Absolute brilliance. Cuarón has done it again with a poetic, moving semi-autobiographical take on what he saw growing up in the tumultuous social and political time of his homeland. The visual style and groundbreaking technical work is breathtaking and unprecedented, lifting long-unseen camera profiles from panning to long-tracking shots straight out of film textbooks, as well as crisp cinematography cleverly playing on juxtapostitions of extreme orderliness and balance in everything down to the floor patterns to the chaos of the time, boosted by the decision to go vintage Golden Hollywood-feeling gorgeous black-and-white sleek with auteurism and film history appreciation. The cultural vibrancy of the location and time-period, as well as the fact it's a Foreign Language film through and through even forcing non-Spanish speakers to watch through subtitles (as most non-Americans worldwide have to do for Hollywood); it's extremely refreshing and creates an escapism and authentic glimpse into the Mexican heritage and diversity in every brushstroke by Cuarón. The personal, Greek tragedy-like, emotionally-resonant, and intimate family-centered storytelling set against the backdrop of this massive-scale political and social turmoil (with horrifying protest/disaster scenes), is incredible too and well-set in its later payoffs, bolstered by some *brilliant* performances led by indigenous and star-making Yalitza Aparicio as poor Cleo, Marina de Tavira as Sofi, and Jorge Guerro as the downright evil Fermín. Despite an overlong single-shot opening credits sequence, somewhat finality-lackluster closing shot, and bizarre penchant to for indulging negative (and untrue) stereotypes like the bad female driver and absent father (included twice for good measure! Is it really a modern Hollywood film if they don't take a few generalizing jabs at men *sigh*), these are minuscule, overlookable gripes in what is otherwise an absolutely BRILLIANT film. Easily the best film of 2018, as well as one of the best of the decade.Overall Rating: 9.7/10"
ROMA,10 January 2019,10/10,I found this utterly stunning. The visual storytelling is incredible. The gentle camerawork is sumptuous and I was drawn into the emotion of the world - caring for the characters to the point of crying & laughing with them. Cuarón again delivers huge set pieces on another level. I hope this Film wins every award going!
ROMA,10 January 2019,1/10,Don't waste your time in this. Beautiful but empty
ROMA,21 February 2019,10/10,A stunningly beautiful cinematic masterpiece. A heart-wrenching and heartwarming story of love and family.
ROMA,22 February 2019,7/10,"To mind mind, this film did not live up to the hype. The story is a year in the life of a Mexican family in 1971. Bad things happen to different members of the household, and they pull through because of the empathy they have for each other. Excellent black and white photography. I saw it in a proper theatre with 7.1 surround sound and the sound is extraordinary, creating a 360 degree ambience of the world it is showing. It should get an Oscar for Best Sound Design or Editing."
ROMA,16 December 2018,1/10,"Pure Dog Crap!
No matter how many overused dolly shots, it's still Dog Crap!
Obvious marketing attempt to create a path as Oscar material.
The only way this film could be considered Oscar material, is if the Dog's name was changed to Oscar.Viewer beware where you step!"
ROMA,23 January 2019,8/10,"This film starts as if in slow motion and very little seems to happen as we observe the mundane actions of a young woman. I did wonder if I was going to stay the course. Gradually the pace picks up and draws you in to the daily life of the young woman who we learn is the maid, and the life of the family she works for. The ups and downs of life are in this chaotic city are well conveyed with the ordinary and the dramatic side by side. Beautifully shot with every frame counting it has heart and soul and is very moving at times. If it has a weakness it is a lack of narrative drive, it is essentially anecdotal but gripping none the less if you allow yourself to be drawn into this world."
ROMA,25 February 2019,10/10,"1. The MemoriesRoma is set in the early 1970s following a young domestic worker living in the middle-class neighborhood of Roma, Mexico City.Oscar-winner director Alfonso Cuarón (Children of Men, Gravity) takes us on a deeply personal journey in an autobiographical ode to his childhood, and to the women who reared him.""Eighty to ninety percent of the scenes represented in the film are scenes taken out of my memory,"" Cuarón said during a Directors Guild of America interview, ""sometimes directly, sometimes a bit more obliquely.""2. The CharactersJust as the memories are real, so are the characters, including Cleo, played to perfection by Yalitza Aparicio, who had no previous acting experience. Cleo is a fictionalised version of the Cuarón family's live-in-maid Liboria ""Libo"" Rodríguez.Cuarón embarked on a painstaking search through countless villages in Mexico auditioning thousands of women for the role. When he met Aparicio, who is from the same small town as Libo, his search was over.3. The Corpus Christi MassacreCuarón draws on his childhood amidst political turmoil of the 1970s, most notably the devastating Corpus Christi massacre of 1971. Soldiers and police disguised as civilians opened fire on thousands of high school and university student demonstrators killing over 120 people.4. The MasculinityIn many movies being made right now men seem to be suffering from a form of toxic masculinity syndrome - a disorder associated with brutal, abusive behaviour, with tendencies to lie, cheat, and often drink too much, ultimately letting everyone and themselves down.Roma serves as a testament to the women who raised Cuarón who are left to pick up the pieces after being betrayed by the men in their lives.5. The CinematographyAlong with directing the picture, Cuarón wrote the screenplay and also helmed the cinematography.Due to a scheduling conflict Cuarón's go-to guy, and three-time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, who has worked with him on almost every film he has made, was unavailable, leading Cuarón to step into the role himself.This decision ended up being hugely beneficial to the creative process and the result is stunning.6. The SimplicityThere are plenty of high-impact parts throughout: a blazing forest fire; an earthquake; violent street riots; and an unsettling seaside scene.But it's the softer scenes that say so much. Cuarón has a talent of making the ordinary seem extraordinary: soapy water sloshing across a courtyard; a plane reflected in a puddle; laundry swaying on a clothesline.These moments of magic seem like a dream - these memories of one of the greatest directors of our time.7. The ScoreThere isn't really a score as such, the soundtrack to Cuarón's latest opus is made up of an occasional song drifting in and out of a radio or stereo, the rumble of city streets, cars vrooming, people babbling, waves crashing, fireworks, rifles, dogs... the sound design is instrumental to the experience allowing us to completely immerse ourselves into this world."
ROMA,27 January 2019,5/10,"I understand why this movie is getting so much attention. Beautiful cinematography and artistic qualities and all that. But lordy it was as sloooowww as a snail. I felt like I kept waiting for something that never happened. The dog kept pooping and pooping all over the place and no one was bothering to scoop it up, and yet all I could do throughout the film was worry that something bad was going to happen to this bouncy, poopy pooch! Glad I watched this film just to see what all the fuss was about. Wasn't a complete waste of time. Best Picture Oscar? Not a chance. But worth watching...once."
ROMA,14 April 2019,10/10,"Roma is a great movie that speaks to the power of memory and childhood experiences. It brilliantly manages to place extremely intimate details of family life within the context of contemporary historical events and thus addresses issues of gender, ethnicity, and class that, although specific to Mexican society are also evident in other complex societies, including the U.S.Those who claim to be bored by it are simply too socialized into the fast and cheap movie making that is much too common nowadays. Please be more careful about your watching habits and what you select to view. Read the fine print and don't unfairly inflict your uninformed ratings and commentaries on the rest of us. It's particularly unfair to the filmmaker as you drag the ratings down and misinform potential viewers. This is a masterpiece and should be treated as such."
ROMA,7 January 2019,8/10,"Let's start by the actors: although they're unknown I thought their interpretation was very solid and transparent.
The movie is all black and white, which is a very bold move and the plot is awesome and very well constructed.
It has an atmosphere that gets you in it and convinces you of what's happening at that time and you really feel empathy for the characters.
And I finish with the photography, even being almost the whole movie inside the house it still has a great photography, always using the landscape point of view. Love it!"
ROMA,11 January 2021,3/10,All the camera panning made me dizzy. I had to look away. Doesn't anyone know how to hold a camera still anymore?
ROMA,16 November 2018,1/10,"I just wasted more than 2 hours of my life watching this horrid vanity project about nothing with way way way too many panning shots. Boring doesn't begin to encapsulate this insulting ""film"". Don't get it twisted, I am not a a Hollywood blockbuster film watcher. I'd rather see an indi film, foreign film, low budget anything than sit through anything with pyrotechnics. But this story of a maid and the family she serves, should have never even got past the, ""WTF were you thinking?"" phase after a first draft script reading. The acting is great but how burdensomely dull is it's content. Slow and wandering are not great adjectives when describing a story but perfect for this bland picture about characters that never get to a point where you care at all what is happening to them. I've never wanted to walk out before a movie was over before, but I ran out of the theater when it finally was. This is a failure in every aspect. Zero stars."
ROMA,5 January 2019,2/10,In a word: boring. In two words: very boring. No reason to watch unless you are into black and white cinematography.
ROMA,16 November 2019,2/10,"Despite looking amazing this is perhaps the dullest film I've ever sat through. Unlike the sluggish narrative and languid camera work of Tarkovsky, this has no pay off or hidden reveal. There is no prize for sitting it out until the end.
It's dull."
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"Those who make bad reviews simply dont understand film. Roma is amazing, from the start and everything. The basis is not only the story but also art just like in La La Land and Cold War, while there are techniques of camera and shots and the way the movie goes that reminds the way old movies were made (those of Bergman, Ozu etc) with great work from director. Everything is almost perfect, we see a city of 1970 with cars and houses of its time, scenes that are too many to remember, soundtracs that never stop, cinematography that bring works in the whole movie, things that were happening like protest of students and them being killed, what Cuaron has probably seen in that time, and after all it is also about a family, the story goes on while we see dialogues and events of real life, making it a kind if Boyhood. Im comparing it with many great movies because I saw many of them in Roma. Its a masterpiece of Mexico and Hollywood is not being able to bring movies like this today. Sadly Roma will likely stop at best foreign due to Oscar politics."
ROMA,18 March 2020,9/10,"Roma. A movie with flawless performances by all the actors. I was astonished to quite an extent when I read that the actress who played Cleo, the central character was a debutant. Her performance stands out. At various scenes in the movie, she nails her expressions to perfection. Alfonso Cuaron, the man, deserves all the credit. He directed the film, wrote the screenplay and was the cinematographer. The cinematography was beautiful! So was the screenplay. Roma definitely is meant to be a slow, character driven film filled with many scenes which are heartwarming. During many scenes, I found myself praising Alfonso Cuaron for the extent to which this film feels real. Of course, the entire movie is in black and white and I can say it affects the film in a good way. The music is beautiful too. Overall, after watching Roma, I find myself developing a growing interest in international films and also slow films. However, I'd like to mention that slow cinema isn't everybody's cup of tea. People may find it boring since there's not much of a plot which I don't think it's bad. But if you're a fan of character driven films, go watch Roma. One of the best films of 2018 easily."
ROMA,2 June 2019,9/10,"The only word that describes this film is a masterpiece
The emotion overwhelmed me completely"
ROMA,18 January 2019,8/10,"There is little doubt as to the how this film looks - the black and white cinematography is beautiful and the many tracking shots and widescreen photography really help to evoke the atmosphere and location of the film. This certainly helps as the film takes its time establishing the central character, her day-to-day routines and the relationships around her. The documentary feel of the film and the observational nature of the camera at times keeps the audience at arm's length from the central character, in much the same way that the family appears to do, especially in the first half of the film, but this gives way to a much more involving second half, as plot points and events build to some highly difficult and emotional moments."
ROMA,14 May 2019,8/10,"It's not riveting or engrossing or thrilling, but it feels honest and grounded. More than any other movie I've seen, this movie just felt like life to me. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I keep thinking about it. It's like it has burrowed into my soul and taken up residence."
ROMA,10 July 2019,1/10,"I don't understand what's really the point of this movie. Very slow, showing only trivial events. Don't waste two hours of your life with this movie."
ROMA,16 July 2021,10/10,"The beautiful thing is that in the times of blockbusters, we can still see low-budget, breaking patterns and original works of art in the form of films. One of them is Cuáron's Roma."
ROMA,29 December 2020,7/10,"I would give it 10 since the artistic point of view, bur the plot is weak and could have happened in 90 minutes or less. Not a movie to watch again."
ROMA,1 October 2021,2/10,Don't know what all the fuss is about. Very boring. And I'm a big fan of Mexican culture.
ROMA,9 January 2021,2/10,Politically correct boring movie made for Americans.
ROMA,28 March 2019,5/10,"I'm Argentinean. I've seen stories like this my whole life, even my parents split up 3 times and got back together. I've seen inequality and house help with rich people. And rich people were not understanding, and in the 70s things were much worst. So the filming is great, photography is awesome, the acting is splendid (really all the emotions were great) and the historical context is well written. But the plot and the end lack of strength. And they are the main elements of a movie. Cuarón said it himself: it's written from his own memories. And feels that way: it's like trying to fit pieces from different puzzles. So watch it if you want to take off the doubts. But you won't get a film to remember. And certainly doesn't deserve so many nominations."
ROMA,29 January 2019,10/10,"Let me start out by saying that Roma (2018) is something that I feel I've never experienced before. I've seen many personal films but this one isn't just personal. Sr. Cuarón here gives a glimpse into his heart, and transports us into a universe of feeling that envelopes the viewer in such a way that you can't help but watch.Roma is easily one of the most beautiful films of the last twenty years. Everything about it is nearly impeccable: the direction, the cinematography, the editing, the set design, the acting, the story. It all comes together to give us a glimpse into something we all take for granted: life. We are brought into the life of a simple maid of a middle class Mexican family who is simply living right in front of our eyes. I see many low ratings and reviews here stating that the film was ""boring"" and ""had no story"". Those of you who wrote these reviews obviously do not have a true grasp on the art of cinema. What makes seeing movies so great is being able to see life as it happens and to relate to the characters on screen and what happens to them. Roma does this tremendously. The story is deceptively simple, and yet you feel as if you are watching an epic sprawl out before you.Alfonso Cuarón has outdone himself here. Putting every fiber of his being into this motion picture. In every frame you see a glimpse of him and the experiences he has had in life. One thing I appreciated immensely was his choice to do the film in black and white as it gave the film timelessness that really made you feel as if you were watching someone's life play out right before you. That and his choice of camera work. The long extended scenes that allowed you to take everything in, every detail. It's breathtaking.Now I must comment on the acting which, as an aspiring actor, is my favorite part of any film. Here it is one of the things that elevates the film to a masterpiece. Yalitza Aparicio, an unknown before this film, here delivers one of the most astonishingly human performances I've ever seen on film. You can see every emotion she feels written on her face, to the point where she doesn't have to say anything to convey what she's feeling. It's a tremendous performance that deserves to be seen by everyone who can see it. And of course, we can't leave out Marina de Tavira. Her performance is one of the films most startling. You see this film is essentially about two women. The story is focused on Cleo, we see everything through her eyes and experiences. And this is how we see Sra. Sofía. She is essentially in the background most of the time. But de Tavira's performance reveals so much. Little by little, we are shown a broken and abandoned woman. A mother who is simply trying to keep her family together, and pick herself back up in the process. It's a subtly heartbreaking performance, and has easily become one of my favorite performances by an actress this year.I can't heap enough praise on this film, so I'll just say this: if you have an appreciation for great cinema, see this film. Because I promise you, it's one of the most immersive and emotionally astounding films you'll ever see."
ROMA,23 March 2019,9/10,"First of all...some of the people who rated this movie 1 or 2...they should stick to Avengers and Marvel's or similar.This movie has SO many vantage points. One can be Cleo (obviously the main anchor of the movie) Or Mrs. Sofie (anchor of the family) or the Kids (anchor of the life in the movie) 9r the Husband (anchor of an enigma... deliberately shown)Then you have Mexico in '71...another Vantage point as a backdrop all the time....keeping you always on the tenterhooks.Soooooo many of vantage points this movie has. You can see from either of the side, and enjoy equallySo if you want to enjoy life for so many point of views... peacefully...watch this movie."
ROMA,26 January 2019,1/10,"Show cares about neorealism in the 21st century, which even does not have a plot and character development. The movie sucks!!!!!!!!"
ROMA,7 February 2019,4/10,"Roma is the kind of movie that only a movie critic can truly enjoy. I think most of us can see it is immaculately shot and directed well, but it's difficult to care because it moves at a glacial pace. It feels like the director made this movie for himself and not for the audience - I found it tedious to sit through to the end. I was hoping that it would pick up the pace, but sadly that never happened."
ROMA,23 January 2019,4/10,"Maybe you need to like families and babies to really connect with this film. I don't and maybe that's why it didn't resonate with me at all. Now, I'm a huge fan of Baraka and Samsara where not a single word of dialogue is spoken yet the imagery on-screen absolutely captivates you. Roma is similar in that, well, not a whole lot of anything happens. There is dialogue, there is some drama occasionally, but, for the most part there's absolutely nothing happening. To give you an idea, the film starts with 4 minutes of watching water on the floor. I kept thinking ""maybe there will be some profound moment, even just a single line of dialogue, where this all comes together for me"" and, for me at least, that never happened.I am giving this four stars though, because the craftsmanship behind this film is absolutely phenomenal. Cinematography, sound, editing. The film is marvelous in those aspects. But that's quite simply not enough to make a 2 hr 15 minute film worthwhile.The overwhelmingly glowing praise for this film has me wondering if people actually liked it that much or if they're more akin to the art exhibit patrons lining the block in ""Exit Through the Gift Shop""."
ROMA,8 December 2018,10/10,"It's cold out, and my lips are trembling - I place my hand on my cheek to conceal the tear rolling down my face. a nice little old lady stares at me at the traffic light. I give her a nod and a smile, and then she looks away. I am absolutely fine; ROMA did this to me.as I grapple for the words to express how I feel, I can't help but look back to how this all came to be. how I've longed to see this movie, how I've read every critic review, how I promised myself to see it in theatre - all of this, yet not knowing what to expect.but Alfonso Cuarón has not made a movie. he's carefully crafted an experience; one filled with love, and grief, hope and betrayal; one filled with reality and truth. and he's invited us in, with his hands over our eyes, like a mother leading her child to a surprise.following the end credits, I breathed a deep sigh, thankful that I experienced this in the theatre - not only is it a gorgeously visual experience, it's auditory quality is gracious and lush. there's little to no music, but that is deliberate - you feel every sound (in 4K atmos too), carefully designed to immerse you in this world that Alfonso has created, but Yalitza Aparicio has executed, with acting as opulent as it is captivating.maybe it's me being too vulnerable, and I just might be overselling it, but this film is truly in a world of its own.and so I close my eyes. I hear the water crashing against the shore. I see the tears rolling down Cleo's eyes. I taste the salt in her mouth. I feel the sorrow in Sofia's voice. I am absolutely fine; ROMA did this to me."
ROMA,3 April 2020,6/10,"I initially had high hopes for Roma but then saw the huge number of 1/10 reviews. I'm glad I saw them now as they did lower my expectations (not always a bad thing). The film has some glorious camera work, as many have pointed out, and a plot/story that isn't actually as boring as some might have you think, with some rather impressive scenes, however in amongst a solid piece of work are some rather painful self-indulgences (forest scene for one) and a few obvious anachronisms that distract from it. Ultimately it's a film that I cannot recommend but on the other hand I didn't feel that I wasted 150 mins of my life."
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"First off, let's get it straight, this film is NOT black and white-it is grayscale, and no, it's not synonomous. The correct term is grayscale.This is an amazing work of art, not overrated, not overhyped. True to it's astetic and substance. That airplane will just put you in a trance, some faraway thought.There was most definitely a couple of scenes that ripped my heart right out. I will not say which ones, but indubitably a mine field.This is the kind of film you must watch over and over again. You will find treasure each time."
ROMA,13 January 2019,1/10,"Hard to imagine a movie less interesting than watching paint dry, however Roma has managed to top it, no offense to those who can find the excitement found in the evaporation of paint.No doubt an inspiration of art house folk who seem to glean pleasure from more than less common place mundane activity. In fairness though, there are a few redeeming moments - not minutes - of interest in this two hour and fifteen minute experiment in self imposed sleep deprivation.I strongly suggest you take note of reviewers giving this experiment for induced narcolepsy anything above a five, unless you are young AND have plenty of time to waste watching more of their recommendations."
ROMA,24 February 2019,4/10,"I live in Mexico City. I lived pretty close to Colonia Roma where the story unfolds. I lived a lot if the situations depicted in the movie. I have a lot friends who experienced in one way or another vivid aspects captured in the movie. Still, nothing seems plausible enough to make this the movie of our times. It seems like some Hollywood actors and producers want to manifest about what is happening under Trump era in the USA, and Roma is the perfect mean to its end. I have no regret in stating that movies like The Green Book or A star is born, are by far much better, and impecable fifth art demonstrations. Roma...is just a politics manifest in elections year, you know."
ROMA,28 February 2019,1/10,"I'm completely disappointed in this movie. It is literally so boring that I fell asleep during it. How did this win a single award? The black and white just made it worse. This is the biggest let down, all hyped up for nothing."
ROMA,9 April 2019,1/10,"Even If u have no job and have a time to watch this movie listen to me ! don't make this mistake, I usually watch black and white movies And I like kind of slow motion movies but this is so overratted it has no story at all . I won't watch this netflix movie again"
ROMA,5 January 2019,3/10,"It's really intrresting... One of the worst movie i watched in the cinema, but it's average is more than 8... i hardly endure the movie to finish"
ROMA,30 December 2018,10/10,"This movie is superb is so many ways -- in its ambition, its portrayal of human caring and in its cinematic execution. The film was written and directed by Alfonso Cuaron and shot in black and white. It tells the story of an upper middle-class Mexican family and their caring housekeeper-child-care worker Cleo, played by the incomparable Yalitza Aparicio.The acting is amazing, from individual performances to ensemble playing. That said this movie is not for everyone. First, it moves very slowly at times - and then it speeds up dramatically. If you are an impatient movie-watcher (as I am most times), this one is not for you. Basically it tell the tale of a dysfunctional, marriage, the consequences for the children, and how Cleo responds to various challenges. That is a whole lot of short-hand, but I am trying not to reveal much.The way I found enhanced my appreciation of the film is to watch each scene unfold studiously. Observe what is happening in the corners of the frame, especially since it is often shot from a distant view. Something meaningful is always going on, whether it pertains to plot, character development or cinematic beauty.If I found some imperfections in the film, they are these: 1) At Cleo's crisis moment, she could have screamed. This would have added power to her portrayal and to the movie as a whole (even if some would say it would have been out of character). 2) When the mom behaves irresponsibly at the end of the film her state of mind is not sufficiently foreshadowed.Finally, you may wonder: ""Why should I watch this movie?"" My answer is that the character of Cleo is emblematic of many of the world's long-suffering but dedicated and indispensable women. This judgment is not in the sense of a lesson that you must take, but in the sense of a warm human story that is rewarding to watch."
ROMA,7 January 2019,8/10,"Best Drama Movie Of Year!
Different With Everything."
ROMA,19 January 2019,5/10,"Absolutely boring movie, that goes nowhere while showing the uninteresting life of a native-mexican maid working at a white family household. She is to become a single mom, the family is in crisis because of the boss's frequent absence and the stereotypical relationship colonizer-colonized and/or social class gap is portrayed at a very slow pace. You cannot see where the story is going because it is just that: a documentary on the assymetry of social conditions in Mexico. Shallow characters, long pointless shots, little tension, a flat line of facts. Yeah, the direction may be good, for the framing, the photography and the black & white usual expressiveness. But that's pretty much it."
ROMA,2 March 2019,4/10,Great cinematography. Dull film. An important part of story telling is that the protagonist must affect the plot. Here that is not the case and the movie becomes almost unwatchable.
ROMA,26 February 2019,9/10,"Roma, a movie so visually stunning that each scene takes your breath away! I can't explain how entranced I was, how much I cried when I saw the realities of life in a time of political uncertainty. I am in love with this film and don't think I'll ever get over it's beauty."
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"The story is genius, I will hardly forget the movie, being a Mexican, it taught me so much, made me cry and so made me happy to know that such a story deserves my tears, no shame, not at all. Congrats Cuaron, I think that this movie is the perfect example on how to do a beautiful piece of art and help a whole country to get motivated to make progress."
ROMA,5 January 2019,9/10,"Can't say much that hasn't already been said. I love that while the plot is very simple and keeps it very rooted in basic human elements, the setting and cinematography contrasts this with a ghost-like, spacey, and turbulent aesthetic. This film is cold yet warming (it's hard to describe in words but yiu might get it if you've seen Children of Men).If you want a challenge, try watching the whole movie next just watching the background. The work put into set design and choreographing the extras are nothing short of masterful and awesome."
ROMA,30 March 2019,9/10,"The movie started quite slow, at first I thought 'this could be another one of those movies praised by critics but no one else gets?' It soon draws me in, with no music, just stunning cinematography, clever use of sound effects and conversation depicting someone's life events. The emotions this movie has stirred in me was immensely powerful, wave after wave toward the end, and it was not because of any deliberate drama, I was merely invited in, to experience someone else's life moments. I could only marvel at the director's talent.Being a black and white film, you feel like it is a memory, if you pause on any scene it's becomes a LIFE magazine photo from the past.I also love how this movie portrays the strength and compassion of women in their most difficult times."
ROMA,1 October 2019,1/10,"Insipid. After reading user reviews, I believe we all agree that it is boring, useless, and should never have been made. I stopped the film and reread about it, thinking I was somehow mistaken and watching the wrong movie. I knew there was a reason I only view user reviews and not critics. Reading what other watchers saw, whether I agree or not, is what is of interest to me. Often I decide not to watch something if enough people say the same things about it. When a movie is divided into 2 totally differing camps, I will watch it and decide for myself. If I like it so be it and if not, I gave it a chance. When the artsy-fartsy group fawns over its theme as meaningful and profound, it's usually a yawner."
ROMA,26 January 2019,1/10,Super boring movie.. no story.. only cinematography is nice. Avoid. Or fast forward and watch in 10 mins..
ROMA,12 October 2020,,"Not gonna lie this movie was a TASK to finish! I found myself getting so distracted because it was so slow moving and hard to focus on what was happening. But that slow pace is super significant for the theme that Cuarón is going for, and he does an excellent job executing it. You can't watch this movie expecting a wild experience because you'll only be disappointed. It's slow but if you commit, the story is well worth it."
ROMA,12 September 2021,9/10,"The problem with art that requires sophistication to appreciate is that the majority of the recipients are not ready. There is a level of art that is so progressive that it surpasses the masses, leaving them dumbfounded until a foundation is built up to the point where they can not only understand it, but appreciate it. This film is college level physics in a world that barely grasps multiplication. The same people who rate this film a one, would look at a Picasso and say,""my little kid could do that."" This film is a masterpiece of cinema, AKA Malick's ""Tree of Life"" or Frick's ""Samsara"". One of the best films ever made in my opinon."
ROMA,20 January 2019,10/10,"This is one of those films that come along every few years destined to be counted among the all-time greats, like Citizen Kane and The Godfather. The most stunning aspect is the cinematography and the choreography of crowd scenes, and the overall look of the film is breathtaking. The totally sympathetic character Cleo is at the centre of the film, incredible for someone who has never acted before. Two or three set-piece scenes will touch even the hardest heart, and the single 5-minute take of the beach and sea scene is almost unbelievable considering there was no cgi or editing. On third viewing I spotted one tiny detail which I assume deliberate: during the martial-arts training, when the ""Professor"" demonstrates his sense of balance and everybody tries to emulate him, there is just one spectator who manages it. See if you can spot who it is!"
ROMA,19 February 2019,10/10,"Roma deserves all the praise it gets. The cinematography in particular is stunning, like nothing I've seen before. And it's one of those films that, the more you watch it, the more you notice. I've watched it 3 times, and one tiny detail which I spotted was in the martial arts scene with the instructor. When he does his blindfold one-leg performance, and everyone else tries and fails, there is just one person who succeeds, namely Cleo. There's no close-up, and you wouldn't notice if you weren't looking carefully, but it must be deliberate and telling us something about Cleo's character. A truly magnificent film which will undoubtedly become a classic."
ROMA,17 February 2019,2/10,"Because it ends as boring as it begins.
It's pretentious rubbish and wouldn't be nominated for a single award if it wasn't in black and white. To be honest a score of 2 is a bit generous."
ROMA,14 December 2018,6/10,"Roma are the memories of a year (1970-1971) in the youth of filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron when he show us a representation of the everyday in his house located in the Roma colony after his father decide to leave his family and with a special attention in Cleo's point of view and her future pregnant situation. Cuarón give us a very close, impressive and intimate experience thanks to his great cinematography skills and his powerful visual language, who remember me so much to the work of his all life coworker Emmanuel Lubezki who couldn't work in this production due to schedule conflicts. But Cuaron uses Lubezki language in the most effective and glorious way to the point you can't believe this is not a Lubezki work and definitely this is the best cinematography work of the year and one in history. Glorious work in this point Mr. Cuaron.But this movie remembers me so much to my experience when I saw Mean Streets (Martin Scorsese, 1973) and this is not good because in few words: There's no story in practically 80% of the movie. Actually there's a point in the half of the movie when I was thinking ""This is going to somewhere?"" Exactly my experience when I saw Mean Streets for first time. It's only an representation of this house and family, there's no line to follow, there's no form, no motivation, only with the exception of the Cleo's pregnancy story, the shooting (the famous Halconazo) and the Mrs Sofia matrimony situation. This 3 points for itselfs aren't capable of supports the 135 minutes of the movie in time and narrative way. The cinematography gives that support, if this movie didn't have this perfect cinematography the movie would be a boring tribute of the Italian wave of the 60's and 70's. This is a Cuaron very, very personal work but this movie could have been so much better with a script with different rhythm and edition."
ROMA,7 March 2019,6/10,"The whole movie runs around the miseries of two women of different levels. There's nothing to see, nothing to learn, and nothing to enjoy. You will save 2 hours of your life by not wasting it on this movie! Watchced the whole thing in Fast forwards and did not miss a thing. It was both slow and super boring!"
ROMA,26 December 2018,5/10,"I can imagine this film to be one that students might be shown. Look at the detail, the framing of the shots, the pacing of the story, etc. It's all very impressive as far as the depiction of life in Mexico in the 70s is concerned (I imagine, I wasn't there).
However, it is one of the most mundane, pointless movies I have ever seen. Sometimes you watch character based movies where the storyline is extremely simple, but the characters and acting are amazing. Think Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine or Little Fish, or movies like Boyhood which tell a very basic story, but draw you in with an amazing ensemble of acting talent.
Roma is not up to that standard. It's realistic, well acted blah blah blah, but you will get to the end of the movie and feel nothing. Except maybe, ""what was the point of that?""
This is one for movie nerds, not movie fans who want to be entertained"
ROMA,16 February 2019,7/10,"Roma follows the life around a maid in mexico in 1970's.pilot is very Simple, character build-up (development) Is up to mark,Flow is flawless but very slow,acting is exceptional but the realism , the realism catches the eye here.U r in the movie right from start nd everything is happening exactly if itz happening around u. Hats off to director. Glad it got nominated to Oscars..
Since the movie is realistic drama, it got no epic base story nd that's wat life is about. U face problems, u deal with it. U meet new ppl but not everyone is nice
P.S:- Movie is in Black-white off color screen, nd english subtitles r provided against Portuguese dialogues throughout the film."
ROMA,26 December 2018,10/10,"This movie has a very particular story it wants to tell, and it's executed perfectly. When the crucial, harrowing moments come, the viewer understands that they come not just out of a specific cause, but also out of much larger causes involving the whole plot, the story of Mexico in the period, and the whole world. It's a very sad film at times but one that leaves you loving life, which is what a great movie ought to do."
ROMA,23 November 2019,8/10,"It is difficult to understand Cuaron's art. He tells a story, a simple typical story of a middle-upper class family going through a separation and the silent drama of a servant Cleo. The magic of this movie is everywhere, specially the use of the camera in the narrative of the story. The big planes are usual and, for me, it symbolized how small the whole drama is for the society, specially the chaotic one that is represented in the movie. Besides the mainline story, it represents in an accurate way the Mexicans felt in that part of their history. The whole movie is a piece of art which uses the camera as a way to tell a touching story."
ROMA,26 December 2018,,"Good Photography, very authentic, but boring movie, lack of Focus and Monotonous storytelling without intensity in scenes where there should have been."
ROMA,28 December 2018,9/10,"We all know by Cuarón's work that he isn't the most prolific of directors, and also that he doesn't reach the highest of personal levels in his filmmaking. In Roma, though, we must forget those facts: it is the most intimate we can get from the Mexican. This is a movie made essentially of emotions (and beautiful shots), where Mr. Cuarón takes almost all the credits (direction, photography, edition, writing, production).In the opening credits, we get to see a still shot of what seems to be someone cleaning a tile floor. The water reflects the sky and there's a plane slowly passing by: we're outside. This kind of wavy motion of the water made me recall Fernando Pessoa, who, in Mensagem, wrote:
""Deus ao mar o perigo e o abismo deu,
Mas nele é que espelhou o céu.""
Something tragic is about to unfold before our eyes.Suddenly, the camera shifts its angle and we meet Cleo, the young girl that characterizes Libo, the person that Cuarón dedicated the movie to and whose identity I don't want to reveal. She speaks Spanish with a dog. In a hurry, leaves the house where we believe she is a housekeeper and walks to the nursery, picking up a little boy, Pepe. As she returns home, other girl tells her that Fermín is on the phone, waiting to talk to her. He's her new boyfriend. As the girls are talking, the rest of the family gets home, but we don't see the father, who is leaving to Quebec for work next Friday. At the end of the day, the father returns, still earlier than usual. He is presented as a superior character, hearing classical music and smoking inside a big car, with some difficulties to park it inside the house, as he also can't avoid the dog's feces: he doesn't really fit in this place.In the evening, the family gathers in the leaving room watching TV and we see the mother's ""jealousy"": she asks Cleo to bring a tea to the father, when the kids start to embrace her. Before the end of the day and everyone goes to sleep (possibly the best photographed scene is seen here), we hear the couple fighting in their room.Some other day, Cleo and Adela (the other housekeeper) go to the movies with their boyfriends. The first one changes her mind when Fermín asks her to take a walk instead, ending both in a room. Fermín talks about his hard days as a teen. Then, they have sex.Cleo wakes up Friday morning. The following events change the whole scenario.When Antonio, the father, is about to leave, Sofía, his wife, holds him and kisses him, very strongly: something's not right, and we start to doubt about this father figure (maybe he is leaving definitely). A military band passes by their house, which, for me, symbolizes the dark days that this family is about to experience. This time, the mother is the one who walks the young Pepe to the nursery, after shouting with Cleo to clean the dog's feces. While she does it, we hear the plane passing by again and we're taken to the cinema, where Fermín and Cleo are kissing. She, then, reveals that she might be pregnant and the boy disappears, leaving the poor girl helpless.Cleo's thoughts wander while she looks at a hail storm. Again, Mr. Cuarón is telling us that something went very wrong. It is time for her to ask her bosses for help, which she does. At the same time, the grandmother, Teresa, is speaking to her daughter about Antonio's departure. We are now sure: this movie is about these two women, whose men left them behind, and what they'll do to make it without them.The big difference between these two is that Sofi, in contrast with Cleo, never had to fight for nothing, which is clearly seen by the way she drives her car, when both women go to the hospital. But, at least, she has a car and, possibly, a license to drive it, something unthinkable for people like Cleo.Inside the hospital, we learn, in one hand, that Fermín is the only man who had intercourse with Cleo. In the other hand, the drama between Sofi and Antonio intensifies as she talks with Dr. Zavala about her relationship problems. An earthquake hits the town while Cleo contemplates a new born baby (who probably died following that moment). We shift to some new place where some Christian crosses are shown. This is where the director starts to ""overemphasize"" with his symbolism. Wasn't the ""omen"" brought by the previous scene enough to tell us that, maybe, her baby is sentenced? Why do we need this shot for? It doesn't even stand at the level of the majority of the picture's frames. In this moment, we start to question Mr. Cuarón's (not so) subtle way to warn us.The family spends the Christmas holidays in the countryside with some other bourgeois families that speak some English. This is possibly the most boring part of the movie and it only serves the director's mission to, once again, clarify that Cleo and Sofi live in different worlds: didn't we already know that? The New Year starts with another one or two hints of tragedy. Cleo doesn't want to have toast with her ""low class"" friend, but when she agrees, some other woman hits her: the glass falls, and breaks. When she leaves the room where all the servants were celebrating, a fire starts to consume the woods. At this point, I'm starting to doubt the story and who wrote it, even more when all the people (including children) are helping to extinguish the fire and a mysterious man, shown before, starts to sing something... well, something! Before returning home, Cleo walks through the fields with the exact same woman who pushed her and talks about how that place reminds her home. Cleo doesn't talk that much, so we must listen when she does, even if it means nothing...The sunny breeze turns into a rainy day: the family's back home. Their big Maverick that Sofi scratched is now fixed. Antonio, though, still ain't home. Toño, the oldest of the brothers, wants to go to the cinema. Antonio is there. Cinema is now a place related with betrayal, and we must never forget Fermín, who Cleo ultimately finds in a martial arts training. The most important moment of this scene, apart from the fact that Fermín leaves Cleo helpless once again, is that, when Profesor Zovek, a famous figure in Mexico, challenges people to pose in a certain way with their eyes closed, Cleo is the only one who can accomplish the demand: she is the movie's strongest character, and she'll make through this storm.Everything seems to be in a downfall: the kids fight in the afternoon and, in the evening, Sofía returns home drunk: ""We're alone. (...) We, women, are always alone!"". Cleo doesn't reply. Did she need to hear that? Did we? And did we need to hear that, in the following scene, where we clearly see people protesting that they're protesting? If Cuarón wants to make an allusion to something, well, he has to be specific, not just talk about violence and leave the matter like that. He really made an effort to show us a reality that his people lived, but, somehow, failed: what follows is the movie's worst scene.After we get a ""cliché"" kind of piece of story, we reach the movie's emotional ""clímax"" (and its best scene, in my opinion). This is where the director shines. All we can do now is to keep quiet and simply look at the screen. If we pay attention around us, we'll then notice an empty, but understandable, silence, a silence that matches the birds' and the dogs' sounds, colored by frames where we see the family's neighborhood and house.Cleo is now a different, maybe stronger woman. Sofía buys a new, smaller car. The family goes to the beach. Sofía tells the children the truth about their father. They face it with different reactions: Toño freezes, Paco cries more than everyone else, the young Sofi hugs Cleo and little Pepe just seems to have some anger inside, leaving us with no clear understanding of what he's feeling. They talk about divorce and then sit silently eating ice-cream next to some couple getting married, which reminded me of how good Cuarón can actually be, sometimes.When the family finally confronts the sea of problems surrounding them, the movie seems to be over. As they return home, the same military band passes by. Same thing happens with the plane. The sunlight is now strong. Cleo wants to talk with Adela, and not the other way around. Everything's in its right place now.I preferred not to talk about the movie's core issue/subject matter, so that people go on and see it like I did. When we reach the end, there's nothing more than that issue to really deeply think about. Not always easy to see, this is a touching movie, but not a perfect one. When we start to imagine other ways Cuarón had to pull this off, we reach the conclusion that it could've been his best movie, because it'd certainly be one of the best movies of the decade. Doing things in his own flawed fashion, he made a flawed movie, but certainly one that's worth watching and re-watching."
ROMA,24 January 2019,8/10,"I really do not remember the last time we had such an art in the theaters, apart from the story line which could be stronger but the production, editing, screenplay and directing such an art is really fantastic. I highly suggest it. True passion, undeniable life facts, pain and challenge."
ROMA,13 January 2019,1/10,"I have not submitted a review in years, but after watching Roma, I feel compelled to say that I disliked this movie for multiple reasons. Several 1-star reviews eloquently addressed those issues, so I won't restate them. I see movies like Roma as jedi mind tricks by the filmmaking industry to make viewers who don't love it feel they are not smart enough to discern its worth. For the record, I love indie, art house, foreign, and documentary films, but Roma was so boring I suggested that friends watch it with the sound turned off and just enjoy the visuals. Still, beautiful cinematography without an interesting storyline is an utter waste of time."
ROMA,14 December 2018,10/10,"The camera work and cinematography is the best I've seen since Children Of Men (also directed by Alfonso Cuarón) everything feels stunningly authentic and every single scene and shot is crafted to perfection, I wasn't alive during the 70's nor was I in Mexico but after this cinematic marvel I may as well have been, it's also a credit to Cuarón how well he was able to utilise non actors, just fantastic. I went into this film thinking it would be a pretentious but decent film but as the beautifully crafted end credits rolled it turned out to be THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN."
ROMA,9 January 2019,7/10,"I'm no film critic but I know what I like in movies and this isn't it. Sure all the technical aspects are great, the acting and casting very good. I just don't know what the big deal is with this movie and why it was even nominated for any awards. Its boring, it goes nowhere. Theres no action. My lasting memory of this is poor Cleo constantly cleaning up dogshit and the dog getting no exercise."
ROMA,23 February 2019,10/10,"The time period of this movie is the beginning of the 70's. Just two years before that horrific Tlatelolco Massacre happened. Students (hundreds and hundreds of them) were peacefully protesting (as it was happening all around the world, but particularly in France). The Tlatelolco Square had, I think, three points of entry. Those were blocked with all the students, teachers and the army inside. Nowhere to hide. Then an elite paramilitary group started shooting. They even searched all the apartments sorrounding the square and kept with the executions. I mention this because many people don't know how bad it was in the aftermath. If you want to know more (and if you can find it), there's a tough heartbreaking movie that depicts all this. I don't know how they titled it in English, but in Spanish is Rojo Amanecer (Red Dawn).So, the sociopolitical situation in Roma is this aftermath. It's a VERY realistic and raw movie.Now, three generations of empowered women in Cuaron's movie is just marvelous. Can't say more because I hate spoilers.Just watch the movie. It's beautiful to hear a language that is basically forgotten. The weird black and white makes it even more realistic. One of the best movies I've seen."
ROMA,15 March 2019,2/10,"It may appeal to some people, and that's fine enjoy the movie.
But black and white? Come on, you know this is bad. It's bad. Just... no, no way! This movie is so bad."
ROMA,1 May 2019,9/10,"This film can't be watched in a rush. Take your time and make sure you don't have any other to-do things on your head.
Watching it is very soothing and gave me a sense of feeling the heaviness or lightness of each day the main character was going through.
Great visuals help in this experience.
I loved it."
ROMA,10 June 2019,1/10,I watched this a few months back after it received a rave from the film critic on BBC. What a fool was I. If foreign language black & white films with minuscule plot and storyline are your bag then this is for you. It is possible to have great cinematography and an actual story. This ain't Lawrence of Arabia. It's a pretentious and self indulgent borefest.
ROMA,20 May 2020,10/10,"Roma is such a beautifully crafted film, and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer - following Cleo's story contrasted with Sofia's story was an incredible experience and narrative journey, looking forward to what these actors star in next."
ROMA,8 December 2018,9/10,"I did not know what to expect going into this movie. I came out thoroughly overwhelmed by the emotional impact of the protagonist Cleo's story. But what really gets you is the sense you have, while watching, that Cleo and the other main characters are deeply implicated in an entire larger world, a world re-created for a film but that is so detailed, complex, and vibrant that it feels startlingly real. As such, the dense energy of an entire society seems to be conveyed to us through the quiet and unassuming figure of a lowly maid, the type of person until recently rarely chosen as the center of such an epic look at a time and place, but who emerges as epitomizing the best that society has to offer.As a result, the film is a sort of bourgeois family-saga told through the margins. The story may have an allegorical significance for Mexican society at large. A white family is almost destroyed as its patriarch gives up and takes off, abandoning his wife, four children, the two maids and dog. As everyone is let down by his betrayal, it is Cleo, the indigenous maid, who holds everyone together, through the quiet strength of her loyalty and stability.The film's plot, though, has garnered much less interest than its visuals, of which much has already been made. They are indeed stunning, and do seem to be modeled after the great Mexican tradition of muralism, a consciously social and political art form that portrays moments of great upheaval and change through a panoramic, long-view of Mexican society.However, for me the great success of the film is precisely its success in shifting between the small and the big: it imbeds the close-up, fine-grained story of Cleo and her employer's family within the greater tapestry of the larger world of Mexico City in the 1970s. Throughout the film, the turmoil of the latter increasingly encroaches upon the world of the family's house. In the end, it was the back-and-forth between the intimacy we begin to feel with the characters, the emotional impact of their story and their search for a new equilibrium, and the greater sense we have of an outside world similarly roiled by instability and unforeseeable changes."
ROMA,30 December 2018,10/10,"I haven't been moved by a film like this for years.
I had no idea I would be so emotionally affected by the wonderful piece of art. I am simply stunned a man could tap into the world of two different classes of women and reflect their lives so beautifully. These women characters are true strength and beauty; nothing holding them back from finding true happiness within their daily lives.Brilliant"
ROMA,14 January 2019,2/10,"I was bored out of my mind! Attempted to watch in 3 occasions and could. It keep my eyes open. Photography, direction, were really good as only Cuaron can do! But story line and acting where just boring boring. On the attempt to watch I had to take breaks every 10 min by watching something else either funny or truly interesting and even then I could not pass the 30 min mark and just finish watching."
ROMA,21 February 2019,7/10,Vastly overrated. it does have nice photography and a couple of interesting scenes but overall it falls flat in my opinion.
ROMA,10 November 2019,1/10,How did this below-average film beat Capernaum in the oscars?Unbelievable..
ROMA,27 December 2018,5/10,I sincerely tried to get into this movie. I was honestly bored throughout the film. I loved the camera work and get what this was going for. I just could not get invested as much as I wanted to. Not a bad movie. Just not keeping me tuned in. Although I do say again Cinematography was very nice throughout the film.
ROMA,26 January 2019,1/10,"Long shots, that makes me think this movie was produced in some Eastern Europe country.
Started with 5 minutes of washing the floor scene and ended with the five minutes stair scene.
What makes Alfonso Cuaron think that setting the background against Mexico in 1970 will enlighten the audience?
Please, someone tells Cuaron that using black and white photography does not make it a cult movie. Was that his intention?
Dreadful performances by both actress.
Is the American movie industry plagued by some guilty conscience about what happened in Mexico or other Latin American countries during military regimes of sixties and seventies? Turn the page and let us move on.
The lives of most people are naturally boring. It This is not an excuse to make a movie about it."
ROMA,25 December 2018,10/10,"I was prepared to not be into this movie as it seemed very much a not a ""dude"" type of film. If anything, the STYLE & Camera work got attention. But oh boy...what a payoff. They actually got me to tears with Cleo's entire Labour scene. The reason you gotta give this movie the respect is due to both the ACTRESS, & this filmmaker, who deserves the praise for bringing to life Real basic human emotional connections to the life of a Mexican lower class woman. American society DEFINITELY needs this portrayal & story. These are the same REAL ppl certain INHUMAN WALKING GARBAGE FIRES & the lil dumpsters that support them classify as ""ILLEGALS"". Let's not pretend this beautiful touching movie wasn't just made in the face of HEAVILY GROWING UGLY anti brown Racism in our country. THIS MOVIE SPEAKS SO LOUDLY I feel in response to the way our society views both women, & Mexicans. You can genuinely FEEL It's not JUST a year in the life of a lonely yet beautiful human, but an artists carefully done love note to a life once shared intimately. Maybe it doesn't have this affect on every one. Rest assured there are always genre movie crowd ppl that will always be ""bored"" & not ""get it"". But this one is a little but too honest and simple to have to ""read through"". Hey f u can sit through this and feel nothing..I pity you."
ROMA,19 December 2018,7/10,"I was actually excited about this movie thinking that it was going to be better than Gravity considering the artistical liberty that Netflix allows to a director of Cuaron's calibre. Oh boy I was wrong.
The movie has no plot. The movie has no plot. I cannot emphasize this enough...
Nothing interesting happens throughout the whole movie. It's almost unbelievable. I am giving this 7 stars due to the beautiful cinematography and the talented actors. I have to admit that the casting was on point. The main characters are the only thing that will keep this movie away from a Rasberry award or however they are called. But knowing Hollywood I won't be surprised if I'll see this bringing home a bucket full of oscars. Showbiz baby :)"
ROMA,16 December 2018,2/10,I never found anything. no script. No acting. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!
ROMA,7 January 2020,2/10,"It is one of those movies so pretentious yet base, that sometimes you get a feeling the movie is actually smart and just laughs at itself."
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,I cant understand the good critics and the Oscars?!??
ROMA,26 December 2018,7/10,"Life goes on, and it will, like a piece of paper blowing in out up down in the wind, it stops when it will...xx"
ROMA,18 September 2020,1/10,"I tried to like it, but it was dull. I found nothing in the movie to grab me and to hold my interest. I agree, much of it felt real, but if I want to see life played out in something that looks like real time, I'll look out my window. Even the rescue scene at the beach didn't grab me. Everything felt superficial.If you like great camera shots and cinematography and are happy with just that, then you might like this movie. If you want something that resembles a plot that moves forward or has any twists, then I would avoid it."
ROMA,5 March 2019,5/10,"Beautifully made, very slow, monochrome film, in the classic tradition, with exquisite sound and with some wonderfully naturalistic, if distantly observed, performances, subtly infiltrated by stereotypical themes of toxic masculinity that mesh precisely, and fashionably, with today's zeitgeist."
ROMA,21 October 2019,8/10,"The movie reminded me of Satyajit Ray's ""Pather Panchali"". Similar direction, black and white, storytelling and the story too (a bit). The little things brought to focus.I laughed when the splash of water revealed the sky out over concrete surface, like a window opening. Splendid.I cried at the delivery scene :(Brilliant direction.. but slow at times. It should have been done under 2hrs. But thats how art movies are done anyways."
ROMA,28 December 2018,5/10,"Alfonso Cuaron achieved great success and received abundant acclamation for directing the Oscar-winning film Gravity back in 2013. Aside from the film rightfully winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, Cuaron took home the hardware for Best Director as well. Since then, the world has been waiting for Cuaron's follow-up project in hopes that it too will wow audiences everywhere and be the next masterpiece in Cuaron's growing catalog.Now, fast-forwarding to 2018, Cuaron gives us Roma - a flashback film telling the story of two women looking for a fresh start from heartbreaking situations in 1970 Mexico City. Cuaron has said that the film is a semi-autobiographical story of his own life growing up in Mexico observing as a child his maid's perseverance through her burdens.Unfortunately, if I was Cuaron's maid, I would be more insulted by my depiction in the film than flattered."
ROMA,23 December 2018,5/10,"As most of mexican films, a 2 hours soft opera with the recurrent story of every time"
ROMA,30 March 2019,10/10,"A stunning portrait of Mexico. I am South African, and there are echoes of my country in every corner of this film. Be it the dusty plains, the domestic workers, the many absent fathers and the government shooting at students in the street. But setting all the politics and feminism aside, Roma is a warming story about family. Beautiful cinematography and unpretentious characters leaves you with a sense of quietness - like the courtyard outside the house."
ROMA,11 February 2019,3/10,"I'm sorry but as hard as I tried I thought that this was meaningless rubbish. Another example of film makers trying to be overly cerebral, and making a has of it. I painfully sat my way through this thinking that an epiphany would eventually manifest itself, but sadly not....... it really is not an award worthy movie and I suspect that, like La La land, it is really just another wrist kissing exercise, and more of a nod to Netflix than a serious recognition of any real movie substance .......... compare this to City of God and it doesn't come close."
ROMA,15 September 2019,1/10,"I am soooo glad that I resisted the urge to see this boring stinker when it was in theatrical release. Watching it for free on my friend's Netflix was ok because I only lost time, not time and money. This was Hollywood preaching to us about its hatred for Trump. Slow and boring. Don't waste your time."
ROMA,24 December 2018,10/10,"I found Roma absolutely incredible. The best filmgoing experience I've had this year, maybe one of the best ever. It's so hard for me to describe what made this special to me, but I think it comes down to just how alive it was. It was a little slice of a normal, happy and sad life of Cleo, and the people around her.There's so much to unpack in this, but what really stood out was the acting, direction, sound design and especially cinematography. Roma represents Cuarón at his best and most confident as a storyteller, and the intimacy of Roma is almost too hard to bear.I do want to touch on the hospital scene, though. It's the tensest I've been in the cinema in a long time, and it was all done in masterfully choreographed single-angle takes that ended up lasting well beyond several minutes. When I saw the liveless little baby body, I broke down, harder than I think I've ever done at a film. The brutality of seeing the doctors cover the child in the background while Cleo was still in her birthgiving position was too much to handle.When she finally makes peace with herself at the beach, saying that she didn't really want the child, and the family all hug her, it almost hit me even more than the hospital. The fact that she realised that she has more love from the family than she could ever need, and that she loves them just as much was the perfect wrap-up of such a beautiful character arc.Roma is a masterpiece. I can't wait to see it again. I had to call both my parents after seeing it. It reminds you (much like Children of Men) of what a precious gift life is, and that each one matters as much as the next one"
ROMA,26 January 2019,5/10,"Yes, cinematography is excellent. Decor, atmosphere, costume are magnificent. Side characters are also kind of interesting, like boyfriends of the maids, smallest child of the estate, etc.But why not try digging a bit more into their worlds instead of wasting the film roll on detailed description of usual daily activities? Besides, can anyone tell how 70s Mexico contributes to the story? And does this contribution justify the budget spent on decor and costume? The story could easily take place today with much cheaper needs.I understand this is a very personal movie for Cuaron with many emotional memories connected to it. But man, with all this money and effort, he could easily achieve much more remarkable outcome for people beside himself."
ROMA,14 January 2019,9/10,So real.it was like a documentary every actor was great and the hospital scenes will tear your heart out
ROMA,9 June 2019,6/10,"Not particularly valuable. A maid gets pregnant, apparently doesn't know about abortion, or abortion isn't available. And she gets lucky that the baby is stillborn. Happy ending. The movie is excessively slow."
ROMA,10 May 2020,9/10,"Roma is a slow and simple Mexican Oscar winning film. I see many reviews saying it's too slow, I disagree. There is always something small to watch, admiring the cinematography, watching the birds in the cage, or even listening to the sounds in the background. It's just like life, no action just drops of sadness, if sad. Overall the film is enjoyable, it is not slow! I got carried away by the smallest sounds and details. The best Mexican film ever made! Better than Green Book."
ROMA,1 March 2019,8/10,"Having read dozens of reviews I have come to the conclusion that Roma is only likely to appeal to serious movie lovers. I agree that the pace is slow and that the story appears to be relatively uneventful, but isn't. It is one of the few films I have ever seen which seems to be about real life. Sometimes life is boring and repetitive and seems to be going nowhere, but then something happens which impacts immediately and may only affect one person or it may affect many. This film shows how events affected Maria, her employer, her lover, the children, the town, and the country. Every level is important and related.
The cinematography, the lighting, the sets, the use of hundreds of extras and the choice of monochrome results in a masterful film well deserving of the acclaim."
ROMA,8 June 2020,8/10,A slow but affecting story unravels. Beautifully shot and showing life from the bottom up including all the political developments in 1970s Mexico. The life of an indigenous domestic worker is not one you expect to see on film but it's a remarkable film.
ROMA,1 July 2020,10/10,"A very rich film, but difficult to accessing for some viewers, precisely because it is a trivial and mundane story; in other words, the film is a slightly more challenging exercise of patience. However, whoever wants to face the film with an open heart, can open their senses to various subtleties and enjoy countless discussions in several layers. In the end, you may not have been so excited about the narrative, but you certainly touched it somehow.To witness this story happening, Alfonso Cuarón plunges into an Italian neorealism, which was / is an artistic current in special cinematography, which bring elements of reality to fiction."
ROMA,20 December 2018,1/10,"So might as well make a documentary versus this film. Was totally boring, almost no plot or character or story. No story other than watching the lives of the families like done with a cam corder. I don't know what is the basis of any good reviews other than authenticity in look. The black and white was good but this was like watching paint dry. Not memorable, will never watch again and shows again its Lemmings, fish swimming in the same school that this is a good film"
ROMA,28 January 2019,9/10,"This is such a simple story but, man, the way that it is told, just pure magic. The cinematography, work with the camera, the perspective, the angles ... just too good.
I understand why some people cannot connect with the movie and see it as a slow, tedious drag. But it certainly is much more than that.
And to think that this amazing work is in a category with A star is born and Black Panter ... I would feel totally out of place."
ROMA,12 April 2019,10/10,"As with his other ensemble masterpiece, Chidren of Men (2006), Roma proves Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron to be yet again one of cinema's finest auteurs. In both movies, you have a vulnerable pregnant young woman. In both, men prove themselves to be treacherous and unreliable, though even more so in Roma. Having just finished it, I think there are only two male characters in the whole film that you can have some confidence in, and one is a self-important (but appealing) spiritual strongman, and the other is a house-servant who is given hardly any lines, but is gracious and unassuming in the way he opens doors for others.In both films, the busy background scenes are integral in communicating the director's message to the viewer, although equally significant in Roma are the sounds (dogs barking, taps dripping, birds singing, and - most of all - aircraft flying overhead). The almost constant backdrop of crowd scenes provides a useful counterpoint or supplement to what is going in the main characters' heads and hearts - that is, Cleo, the maid (Yalitza Aparecido) and Sofia, the lady of the house. Cuaron is a genius at forcing us through the camera to linger on details which otherwise we might overlook and you feel that he could make an entirely different action movie if he were to focus on the shoot-outs and football matches and forest fires and earthquakes that manifest themselves throughout.Roma is a soulful, agonising, beautiful, tender film and entirely deserving of all the plaudits its received. It merits your full focus so don't do anything else while watching it and give particular attention to the imagery and the sounds. You will be richly rewarded."
ROMA,5 January 2019,7/10,"I was looking forward to see this movie. But while watching I found myself drifting away. Had to concentrate to stay in the movie. Not a good sign. The movie is beautiful, the acting is great, the birth, beach and warehouse had impact. But a lot of scenes didn't have much impact. I got the feeling this movie was to preoccupied with being beautiful, with winning an Oscar. And less with captivating it's audience, offering context and guiding them in an engaging story."
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"Roma is primarily a story of a maid Cleo and her influence on the people with whom her paths meet primarily in her profession as a maid to a wealthy family. Roma is just not about Cleo but also about the very delicate and minute aspects about our lives which the director has portrayed brilliantly through his cinematography and genius camera work . The shots are slow , the frames are very detailed and unparalleledly realistic . In some sense Roma also intends to show the plight of the women in Mexico of 1969-70 , which is even relavent today but that's not the objective of Roma . Roma is about showing an extremely normal setting in an extremely detailed and flawless way. If you are a person interested in thrill ,action , pace and suspense , then Roma will disappoint you. Else , go for it ."
ROMA,13 February 2019,3/10,"Extremely overrated, too slow, waiting for something to happen, nothing does except the expected"
ROMA,31 January 2019,4/10,"I was bored to tears!! It's sooo long, sooo slow, and completely pointless! The editor needs a slap on the wrist because every shot was about ten seconds longer than needed, and it's mentally exhausting waiting for a cut several seconds after where it naturally feels one should be. This movie could easily be 30 minutes shorter without so much dead space. Next, the script and story structure are both awful. One hour in, I still had no clue who the characters were, what they wanted, or what the movie was even about. Then the movie just randomly ends after a travesty happens to the main character, leaving the audience with their hands up like ""..... that's it?""The only good thing going for this film is the cinematography and direction, although I think Cuaron got a little carried away with his wide shots, deep focus, and long takes. It reminded me of a movie from the 50's where everything is filmed from far away like you're watching a play on stage, and movies aren't made like that anymore. However, I did appreciate the mise-en-scene. You can tell that each long take took a lot of work with the timing and so many characters in each frame. And some of the black and white shots are gorgeous. But I would have rather just seen a nice photo than wasted two hours of my life on this snooze fest."
ROMA,30 December 2018,9/10,"This movie drags for 2 hours + and it seems quite slow, however the acting skills of Cleo are superb, given the fact this lady had no acting experience whatsoever. Moving on to the plot itself, I guess it will be difficult for people from different backgrounds to connect with the real meaning of this film due to the fact that is common in latin american households to live this reality and grow up having a domestic maid living in your home, sharing your pain and victory, happiness and defeats and yet being overlooked in so so many ways that in all honesty saddened me a lot as these women due to their socio economic status find a stable salary working as maids, and end up raising children that aren't theirs, sacrifice their own needs and family in order to provide for them while looking after another. This is the true message of this movie; when Cleo is about to give birth and the grandmother doesn't know her birth date, not even her last name... this struck me hard; those were the tiny messages Cuarón in my humble opinion was trying to convey."
ROMA,1 February 2019,7/10,I found this film quite slow and in places tedious. However there are some moments of tension and one scene towards the end of the film lifts it out of the ordinary and stays with you after the titles roll. I am surprised at the number of Oscar nomination it received as I wouldn't have thought it merited any.
ROMA,17 March 2019,4/10,"Apart from the good acting from the lead and the film looking nice, this is a really drab piece of cinema. As with the director's film Gravity, I left the cinema wondering what was the point. Seriously, I do believe people get caught up in the hype of the movie and have to 'love' it. Is to brag to people they have seen an art house movie? Probably. You be the judge, but a very underwhelming film."
ROMA,3 January 2019,6/10,"I watched this film on my laptop. The sets, the photography, and the music were beautiful and I was drawn to the story line, despite the fact that it depicted a relatively ordinary slice of life of a relatively ordinary family.My reason for not giving it a higher rating is that too many shots were far longer than they needed to be in serving their purpose. I recognize that many shots are designed to establish a mood, but, even by these standards, the director lingered far too long on them. The film could have been just as powerful if it were 30 minutes shorter."
ROMA,9 April 2019,2/10,"A film with no point, no story, just few moments from boring life. Are we really that desperate that we have to stare at pointless pictures?"
ROMA,26 January 2019,1/10,"It was so boring, that even our dog didn't react to the dogs barking. It was like watching paint dry on growing grass. Painful and absolutely meaningless."
ROMA,24 November 2019,6/10,I saw this movie to see what the hype was. The story is very good and the whole black and white usage throughout the movie really creates a different mood. It's a movie worth watching once. Definitely different.
ROMA,25 February 2019,1/10,Pretentious boring film. Like every year something wins 20 oscars for nothing. Awful
ROMA,20 January 2019,6/10,"This is an ok movie. It has an interesting, though slow moving, story. It has a lot of strong themes that it neatly ties together. It gives you an interesting perspective on some social themes that you are probably already fully knowledgeable about but highlights them with a story. But this was not entertaining movie for me. And usually I really like movies like this. It was just not engaging.I think that the real reason it's receiving Oscar buzz is because Netflix is running a $20 million Oscar campaign for it. And, aside from money and acclaim, the reason they think it should be Oscar worthy is because it deals with a lot of important themes, like women's rights and minority rights. And I fully support those themes, but you should win an Oscar because you present those themes in an engaging movie, not just because you made a mediocre movie addressing them. I think that the Netflix campaign hurts the cause because if it wins, people will say it won just because of politics. And I normally don't agree with people who say that but in this case I think they would be right.If there were no Oscar buzz I would say this was a decent movie that addressed a lot of good themes but wasn't necessarily entertaining or engaging. The fact that it's being pushed for an Oscar has actually made me cynical about the Oscars."
ROMA,5 January 2019,10/10,"Main misconception:I don't get most of the people saying this movie - this masterpiece - was boring, that it didn't have any twist or that it's lacking taste or that the characters weren't vivid.I think many people had some expectations from this movie and didn't get them.
They probably wanted some more family drama, someone being murdered or more people dying.
And I just don't get it; it's not a drama unless people die in it? or unless something massively depressing/bad happens?The actual movie review (my review/opinion):Overall it was a very pleasant movie to watch, it didn't feel stupid or dull or boring in any way, everything felt natural and REAL.
That's actually what I liked about it, it was just like a small part, a year of a pretty balanced (financially speaking, but not only) middle-class family, it's so normal and real, everything feels so natural like it's not even a movie, it's almost like a documentary, most of it until the drama kicks in, every time it feels so real, so relatable because it's not some fake, phony movie that shocks you with things you see in most movies (wars, biohazard, breakups, etc.); there are real life problems that are totally relatable in a pretty dramatic setup.
There is life being given and taken away, there are the lives of the main characters that the audience can see, just like a glimpse of them, of their lives, of their emotions, feelings, thoughts.
All the characters are already there when the movie begins and when it ends everything is like 'life goes on'.And the filming, all scenes are so wide and capturing every detail, letting you see everything, there's no hidden things behind it, there are no scenes shown beforehand to give you hints nor scenes that try to confuse you, everything just happens, and the camera is like a silent observer.
Also, very good choice to film everything in black and white, it just makes everything blend in since the action takes place in 70' Mexico City and also since this is a drama, because the lack of color adds to the drama, especially in the most dramatic moments of the movie. It gives it the look of an older movie, a sad atmosphere and it just captures everything that you need to see.It doesn't have to be all in 4K, millions of colors, sound effects, visual effects, stunts, explosions, etc.
It can just have a normal flow, like life itself with it's ups and downs but with a more pale, less colorful, sad but also more classy look to it."
ROMA,20 December 2018,1/10,"I'm shocked. What a waste of time. Nothing meaningful was happening throughout the whole runtime, it's like watching my neighbor and that's not fun. It made me fall asleep multiple times and I had to finish the movie in three separate sessions. Everything was sloooooowww and black & white look of the film was completely unnecessary."
ROMA,15 January 2019,1/10,Ok so like so many I've been hearing about this film so I watched it. Actually I had to watch it 3 times because I kept falling asleep. IT'S BORING! I love foreign films but for me this film could put a dead person to sleep.
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"Wow, what a beautiful film. From the opening scene right until the end credits, every shot could be a photograph that would carry its own story. There was something hypnotising about this film and the people within it. It's not action packed and full of forced drama - it's just life. Please watch!"
ROMA,6 January 2019,9/10,"If you're the average movie-goer, you probably think that movies are made for your approval -- that movies should pander to your amusement; strive to make you laugh, cry, feel inspired, etc. And that's fair enough. But Roma is not one of these. It takes its cues from Italian directors De Sica and Fellini more probably than from our own current Hollywood. So, Americans, be advised: Roma does not come to you -- you must go to it. But if you are willing to kick-back, relax, and let yourselves be drawn into the childhood world of writer/director Alfonso Cuarón's 1971 Mexico, in all its political and socioeconomic turmoil, and into the lives of sweetly resilient women who once nurtured and protected him there, you will find your cinematic magic. Let this film wash over you like a warm bath, transfix you, mesmerize you. Demand nothing from it. Expect nothing. I promise you'll emerge with a profound appreciation for life beyond yourself, for the lives of other people, and those many unsung heroes we usually never notice. You'll love your own home more, your own people. In this way we are privileged to experience Alfonso Cuarón's artful masterpiece. Roma is a major contribution to the craft of cinema, and exemplifies with exceptional aptitude that art does not pander -- it elevates."
ROMA,7 December 2018,10/10,"Call this a MASTERPICE is going to be so simple through time without thinking about it.Some scenes of this movie will pass through history of cinema as the most iconic of our era (There Is no question about it). We are going to be talking about them for many years. This movie starts with simple slices of life (you laugh in a scene, then another one you get happy, then another one a little bit sad ""just like life""). This makes you think that the movie doesnt have a plot with a structure, but in reality what Cuarón is doing is making you to generate a huge empathy with each character and when the time comes; when the movie gets to its climax....... Ohhhh my goooooood! I can tell you, perhaps in the last five or more years you havent seen something soooo powerul, so moving. Just play the game of the filmmaker, forget about pacing, just sit and let everything happen and you will have your return of investment, you will be rewarded with the BEST MOVIE of the year!"
ROMA,30 December 2018,2/10,"This movie was very slow, with not much to add in terms of thoughts/knowledge/excitement or feelings. Really slow-paced, it was absolutely boring, even on a day when we were desperate to watch something."
ROMA,9 June 2019,9/10,"I could tell how influential this time was on Curaon. This film as a soul, and it drags you under all the depression, frustration and curious optimism it conveys. You come out better from watching it. Very beautiful."
ROMA,22 January 2019,6/10,"This film is a masterpiece in technicality. The cinematography is near perfect, sets and production are brilliant, editing on point and acting very well done at points, however it is just two hours and fifteen minutes of techniques to make a film teacher cream themselves.The story is almost non-existant. You could claim its just a slice of life however normal life has much more connection and emotion than this. This just feels like we're watching bland characters walking around doing next-to nothing for the majority of the runtime.This film deserves Oscars, but little else. Watch Children of Men instead, it's much more emotional and entertaining than this."
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,"10/10 because he captures a plane flying over some blokes head ??? Really??? I swear 90% of this film is just of people either doing household chores or travelling from one place to another.... yes, it's beautifully done, but I'm just glad Netflix has a 10 second fast forward button...As for the '""sad"" story itself, I just felt nothing - no emotion what so ever. I've cried a lot during films, but any tears here, were just out of boredom.1 word summary. Overhyped."
ROMA,20 February 2019,8/10,"I can't decide if I liked it or if it's just self indulgent.It's stunningly beautiful, but that's about it. For me anyway. Maybe you'll enjoy it.Either way I don't think it deserves Oscar nods... But you decide"
ROMA,26 February 2019,6/10,"It is a nice story. The director and the main actress are incredible. Other than that, I found it a little boring. It is like seing your neighbour for two months. Bad things happen, good things happen and thats all. No screenplay, no plot"
ROMA,6 December 2018,1/10,"I can't believe the reviews of this rip-off of the Italian cinema of the 50's and 60's.
It started with the opening scene of the water being splashed on a floor. I not only found it jarring but interminable. One or two splashes would have sufficed. I lost count after six or seven. I am confused when an ""auteur"" uses a sledgehammer where delicacy and respect for the intelligence of the viewer could suffice.
The film seems to be being touted as an Oscar contender, primarily for the cinematography. I don't get it.Yes, some of the scenes were staged beautifully and the images were well effected, but there was nothing that I had not seen in the fore mentioned Italian movies. The one scene of Sophia Loren holding her child in the middle of the road in ""The Women"" totally encapsulated everything this boring movie was trying to say. Fellini and Antonioni did it all first.
Boring does not equate to art. And the film is endlessly boring without the rewards to be found in deep, meaningful stillness.
I have to confess. I walked out of the movie after about 90 minutes and am very sorry that I did not walk out an hour sooner!"
ROMA,4 January 2019,9/10,"Although I found this film to be very forlorn, I was on pins and needles throughout. Tragic, yet the lead character was so humble that she caused me to reflect on my own privileged life and attitudes. Beautifully portrayed with outstanding performances from the children to the grandmother. I was touched deeply by the dogs. The martial arts training sequence was emotionally wrenching. A glimmer of hope, of escape. Cleo was never looking for an escape, which is phenomenal in my mind.
I will never forget any of the scenes from this film, which is proof that it is a winner in my book!"
ROMA,31 March 2019,1/10,"Two questions;What has the title 'Roma got to do with the story?
What had the two astronauts in space got to do with the story?I do not even need to mention that I regret wasting my 2 hours trying to understand what was going on in this movie."
ROMA,14 July 2019,7/10,This movie was good but somewhat overrated. One measure for me of a really good movie is when I notice that the movie is almost over and I haven't looked at the clock.. I looked at the clock on more than one occasion during this show. It was a nice look into mid-century Mexico...but that was insufficient.
ROMA,17 March 2020,3/10,The pretentiously dragged on story doesn't say much and characters are not very likeable or engaging either.
ROMA,12 January 2019,9/10,"After Gravity (2013), Alfonso Cuaron went on a long directorial hiatus. The reason is Roma, his newest and probably his best film. Almost every shot transcends from art into real life because of distant camera and lack of choreography on the screen. It's slow but has a great pacing because every extra second pays off in the end. During the watching of the film it's likely you will think to yourself 'I should have ordered pizza and watched new Tom Cruise movie, I can't stand black&white art films and subtitles anymore...' but after the movie ends you will think about it long and hard. You will regret even thinking about Tom Cruise. You will contemplate and you will ask questions. And you will use Google because you probably don't have the slightest idea about political state of Mexico in 1971. Corpus Christi massacre is an interesting read even before you watch the movie. Speaking of which, it's fascinating how all those different themes managed to connect and create seamless narrative. Cleo, who is connection to all the stories, is a maid from a Mexican middle-class family. For most of the screen time she's seen scrubbing dog poo and taking care of children but I would call her the strongest female character of 21st century cinema. Meryl Streep and all her Oscars have nothing on Cleo, modest Mexican maid who we all met in life in some form. It's only January but I can tell Roma will be reaping this year's awards like apples from a tree. My rating for this movie, as high as it may be, wouldn't do its justice. This review is dedicated to Cleos of the world."
ROMA,9 October 2018,10/10,"I saw Roma at a screening on Saturday night at MOMA in NYC.This is an absolutely stunning, unforgettable film. Good God, Cuaron is a fantastic director. He's also the cinematographer and his superb work on this simply couldn't be improved upon. He has perfectly cast the film from top to bottom and has guided the non-pro who plays the lead to embody her character to an extent that is truly remarkable. I can't say enough about how moving an experience this film provides. And because I don't want to discuss the plot for spoiler reasons I'll end here. However I want to urge everyone to PLEASE see this in a cinema with a great sound system-the sound mixing alone is extraordinary. Like, give the sound mixer the Oscar, already. No other work could possibly come close to approaching this towering achievement."
ROMA,17 March 2019,3/10,"Extremly boring, definable NOT ""visually stunning"" and basically a good waste of time. I've seen thousands of movies but it's verry rare to get disappointed like that.. Don't really want to talk about the movie, so I'll just tell you that I would prefer to watch ""Holmes and Wotson""( labled worst movie of the year) 5 times in a row, than watching Roma :) It's pointless for this film to exist at all.."
ROMA,1 February 2019,9/10,"Ok, first of all this film is not for public consumption, second of all is that it might be wise to preface ones self before seeing this film. Please allow me to explain.This film is more like a slice of blue cheese on your roast beef sandwhich...it's an aquired taste. What the director Alfonso Cuarón has done is to take a brief look into his childhood memories and he has successfully place them on film.This film is a visual epoch which, if you allow, will unfold before your eyes. It is more of an experience rather than watching a movie. It takes patience and the understanding of where the film is coming from before viewing."
ROMA,20 April 2019,1/10,"I'm 49, graduated with a four year diploma and worked in Social Work and military. I just watched about 44mins of the film and my wife and already wondered what was going on with the seemingly long intro with the water. We checked in with eachother about every five mins about whether the film was delivering anything. I just now logged in and had to write this. I'm with the most other neg. reviews. This is a boring monolithic attempt at delivering and what we were expecting an entertaining and engaging film. Nope. More like Coma."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"I found this movie to be too slow moving and boring. At two hours and fifteen minutes, it is also far too long for the meager content. It just wasn't interesting, and tedious."
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,"Like the title says... indifferent and boring but Alfonso Cuaron it's very clever to understand that the anti-Trump mania that has take over Hollywood the last couple of years will make a black & white movie about the other side of the ""wall"" (that he wants to build), will be a big hit. And it did. For you people in the USA (and the Academy) maybe it's important for the rest of the world it's..... indifferent and boring!!!"
ROMA,25 February 2019,9/10,"Roma is one of the most beautiful films of 2018. This is such a simple story but the way that it is told, just stunning.The cinematography was stunning. Directing, editing and actings were so good. Cuarón is a fantastic director and he did a phenomenal job. Every scene is so well detailed and so captivating. Right from the opening shot, every shot is masterfully executed, framed and detailed.But for me the most impressive thing about film is that it all just feels so real. Roma is a true life story, it's all about life, the simpleness, the unexpected misery and the joy that you can get of simple things. That is the word I would use to describe this film, real.Thank you Alfonso Cuarón for this beautiful masterpiece and for having given us such a wonder of a cinematographic experience."
ROMA,2 February 2019,9/10,"In a cinema world plagued by sequels, remakes, action movies and superheroes, Cuarón becomes Theo Angelopoulos and takes us back to a different era of film making; an almost back to basics approach.It's not a crowd pleaser, but those who do watch it, will appreciate it"
ROMA,4 January 2019,9/10,"Thank you for showing everyone else that you are not a self-serving biased dolt who can't separate their own preferences from at least recognizing that absolutely flawless cinematography and art direction is a VERY large component of what constitutes great filmmaking, and should be respected as such.I happened to also love the story and acting and slice-of-life writing/dialogue, which is why I gave this a 9/10. What kept me from giving it a full on 10 were a couple over-the-top scenes... the fire scene on New Years Eve was kind of ridiculous and started getting into the ""genuinely pretentious"" realm, as opposed to what all the ""1/10"" morons deem as pretentious with this film simply because oooh it's in black-and-white and has a lot of long takes so it's instantly written off as ""artsy-fartsy.""I can totally understand how there are plenty of people who will say they wanted to get into this movie, but just couldn't get past the long pacing and cinema verité style of the writing.. and I won't get on anyone's case for feeling that way. And the many people on here who basically said as much and gave it a 5 are very probably worth looking into other reviews because they have displayed that they understand that it wasn't their cup of tea, BUT they also know full well that the other aspects of the movie - really significant aspects - were undeniably FLAWLESS and AMAZING. And that isn't at all something that is nearly as subjective when critiquing film. There are plenty of components to filmmaking that are much more largely NOT a matter of opinion. There is excellent sound engineering and then there isn't. There is amazing cinematography and then there isn't. There is flawless editing and then there isn't.This film has all the technical genius of any film out there. Lighting a black-and-white film is much harder than color. Any undergrad film school student can even tell you that. And this movie had all the flawless lighting, cinematography and camerawork direction you could possibly find. THAT is undeniable and worth a hell of a lot more than a ""1/10."" I mean come on, just... come on. What the hell is a movie like ""From Justin to Kelly"" or ""Gigli"" supposed to get if this gets a 1/10 in your oh-so-nuanced opinions, if that's the case??! Get over yourselves, and at least recognize the parts of the film that are undeniably worth at least SOMETHING.So yeah... if you enjoy slice-of-life, slow-paced and subtlety downplayed drama.. 9/10. If you can't sit still through stuff that doesn't have chase scenes and explosions and superheroes, 5/10 .:.because I don't care who you are, you should at least watch something once in a while that has flawless cinematography just to know what it is."
ROMA,27 February 2019,,"I don't get it. I feel like I've been looking at an abstract painting but just not seeing what others say they are seeing. But, wait, maybe they don't see it either. They are just told that they SHOULD see it, and they aren't really sophisticated or clever if they don't see it. I don't see it; I don't get it. A movie should entertain or at least educate; I got neither from ""Roma""."
ROMA,7 January 2019,6/10,"I relished every second of the framing, lighting, panning, artistic perspective.... This should be a required film for anyone who even hopes to shoot a film someday. Bravo!Now the storyline? First let me say this: My wife was born, raised and lived in Mexico for 40 years. She also had loves films. She thought this was a stereotypical Latin American soap plot. The unavoidable tangled lives of those who have live-in domestic labor. It's only been done a million times already.I on the other hand grew up in Philly, and know nothing about live-in domestic workers in third world countries. So, I thought it would be interesting to watch. It wasn't. It was thee thinnest plot possible.It was an ego mastribation resume piece for a Cinematographer. Period. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. They were shallow roles played by B-grade performers."
ROMA,12 February 2019,8/10,"Man, I'm struggling with tthis one. It's well made, sincere and clearly personal. But I haven't felt as distant and uninvolved in a film since Moonlight. It's so self- conscious, self- congratulatory and self- important, it's destined to be one of those critics favourites that few people see and/or remember. In tge end it runs for a couple hours, looks good in places, contrived in others and is unlikely to have filmlovers watching and praising it in a decade, unlike A Quiet Place, First Man or Isle of Dogs. Oh, but did I mention, it's IMPORTANT?"
ROMA,28 January 2020,9/10,"ROMADirected by Alfonso Cuarón
Written by Alfonso Cuarón
Cinematography by Alfonso CuarónRoma is the story of Cleo, the maid of a middle-class family living in Mexico City in the early 1970s.Roma, first and foremost, is a film about the daily life of a maid as she balances her personal and professional lives, and how they drift inextricably together. She loves and cares for a middle-class family on the verge of being torn apart, as their father abandons them to elope, all the while dealing with the disappearance of the man in her own life, who leaves her three months pregnant. This is all balanced against the political strife of the Mexican Dirty War, as students and paramilitary groups battle in the streets, ultimately leading to the Corpus Christi Massacre.This film is almost paradoxical in its drama. We are at once distanced from the characters, literally and emotionally, by Cuarón's gorgeous monochromatic cinematography, while simultaneously drawn closer to them as their comparably unfortunate circumstances slowly unfold.Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo is expertly subtle in her glances, posture, and delivery. She does not say much, but all one must do to access her thoughts and feelings is to simply look at her. She is perfect.Cuarón's camera is always slowly panning, observing everything in its wide 2.39 : 1 aspect ratio. He shoots this almost documentary style, as we are very much observers in the unfolding dramas, and long shots allow us to discern the countless textures and details present in each location. Everyone is shown full-body throughout the film, which is why when Cuarón chooses to shoot a closeup on a character's face, we are suddenly thrust into their headspace, and are called to give pause to the fleeting moment.Each event in Roma feels ephemeral, as we are witnesses to events and times that are coming to their close, even as new ones are beginning. Roma is about the closing of chapters and the inevitable revealing of new ones, and how brokenness sets the stage for rebirth."
ROMA,8 September 2019,9/10,"Just enter the lives of this family and enjoy the atmosphere, the playing"
ROMA,16 January 2019,8/10,"Quietly and commonly tragic. That's where this film's beauty comes from. However, I would say that there is a degree of cinemanarrative dissonance in that the story being told is one of viscerality, triumph and sorrow but the visual language paints a different picture. Cinematically, the film has beautifully lit shots, masterful camera work and a silky slow pace. It is in this juxtaposition that the film falls short for me. The text and the visuals tell different stories, making the audience feel disconnected from the protagonist. But maybe that disconnection was intentionally done, asking viewers to question their perspective on the everyday tragedy that is so painfully common."
ROMA,19 May 2019,8/10,"I really don't know why people gave bad reviews to this movie.. Did we really watch the same movie?
I get that the movie is kind of slow paced, and aku little bit boring sometimes, but the story is unique and emotional. At first I was hesitant to watch this movie because of the review, but i decided to give it all try. And I'm so glad I did...
The main character (Cleo) is so on point, and I could feel her pain and emotions. She played this character like this is her actual life. It's amazing..
The story, although not too exciting but still give is a glimpse of a maid life back in the 70's, with a family of her employer, who become like her own family.
All the people involved in this movie deserve an award, and that's just the director or the cinematographer, but the actors, costume designers, and music arranger. Bravo!"
ROMA,12 December 2018,7/10,"Nice but boring (except for the ending and the lone plane flying overhead throughout the movie). Conscientious, well-intentioned, but no Fellini. Not even as moving as its two predecessors: ""Ilo Ilo"" (2013) and ""A Simple Life"" (2011)."
ROMA,2 February 2019,1/10,Don't waste your time with this.Dull dull dull.Did I say how dull it was?
ROMA,25 January 2019,4/10,"After having painfully slogged through this opus of the famous Mexican cinematographer, I hastened to check out the reviews. To my chagrin, the film has been showered with bouquets of lavish praise for the meticulous artistry of the camera, the painstaking attention to detail, the honesty of the actors, the juxtaposition of scenes, the acerbic and incisive social commentary. All that is good and well, but my reaction was of puzzlement and discomfort. Is that the intent of the director? Then he succeeded brilliantly.
From the very onset, I was not happy about the lengthy fascination with the sloshing of water onto the pavement. Peering at the screen, I noted such details as the image of the plane in the reflection. Aha! The minute and the monstrous meet. However, it was a bloody bore. The anarchy of the story line was bearable but not very beguiling. Who were the two young native women? Were they sisters, as they called each other ""manita?"" Who were the children and the women in that large and confusing building? Was that the father who drove up in the large automobile? The relationships were very oblique. Is that how we are to perceive them in our real life?
To the film's credit, the social commentary was interesting enough, with the scenes of the rich set versus the indigenous poor folk during the Christmas celebrations. But who was that person in the costume who sang a song in a language which I could not make out? I did appreciate the reconstruction of the Santa Cruz massacre. The reenactment of Cleo's labour in the very large hospital did capture my full attention in its gripping pathos. However, the whole did not successfully integrate the sum of its parts. Regretfully, I cannot really appreciate Roma as much as the reviewers would want me to."
ROMA,16 December 2018,3/10,"We have been big fans of Cuaron, which was the only reason why we sat through the first hour and a half, in hope for SOMETHING to happen. When it finally did, it was brief and just 'meh'. I respect the director's artistry, but the movie is definitely not for anyone except festival-goers and (pretentious) movie critics. The three stars I rated are for the main actress, who did a great job even though she's not a professional. In short, if you haven't been to Venice, Cannes and Sundance lately, skip this one on Netflix as well."
ROMA,31 January 2019,7/10,"I was hesitant to watch Roma based on the reviews that called it a boring film. But when I didn't have anything else to watch, I decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I knew the cinematography was going to be beautifully done but I didn't expect to be so interested in the story. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican or because I can understand Spanish or because I'm familiar with Mexico City. Whatever it was, the movie held on to my attention from start to finish. I really connected with Cleo too. She's a strong woman that kept a brave face through everything she'd been through up until she lost her baby. I enjoyed the connection the children had with her and the realness between Sofia and Cleo."
ROMA,28 April 2019,10/10,"It is a beautiful piece of art. Realistic, strong story, without exaggerating the events and making the protagonists a caricature of real humans. The people are real. They actions, reactions, interactions is what we see in real life.
At the same time lots of symbolism, signs that prepare us for the events in the film and keeping the viewer intrigued. I loved it."
ROMA,16 December 2018,4/10,"Because a native Mexican is the star, does not mean is an interesting movie. Mexican classism again present, but there is not a positive message, historic approach or deep cultural reference. We can only rescue the good art direction to understand family mexican lifestyle in one of the most know neighborhoods of mexico city.
Is offensive and bored."
ROMA,22 December 2018,8/10,"I watched it alone for the first half. And for the second half, my seven year old niece joined me. So what happened was I told her the gist of the story: that there is a protagonist who is a housekeeper to a family. And because English is not our mother tongue, I translated and simplified most of the conversations in the movie. What I found surprising was she was instantly immersed in the story. (Spoilers) Like she could relate to having a housekeeper, the poops of the dog not swept up at instant, the quarrel among siblings. Two things she could not relate to but I made her understand how sympathetic the situations were were the jerk who made Cleo pregnant but didn't hold himself responsible, and the father in the employing family committing adultery. My niece told me that she would be watching until the last 30 minutes of the movie so she can go to bed and sleep. But by the time the protests occured on screen, she was so tense she bugged me to explain to her what was going on. Then the labor happened. I reminded my niece it was past her bedtime yet she just decided she wanted to finish the movie. The beach scene made her gasp and panic she stifled her scream. By the end of it, I asked her if she liked the movie. She did. She appreciated it all that she asked me if the grandma wore the same clothes everytime and pointed out how the two youngest children were close and attached to Cleo. Really glad my niece wasn't present during that full frontal nudity in the first half.So for those people who are saying that this movie is for cinephiles only because aside from its technical excellence the story is mundane and will bore its viewers, my niece will defend it if she can."
ROMA,28 February 2019,1/10,The cinematography is good. But it has a flimsy plot. It's boring. The characters are uninteresting. Its one if the worst films I have ever seen. If only Netflix had spent the 24 million dollars to help the homeless instead of using it to promote this terrible film!
ROMA,20 February 2019,9/10,"Everyday that goes by after seeing Roma, something else comes back to me about the film. It's in the back of my mind, I see it's themes and message reoccur in real life situations or just remember a singular moment of technical brilliance in a film that is as much 100% technical brilliance as it is 100% performance brilliance.Firstly I'll pick out the obvious amazing feats of ROMA, cinematography, amazing, acting, endearing, tender and heartfelt and so believable. The production design is so good you'd be forgiven for thinking that this film was made in 1970 and forgotten about for 40 or so years. The finer details and attention to detail applied here. Everything is exactly how it was and you, the camera, the silent on looker of this time and place.The intimacy of the story is first of all rare for a film to be that confident to show such a story but also extremely impressive at its universal appeal. With this Roma does what the best of film as an art form can do, it can bring us together, it shows humans not as sperate beings, living separate lives, doing separate things but how what we all do, what happens around us, all affects everyone else's lives. While we may think we're living our own life but there's millions of others, other issues and they all weave in and out of each other. The most true thing to real life and yet the hardest thing to protray in film and Roma does it flawlessly.It is as much as a place and time as it is about humanity, as it is about a family, as it about domestic workers, as it about class divides, as it is about masculinity. These are all themes delt with everyday in our lives, in other media but what Roma does with this, how it takes difficult concepts and makes them flesh and blends them together into a beautiful human drama, with mostly none, new or unheard of actors, acting so true to real life your swept up in that atmosphere of it all.The fact Roma even got financed is a great feat. A black and white, slow paced film about a middle class in polictally instable Mexico in the 1970s would seem like it'd never be made. And it's here. Here in a time of self centered, social media crazed frenzies it allows us to take a step back and think about us as people as human beings with relationships and feelings.Now I wasn't raised in Mexico, I never had anyone like Cloe bring me up, it's not that standard in the UK middle class in the 21st century, I found something in Roma, yes the universal message but also the protrayal of family, of the fights between siblings and stories my parents would tell me. If someone else was to watch Roma they'd probably get a completely different and yet 100% personal moment for them. Even down to the little detail of the youngest boy saying ""when I was older"", the acute attention to how kids think and talk in a true representation of the utter genius of this incredible film.This is an incredibly important film and I hope is passed down and considered highly throughout the decades by its ability to defy any accessible barriers, everyone can get something completely personal from Roma and for me that's the true power of cinema."
ROMA,13 February 2021,10/10,"Although I am a Turco who has never been in Mexico, I felt like I witnessed a part of the life of a familly which took place 50 years ago in Mexico. Cuaron took his camera and went to past, increíble!
And also it has bitter feminist elements in the sub text."
ROMA,16 December 2018,6/10,"The good about this movie,, is just like real life,,, its not movie,, its real.. but also for people like me,, the movie is slow and kind of boring.. i think this movie can win oscar,, but in cinema,, most people won't like it.."
ROMA,18 February 2019,1/10,Don't listen to those who findthis movie amazing. It's an absolute bore fest. Another artsy movie that Hollywood dares for no reason.
ROMA,31 January 2019,2/10,"Clearly the viewer is overawed by the monochromatic, broad sweeping and idyllic cinematography of this vastly overrated film. However, beyond that, the viewer is presented with a cookie cutter story of an upper middle class early 70's era Mexican family complete with servants from a rural Mayan, Zapoteca or Nahuatl village. The middle class children bond with the servants, the mom alternates love and kindness with anger and condescension while the father carries on affair with a mistress. Small plot developments barely warrant attention such as the ever ubiquitous dog poop, the stereotypical boyfriend of the main servant who stupidly bores us with a martial arts stick moves while naked exposing us to his grotesque junk, but abandons her once pregnant. The devout Catholic grandma who tries to help and prays a lot.Nothing is really resolved in the movie other than to present this horribly predictable story that closes with a group hug! The martial arts scenes are a colossal waste of cinematic effort, while the supposedly dramatic swimming in the Gulf of Mexico at Vera Cruz is hyped up solely by the sound editor blasting the volume from very rough seas yet visually presenting - what? 3 foot waves! About the only amusing part is when the family picnics with an American family that likes to shoot guns but only drink cocktails when a forest fire starts. Now that was entertaining!Is this movie Oscar material? Absolutely not! Definitely not even really Worth watching the whole movie. Protesters shooting up with other people? Uhhh....run of what mill 3rd world everyday stuff. The title? Roma? What's the point of that? Later on, one reads that's it's the name of a neighborhood in Mexico D.F. Yet It's more widely known as Italian for Rome or the latest euphemism for Gypsies. Is that even remotely relevant to this cookie cutter story of self-inflicted injustice in a 3rd world country?"
ROMA,5 January 2019,9/10,"For the ones who say there is no story line maybe they should watch it again? If you want to see and feel the story, you will see it....and hopefully feel it too"
ROMA,6 July 2020,10/10,""" Existence is nothing but a shared experience of loneliness.""Roma is basically a story about a domestic worker named Liboria ""Libo"" Rodríguez, who looked after the director's family and their home in 1970s Mexico City. "" This is a film about reminiscence, useing of Black and white is according to director is looking at memory.The film is Cuarón's way of ""delivering an artful love letter to the women who raised him."" The story focuses on the crisis and catastrophe of life and how to overcome it. The film is built around situations rather than plot.The story unfolds a journey of a life. This movie reveals the lives of two women, one who is economically wealthy and one who is a domestic worker. Though their life standard is different but however their life story leads to a same direction. this is largely Cleo's story. Here we can see a father: Antonio, who is a doctor. A mother: Sofia, a biochemist. A not working grandmother: Teresa and four children of Sofia.
Cleo is one of two domestic workers, other one is Adela, in an upper middle-class family. She takes care of children, family, cleans the feces of dogs. Sometimes in these early moments, it feels like nothing happens at all. One sweetly realized scene sees the family literally just watch TV. Cleo joins them, maternally cuddling one of the kids and sharing in the simple joy. Everything was perfect in her life but one day outside of her duties, Cleo goes out on dates, falls in love and gets heartbreak. At one point, Sofia, fed up with her now-estranged husband, approaches Cleo and says, ""No matter what they tell you, women: we are always alone."" It's a lesson that Cleo learns after a single date with Fermín (Jorge Antonio Guerrero), a wannabe martial artist. Just as Cleo's life is about to change with an unannounced pregnancy. The family she works for is also going into its own crisis. The doctor Antonio left his family to live with another woman. After That the family sympathizes with Cleo and she continues to work for them and receives good medical care. But trouble ensues when Cleo goes on a shopping trip with Teresa, during a day of student protests; they know that such protests have been violently repressed, but this time the violence is worse than before, and Cleo and Teresa observe it up close. Cleo somehow thinks she is only responsible for her stillborn baby because she always feel guilt for it and never wanted that baby ""I didn't want her to be born"".. But the last scene marks it remarkable where Cleo resolve her conflict unconsciously. She knew that she doesn't know how to swim but somehow she rescued the children with the innate ability. That says if we want to do something we can.
The director used so many symbolization in that film beautifully. Like Water on the floor: The first scene appears he opening shot of water spreading across the garage tiles and it reflects a plane in the sky. Both somehow represents that life goes with the flow, it never stops for anyone. The ocean: a symbol of renewal and change.A scene also shows that the car is too big for the space and later sofia changed that car. Its somehow symbolizes that the life she is leading is not fit for her. Later she exchanged the car and it represents the acceptance of changing.Roma breaks the stereotype and inspires us to perceive our world from different angles.""I think I wanted to understand, to put the pieces together,"" the greatest lesson to be drawn from ""Roma."" We are never alone in our loneliness; with family, we share troubles and persevere. its understanding of the chaos of life, and its unerring respect for those who meet that chaos with love. Roma feels like a celebration of what it means to feel alive.
Roma is constantly reminding us that only certain kinds of people are allowed to externalize their anguish and perform their suffering in public - namely the very young and the very rich. The rest must bear it quietly, invisibly, alone. This is an exceptional movie, powerful and breathtaking, and beautiful."
ROMA,1 March 2019,10/10,"I'm seeing a lot of comments about the lack of story telling and the calmness of the movie but that makes sense. Because it is from the point of view of Cleo, who lives with an upper class family, she is distant from a lot of th apolitical upheaval which is why most of those events are in the background instead of taking center stage. I feel like this film is a commentary on class structures, explaining why most things seems dull and normal and that's the beauty of this film"
ROMA,22 December 2018,1/10,"I kept waiting for something to happen. It reminded me of PBS when they followed a family on Long Island around in the 70s. No emotional roller coaster am, just scenes of daily life with apathy all around."
ROMA,26 December 2018,7/10,"Not exactly my flavor of movie, but wow was this a piece of art. The cinematography, blocking, and story was very carefully and beautifully crafted. Amazing homage and story. It's slow paced and a slice of life, but everyone should watch this."
ROMA,29 January 2019,6/10,A noble and heartfelt curio of power relationships and acceptance of adversity that I never want to see again. The black and white cinematography emphasises a foreboding and lack of release that blankets this film from the first frame to the last.
ROMA,17 December 2018,9/10,"Roma is a film about life. It's about all of the beauty of the human condition as well as the brutality and suffering that goes along with it.The story follows a maid in Mexico City who tends to a well-off family and her experiences with them and the other people in her life. Through beautiful shot composition that add to a sense of realism, the plot moves like a flowing river. By the end, you will have gasped, laughed, cheered, and maybe cried with our main character Cleo.The film is so well shot and edited. It lingers and moves deliberately, always letting you soak in what it wants to show you. Even when things get tense with the odd natural disaster or near death experience, it never feels like it needs to move faster and get a reaction out of you. Plenty of times I got lost in the scenery and forgot about the characters on the screen. I felt like a trespasser into Cleo's life at times. In a pivotal scene in a movie theater, I started watching the movie the characters are supposed to watch and lost track of the conversation they had and I felt like I was intruding on their business. It felt like I was in the theater with them, sneaking bits if their conversation as if I was eavesdropping on them. To say the least, this film immersed me in its world so well. The sound design is minimal and adds to the realism. With the odd bit of song being sung or being played over the radio, but never as background music. The bare sound adds to the realistic atmosphere created and really lets the film breathe at times.This is a great film and definitely one I'll have to watch again soon. It was funny, tragic, and beautiful, just like how real life can be."
ROMA,10 February 2019,4/10,"Looking on IMDB, ""ROMA"" seemed to be the highest rated of the Oscar nominated movies. I've only seen ""A Star is Born"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".. plus I TRIED to watch ""Black Panther"" (action movies not my genre), but I think ""ROMA"" comes in 3rd place of the 3 I saw. I totally enjoyed A Star Is Born, but Bohemian Rhapsody was awesome!!! ROMA is just a simple story, that is in Spanish, with subtitles. Sometimes I didn't know who was speaking. Sorry Netflix... i was about 85% bored."
ROMA,5 April 2019,1/10,This movie was stupid!!! Just watched it cause of the oscars so I thought it would be a good movie but I was wrong...This movie is horrible.
ROMA,21 February 2019,9/10,"New film by Alfonso Cuaron, Roma, uses his brilliant direction of art and photography mainly in the scenes without sound, where the expression of the actors manage to convey a true feeling and realism to the viewer"
ROMA,24 July 2019,10/10,"I watched Tokyo Story for the first time recently...there was something about Roma that reminded me of that very human and powerful classic. Something about the technique. Every. Single. Scene. in Roma was striking, but particularly those ones where Cuaron just put the camera where he thought best and relied on that spot to capture the scene. It felt like Cuaron was trying to tell us that this is happening all around us, if we'd just stop our flight/plane passing over it we would notice. The hospital scene brought me to the edge of my seat with emotion. The dogs on the wall scene, the forest fire scene, and the mass martial arts training scene (and the few scenes Cleo's journey to find Fermin leading up to the training scene) all stand out as well. Could be the best shot 21st century movie I've seen. For me, 2018 brought some of the very best movies of the century in Roma and Burning."
ROMA,10 April 2020,5/10,"Yes it is black & white and so it will attract arthouse fans. Yes it is eye candy boasting beautiful photography. That said, as far as the storyline is concerned, Roma is flatter than a pancake, emptier than your average politician's promises, more boring than Thanksgiving with your in-laws. Waste of talent, waste of space, waste of my time. Don't let it be a waste of yours."
ROMA,23 March 2020,10/10,"What I should mention the most about this film is its beautiful photography. The ability to tell a simple story but that manages to reach a climax seemed very remarkable to me because it achieves it with its performances and the perfect development of its plot. This film is an undeniable visual poetry. Definitely, a masterpiece of Alfonso Cuarón and cinema in general. 982/1 000"
ROMA,22 July 2020,9/10,"It's a special movie really. If you are looking for a fun film to watch in order to be entertained - this is not your movie.
But pick any day that you fell you want to watch something different.
Not sure why the black and white feel to it but it was okay at the end.
Overall it's a great film. You almost never see movies like that."
ROMA,14 January 2019,1/10,Snooze. I tried to watch this. Too Artsy farsty for me
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"I saw this on a trip to Guadalajara on Dec.6th. and I will never regret having gone through all the trouble to catch this on the big screen. It's not just the amazing cinematography, the sound mix was amazing!!. The first half moves somewhat slower but it sets up the second half wich will most likely make you laugh and cry. Cuaron sets the movie in the turbulent early 70's perfectly capturing the feel of the times and it does make you (being mexican myself) wonder how much have things actually changed, how other people aside from our parents influence our lives and how painful, loving and powerful looking back can be.This movie deserves the reviews it's gotten and Cuaron deserves all the praise. Bravo!"
ROMA,22 December 2018,10/10,"It's not often that I see the same movie in a theater twice in one week. Certainly not one I can watch just as easily at home on Netflix. But this week I saw Alfonso Cuaron's ROMA twice on a big screen, and it's worth every moment. You have to let that film Some breathing space, see it in one session, note all the nuances. If you do, this film will reward you big time: unforgettable characters with several intertwined story layers, and amazing camera work. Not only it's the best film I saw in the 21st century, it probably made it into my all time top ten films. A true masterpiece, on so many levels. If you have a nearby theater that screens it, don't hesitate."
ROMA,18 January 2019,8/10,"It is a nice movie that made me think about what my life is about, whether I made wrong turns or not, and so forth. It's good if a movie makes you think like that. Some movies just blow your mind (like Fight Club), and this movie is more calm and slow, even though it provokes emotions too.
I found the following topics/ideas in the movie:
1. Life of the rich vs life of the poor. The family had 4 kids whereas Cleo couldn't have one. That could have been caused by her carrying heavy luggage while pregnant. Yes, she was part of the family, and even saved 2 kids. Still it was their life being lived, not hers.
2. Some things are common regardless of wealth. A man left the wife just like Fermin left Cleo. ""We, women, are always alone, no matter what they tell us"".
3. The revolution scene, especially the moment when women holds a dead body of her man, shows that life goes on. People are born and killed, and that's sad. But regardless of how painful and unfortunate your situation might seem, somebody's love one has been just killed on a street.The movie doesn't have any pathos. It just portrays real life. And it does that beautifully."
ROMA,25 January 2019,10/10,"Roma will be in my heart for a long, long time.Scenes that Tarkovsky or Antonioni would have loved to sign. Stunning performances. Humanity pervading every second. Life.I have a bit of difficulty typing as my eyes have not dried yet. Thanks, Cuaron, for these tears."
ROMA,16 February 2019,3/10,"Wow, this movie was so boring. There were so many long drawn out shots to ""set the mood"" of nothing happening. Water going down the drain, parking a car, girls drying glasses in the kitchen. What was the movie director thinking? This wasn't artsy, it was just...boring. Even if you can appreciate the movie, it won't be an entertaining or fun night. For that, pick something else."
ROMA,6 March 2019,10/10,"Illumination and sound can't be better, beautiful adaptation. The scenography is great no mistakes here, it's a portrait of Mexico in the late 60's."
ROMA,10 February 2019,10/10,Minimalist plot & amazing photography. Family ties beyond conventions against conventions that do not amount to much.
ROMA,26 February 2019,2/10,"Wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and let me tell you - record yourself washing some dishes, making some tea, go run some errands, and you have yourself a more exciting 'film than Roma. That is literally all it is. The movie is beautifully shot, the camera work and angles are a work of art I can totally understand that. However, there literally is no story. It's pretty much about life in the 70s in Mexico. I can understand it is Alfonso Cuaron's biopic of his life as a child living in these times. But not all life stories make for interesting viewing. It bore me to death I'm afraid, which is a shame because I do like Alfonso Cuaron's previous work, but this one really did lose me. I think it won all the awards for its originality, and the way it was shot is absolutely beautiful. But as a whole, the film lacked substance and failed to do what I believe films should always aim to do, and that's to entertain and engage the viewer. After all, if we just wanted to ""witness"" something beautiful and a work of art, we would go to the art gallery. I found the fly on my wall far more interesting than this film."

ROMA,22 February 2019,1/10,So boring and unremarkable. I've seen commercials on TV with better plotlines. Tries to be artsy and cutting edge. Just a waste of time and film.
ROMA,15 December 2018,6/10,"""Roma"", Alfonso Cuarón's newest film, is quite different from what made him famous for North American audiences - ""Gravity"" and ""Children of Men"". I personally found ""Roma"" tedious as well challenging to watch with its subtitles and black and white photography.The cinematography, done by the director himself, was beautiful, however, even if its subject matter was very mundane at times. The background activities were far more interesting than the foreground lives of this 1970s Mexican family and their live in domestic workers.I kept waiting for the story to start and engage me with a compelling narrative - a conflict between protagonists and antagonists - the core features of modern dramatic fiction. Unfortunately, none of these story telling elements could be found.If you were drawn to watch because of the science fiction accomplishments of this director, you will be disappointed. Alternatively, if you watch with little expectation, you will find some interesting and touching moments."
ROMA,29 July 2020,2/10,"After 10 minutes: maybe it's gonna get better.
After 30 minutes: ok maybe it's gonna get better somehow.
After one hour: sorry i don't wanna know how it's gonna be because watching an ant moving in a glass little box would be much more interesting than this.
All i know that a book should be interesting after a few pages, a film after a few scenes, but with this movie i've spent the most boring one hour of my entire life and couldn't continue watching and am sure there's something weird with the awards been given to it."
ROMA,17 May 2020,6/10,"I get that it's meant to be intimate and realistic, but to be honest it doesn't appeal to me. I think this film is more on the artistic side (and extremely pretentious).I can see why people would like it, and don't get me wrong I don't mind slow intimate movies, and this film has a few good moments in it as well, but this film is just not for me.If you're going to watch make sure you're willing to watch things like a pan going around the whole house and turning off lights and watching a cat pull into a driveway for a few minutes."
ROMA,4 March 2019,,"If this movie had won an Oscar, I would have been very disappointed. This movie just went on and on, with no purpose. The only part that intrigued me was when Cleo rescued the kids from drowning. I thought she was going to drown since she said she could not swim."
ROMA,24 February 2019,8/10,"""We are alone. No matter what they tell you, we women are always alone.""
A very good drama. I'm emotionally devastated."
ROMA,28 January 2019,9/10,"I felt asleep discovering some of my favourite movies. Slow and boring, visually stunning, a masterpiece. To see again and again. I love it."
ROMA,17 January 2019,8/10,Sorry I didn't get that .. why the film is named Roma ?
ROMA,17 February 2019,10/10,"Intelligent, engaging, striking and, above all, thought-provoking. Rome is a movie that will stay in your head for quite some time. It is cinema in its purest and sublime state."
ROMA,13 January 2019,10/10,"You ever wondered why people keep calling this movie a masterpiece?Alfonso Cuarón might be my favourite living director, jesus that was brilliant. Where to begin with this masterpiece...Well - to start - 'Roma' is one of the most beautiful films of the decade, every shot is masterfully executed, blocked, framed, and detailed. Cuarón himself was the cinematographer in this project, and he did a phenomenal job. You can't help but have your jaw on the floor the entire runtime. Right from the opening shot I knew I was in for something masterful. Cuarón's signature long takes were ever prevelant here, and each was as masterful as the last. Sometimes he lingers on a subject beautifully to exentuate a point, or makes a small adjustment to a shot - giving it a completely different meaning. The symmetry and pure brilliance of every single scene sends chills down your"
ROMA,14 January 2019,3/10,"Hard to add more, it is a really great disappointment, using black and whites to be considered ""art""... indeed the photography is good, but deserving no more than a short film not such a long, tiresome feature time, maybe that should be Cuaron's next step, and leave the feature films alone, he's definitely found his limit with Gravity, and when running out of ideas or serious projects, he just wanted to pay tribute to the place he grew up in, definitely nothing more than a whim with a lot of marketing behind it."
ROMA,2 March 2019,1/10,With all the rave reviews I can only imagine that there has been a sophisticated hacking of IMDB by someone who would benefit. Having watched this boring nothing of a movie I totally agree with all the one star raters. Pretentious bilge.
ROMA,3 March 2019,3/10,Want to give this movie a chance but the story is boring and I keep falling asleep I gave it 3 stars because it really does do a great job of putting me to sleep. Not sure why it was up for any awards other than boring.
ROMA,23 February 2019,3/10,"Isnt there a special category for forgien films. O thats right. This is Hollywierd we're talking about. The film is slow to start and frankly i never caught up too busy reading those subtitles since this is filmed in Spanish and black/white to boot. Now the real story will be when she gets (not wins) that Oscar. There is no acting only repeating her lines. And i can guarantee you SHE WILL BE HANDED OSCAR. Hell im surprised they dont give her a Grammy for her singing Lullabies. She was obviously picked for this roll and to play her part in Illegal Immigration Policys. I have heard she is running for Governor of California (as soon as she learns to speak English and gets her green card) I personally dont like Glenn Close but she is one hell of an actress. And yo think at her age and to have worked as hard as she has she would be willing to give up the chance at Oscar. Which is what she has done. Well she has all the fame and money she needs and needs no more. But WAIT thats not what Socialism and Illegal Immigration is about. Its about 1% of the Population working their asses off so the other 99% can share in their success. I mean just look at the wonderful things OAC has already done for New York. Those 25000 people didnt need those jobs. New York didnt need the millions and millions of revenue created from those jobs. But good OAC sure did show NYC how she thinks the USA should be. She certainly got her point across now didnt she.Next we will see this ""actress"" be handed the Oscar only to have it stripped away because of some stupid law. And who do you think is going to strip it. The same folks that gave it to her. She will be sadly used as a political pawn. Once she gets Oscar taken away the left will go nuts blaming the right. Can anyone say ""Jessie Smollett"" SSDD.Cant wait to see how this plays out for the next 2 years."
ROMA,30 March 2019,10/10,"Stunning campaign in some IMDB users to attack this film. I don't know how many trolls are here or if they probably have multi accounts to bash this with 1 star constantly...It's clear that many people who are used to POPCORN movies and has Netflix are just ignorants of cinema, when they see something different, their brains collapse. Maybe they didn't see any author movies in their lifes. They thought Cuaron would made another commercial nonsense popcorn eating thing like Gravity, but NO. He is an author, not a moron who makes films only for money.He made a masterpiece, ROMA, with real emotions, about childhood and mothers love. If you can't capture those feelings in a different film, then go back to watch mediocre movies where the plot is nothing but the same always. If you enjoy other types of cinema don't come here to show your ignorance.If you love cinema (all kinds), the realest cinema, with genuine emotions then you WILL AT LEAST ADMIRE THIS FILM. Period.10/10"
ROMA,26 January 2019,4/10,"Just didn't see what the big deal is with this movie but I guess some liked it for its black and white style. The story was very boring and depressing. No plot twists. Weak plot points, if at all. I never connected with any of the characters at any level. Looked like a high school video project as far as content."
ROMA,29 December 2018,7/10,O donemin siyasi durumunu hic hissettrimeden anlatmislar. Goruntu yonetmeni cok iyiydi. Guzeldi ama sonunu baglayamadilar.
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,The movie was very disappointing and a waste of time!
ROMA,14 April 2019,3/10,"I waited for something major to happen and it didn't. The movie is the definition of scam,all that hype for nothing."
ROMA,7 February 2019,7/10,"Let's start with the obvious: the movie is visually stunning. And not just because of how velvety yet intense the black and white picture is, but also because of how refined, powerful and creative the vast majority of shots is.And this mastery of image is far from being only a portrayal of craftmanship: it serves a deep storytelling purpose and, paired with what I believe is the best sound mix (like, ever), it gives enormous weight and strength to the whole filmic experience.Yet, more than something is missing.Mainly, this movie lacks courage. Nothing innovative is to be found in its themes, neither in its language, nor in its structure, nor in its direction.Furthermore, the acting is sometimes stiff, sometimes overdone, but never - never - convincing.What is left is a magnificent portrayal of an often-told story, a melancholic childhood memory which never becomes a universal tale, and is never characterised enough to acquire sufficient depth and gather enough interest.We, as spectators, simply pass by, admiring the wonderful view from above, attracted yet still quite distant. Just like what the passengers of the frequent planes seen in the movie would feel if they looked down at Mexico City from their tiny windows."
ROMA,10 January 2019,8/10,"I know 3 words of Spanish but loved this gem, so can only imagine how much better it would be if I didn't have to read the subtitles. The film grows under your skin and I couldn't believe how much it reminded me of my childhood. Different country and different time period yet the emotions were the same."
ROMA,11 February 2019,10/10,"Alfonso Cuaron's film is nothing short of masterful with beautiful landscapes, tremendous acting, and of course phenominal directing. The film tells us that memories good or bad can be a wonderful story regardless of the outcome. Kudos!"
ROMA,18 February 2019,2/10,"My wife can't watch a subtitled film, but I think she is missing out on some terrific movies. But not this one. I watched it in three stages (because my curiosity told me I must be missing something) and it didn't grip me, even when the riot scene happened. It tried to too arty and forgot about the storyline."
ROMA,17 December 2018,1/10,"Once upon time in mexico i think is better name for this film
What meaning of this film ????"
ROMA,29 January 2019,2/10,"There is no much to say , good photography , interesting ost and good acting of the extras but the storyline its poor , pretentious and boring.Another ""telenovela"" the difference is that ""Roma"" its in black and white ..... nothing more ....."
ROMA,19 January 2019,5/10,"From the very beginning when Cleo is cleaning the floor you can appreciate the quality of the visuals and the photography. It is beautiful and stunning. In other hand, the story is pretty boring and uninteresting. You dont feel anything that steals your attention from the characters and the situations they are living. Sometimes they even act in a very strange (like the man singing in front of the fire) or idiotic (like the mother when she left the kids with Cleo in the beach). So combining this 2 facts I give a 5 because I felt the movie was missing very important to attract my attention."
ROMA,1 January 2019,7/10,"From my perspective, this film is trying to tell us that no matter what kind of life we are living in, there will be a moment where you will find yourself inside that person. The cinematography for me was different than what we have seen in these recent years. The scenario is not 10/10 but I would advise you to watch it."
ROMA,15 December 2018,1/10,"I completely agree with Patrwright's review. This is a self-indulgent art film that never bothers to explore the morality of indigenous Mexicans essentially working as slaves. It's barely entertaining or meaningful. I forced myself to watch the whole thing and regret it. 5 stars for Cleo, 1 star for the film."
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,The story being told is sublime and raw. A film so captivating in a world full of big budget action and overly celebratised films. Truly special.
ROMA,30 December 2018,7/10,It's the type of movie filmmakers and film buffs appreciate more than the average viewer. I think you also have to be in the right frame of mind to truly appreciate Roma. Unless you're into slowly paced black and white movies with subtitles Roma might not for you. Alfonso Cuarón fans will love it
ROMA,28 February 2019,,"Thanks IMDB for telling me where the film is set and when. More than the film-maker did. But then, he knew didn't he, and why should he bother to tell all those of us who couldn't tell.A beautifully made film which left me puzzled as to what it was really for. A common fault of films written/produced/directed/shot/edited by one person, however technically and artistically skilled that person.A more informative presentation might have helped to make audiences more appreciative."
ROMA,18 February 2019,1/10,"If you're Catholic you might like this bloated piece of silliness. You're certainly going to need a priest to explain why this is a great film instead of a boring piece of tripe. Personally, I'd put it right up there with watching paint dry and ladies golf. Yes, it's that bad but for some reason it's caught the attention of some important critics. My opinion? Stock up on No-Doze."
ROMA,19 February 2019,1/10,"I asked my viewing companion to wake me up when this was over. That was a week ago and we both just started to open our eyes. This movie could put Ambien out of business, expect for the pseudo intellectual critics of course. They'll stay awake for weeks talking the philosophical import of Roma.........sorry, I just dozed off again."
ROMA,21 February 2019,5/10,"I saw this on Netflix and I don't think it had the same impact on me it has had for other people as a result. Not like Cuaron's other films at all. But some images are really powerful, and probably are more awe-inspiring at the cinema."
ROMA,15 February 2019,1/10,"You instantly recognize all the oscar baits the movie is trying to make. You really get it what is it about... but it is NOT enjoyable... But if you are sentimental or have an 'exquisite' (hate this word, btw) taste of movies,- you will adore it. I hated it and only could cure my senses with another watch of Big Lebowski... Check out 'Fyre' documentary - you'll have a LOT of fun!!! Best of luck to all of you critics))"
ROMA,8 January 2019,3/10,"I really wanted to like this. I should know better than to trust Peter Bradshaw, critic for the Guardian, but everything sounded right. I really was willing to give it every chance, even waiting for the tragedy that had Peter Bradshaw crying first time he watched it.The only tragedy with this film is that it is so tedious. The characters are two-dimensional. The plot, such as it is, is OK - it's a kind of everyday miserable life in Latin America if you're not in the posh classes. For servants, it can be rough, although not particularly for the ones in this particular household.Then there's the cinematography. I think someone else has mentioned the panning. It never stops. In the streets, in the house, the camera goes on forever, adding minutes of time that I will never get back, without adding anything to the story.The filming itself is nice and sharp, but that has the odd effect of making it feel consciously like a film set. Just too staged, and not at all that kind of fly on the wall feel you get from some movies that drag you into the characters' minds and lives.There's a sense of impending doom that the plodding plotline can't really pull off. To be honest, the whole movie could have done with a bit more tragedy, and maybe a bit less wooden acting. Yes, I know the one person is not a professional actor, but that doesn't make her acting any good, or believable.I regret watching this. The three stars are mainly because it's an interesting subject, and it does capture a bit of the zeitgeist of the early 1970s. But it could have been much, much better."
ROMA,8 August 2019,9/10,"I watched this film alone and I do not regret it. I am coming from a country with a lot of similarities with Mexico, my husband is from Europe and far from growing up in similar situations as the depicted here. I did grew up with the help of many wonderful women that did far more than to clean the house. I was deeply moved by the film. I can not stop thinking on those wonderful persons who gave me so much love. It just transport in time and had a lot of flash-backs about my own life... I guess people who grew in a different culture or another time may struggle to appreciate how genuine and beautiful in its simplicity this film is. That is why I guess many persons on the comments were not moved by it and did not like it. I really thank someone put the struggle of so many woman who work on the most hard conditions and often with so little payment to make us think about them. It is slow but I recommended on particular If you live it during the same time period and type of culture... or If you want to learn about it."
ROMA,15 February 2019,10/10,"Rome ', more than a movie, is a piece of life. A piece of the heart of Cuarón in which the Mexican, in a prodigious exercise both in form and substance, and combining a sincere nostalgia, a great claim component, and an emotional scale as dazzling as the amalgam of grays in his photography, which is not afraid to drastically change from the tender to the heartbreaking, it makes an eternal secondary in real life an unexpected protagonist. An incidental thread that serves as an excuse for the director to capture on screen an era, a setting, a socio-political climate, textures, an amalgam of memories and a veritable whirlwind of sensations on the surface. A sample of unbeatable cinema, unique and unrepeatable that invites us to observe, judge and remember with its architect a brief passage of its existence with the greatest authenticity; which, in the times that it runs, is something unpayable."
ROMA,27 January 2019,7/10,"It's like The Help, but in Mexico and no one sh!ts in a pie."
ROMA,11 May 2019,8/10,"I've read a lot of the reviews and most of the people complain about being boring, stupid, non sense, etc.Those are the same kind of comments I've heard from friends (I'm writing from Mexico City), and it wasn't in my plans to watch this movie. However one night I had no better choices and decided to give it a try.It's partially true that the plot is weak. But I think that's precisely the point the director wanted to make. Before watching this movie you have to get rid of stereotypes all together, and simply enjoy with an open minded attitude. Because this one is not the well-known formula most of the people like to watch in a movie.It's basically about the life of a maid in the early 70's in Mexico. How she fits into the family, the sort of problems she deals with due to the lack of academic education and common sense, and finally, the way society worked in that time. But yeah, the maid is the main character of the movie.So, for starters, if you don't find anything appealing about knowing how a maid lived in Mexico City 50 years, go do yourself a favor and don't be stupid enough to watch this movie, expecting the adrenaline of the Avengers or such, if you know what I mean.However if you're like me, who happened to live his childhood during that time, then maybe it is worth watching. But you need to understand there is actually no plot. It is basically the introspective of the life of someone, as regular as a maid. Nothing truly amazing about that. She doesn't fight the super bad guys, neither becomes a rock star or a rich software developer. It's 1971, it's Mexico City, and again, it's a maid from Oaxaca, one of the poorest states in Mexico.Overall I could not rate the movie over 8, not because it is not good. It is indeed. But I trend to keep higher ratings for movies that truly make me wonder about something. This one is not the case. But I cried like a baby when I saw this, and probably you will to.Hope this feedback can encourage others or prevent more disappointed ones, depending on your case. Cheers."
ROMA,22 January 2019,6/10,"...that's all I got. A year in the life of a maid in Mexico, and the family she works for. Several gripping scenes, but then no follow up. I just never was fully invested emotionally. Maybe check it out again in a few years and get a better perspective. Also, if I want to see numerous shots of dog waste, I'll walk by my neighborhood park."
ROMA,29 March 2019,4/10,"What a disappointment, where's the story ...really where's it"
ROMA,9 December 2018,3/10,"No. Pointless and meandering first 80%, so you get dulled (yes some good moments that mean nothing) so the 2 shockers at the end have more impact.I realize their trick: Netflix KNOWS no one will sit through this crap at home to get to the big ending. SO - they put it in theaters where you are captive and have a better screen and sound. Then everyone will read the GOOD reviews and sit through it at home. I won't say those last 2 big scenes aren't great - they are - but only in contrast to the stupefying boredom of the first 80%, and only because they use the cheapest ""trick"" in film - to have death and children mixed together. Thays the easiest and dumbest ploy to get you to ""feel.""Skip it. See something better."
ROMA,26 January 2019,8/10,"Full of life in every shot, Alfonso Cuaron has proven that he is one of the greatest directors of all time.
Deserved every nomination and it's going do dominate the Oscars for Sure."
ROMA,31 December 2018,9/10,"I watched two other movies that where nominated for best foreign film 2018 (one beeinng from my own country, both filmed in B&W) and I have to say Roma had the strongest impact on me.
This story about two women at the end of opposite spectrums in terms of social class and life style, struggle with similar life blows - betrayal by loved ones, isolation and fear. What draws you in is the intimacy and simplicity of the camera work and also the plot. Street vendors and dog poo carry larger meaning than usually as they intensify memories of sounds, smells. The film is filled with stills of naturemort scenes, hypnotising the viewer and giving it plenty of time to process the significance of these moments. It's as if viewer is lifted into a children's and the servant's perspective, cutting therefore all the rest of the noise out. The camera work is at times literally as a pause on flashbacks, a meditative reflection. The film inspires us to look back into our childhood and to remember the people there, the stories and characters that often go unnoticed, disappearing into the void of past."
ROMA,2 May 2020,7/10,"This film is not plot driven. Because it's not plot driven each scene holds the viewer for longer then your usual film. I feel like with most films it's one scene and there's a rush to get to the next, always looking ahead to what's going to happen when the scene is over. This film is different in that it takes it's time for you to get to know and understand it and draw your own conclusions from it. It is a slow burner with no real goal or end point in sight other that just being. And for most people's lives I think that's realistic. From day to day most of what we do is pretty mundane with extraordinary moments thrown into the mix. This film makes the mundane beautiful. From the running of the tap, to the rain tapping on the window to the time consuming chore of turning all the lights off at the end of the day, you feel like you're really there.
This film was really reminiscient of 'The Florida Project', one of my favourites, The acting was really superb and at some points during the film I forgot it was fiction and it was like watching a real life account of someone's life.
I found this film really comforting in many ways. One of the loveliest scenes was when all the family were on the sofa watching a movie and Cleo joined in. There was something really homely and inviting about it which was pretty incredible considering it was black and white. And because it was in black and white it made every other sense heightened. You could hear every background noise, every smell and sense every atmosphere. There were many points throughout the film where I was acually imagining the colours. Lighting also played a really key part too, demonstrating the level of ambience that permeated the film,
I found this film really calming in a lot of ways which is why when it drew its conclusion it was even more hard hitting then I expected.Superbly acted, superbly shot. Worth a watch."
ROMA,18 February 2019,3/10,Painfully slow isn't a term I'd usually use as I'm a fan of many slow developing movies but Roma takes it to an extreme.Nothing brings the audience in until the 50 minute mark.This movie is overhyped for being an artsy film but there are many others available to invest your time in.
ROMA,1 February 2019,6/10,"The cinematography, filming,editing is great and Cuaron deserves a huge bravo for that.Director really shows us how skilled he is at his job. Unfortunately it feels that the movie is like a boring documentary,I actually got bored by the story and could not get attached to film protagonists. The technical aspects of the film is great like it was with Gravity but other than that it's ""hollow"". The black and white filming is also good but I prefer ""Cold War"" for this year Oscars."
ROMA,31 July 2019,1/10,...one of the worst movies ever made. I mean...what is the point of this? That is all.
ROMA,27 December 2018,6/10,"The reason critics love this film is that the camerawork is stunning and it has many subtle allusions. If you love to study the nuanced choices great actors make then watch a different show.I was pleasantly surprised that the black and white photography added a crispness to the imagery that shows off what a high definition TV can do. But I was greatly disappointed that no theatres showed it the launch week in Calgary (Dec 21, 2018).The story is filled with symbolism an English teacher like me will love. But the extended male nudity will deter much classroom usage.And the plot? Most people crave a problem that worsens before it gets resolved. Many tiny problems here have no development, an opportunity missed in favour of seeming ""realism"". It ends up coming across like a documentary before music and narration have been added. A hundred years from now kids will be refashioning this film with a score, which it does not have, and some voice over, to see if more tension can be created. My guess is that it will become a film-class darling. Until then..."
ROMA,2 January 2019,6/10,"This was a beautifully shot master raft from Alfonso Cuarón with the kind of gentleness that you will see from the likes of Steven Spielberg in the film Schindler's List, and many other films where they resonate as highly personal. From the opening to the closing you can see the kind of detail that was put into the steady objective view that Cuarón laces throughout the entire film. The issue here lies within the script. Although I generally enjoy these kinds of character films, I found myself caring very little for the female lead despite her quiet and thoughtful performance. I wish that the kind of care and patience in each shot was translated to the script because it felt like it was dragging at multiple points in the movie. Reluctantly, I watched this movie in four sittings because I found that I cared very little to finish it other than the fact that it will be highly relevant come Oscar season. Expect to see this film take home some big statues including Best Director and Best Foreign Language Film, but don't make any bets on this thing taking home Best Picture. This does not carry the same weight and intensity as other films released this year, nor does it have the staying power to make it resonate with future (or present day audiences)."
ROMA,2 March 2019,5/10,"Many reviews say the movie bored them, or that they felt nothing after having watched it. This is by design. When you are done with the movie, you feel just like the people in the movie, and you are supposed to relate to that.. you've been tricked."
ROMA,15 December 2018,5/10,This film is beautifully shot and though in black and white looks very colourful. Long shots give you every opportunity to appreciate the scenes. But for me this was a very incomplete movie as it is ultimately very dull. It reminded me of looking through a family album of great photos but like most family albums they are really only of interest to the family involved.
ROMA,17 December 2018,7/10,"Scenario: A mosaic of events, there is no main plot.This fact itself makes you say ""so what""?
Characters are shallow and not explained, unbelievably given how long the duration of the film is. For example, why do the children love one maid over the other? What was the relationship between the mother and her husband before the abrupt and inexplicable (at least to the viewers) abandonment?
Pseudo-feminism cliche: good women (the heart of the family and of the country) vs bad men (they are heartless and destroy everything). Open minded upper-class people, how are large enough to consider maids a true part of the family. In the 70's Mexico. Yeah, right...
Positive aspects of the film: Impressive representation of the 1970 Mexican times. Excellent photography. Many scenes with masterful cinematography (eg the scene at the hospital and that at the sea).Summary: a good movie. No more than that. Very overrated. I was kinda bored watching it..."
ROMA,8 January 2019,6/10,A sad story in black and white makes the story even sadder. Is there a story? You look at the sad live of a upperclass woman and the even sadder live of a servant. After half a hour the story begins. Just on the moment that i thought about leaving the cinema !!!
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"Technically is beautiful, a black and white that calls more to look beautiful, it is captivating and emotional, it is impossible to imagine this film in color. The simplicity of things, which are accompanied by a powerful message in between are even more shocking and leave you speechless. It's impossible to talk about the narrative, technical and visual achievements of this film as a whole without mentioning them when you write about them.One as a Latino can identify and feel very close to the story, but the most impressive thing is that the film speaks directly to the intellectual reasoning of each of us so that the film sounds like a social echo that amazed our feelings with a series of facts that, beyond looking real, can be done. It is a reality reflected in a fiction.Since Blade Runner 2049, I haven't been deeply moved for while."
ROMA,5 January 2019,3/10,"Big Cuaron's failure by forcing each of his memories from the 70s one scene after the next. Acting and the ending were the only good thing. Sounded like Cuaron saying ""Do you remember how the cars didnt fit in the garages? Do you remember how the garbage truck passed with the garbage man ringing the bell? Do you remember how the clothes were washed? Do you remember the movie theatres?.. Do you remember going to watch the movie? Do you remember the magazine stand? Do you remember..? And ...? "". Disappointing."
ROMA,30 December 2018,10/10,"So much to enjoy here.
Beautiful acted, perfect pace and so good to watch a b&w film, so much colour."
ROMA,24 February 2019,3/10,I went into this movie with an understanding of Mexican history but this movie was a whole lot of nothing. I really can't believe that this won the golden globe for best picture. In addition the direction was disjoined and you were having to wonder what was actually going on and what you needed to pay attention to and if you were missing anything....but you weren't.
ROMA,20 September 2021,1/10,This is the perfect movie if you need help falling asleep at night.
ROMA,12 May 2019,9/10,"This is a beautiful movie with a sweet and sad story done in a, to many, unusual style.There are many who don't like it. And that's fair. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. It offers something quite different than Hollywood movies which is a low key story from the common/lower ends of a Latin society. It's not about being pretentious it's about the expectations you have for a movie. If you watch movies for the plot then it likely isn't a movie for you. This is a movie about low key storytelling.It's an acquired taste much like other kinds of culture. Most people who love pop music probably wouldn't like classical music. That's not because it's bad it just doesn't live up to what they except from music. This is the case with this movie. It's not a movie that leaves you contemplating life or a lifechanging experience or a story you just have to dig deeper into, it is just the foundation of what all movies are in a sense: a story. Without all the glamour and extra things we are used to (for example there's no music to emphasise anything anywhere). The dialogue is simple, and we are simply passengers in this little story.We are just so used to movies having the classic disposition of build up point of no return climax etc with main character development or plot moving in one direction but that's not all a movie (or life) is. Sometimes stories are circular and the profound experiences that we do have end up leaving us where we began. Things change but they also don't. Life doesn't always progress forwardly, but it's always moving whether in circles, forwards or backwards.People say it's boring and I think that's wrong. It's not an exciting movie, but it's well done and it isn't boring. I can rarely watch a movie without checking my phone or getting boring but I barely blinked. I found the story to be captivating and beautiful and intriguing. This felt like a real story that could go anywhere. It was not predictable and it was well told. It isn't about that big plot twist or culmination in the end, it's just a movie moving at a slow pace which isn't trying to reach and overarch anywhere.A great and beautiful movie, but atypical and not something you should just put on to watch if you're bored. This movie is specifically not hollow entertainment and it's also not grandiose. It's low key and very simple and in many ways it's a movie without all the ""extra"" stuff which is usually used (elaborate plot, music to emphasise, classical movie split). And ironically it's because this movie is *just* a movie without all the things we're so accustomed to that it's difficult for many people to enjoy. It doesn't meet what people except of movies, but if you let go of your expectations of what a movie is or how it should be and just watch it for what it is, it's a very beautiful movie."
ROMA,17 February 2019,3/10,Typical Oscar nominee...in that the art form is everything and entertaining the viewer is forgotten . films are meant to be entertaining and that is 2 hours of my life I won't get back.Lots of long shots about nothing....just a lingering shot in which maybe a plane will fly over. Sadly nothing to hold your interest as no discernible story lines to latch onto or characters to feel something for. The film ended and I don't even realise which I guess sums it up. Think the fast forward button is the best accompaniment to this picture.If you suffer from insomnia then maybe one for you....
ROMA,18 January 2019,3/10,"I get that this movie looks good and is well directed, actors give a good performance and all that but it's a boring movie overall. You wait for something to happen but nothing that interesting actually does. If you're looking for an Arthouse type flick then maybe you'll enjoy it. Not for me. Don't believe the hype."
ROMA,12 December 2018,7/10,"I just saw ROMA at the Orpheum. I'm not too sure what to make of it just yet. I either need more time to realise more or I will stay with my initial gut feel about this film's meticulous production design and editing with extraordinarily real character portrayal.Whether I invested in those portrayals I can't yet tell you. It was like a fastidiously well edited home movie. Immersive and real but at the same time, a very narrow narrative and story.It truly does makes you feel you are living in the grit of metropolitan Mexico in 1971. The attention to detail, the background action and characters, the extreme realism transports you to another time. You can smell the smoke, dust; even the detergent that cleans the pots and dishes.If you read the crits on this film you may read that some believe this to be one the best films of the decade or some such, but the reality for me was that ROMA was more of a tea ceremony. Slow, observation and a mindful diversion. Not a narrative that I bought and that affected me.ROMA is however incredibly well made and purposeful. Though I do wonder why it was released in washed out monochrome. Like I said, I just don't know what to make of it."
ROMA,13 December 2018,7/10,"I just saw ROMA. I'm not too sure what to make of it just yet.

Slow, observational and a mindful diversion; and sadly not a narrative arc that I bought and that affected me.As this is a heartfelt tribute to retell the days of director, Alfonso Charon's childhood in Mexico. The length of the memory strings that pull his heart are longer for him than they are for the viewer.The languid pace of the film though conjured up two stories I love: those of novelist John Irving in his contemplative and swirling stories of family and consequence (GARP, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES); and Coppola's ode to Tokyo, LOST IN TRANSLATION. The latter was spruiked by a timeless soundtrack which helped me absorb and appreciate the characters so much. While Cuaron uses some excellent in scene, prac. musical bites (eg YELLOW RIVER and 1970's overplayed MAMY BLUES), the lack of soundtrack extinguished the sense of unity and aural theme (save the concophounous background splatter).ROMA is however incredibly well made and purposeful. The realism is a spectacle. Though I do wonder why it was released in washed out monochrome. My daughter once asked me ""Dad, when you were a kid, could you see in colour too?"" Yep we all sure did and we also shot in colour didn't we.Like I said, I just don't quite know what to make of ROMA."
ROMA,27 February 2019,8/10,"Sometimes we forget that not only action and violence make good movies. It's a beautiful and a good story, not quite a good script, but you need to connect to the characters so you can feel what they're going through and if not, you miss the whole point of this story and you're only gonna see the perfect esthetic and photography."
ROMA,8 October 2020,10/10,"Roma is a nostalgic film that takes us to a time where architecture and science was the future. Written, directed, (Co)produced, edited, and shot by Alfonso Cuaron in the beautiful Mexico City. Described as a semi autobiographical project, Cuaron handles this project with experimental finesse that reminded me of Kubrick's opening shot of the Shining. The settings quietly tell a story as clear as the dialogue between the characters. Shot in black in white and running just a little bit over two hours, Roma captivates the audience with his usage of space and depth.The opening shot is that of a closeup of the driveway, then there's a slow constant rush of water. The location is still not fully disclosed to the viewer, all you can see is a reflection of the open sky. The shot gave me the feeling of being at the bottom of a well, trapped. Then a plane soars across the sky followed by more and more suds of soap. A beautiful shot of space and reflection. It is also at this time we are introduced to the main character Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) and the family dog Borras.Cleo and Adela (Nancy Garcia) both live in maids who work for the family. Throughout the film there will be more and more social identifiers that show a separation from the family. I get the feeling there is a Jim Crow type of law in place or maybe a caste system. The family they work for aren't the only family who have live in maids. Cuaron does a beautiful and subtle way of depicting it's normality. After Paco (Carlos Peralta) leaves Pepe (Marco Graf) on the rooftop and Paco and Cleo are staring off into space. The viewer is staring off into the distance of other rooftops of other families who live just as they do.For some reason I find a strong sense of New York City and Tokyo when I look at little details. Sure every city has an alleyway but not every city is known for their rooftops. The art deco structures and designs seen in the movie are beautifully infused with rich Mexican history.The Family, is made up of the mother Sofia (Marina de Tavrina), Dr. Antonio (Fernando Grediaga), Sofia's mother Teresa (Veronica Garcia), the eldest son Tono (Diego Autrey), their middle son Paco, Sofi (Daniela Demesa), and of course little Pepe. Sofia and Dr. Antonio work, however what seems to be a constant strain, and lie, in their relationship is that Antonio has pending business in Quebec.Sofia is a chemist and she grew on me. Her hard exterior is due to her husband's absence and infidelites. There's one scene when Sofia comes downstairs and speaks with Cleo and Pepe before Antonio comes down. She mentions to Cleo he can be late, which I believed referred more to Dr. Antonio than Pepe. He comes down and says one word to Cleo and Sofia gives him the quickest and most disgusted look. It's subtle and fast, because Sofia is clearly not the person to overshare her personal strife with the help. However, by the end of the movie you realize she is a woman of great dignity and value. By leaving a situation she plays a sign of strength to Cleo.When Cleo tells Sofia of her pregnancy with Fermin's (Jorge Guerro) baby, there is a moment I with Cleo feared she would be thrown out. Sofia instead embraces her and even takes her to her doctor appointments. On the way to an appointment Sofia purposefully squeezes Dr. Antonio's car between two vehicles on the road. She waves it off as an honest mistake to the drivers whose cars have been hit, but how else would she get away with it. This car is also a vehicle in the sense as it's something important to Dr. Antonio.Dr. Antonio and his prized car are first introduced in what could be described as a music video from the audience's perspective, but as a wrestler's entrance to the character's in the story. He slowly drives in with his cigarette and oversized luxury car. At one point he stops and adjusts the car and continues down the now narrower alley. Once he parks he exits from the passengers side, an inconvenience that would annoy any person. Once again Cuaron has us examine the smoking doctor. He's clearly going through the stereotypical depictions of a midlife crisis.It is later revealed that along with the shiny new car, Dr. Antonio has a new girlfriend in the city. He is spotted by Tono and Cleo who keep the incident a secret. Dr. Antonio is seen briefly again at the end and when Sofia tells the children she's leaving him, I don't feel bad.The scene where Sofia tells the children she's divorcing Dr. Antonio is an amazing blend of emotion. The kids are sitting around eating ice cream and Sofia breaks the news. Paco takes it the hardest crying, but the rest of the kids take it well. Paco was the middle child until Pepe came around, but he is now the middle male child. It's a coming of age moment for one child and a new bedroom to the other.Though she is not a part of the family Cleo is there to witness it all; from their morning breakfast to Sofia destroying the car after a night of drinking.Cleo and Adela do have personal lives and some freedoms. They are allowed to visit to go to the theater, which is beautifully built and designed. In this era Cuaron also highlights that going to the movies was an experience just as grand as going to a play. Once inside the theater extravagant architecture is shown in the distance and a wide screen. This could possibly be another reason why this film is in black and white, using new forms of depth and space played in the background, movies today are oversaturated and gaudy displays. But we still like it.One person who is constantly present is Teresa, another great player in this ensemble cast. During her trip with Cleo and the driver Ignacio (Andy Cortes), they are beautifully overlayed by soldiers gearing up to take on protesters. Now Cuaron does not really use a digital overlay, as it's not what he wanted to clearly avoid in this project. He simply has the soldiers trucks and equipment shot upstage as the group walks downstage behind them. It's clear that the troops have no quarrel with the middle class, they're focus is on the students. Once inside the crib store it appears the sound of chaos outside is non-diegetic as everyone continues to shop. Suddenly a group burst in and shoot a man in front of the shoppers. The camera pans and we see Fermin pointing a gun at terrified Teresa and Cleo. Fermin and Cleo are frozen in this chaos as he is faced with a decision. Fortunately he decides to take flight and is off to live a dangerous life of violence. Once Fermin flees, Cleo's water breaks.For some strange reason the color of what is supposed to be the amniotic fluids reminded me of B Horror movie blood in black and white setting. I haven researched amniotic fluids but I thought they were clear and it looked like it might've been a pepto bismol pink or orange. Who cares it's in black and white? It's just something that stood out to me amongst my heartbreaking for Cleo. Fermin had already shown signs of possible domestic abuse and psycho-fanaticism.Cleo and the group now must dodge madness and get her to the hospital. A sad moment for Cleo that leaves us hopeful for her. Once at the hospital Cleo is taken to a room as Teresa assists the nurse with what little personal information she knows about her. Once in the examination room, Cleo is transferred to an emergency surgery room. The doctors begin performing surgery and they remove a quiet baby. It is later revealed that the baby is stillborn. Cuaron once again finds beauty in the madness as there is a shot of Cleo's sweating face and it appears the focus is on her breast and then in the distance we see her baby. Who would she be a mother to? Who would she nurse?This is later revealed when Cleo travels with the family in the final family ride in Dr. Antonio's abused prized possession. When Cleo turns her back to take care of one of the other children Paco and Sofi swim and get pulled out by a strong current. Cleo rushes back and reaches and grabs both of the children out of the waves. Once on dry land Sofia returns and Cleo confesses that didn't want the baby to be born. She begin crying and Sofia tells her they lover her, everyone joins in. They all cry together. Once we return the family and Cleo go back to their routines and we are left with almost a reversal of shots showing us that it is time for the viewer to leave. A feeling reminiscent of when Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is about to end. We are then left with the view of the exterior. I'm not sure if it's to allude to passing to another side but the ending is overtly positive. Everyone is ready for a new beginning.This is an excellent film and has elements that different crowds can identify with inside of the film and outside. At times it also feels the fourth wall is blurred and then just like Cleo we are pushed out of the fantasy and into another dream-like sequence, a very controlled dream. For example Professor Zovek plays someone with a cult like following. Perfect role for professional wrestler (Latin Lover) to play. Sofia and Cleo are both strong women who will persevere despite their situations. Finally there's Pepe, the dreamer in all of us and possibly Cuaron. With all the stories he tells, you hope he becomes a great storyteller."
ROMA,11 February 2019,7/10,"My family is from Mexico D.F. and from a middle class environment and many of my friends! They have lived in Mexico since the late 30's up to now and never have I witnessed that they care for a pregnant indigenous servant!!! On the contrary, the minute they discover they are pregnant, they are dismissed! I would enquire why and my answer was that Mexico had good Social Security hospitals and that the families couldn't put up with hiring these people with all the children they'd keep on having!!!"
ROMA,22 December 2018,4/10,"I understand why this movie is a work of art. I just don't know why it is a work of cinematic art. We are watching cinema, not video art.Underlying cinema is a story. The story has characters, that represent the complexity of the human condition - they have hopes, disappointments, successes and failures. They have different traits.Roma is a work of visual art. It has no story that captivates you. It has no characters that have any real sense of depth or complexity. If it's leading actress wins the Oscar it will be a shame. She was just a doll in Cuarón's autobiography.In a nutshell - it is boring.The leading movie critic in israel called it one of the most important movies of the century.I think the ""king has no clothes""."
ROMA,18 April 2019,8/10,"Simplicity is Art SublimeWhat comes across as striking about this movie is its unparalleled cinematography as well as direction. The real worth of art can probably be realized when it is stripped of its frills and façade. Roma is simplicity personified but that does not stop it from being profound and sophisticated. In a nutshell, Roma is a story of a house help who works for a middle class family with four kids Paco, Toño, Sofi and Pepe,their mother Sofia and father,Antonio,a doctor who falsely claims to go to Quebec for research,leaving behind his family in lurch. The family is at the verge of falling apart albeit Cleo and Sofia are able to eke out a life of their own.One would perhaps attempt to find traces of kitchen-sink realism in this masterpiece but that seems limited only to the trope.Devil is in the detailThe wispy trance-like state that clouds the commonplace for that matter even burnt and broken things is ethereal. For instance, the manner in which the broken jar that was raised as a toast to the new year and Cleo's baby or the man who sings against the backdrop of fire somehow symbolize peace, hope and aplomb even in the eye of storm. Who would have paid attention to minute details like cleaning up dog ordure or the rubbing and scrubbing of floor reinstituting the dignity of menial labour or even exalting it,painstakingly crafted, emanating a sublime aura. It revives many images from the past such as the scene outside the movie palace with balloon sellers crying their wares and the puppeteer's words ""no strings, no tricks"" quite poignant at this juncture as Cleo who has been forsaken by her lover almost resembling the puppet bone man.Reminiscing the turmoil ridden periodSet in 1970s Mexico city, the movie provides oblique glimpses into the period of civil strife and dirty war in the state which resonates at the domestic front too with the severing of relations between the husband and wife, also Cleo and Fermin who professes relentless loyalty towards martial arts but chooses to abandon her the moment he hears about her pregnancy. When all the male figures have fled, one witnesses the germ of new bond which momentarily transgresses the master servant relationship.Critics aver that Cleo hasn't been given much agency,perhaps, Alfonso Cuarón tried keeping Cleo's character closer to the reality,a persona who is gritty yet chooses to not to express much in front of her superiors adhering the norms. Nevertheless, her interactions with the younger lot is unrestrained,especially her tête-á-tête with Pepe.One of the remarkable scenes in the movie is when Cleo is doing laundry and Pepe and Toño are playing a make belief game. Pepe having been shot by his brother refuses to speak as he is dead figuratively.Cleo too becomes a part of this mystic make-belief and says that she likes lying like that possibly letting her inner feelings flow thereby acknowledging that she too likes taking a break. Superficially, it seems to be Cleo's portrait which it indubitably is,herein lies the craft of the maker Alfonso Cuarón whose portrayal of the character is completely contextualized that the line between the character and the context or the content and the form is obfuscated.Alfonso Cuarón's magnum opus is a cinematic legacy for posterity just like Ingmar Bergman's and Satyajit Ray's works, timeless and universal in appeal."
ROMA,9 January 2019,9/10,"I'm going to be honest and say I wasn't expecting a good movie. Yes the beginning is slow, but you start to get engaged and start enjoying what's happening, I'm from Mexico so it was like traveling in time to when those things used to happen. It's very good if you pay attention and stop thinking about how boring/slow the movie is. The emotion is there, the feelings of a mother losing a child she was scared to have, the acceptance, the grief. I would've liked another ending though. It was very good overall."
ROMA,5 February 2019,5/10,I want everyone to know that this movie is overrated
ROMA,23 February 2019,5/10,"I really tried to get into this movie, especially given all of the awards and accolades. But this film is too slow, the storyline is pretty dull, and I'm not a fan of black and white for no reason. I guess the cinematography is beautiful but that's not really why I watch a film. I'm afraid this is another example of Hollywood or movie makers being in love with themselves and their own work. This will probably win lots of Oscars and it will be another one of those movies where I don't understand why it wins. It reminds me of Moonlight which was a decent film but not worthy of Best Picture."
ROMA,2 March 2019,2/10,"I kindly recommend this to anyone who loves staring at nothing, through a still camera, for at least half of this film. Mister Alfonso Cuarón, the director, shows as things and people doing ordinary things without or with minimum dialog that will put you very fast to sleep. So, if you have trouble sleeping I also recommend this movie, is very efficient with no side effects."
ROMA,17 March 2019,9/10,"This film which won the Best Direction and Best Foreign Language film at Oscar was really good enough to win Best Picture. Probably being a Netflix film rather than a theatrical release, the Academy was somewhat bound to be biased against it.The director is in complete command of his cinematography, camera movements and frames. The movie achieves a perfect balance of realism and grandness. The story of women and families which they hold together in 1970s mexico is shown in a moving and hard hitting manner. The third act which begins with the 1971 student protests in Mexico and the massacre that ensued leads to an enthralling climax.A highly recommended film for all cinema lovers.My rating: 9/10"
ROMA,20 January 2019,9/10,"Roma can leave a long lasting impressionSet in the time of 1970-71 in Mexico, the movie has successfully portrayed a realistic picture of that era. Its a wonderful experience to watch this movie in black and white with the stunning cinematography. Although, there were hardly any turn or twist in the film, its realistic and linear storyline can leave a long lasting impression to the viewers . The movie is a semi-autobiographical take on the director Alfonso Cuaron's upbringing in Mexico City and he has successfully revived the details of the lifestyle of that time in the movie. Yalitza Aparicio, who played the role of an innocent maid 'Cleo' and Marina de Tavira, who played the role of the wife of a doctor were the main characters of the film and they successfully portrayed their characters. Last but not the least, the cinematographer cum director Alfonso Cuarón did a spectacular job with the long panning shots which were worth watching. Overall, you should watch the movie if you are a cinephile."
ROMA,11 February 2019,1/10,I kept waiting for something...anything to happen. But it never did. My mundane life is 10 times more interesting then the most exciting parts of this movie. Just last Sunday a plane missed crashing into my house by about 300 yards. The destruction I saw was far more dramatic then this bore of a movie. Dont waste the 2 hours this movie wants to steal from you!!!
ROMA,9 April 2020,2/10,"Clearly the viewer is overawed by the monochromatic, broad sweeping and idyllic cinematography of this vastly overrated film. However, beyond that, the viewer is presented with a cookie cutter story of an upper middle class 60's era Mexican family complete with servants from a rural Mayan, Zapoteca or Nahuatl village. The middle class children bond with the servants, the mom alternates love and kindness with anger and condescension while the father carries on affair with a mistress. Small plot developments barely warrant attention such as the ubiquitous , the stereotypical boyfriend of the main servant who stupidly bores us with a martial arts stick moves while naked and exposing us to his grotesque junk, but abandons her once pregnant. The devout Catholic grandma who tries to help but prays a lot. Nothing is really resolved in the movie other than to present this horribly predictable story that closes with a group hug! The martial arts scenes are a colossal waste of cinematic effort, while the supposedly dramatic swimming in the Gulf of Mexico at Vera Cruz is hyped up solely by the sound editor blasting the volume from very rough seas yet visually presenting - what? 3 foot waves! About the only amusing part is when the family picnics with an American family that likes to shoot guns but only drink cocktails when a forest fire starts. That was funny!Is this movie Oscar material? Absolutely not! Definitely not even really Worth watching the whole movie. Protesters shooting up with other people? Uhhh....run of what mill 3rd world everyday stuff. The title? Roma? What's the point of that? It's the euphemism for Gypsies. How is that even remotely relevant to this cookie cutter story of self-inflicted injustice in a 3rd world country?
Summary: Overrated! Nothing New or Revelatory!"
ROMA,23 December 2018,2/10,Anyone that thinks this is a great film is welcome to watch my Bar Mitzvah movies. I spent 2 hours watching this waiting for something to happen. It's now 2 or 3 hours later and I've completely forgotten all about it.
ROMA,3 March 2019,1/10,"3 Óscars... Really?
This is one of the worst movies I have seen.."
ROMA,16 November 2018,10/10,"I know that Mexico submitted ROMA for the best foreign language film at this year's Oscars, but it deserves a best picture nomination. This film is nothing less than breathtaking and captivating"
ROMA,18 December 2018,9/10,One off for the perfect arty shots that may appeal to mostly art house movie goers. The two main men are in positions of power but weak in character and the two main woman are in weak positions and after chaos find strength and power. Every aspct of the film works together creating a unified whole.
ROMA,10 February 2019,2/10,"As a Mexican-American, I am always happy to see other Latinos succeeding--but we can do better than this. This film is about the life of women in the 70's in semi-rural mexico--hard, little options, often dictated by the whims of men. And, nothing much else. I suppose that for those that have little knowledge of challenges women would face in Mexico at that time, it may be groundbreaking. In fact, that's the only way I could make sense of this winning so many awards. But as I found nothing shocking, it was a waste of time to watch. Boring, such basic character development, and only paints the women as victims with some slight autonomy at some points. Skip it."
ROMA,16 December 2018,3/10,"Please bear in mind that this film is in black and white , is subtitled , nothing much happens and is very long . If you're not put off by any of that you may well love it but the majority of ""everyday "" people will be bored witless"
ROMA,9 March 2019,3/10,Many of us find this film boring and it's really not for everyone as very little happens . You have to wonder why it scores so highly at 7.8 . Are the low scores being ignored . I understand that many love it but surely the scoring should be fairer
ROMA,2 January 2019,5/10,"I just don't get why this movie is hailed as such a great film. Technically yes, but it comes off as an art house film with hidden meanings. There really was no connection to the characters. What is the re-watch factor for this film as the true great ones? Zero for me. Very disappointed."
ROMA,8 February 2019,9/10,"Quiet in its tone and subdued in its essence, Roma slowly creeps into the audience's consciousness and tells us a story of human fortitude that has not been exaggerated for cinematic flair. Roma is a deeply personal movie. The story being too familiar, nothing in the movie surprises you. But with an elaborate cinematography and slow camera movements, the movie is able to shine the light on moments that we would not have otherwise paused to reflect on. In its idleness, the movie reveals the complexities of human character and and its ability to rally against unforeseen circumstances. It is a story of hope and courage.
The movie is filled with metaphors. There are so many scenes that deserve an essay of their own. However, I feel its best if I were not to betray these details, before you could watch and form your own reflections. A lot of the movie feels more like a poetry. The black and white theme certainly helps build that feeling.
Everything about the movie feels beautiful and familiar and that, in my opinion, is the triumph of Roma."
ROMA,2 August 2019,10/10,"The cinematography and directing, I don't even have to address it. It's flawless.
The story, which many complain about, is not direct and it's for a damn good reason. We watch these movies nowadays and we expect a fairytale ending in everything. Well here's what Roma tells all of us, especially us middle class and upper class: if you wanted a fairy tale ending, you're on the wrong fkin planet."
ROMA,23 May 2019,1/10,A wasteland of a movie. Truly awful. Slightly interesting cinematography cannot rescue this briefest.
ROMA,23 December 2018,3/10,Totally Boring. A Narrative Failure. Excellent photography and ambient but a huge failure regarding story tellingMade to appear to be good but really bad
ROMA,28 December 2018,6/10,"It is just an OK movie, certainly does not deserve to be rated >8/10. If I knew what it was, I wouldn't have wasted my time on this movie."
ROMA,9 December 2018,9/10,"Near perfection. Reels you in effortlessly. It's been a long time since I've seen something this understated feel so moving and impactful. I was definitely reminded of Fellini at times. Rooting for this as an awards contender for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Cinematography. The acting was on point too. So many layers that it will keep me thinking about it for days."
ROMA,21 December 2018,1/10,It's a tossup-Roma or A Ghost Story (Casey Affleck) deserve the award for the dullest movie of the year.
ROMA,26 January 2019,10/10,"Absolutely stunning. Makes me very happy that there are people, actors, camera, director, you name it, who make such art."
ROMA,27 March 2019,8/10,"Film engaged me from the very beginning, i thought i couldn't pull it through because language is a barrier but when you see a art it reflect the real emotions, for understanding art like this you have to understand the emotions."
ROMA,7 December 2018,4/10,"Very simple story if there is any. Unnecessarily long and boring. Shallow characters, no in-depth analysis. Slow tempo and black&white?"
ROMA,1 March 2019,9/10,"Just a few moments in this film and one can guess it's caliber. some of the scenes are so well put-together that they take you into them like the entry of sofia's husband, the wildfire, children drowning. and with the awesome use of camera panning and effects it just enhances it's beauty. The depiction of class heiraachy is with so much accuracy and actors play it so well."
ROMA,29 January 2019,3/10,"Yes, the filming itself was artistic and wonderful... But getting through this movie was a chore. I love a good story, but in Roma I was left deeply unsatisfied."
ROMA,21 September 2018,10/10,Every single frame of this film is brilliant. It's not just his use of long takes -- it's HOW he uses long takes. It's not just his inclusion of non-actors -- it's the dignity with which they move on screen. 10/10.
ROMA,25 February 2019,9/10,"What a great film. From story telling, to cinematography, everything's perfect."
ROMA,18 February 2019,1/10,POS. One of the worst films ever. Super-simple cinematography; just tripod mounted shots. There are less painful ways to waist 2+ hours.
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"Just a bit slow to start and parts remain unclear to me (the various marches in the street - why did no one play with the dogs?). Don't stop watching - movie is visual treat of a production. Every angle and frame was a story in itself. The black & white works, works well - yet Mexico is such a lovely country, was some of that lost with the B&W? The parallels in situation between the staff and family is not lost, both have needs, both have dog crap all over their lives."
ROMA,22 January 2019,10/10,"I want to start my review by saying that I am Mexican. I find incredible, how Alconfo Cuarón took disconnected events happening within a family and sew together its parts to create this majestic piece of art.Many non-mexicans won't understand some of the background symbolisms, like the very known sounds of the vendors in the streets, or the interactions between such a common ""family"" (for many of us).My family, for many years, was very similar to the one portrayed in the story. My mom had to find help, when she and my father divorced, so our Cleo came into our lives. I was 5 and my sister 4, and our grandma was also around to help. The bond of our family was so strong that when we had to move to a completely different state, our Cleo came with us. And such as in the movie, my sister was once drawning in the sea and she was the first to realise and went to help, regardless of her not knowing how to swim.All these resemblances to my life, made this movie extremely special for me. But that is not what makes it so special. For me the magic takes place when Cuarón shows you his life (and that of many of us) by allowong the viewers to (kind of) peek through the windows of the family and makes the ordinary become extraordinary.As mentioned before, his delicate attention to details makes you realise that there is nothing left to chance in this movie. Everything is played just as in his mind, following the script of life.The acting of both leading ladies is also worth noticing, is obvious that even the casting had to be perfect and I believe it was. They conveyed the huge array of emotions of everyday life. Heartbreak, love, distrust, sadness, deep melancholy, you name it. Without these two women, the movie wouldn't be complete.The settings, backgrounds and even what I've heard as ""the unnecessary long boring intro"" blend perfectly good. The camerawork is incredible. The fact that is filmed in black and white had concerned me before starting the movie, but once watching, the black and white made it feel like is one of those flashbacks in the middle of a movie/TV show (I wonder if that is what Cuarón wanted us to feel).I loved to see the beaches of my beloved Tabasco in the movie, so sad they said they were going to Veracruz instead. I was wondering for some time why the scene of the sea looked so familiar, until I saw the blue crab and understood it was right there were my Cleo saved my sister's life.Please watch it with an open mind (especially to the Mexicans out there saying it is so boring or that they can't relate). We can all relate, it is the essence of life itself, human interaction, AMOR."

ROMA,21 December 2018,1/10,"Every now and then a movie comes along that reviewers who want to appear sophisticated and ""in the know"" feel compelled to heap all kinds of praise upon. This is one of those movies. Boring, slow, tedious, and lame don't begin to describe it. Hate is a strong word, but it is the only appropriate one to describe my feeling towards this waste of film. I honestly don't see how any real human being could like or enjoy this movie, and I suspect that very few actually did, despite their phony reviews."
ROMA,22 December 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuarón packs his unique style into arguably one of the decades most beautiful films. His signature long shots are absolutely stunning, and if you've seen any of his other films (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Gravity, Y Tu Mamá También) you'll notice that he adds every bit of his style Cuarón from visual symbolism and imagery, to complex takes.There is so much in this movie to unpack, like the rich history of Mexico and it's politics during Echeverría's presidency, to a very common household and the relationship between employee and employer. The film talks through it's imagery, containing themes of family, love, abandonment and so much more.I don't want to say any spoilers, but the scene in the beach near the end of the movie is one of the most beautiful and complex takes I have ever seen in any movie. Hats off to Cuarón for making such an incredible piece of art, and hopefully it gets the recognition and praise it deserves."
ROMA,6 March 2019,10/10,"Most of the reviews on here say that this film is all style and no substance, but i wholeheartedly disagree. The story isn't a grandiose adventure, but there's so much going on under the surface. You become attached to Cleo until everything she goes through becomes your own emotional burden. The story is slow paced, but very interesting the more you pay attention.I think this is a great film with beautiful cinematography and an emotional story, it definitely deserved all the awards it won."
ROMA,7 January 2019,5/10,"Now I'll be honest. If you read about this film being the best ever like I did you'll most likely be somewhat confused and dissapointed.
If you take into account the film and video performance then you'll be more understanding.
Film making connoisseurs would love the art of this film where the wannabe connoisseurs would attack you for your 'low star' review.
I watched this movie for the share value of the storyline and not the camera work. I would have been more gracious had this been advertised better by professional critics.
I'm writing this on how I felt after watching the movie rather than after reading more about this after watching"
ROMA,28 January 2019,2/10,If anyone else had made this movie it would have gone nowhere. Boring. I attempted it twice after reading great reviews but gave up.
ROMA,1 February 2019,8/10,"This is how i was after watching this, i don't know it feels so personal, intimate. I was feeling like i was in someone else privice, kinda this."
ROMA,7 February 2019,10/10,"Simply, the film worth watching! Thanks for Alfonso Cuarón for this incredible masterpiece!"
ROMA,22 February 2019,4/10,"No story, no plot, no twist it was so boring I had to fast forward some parts to get to some exciting parts but there was none of that. My 4 stars is for the cinematography and the last half hour of the film."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"BORING! It was all I could do not to turn it off. As someone else said, it's like watching paint dry. A movie should grab you in the first 10 minutes, we'll this one won't. He spent almost a minute on a scene with birds in a cage."
ROMA,18 March 2019,9/10,"This film is one of the most beautiful pieces of film that I have ever seen. Cuaron's directing is so precise and the camera work is impressive beyond belief. There were multiple scenes where I asked, ""How was this even made?"" or scenes where I watched in awe. The narrative was also super engaging and brought up some many complex, emotional themes. It had me in tears at multiple points of the film. The tone and pacing of the film was a high point as well. The constant tone shifts resembled a sense of reality as did the struggles. The complex political themes were subtle enough to not get in the way, but poignant enough to stick with me way after watching the film. The audio design was also incredible, and I recommend watching this with the best sound possible. Overall, I expected great film making more than a compelling narrative, but I got easily received both. Cuaron's style is a personal favorite of mine, and his interesting and fresh style of film making is present in this film as well."
ROMA,27 April 2019,8/10,"This was a very atmospheric experience with undoubtedly skilled cinematography. In particular, it was clear that the camera took advantage of the spacious scenery. The panning technique was used effectively with wider shots and the length of most shots fitted the tone overall. The acting was REALLY well done, even the child actors did not disappoint. The use of the black and white filter automatically made the whole experience even more depressing than it should be, which is actually what I believe the film aimed to do. The good thing tha came out from this choice of filter is the fact that it didn't take away from the beauty of the film. There were still amazing still frame shots and scenery, proving that colour is not at all necessary for a good cinematographic experience, with every detail still clear and concise and the different shades still accounting for the different colours. It is clear that Cuaron took a massive amount of time and effort even in the filter, making sure the details in the film are still seen without a problem. You could only imagine how much effort went into this piece. The first half of the movie took me a while to get into (not sure whether or not it's because I was not in the right mindset for this type of film). I usually prefer movies that are a bit more fast paced than this, so I would prefer if the first half was a little shorter, but I understand the artistic choice of going at the pace this movie is set as characters had to be developed to establish a connection between them and the viewer for later, more emotional scenes. The second half however, took me by surprise. I felt like I was embraced by the movie, standing alongside with other characters during the scene where they shopped for a crib. The fact that such an innocent and pure activity could turn into a mass attack really shocked me. I don't usually get too emotional out of shock to the point of tears, but something about the birth scene got to me. Maybe it's something about having a side view of the baby literally dying in front of it's mother while being blurred in the background. Safe to say, second part of the movie was much much better, with the plot resolving and themes coming together. The end scene at the beach was very powerful too, and it's even more impressive knowing that it was shot in one take. I'm new to analysing movies, so maybe I did not see the point in some scenes that I found out flat out boring and unnecessary, but I could say with confidence that this movie deserved to win best cinematography as it used simple techniques (which fit very well with the setting) to explore and be creative with the space given.I would watch this again and maybe I will understand more of it and give it at least 9 stars. But that's what I look for in a movie, to make me think and raise questions after watching."
ROMA,3 April 2019,1/10,"This is by far the movie that has frustrated me the most. A movie is supposed to be digital storytelling, I repeat STORYtelling. If a movie has no plot and no direction then what is the point other than if you enjoy watching people walk around and talk senselessly for hours in black and white. Yes it's pretty and the cinematography is more than there, but that's not what you rely on to create a movie, especially when that's all that's there. Overall this is a lazy attempt at movie making that somehow surpassed the academy and has duped them into handing them awards for it. You can't film people doing pointless things for 2 straight hours, include no plot, slap a title on there, and call it a movie."
ROMA,1 June 2019,10/10,This is a movie with heart. My sense of morality grew from watching Roma and for the insemination of moral sensitivity this film deserves its awards. Sympathy to the ones who come away empty handed.

ROMA,5 July 2021,9/10,"I don't know where to begin with this film. There is so much to observe, but I wanna start with cinematography, the panning, tracking, framework, depth of field was all taken into consideration and brought a deeper meaning to the film. It was visually stunning and I felt like I was apart of this world, a spectator simply observing, which is what you want in film, you want it to feel real. In almost every scene there is a story being told in the background and foreground. The story was told from the point of view of Cleo, one of two domestic workers helping Antonio and Sofia take care of their 4 children. Problems arises when Antonio leaves Sofia and the family and runs away with another woman. Cleo got pregnant and had miscarriage. The story brings up the whole theme of acceptance and challenges of single parenthood as we see Sofia struggle to raise the 4 children. The production was so well done and really shows you what life was like in 1970s Mexico. Overall this movie was a great watch and visually pleasing. There is a lot more to the movie than what was said in this review."
ROMA,14 February 2020,8/10,"Alfonzo Cuarón delivers a meloncholy yet beautiful journey through 1970s La Roma, Mexico in this picturesque and eerily realistic story of loneliness and belonging.Yalitza Aparicio stars as Cleo, the quiet, caring house keeper for a wealthy family headed by the matriarch Sofia (Marina De Tavira). We follow the family- and Cleo- through the excitement and dangers of living in such a bustling and lively city, as well as the emotional attachments we as humans develop for one another. It questions what we conceive as 'family' and how we cope with sadness and stress.Cuarón orchestrates a huge cast of extras and breathes life into Roma, so much so you forget you are watching a film and instead get drawn into a perfect amalgamation of choreography and the documenting of a family routine.The cinematography and sound editing are breathtaking. The black and white, sweeping camera shots and central framing of scenes bring a calmness to the madness, which in turn exentuates the subtle performances of all the main cast and make you feel like you are part of this living, breathing world.Newcomer Yalitza brings her character to life with a subtlety and realism that makes you connect with her story from the word go. Whilst avoiding spoilers- her quest for love and being a part of 'something more' goes through many peaks and troughs. Characters she considered close are unable to remember her name or age and are left abondoning her during her most vulnerable moments. The performance from Yalitza (and the four child actors) take you on an emotional rollercoaster, leaving you with questions like: ""can Cleo realise who her real family are?"" and ""who in her life genuinely cares for her?"" . It's down to Cleo to find that ""perfect balance"" in her life that she doesn't know she is capable of possessing.The only issue for me was the pacing of the movie. In some areas the movie dragged and became a bit mundane and monotonous (I now realise that this probably symbolises the life our characters are leading- but it still felt a little too slow in areas). The phrase style over substance came to mind many times, but with the crescendo of emotional tension during the film's climax, it builds to an incredie final act that may leave you wanting more.With beautiful metaphor (a car not being the ""right fit"" for the garage and the frequent planes signalling a ""daydream"" like life that always seems too far to reach) the film tugs on the heart strings, makes you fall in love with the main characters and takes you back to a hectic childhood in Mexico that you never had. Cuarón delivers and I highly recommend you watch this film on Netflix right now!8.5/10"
ROMA,15 December 2018,5/10,"The implication of that title may make you think Roma is one hell of a movie.
It's not.The critics had me looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory.
An artistic film with both both style AND substance they said. Just what I like.I was captivated by the opening sequence, the movie had my undivided attention.
I watch intently waiting to witness the magic of cinematic genius unfolding before me.
I wait and watch. Wait and watch.
An hour passes and I feel like there's something I'm failing to grasp.
Another 30 minutes pass and I really hope I haven't wasted my time.
Another 30 minutes go by and the movie is drawing to a close and I am dissapointed.
The movie ends and I feel swindled, conned, duped.
The critics have done it again!Not to compose a total hatchet job i'd like to point out that the sound design throughout was exceptional with the Dolby Atmos soundscape using directional sound to it's full potential, immersing me in the setting portrayed on screen.
I imagine the movie also did a good job of representing the era and location with authenticity.Now for the hatchet job:
I take exception to the critics assertions that every scene is beautiful because they're just not. One imdb user review even told me my Jaw would be on the floor throughout.
Truth is, most scenes are just functional, framed just as they should be with the choice to present the movie in B&W imbueing the scenes with a gravitas that wouldn't be present if it was in full colour.There are 3 or 4 scenes throughout the entire movie that stood out as being visually unique in their beauty and 2 or 3 others that fell too far into pretentiousness to fully appreciate their artistic merit.The themes of life, death, family and the human condition are always good fodder for a thoughtful drama but when the characters are lacking personality, the script is sparse and the story is threadbare it is very difficult for the viewer to care.
Even the intended climatic scenes are anti-climatic and fall flat.Personally, I found this movie lacking in both style and substance.But what about the symbolism and hidden
meanings you say? In this case, convenient devices to to make a dull movie appear deeper than it is.
I'm sure it's all very personal and meaningful for Cuaron but then he has tangible experiences to flesh out the bones of this story.Ultimately, I feel this was an exercise in mundane authenticity punctuated by just enough plot to keep the viewer interested in the hope that it gets better.
It doesn't."
ROMA,17 April 2021,10/10,"This is a movie i would describe with any words other than ""a movie"". It is a visual novel. A photograph that tells a thousand stories. It is not only perfect, but in black and white, and is my favorite movie to date."
ROMA,12 December 2020,5/10,"Everone else has written about the great camerawork but how boring the movie was, so I won't add anything else.
To me it was an odd love story. The love an employer has for an employee who becomes almost a part of the family.
Read Roma backwards and you get Amor. Need I say more?"
ROMA,9 August 2021,6/10,"At first i really got bored but the last 30 minutes saved the whole movie, it has nice cinematography and camera work is awesome, other things were pretty mediocre."
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"This movie put you right inside Mexico City in 1970s. The actings are beyond real and the main actress deserves at least Oscar nomination. The shots usually lasts longer than you expect but it is still interesting because of beautiful shades of grey in amazing black and white scenes. However, the story is so thin that prevents Roma from being a perfect movie.Watch it only when you are in good mood and you have three hours to watch and absorb a movie that someone may found boring!"
ROMA,21 December 2018,1/10,I've rated over 400 films and never felt the need to write a review until now. I'm getting so sick of movies about absolutely nothing receiving such high ratings. Boyhood. Ladybird. Moonlight and now Roma. Since when did movies about mundane people living their ordinary lives become masterpieces in cinema?
ROMA,17 December 2018,7/10,"Firstly the photography is beautiful, love the locations, the textures and the feeling behind them. The sound is magical too, beeping horns, birds, dogs barking, it felt like I lived there for a little while.However the story was slow, it had its moments of drama interspersed with long long scenes. The ending felt quite rushed compared to the first parts and I was a little confused about Cleo's status in the family, sometimes belittled sometimes treated like a family member - maybe that's how maids are treated?It's different, it's enjoyable, it's not the worst 'critically acclaimed' movie but if you enjoy action, pace, romance and mainstream movies this probably isn't for you :)"
ROMA,8 January 2019,3/10,"This film is beautifully shot. The acting is excellent. The plot? Just goes nowhere. I so wanted to like or love this movie, but the story line just meanders somewhat aimlessly on a road to nowhere. If I might summarize: it's a story about a domestic (maid / housekeeper) in a middle class household in Mexico City in 1970. That's it. There was no real beginning or end; it was a chapter or 2 or 3 pulled from a diary of someone leading an ordinary life."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,Hate Black and white films .that make you snore.Cinematography does not make a great movie
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"I am baffled by the outpouring of love for this film. I found it so incredibly slow and boring (so pretty much par for the course for a Best Pic nominee). Shots linger on way too long, and there's useless extra shots that serve no purpose. The movie doesn't seem to have any point to it whatsover. And add to that the needless use of black and white-we have the technology to film in color, there is no excuse not to do so! Overrated artsy garbage."
ROMA,22 January 2019,9/10,"This movie is not for the impatient or the unfocused. If you are in one of those categories, don't even bother. Not all movies are supposed to be easily digestible.I've never watched a movie that felt so real and it's a long time since I've been glued to the screen like this one, not out of suspense, but out of identification and synchronicity.Others have described the stunning cinematography; it is not only beautiful, it tells half the story as well and gives presence. The synthesis of all elements in this movie came together so seamless, there was nothing to do but to give myself away completely for the duration."
ROMA,14 January 2019,1/10,"Cinema is not painting gallery. Poor critics dont know this yet!!
The diff between cinema & painting gallery is screenplay. Roma completly has no screenplay and no character. Cinema is not a box that you put every subject(content) to it. You can put one or two things to it and try to zoom on those subjects. Simple & deep. Roma taste nothing. Its not about being mother, its not about killing students, its not about divorce, its not about misery, its not about district Roma, its not about oppressed women. Roma is about nothing. History of Cuaron's family maid is NOT dramatic & not important for others.
Alfonso cuaron is a smart guy who has deceived critics all over the world."
ROMA,24 December 2018,4/10,"This movie is great if you like, nay, if you love camera panning. There is so much panning,
it's truly fantastic. Very artistic. 90 degrees, 180 degrees, once even 450 degrees!! Oh and tracking also. Panning and tracking, tracking and panning, panning and tracking galore. And just when you think ""wow, this panning has been so great and so abundant, they can't possibly squeeze in any more!"" well, right at that moment you're in for a treat. No spoilers, you will need to see for yourself what treat I mean. Oh, there's also a story in there somewhere about a middle class family in the Mexico in the 70s, marital problems and a Mixtec indigenous live-in household help. But I truly don't think any of that is really relevant to the movie, at least not as much as the panning."
ROMA,21 December 2018,10/10,"Wow. Finally got round to watching Roma, and I'm highly ashamed that it's taken so long.It's a bona fide masterpiece. Sweeping and grand, yet incredibly intimate. There's a new superhero in town, her name is Cléo and her power is pure love. Yalitza Aparicio gives a performance that is probably one of the best I'll ever have the privelege to witness. No hyperbole; just flat fact. It's a knockout masterclass in naturalistic performance unmatched by any actor this year.Literally every frame of this picture is magical; like being given the chance to live inside a memory. You won't see anything else this year that's so visually ravishing, yet completely spellbinding.Deeply moving, incredibly profound and shot through with a verité that no other movie has brought to the table for a very long time, Roma might actually be a contender for film of the decade for me, and potentially this century, to date..."
ROMA,12 January 2019,4/10,"It's simply an ANNOYING film to watch, the sound track is there to annoy you on purpose, the lack of colors too. I won't get deep into analyzing the work but I would say that it's a failed attempt to creat something genuine"
ROMA,22 June 2019,2/10,"This is a mediocre film .. There is no depth.. The Academy must have watched too many superficial and non realistic movies and series such as Game of Thrones , Avengers , Bat Man .... that even a mediocre drop of other's everyday reality seems a strike of genius to them... It definitely does not deserve an Oscar ..
If you want the reality and with vein-cutting depth , watch Voices of Andes .it is a documentary but with story that tells itself.or there was a 2010 Russian movie How ended this summer ,between just two characters .. a movie with a true heart beat.. So Oscars must be kidding"
ROMA,23 January 2019,1/10,"When it comes to art, I am not the kind who generally wants to do a ton of research before viewing it. Afterwards, perhaps, if the piece intrigues me. I want to be affected by the art itself. But I certainly should have done my homework before watching 'Roma'. From the start I was unaware we were in Mexico, or that 'Roma' is the name of an upscale suburb of Mexico City (silly me). I kept waiting for this family to move to Rome, Italy, or have some sort of experience in Rome! Anyway, the film's opening scene, covering the opening credits, seems endless and strange, and boring. And the film remains exactly there. The acting is wooden, the pace is unrelentingly that of a snail, and dog poo seems to have a great significance that is lost on me. I read the critical reviews this morning after watching the film, and was flabbergasted that this is a 'masterpiece'. Long-single-takes in B & W are Arthouse favorites, but this film used the technique to no good result. I did not even care about the central character, and I wanted to. The movie ended and I was thinking, ""What happened?"" The answer: A whole lot of no story happened."
ROMA,17 December 2018,1/10,"I would like to take the time to say that knowing the career and great pictures that Alfonso Cuaron has achieved, this is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Despite the ""intellectual"" wave that surrounds it, and being exposed to be marked as ignorant, talking honestly it has a very poor script, it is full of extremely long scenes, and all of which combined makes the most boring and endless movie you could ever see.
The plot could have been reduced to a totally worthy 15-minute short film, which would be much more adorable and viewable.
I personally believe this is a big step back for someone who is already considered a great filmmaker.
As some others -without pretensions- say, I truly recommend not to waste 2:30 hours of your life watching it."
ROMA,27 October 2019,2/10,"This movie does not have anything to give. No wait, it does, boredom and frustration. I gave two points for few cleverly used camera angles"
ROMA,21 December 2018,3/10,Bo-ring.Great images.Nothing else.I love cinema. I am ok with intellectual movies. But this one really doesn't have much to offer other than great images a a bit of drama.
ROMA,2 February 2019,10/10,A gripping slice of life ..everything from a loving family to murderous riots. You find yourself absorbed not only in the lives of the main characters but also in the tragic era they must navigate. You will feel the undertow of the playa tugging you out to the mighty sea. You will know the pain of childbirth and the guts it takes to hold a family together there and then. It makes you think. It makes you feel. I don't believe you will ever forget the story or the people or the times. Thank you everyone for your work on this classic masterpiece.
ROMA,15 December 2018,8/10,"After watching this amazing picture I could bet it's a Carlos Reygadas', not a Cuaron's movie. Surreal and realistic at the same time. Sublime cinematography"
ROMA,31 December 2018,9/10,"Both types are perfectly legitimate and I love both.First: movies as entertainment. A place to lose oneself. I just saw all three of the Lord of the Rings movies here in a theater in Minneapolis over New Year's Eve weekend, 2018. Back to back. To see them again on a big screen was wonderful and I appreciated, all over again, how Peter Jackson (the director), combined so many elements (story adaptation, casting, acting, visuals, special effects) to create a world I was happy to lose myself in, for hours. (Trust me it was hours.) When they're good we all love movies like this. I know I do.Second: movies as an experience or lesson. A place to find oneself. Most of David Lynch's films fall here. A fair amount of Bergman. Some Kubrick (2001 for sure; maybe Barry Lyndon). Lost in Translation. And Roma. Really any movie where the user reviews on IMDB are either 8-9-10 or 1-2-3. And the latter are filled with words like ""boring"" and ""nothing happens.""A suggestion if you're in the latter group: stop trying to figure these movies out. Stop waiting for something classically entertaining to happen. Just turn off your brain and stop thinking. Let the movie roll over you (frankly this is the only way to watch a Lynch movie that isn't ""The Straight Story"" or ""Dune""). Be open and emphatic.When it's over you may find yourself with some subtle, emotional reaction you can't obviously describe (unlike a response to the first kind where typically we know exactly what we liked and didn't like). But you feel moved in someway: sad, filled with joy, terrified. These movies can expose you to or remind us what it means, authentically, to be human. And that kind of movie won't leave you for a long, long time.This isn't to say that some who love the second type can't be pretentious. I roll my eyes at lots of these user reviews sometimes. Ignore them. Find your own way.Think of it this way: loving both kinds of movies just gives you more movies to see and enjoy!"
ROMA,6 August 2019,9/10,"I grew up in the 70's so maybe that is why this film resonates and the feel of this era is so superbly put to life on the screen.
We follow Cleo, a housekeeper in a middleclass family in Mexico. And the way this movie depicts her day to day life in the household is just so real. Each scene is like an amazing pictureframe and is shot with beautiful precision. I really feel for Cleo during her very emotional struggles in life. I found this movie beautiful and emotional. Cuarón has made a movie he can be really proud of."
ROMA,1 February 2019,1/10,How boring can a movie get? This one sets a record
ROMA,18 March 2019,5/10,"Watched this just to find out what all that Oscar fuss is about. I have to honestly say that I was bored. Yes, the cinematography is fantastic and all. But the pace was excruciatingly slow. Sorry guys not my cup of tea."
ROMA,12 December 2018,10/10,"It's a complicated symphony of emotions that starts with a subtle insight at a maids life and quickly turns into a complicated emotional net with heartbreak, confusion, desperation and guilt.
Although at first the movie is slow and random, you can see it is building the characters around Cleo, the main character in the film, and you end up completely immersed in their life and caught up on their struggles, it's difficult to avoid feeling something.The detail in each scene is completely overhwelming, as a Mexican you can see how old logos, places and products where reproduced just as seen in the 70s.A small glimpse to an ordinary life full of sorrow and joy, fear and peace. It's a close inspection of the human condition, life at its purest form. Feels refreshing to see something other than a washed up drama or a gun filled action film.One personal story told with exceptional mastery, one that feels close, as if it could happen to us."
ROMA,4 October 2019,8/10,"I grew up in a house where a maid was working, and this film captures how important her role is in a household. This movie is long, but sure isn't boring at all. It's slow paced, but you get to enjoy every second of it. Drama and suspense are really demonstrated in a flawless way. It's not everyone's cup of tea, that I understand. But you should definitely give it a try."
ROMA,31 December 2018,2/10,"Let me see. Maid gets knocked up, boyfriend bolts. Father has affair, leaves home. Mother must go back to work.. How many times has this story been told. Oh, and we have about 7 minutes of poor driving in driveway. Just because the director is trendy is no reason to like movie. Terrible script."
ROMA,25 January 2019,1/10,"I dont know referee of the golden globe base their choice on, but this is the mostly overrated foreign language movie of the year.
Watch Capernaum and you will know what I'm talking about"
ROMA,23 January 2020,1/10,"Incredibly boring. I like arthouse films and can appreciate the filming and the artistic style, but good lord it was boring."
ROMA,9 January 2019,4/10,"Only for serious cinephiles and English literature majors. The reason (some) critics give this film such gushing reviews is beyond the average movie-goer. I saw the reviews and gave it a shot. With those high praises, I thought, it MUST be good.
Wrong.
So I looked closer at the reviews to see what I may have missed. From the critics: ""ongoing restraint,"" ""lucid detail of a formative memory,"" ""densely realized,"" ""filmmaking as gesture,"" ""it can almost feel prurient,"" and the like. If language like that doesn't turn you off then this movie might be for you. And congratulations, you are the most sophisticated, and sublimely profound person in every room. But you already know that.
The Fellini references are spot on, in the sense that a great movie/story can sometimes be ""not about where you are going, but what happens along the way."" And by that standard Roma falls flat.
The stunning cinematography is the only memorable thing that happens in Roma."
ROMA,9 March 2019,1/10,"I just finished watching Roma and I am perplexed! I hated it!! I kept waiting for something wonderful to happen and it never did!! I did not like the story, the acting was mediocre, the cinematography was boring, it left me totally wanting something grand to appear and it never did. A total waste of time!! I did not get the title, Roma, until I read it in review that the story took place in a neighborhood of Mexico City! It wasn't mentioned in the movie!! This was my opinion, like it or not."
ROMA,22 January 2019,1/10,"This is one of the worst films I've ever watched in my entire life. The story has absolutely nothing, nothing at all to add to the life of any human being. It is absolutely fantastic how possible it is nowadays, more than ever, to shoot something worse than an episode of Gossip Girl and be classified as masterpiece.We are doomed."
ROMA,9 March 2019,4/10,"I feel like i've watched the worst Dan Brown novel.Details,details,details, a very detailed background picture,but absolutely nothing to see."
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"Apparently there´s a lot of things people agree on. Cinematography, acting, setting. All great. But some IMDb users voiced that it has no story and is a movie for snobs. But is it really?I don´t think so. We follow a young maid who is struggling with her place in society. She loves the kids, is usually not treated that bad, but still, she is their maid and doesn´t have her ""own"" family. She also likes a guy, but doesn't quite seem to be in love. She generally seems unsure about her future. Meanwhile the family she works for struggles itself, as the father spends less and less time at home. These two story arcs intertwine while being set in front of historical events in Mexico.So prepare for some dramatic scenes, some heavy tragedies. Maybe even bring a tissue. You really feel for all characters at the end of the movie, but without it being cheesy, tearjerky or being forced down your throat. Sure, Roma doesn´t follow a tradional storytelling-formula, but how is that a problem?
If that´s not a captivating and emotional story, I don´t know what is.It took me some time to get fully involved with the story and the black and white made some interior shots just a little too grey, confusing and too much to digest.But yeah, since that was my only complaint, that´s as close as its gets to a 10. This should be strong contender for all the upcoming awards."
ROMA,3 February 2019,2/10,"Just a banal story, I can't see nothing special about this movie. And some nonsense scenes. Why is so overrated?"
ROMA,20 January 2019,9/10,"Alfonso Cuaron delivers a vivid portrayal of domestic help life in Mexico in the 70s.Shot in black and white - it intensifies the drama, the monotone and crisis of scenes. And yes, the single sweeping camera take does not fail to impress me.The film has the picturesque quality and emotional sensitivity of A Little Princess (one of my fave books adapted to screen), Gravity (got him an Oscar) & Children of Men (an apocalyptic dramatic masterpiece), movies he directed that left indelible impression to me.Bravo!"
ROMA,10 December 2018,9/10,"I have been waiting a long time this year for a movie to truly grab me. I worried that I was being a bit too cynical since there were two movies this year I loved and most of the movies I enjoyed were films I wasn't aure whether or not they were that great. I went into Roma hoping for something remarkable yet tried not to get too hyped. Alfonso Cuarón has made one of my favorite films of all time, Children of Men, and though the only movies I've seen from him were Gravity and his entry in the Harry Potter franchise, he is someone I'd call one of the best directors working today. Once I saw Roma, my love for Cuarón grew.One of the most famous aspects of Cuarón's directing is his use of long takes and in this film, he takes this understanding and gives it a different approach. Many of the shots in this movie are longer than your average shot length yet it never draws attention to it. The way Cuarón handles framing and shot composition creates such a grand environment for something as simple as two people running down the street. In fact the longest takes in the movie are those that seem the smallest in terms of scale but larger in its emotion.Cuarón's attention towards the visual aspect of cinema isn't limited to his cinematography as well as the script. There is very limited dialogue throughout the film, just short sentences yet these sentences say so much about the character's emotion. Sometimes a scene will take place where you feel the character's emotions even if they say nothing. Cuarón understands that this film is a small story and focuses on the lifestyle of these people and it captivates you not with the events but the struggles that the characters deal with.Concerning the lifestyle, this may be odd but one aspect that helps draw you into the world of Roma is its sound design. This director is well aware of the locations as well as the distance between the subject and the camera. A great example of this are moments where a marching band is seen in the streets and instead of playing music and having the audio be the same throughout, he waits until it comes a bit closer to the camera and increases it by a small amount. I could be overanalyzing this but its small details like this that just transport you inside the film's setting.I'm aware that this film will be released on Netflix some time soon and I'm happy because it gives more people an oppurtunity to watch it but at the same time, it's a film that needs to be seen in the theater. It spends so much time with this family as you start to feel for them and on the small screen, it can still be appreciated but in a theater, it becomes an experience."
ROMA,1 February 2019,10/10,"I honestly didn't expect Roma to be so good. Having read about the number of nominations (as well as the fact that the film was shot in Black and White), I expected an ""arty-farty"" self-serving pretentious film from Alfonso Cuarón who had gotten (well deserved) kudos for the breakout Clooney-Bullock film, Gravity. Boy, was I ever so wrong!Roma is an emotional and poignant movie about Cleo (played very believably by Yalitza Aparicio), a maid working in an upper middle class Mexican home in the early 70's against the backdrop of social upheaval. We see life through her innocent eyes as she navigates through the day picking up after the four children in the household, doing the laundry, serving food and washing the dog poo laden garage floor tiles.The movie has been described as ""achingly"" beautiful and I understand why now. This is a movie with an abundance of heart and honesty. Of course, the movie features a talented cast who did a wonderful job of non-acting acting that gives this movie such a raw and natural feel to it. Alfonso Cuarón's direction and photography melds so well together that this movie flows organically with not a single frame of waste to it.A critical and technical masterpiece not to be missed."
ROMA,11 February 2019,5/10,"First of all, let's get one thing straight; this movie's cinematography absolutely is a work of art. Every scene is both heartbreaking and beautiful, purely look-wise.However, there really isn't a point to this movie and it just comes off as, well, pretentious. I'm a movie snob and love long-drawn, lingering shots, but I also appreciate a movie for, well, having a plot and I cannot fathom why people are praising this movie to such high levels. So it comes off as pretentious instead.
It is quite possible to do a movie with a sense of ""every day"" or ""regular life"" feel and it still have a plot. This movie simply didn't show me anything of consequence, beyond having references to a very troubled time of Mexican history. There is a lot of social commentary, but this isn't explored well enough as the story arch does not show an overall red thread, when there really is no plot that serves to show us anything. Even every day life has some meaning, why shouldn't this?"
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"THIS PICTURE IS COMMON TRASH MOVIE THEY USED TO CALL THEM B MOVIES.
DID YOU NOTICE THERE IS A WALL THAT PROVIDED SECURITY TO THE HOME OWNER AND FAMILY. THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOVE THAT.
I WONDER WHY THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY CANNOT MAKE A DECENT MOVIE. I GET TIRED OF GETTING MY MONEY FROM THEATERS FOR POSTING THIS TRASH THEY MAKE TODAY."
ROMA,31 December 2018,10/10,"I dont know what does this movie want to tell at the beginning , I almost jump to the end but once you get chill and watch this movie peacefully, you will know.
It is A truly Masterpiece."
ROMA,25 February 2019,4/10,"This movie was like a welcoming breeze on a hot day. The anticipation is that you will feel the cool air cocoon you in a protective sheath against the blazing sun. But what really happens, is the breeze makes no difference. You want to feel it, it blows but nothing changes. You think the next breeze will cool you down, for 135 minutes you wait...In the end, you move on, still sweaty and hot and wonder why did I stay out in the sun do long waiting for a change.Arriving home you notice a dog poo in your garage and you think to yourself, wow doesn't that look magnificent."
ROMA,21 January 2021,5/10,"The quote above is the problem with the movie. There's so many unnecessary panning shots that could be cut out to shorten this movie which would make it loads better. There's a scene where Roma walks down stairs and turns off all the lights. That's it. It takes about 45 seconds to do so. Nothing else happens. What's the point? ""Hey, this shot is crystal clear so my movie must be good."" That's the impression I get from the director and it's flat out stupid. It doesn't move the story in any direction or give you any information about anything or anyone besides that it takes this maid 45 seconds to turn off the lights in this room. Shots like this is why the movie was so hyped. It's hard to believe he's the same guy who directed Children Of Men."
ROMA,1 March 2019,6/10,Great phtotography But without a plot. Its an overated movie Maybe cause its Cuaron direction Anyways...this movie definetely didnt get me.
ROMA,19 January 2019,6/10,"I understand the art. But if the art is not enjoyable to watch and feel, what's the point?
We need better stories gentlemen.
Even gaming nowdays have more engaging dramas than the last 5 years of movies.Too bad, I used to love movie theaters.."
ROMA,24 January 2019,9/10,"Yes, this years oscar contender for best movie... a true life story of the directors childhood nanny, beautifully shot in black and white with outstanding photography. This will pull at your heart strings and punch you in the face with such emotion. A quiet story with a astounding strong female cast. Definately add to your watch list."
ROMA,19 May 2019,10/10,"This is a truly powerful film that absorbs you into the realities of its world. Despite being black and white, the cinematography is quite something, and it's still possible to notice all kinds of wonderful details (like dog's poop on the driveway :). The main character Clea, is such a wonderful person, that it seems impossible not to fall in love with her, an embodiment of love, beauty, honour and strength to say the least. Cleo is just through and through, so solid! This film definitely has a feel similar to Tarkovsky's films, with deep symbolism that goes straight to your gut, slow and powerful timing, but at the same time has a very unique and powerful flavour of its own. I highly recommend this film!"
ROMA,12 February 2020,9/10,"In one of the very best of recent cinema history, Alfonso Cuaron creates a film about life. About life of a middle class family in the 70s in Mexico with daily efforts and problems. You can just watch how the characters unfold in long, gentle settings of everyday life. In this slow-paced cinematic experience you accompany the woman and children along, what feels just as realistic and touching. This moving story about family and ageless social questions is garnished with stunning cinematography, slow-paced but effective editing and an intelligent sound design. Last but not least Marina de Tavira and Yalitza Aparicio are showing good acting-skills.
All in all you should not watch this movie for entertainment, but you should watch it for a wonderful and intelligent audio-visual experience, supported by outstanding technical achievement (cinematography, editing) and an emotional story of everyday life. (9/10)"
ROMA,16 December 2018,8/10,"The film is about something very common in Mexico, the housemaid is part of the family, she is loved and cared for, it is something that happens even in these times. The end of the movie should have given more, in my opinion."
ROMA,9 April 2019,4/10,"Nothing special.
Do not lose your time.
Mediocre, couple good scenes and that is all.
One more confirmation of low quality of Oscar pictures..."
ROMA,3 March 2019,2/10,"Hot garbage, borrrrrring, a nothing story in a nowhere town. This movie should have been nominated for a Razzie and shown in the bathrooms at the Oscars. Just more evidence Hollywood wants to preach to everyone instead of making entertaining films."
ROMA,24 February 2019,8/10,"When I started watching the movie at first I found myself getting bored. Beautiful cinematography for sure but I could not get why the movie was so highly rated and got all these nominations.But then I thought to myself: we are so used to the dramatic outbursts of Hollywood movies that we forget what cinema is about. Cinema is about stories and Alfonso Cuaron managed to depict life as is. Ordinary, tiresome, slow, with small but precious times of happiness and sympathy and a lot of pain.This movie is about people, their stories that will be forgotten and their dramas that do not matter to anyone but to themselves."
ROMA,31 May 2020,9/10,"That one scene, no not that one - the one after it, it completely wrecks me every time. Every single time.
It.
Wrecks.
Me."
ROMA,25 May 2021,1/10,I don't recommend the movie. Absolutely boring. I don't understand the hype around it.
ROMA,23 January 2019,1/10,"Boring piece of mediocrity.
This movie goes to show how low we have sunk when we take something I could of shot on a handy cam in 1965 as something worthwhile of 10 academy award nominations.
A predictable story line, a cheating husband a cranky wife the help gets pregnant and some one runs around in full frontal naked which adds nothing to the story but its there to complete the trifecta of things a director must do.
.A pointless exercise in a low year for movies where all the reviewers are on their best cocaine. or are blind drunk or just haven't got a clue anymore .
A piece of dog poo which the maid failed to clean up.
All i can say is #metoo"
ROMA,17 February 2019,3/10,"I'm sorry but other than the fact the film is in black and white, this movie has nothing going for it. The people giving it these great reviews remind me of wine testers who think they have a diverse palate.... ""with hints of this..... and a bouquet of this...."". When in actuality they are just drinking water, and making things up.
There is nothing to see here. The political landscape in terms of race and gender, have all but ruined what goes as cinematic worth. The movies selected by the academy for best picture, once again show this."
ROMA,17 February 2019,1/10,"I was excited to watch this movie based on the hype and incredible scores from critics and audience. I am also a huge fan of Alfonso Cuaron. But in all honesty, I do not understand how or why people liked this movie. It is extremely slow, there is constant sadness, and the storyline seems incomplete. I want my 135min back."
ROMA,7 February 2019,3/10,"This film is set for the early 1970s in grayscale pictures..!
even though, even the North Korea was able to produce color films at that time..!!
and they won best pictures.. LOL"
ROMA,11 April 2019,7/10,"I liked how realistic the movie was and that the love the family showed for Cleo was unique comparing to other movies . However, despite most movies this one had no particular challenge or story line . It was like a page torn from someone's diary with no interesting events which might be boring for some people including myself."
ROMA,23 February 2019,1/10,"Slow, tedious panning. Every shot lingers 30 seconds too long--yeah I see the thing you are showing me. Yeah, I still see it, sitting there. Thanks, that's long enough. There are too many scenes with screaming kids, too many crowd scenes with everyone talking at once. Drunk adults randomly shooting guns. More slow tedious panning. Taxidermy heads of all the household dogs mounted on the walls--gross. There is nobody to care about in this film, except to hate their lives. I do not get it, and I'm mad at myself for wasting my time."
ROMA,2 March 2019,5/10,The story is not something which hasn't been told before. There are times when the story line falls a little flat. Its just a simple story told with great cinematography. I think 5/10 is the best I can give it. I even left the movie midway and came back for the heck of completing it. Nothing riveting to hold the viewer.
ROMA,8 March 2019,2/10,"Don't watch this film, because it's awful. You can see in this film only stupid scenes like cooking egg, parking car..., and definitly not deserves nominations for Oscars, Golden globes..."
ROMA,26 February 2019,1/10,This is my first review ever on IMDB. I'm so disappointed I've actually wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. I guess the only interpretation why this film got those number of awards is that the Mexican Mafia did a really good job !!
ROMA,25 February 2019,2/10,"What a pile of Pooh. A shared consensus by two households who watched it independent of the other.
How this film could ever be mentioned In the same breath as the Oscars is beyond our belief."
ROMA,2 January 2019,9/10,"Not every one will understand this kind of situations. A lot of woman now days still doing this kind of jobs, which I think is really sad because there's not other way. In Latin America this is usual as a job. You gotta put your effort, your whole life just doing laundry, cleaning the house,cooking, even taking care the children's of somebody else.
This movie talk too much about it.
Even the manifestation it did happened in 1971, you can google it as the Halconazo.
I really hated Fermin.I almost cry."
ROMA,25 June 2019,6/10,It's full of emotions and feelings and that's what make it so special!! but I still don't know why they made it black and white ?
ROMA,28 June 2020,10/10,The indigenous Mexican vs the Anglo-Saxon Mexican seen in a all too true common story of a young servant woman.
ROMA,19 February 2019,10/10,"A heart warming story that by the end of the film, takes that heart and rips it out of you through your throat."
ROMA,5 May 2019,8/10,"Human, sensitive, simple and touching ! A very nice movie"
ROMA,31 January 2019,5/10,"Roma has a beautiful storyline that could have been cut to one-third the length. There is, however, an over abundance of scenery shots - and no musical background so the Academy is sure to love it."
ROMA,21 December 2018,9/10,"Roma's black and white imagery leaves a lot to be pondered when it comes to scenery. While the cinematography and overall frame of the movie are never imperfect, it does take a seat to the marvelous acting of Yalitza Aparicio as Cleo. I would often get so drawn into her grounded and emotional performance that it took a second watch to recall how well the shots were composed.Roma isn't a film that should be missed."
ROMA,23 February 2019,2/10,"My wife (from Mexico) was really excited to see this so we watched it together. We were both extremely disappointed and bored at the end. The lead character hardly speaks or shows emotion in the movie so it would boggle my mind if she won any actress awards. I'm going to be upset if this wins an Oscar for Best Picture because most of the 40+ movies I watched last year were more entertaining than this for me. It's just an ordinary person living an ordinary life, there was little to draw me in to her world or feel an emotional connection to the characters. The movie being Black & White didn't bother me, the story just wasn't special at all. You could basically pick out anybody on the street of Mexico and make a movie about their life....what would the point be to spend 2+ hours watching it? I go to Mexico all the time, there is nothing entertaining or artistic about watching my suegra scrubbing clothes outside. It's not just us, my wife says a lot of her friends and family in Mexico feel the same way about this overhyped movie! If you want to watch a REALLY well shot Black and White movie, check out Night of the Hunter from 1955."
ROMA,24 February 2019,9/10,"My mom worked as a housekeeper when she was young. Like Cleo, she came from a small town, had long hair and spoke a native language (quechua), also in the 70s, but it was in Lima, not Mexico DF.
This could have easily been my mother's story, or someone else's but here in Lima. I felt so identified with this movie, maybe that's why I loved it so much. Any latinoamerican could."
ROMA,17 December 2018,1/10,"I forced myself to view the full film (speeding up many parts), and cannot understand the raves that this is getting. I must be blind, but this is one of the most boring drivel i've ever seen and i have seen most American and European films. Not much to add except be ready to bored to tears."
ROMA,25 December 2018,1/10,"Boring writing, boring acting. Literally 2 hours of wasted time."
ROMA,25 February 2019,10/10,"Roma Review
By Chase M
Not only is Roma (2018) Alfonso Cuarnó's most personal work, it's also his best. The film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn't let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. Cuarón's mastery of the camera is evident in scene. Every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can't help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project.
Roma, is the story of Cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. The film documents a year in her life.
Before I discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what Cuarón did. To take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. The writing in this film is simple yet moving. The film really made me care about, and connect with the character of Cleo. Cuarón's cinematography is something to marvel at as well. Each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. I could go on about how great the camera work is, but I won't. Just know it's something special and go experience it.
The performances are all strong. Particularly those of Cleo and Sofía, played by Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira. Both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. Aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. The acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.
Roma is a masterpiece. It is the culmination of all the work Alfonso Cuarón has put in throughout his career. I was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it's a Netflix movie) but I loved every second of it. This movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. It's a shame the Academy didn't pick Roma as 'best picture', because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees. Regardless, Roma is exceptional in every sense of the word and deserves to be experienced by anyone who appreciates the art of cinema.10/10"
ROMA,23 January 2019,5/10,"Great camera work, you become one of the characters. However, for me it moved a little too slow."
ROMA,16 March 2019,9/10,Another masterpiece from Cuaron! I'm truly impressed by the talent of the actresses.
ROMA,24 July 2019,6/10,"Roma is a movie which takes place in 70s México, where the protagonist, Cleo, works at a family's house as their maid, doing the housework and frequently dealing with the four kids of the family.The movie has a very long start, which already gives away how the director is going to approach this story. The cinematography of this movie is fantastic (minus sometimes where they push it a bit too much), giving each scene a literal 360° view and letting the spectator choose in what aspect they want to focus on. Maybe you want to focus on Cleo as she does her work, or maybe you want to watch how the kids are playing, or maybe you decide to contemplate the outstanding work they did with the setting of each scene. It is really something unique, and I believe, the rich part of this movie.And that's another thing, the scene's setting and ambience. It's so well crafted to give that feel of a 70s, vintage México. They really did a good job on this aspect.But the problem is that... That's about it. The story is not something I'd put in a movie, because, simply, there barely is one. It's basically Cleo working, getting pregnant, while Sofia, the housewife, deals with his cheater husband. It doesn't have anything special.I tried to connect with this story. I tried to dive in, and enjoy it, but it was so difficult, that I kind of gave up. I'm not saying it was rubbish, but it lacked so many things.
The cinematography is phenomenal, but you can't make a whole movie out of only that. I can't help but feel that this looks and sounds more like an audiovisual project than a movie.I understand what Cuarón wanted to achieve with this, and I respect it, but I don't think that this was the best way to do so.
Nevertheless, the approach given to this movie isn't something that you see everyday, so it's still unique in that aspect."
ROMA,28 January 2019,4/10,Amazing and stunning cinematography. But this is not a movie. It's like a very very very long short film about nothing.
ROMA,17 February 2019,2/10,"Cinematography is good but the plot is so slow and boring ,, I can't understand how such a movie was nominated and is winning alot of awards"
ROMA,29 January 2019,1/10,"Given the hype and nominations this movie received I was expecting something spectacular.NOT!The opening scene of the tile driveway being washed, was waaaaay too long. In hindsight, I would say it is excellent foreshadowing for the rest of the film...slow moving and boring.I feel like I got suckered into continuing to watch this film thinking, ""It has to get better soon...look how many nominations it received! It must be good!""Wrong."
ROMA,29 January 2019,1/10,"From the incredibly slow opening scene to the final credits I kept asking myself, ""How in earth did this B movie get so many nominations and positive reviews??!"" Then it hit me...it is because it is fashionable to portray men as misogynistic, self-absorbed beasts who abandon their families and responsibilities (so ladies stick together, per the line from the mom). The applause of the reviewers is nothing more than pandering to the current fashionable narrative coming out of Hollywood and the main stream media. Ultimately; however, these very same writers who gushed euphemistic reviews, will loose credibility with ticket buyers (where it really counts) and the ratings of the award shows will sink even lower. This shallow facade reminds me of the fable of The Emporer Is Wearing No Clothes. Farcical."
ROMA,29 January 2019,7/10,"Unfortunately, I predict this film will win the Oscar for Best Picture. ""Why?"" is the question we all want answered, yet, I won't even bother asking it myself. This film had good cinematography, I will give Cuaron that. I gave this film a 7 strictly for two reasons. 1) good cinematography. and 2) The two parts where anything actually happened, it was so disturbing and cringe worthy, it was almost hard to look away from the screen.The depiction of this family was boring for the most part. The parts depicting the hardships of the family however, were very immense and intense. I have no reason not to believe these things happen to families in Mexico, in the 70s, which is why that area of the picture was good. This was also the same reason the film deserves a 7/10."
ROMA,2 June 2019,1/10,"I do not understand why a lot of people like this movie, very boring for me ."
ROMA,20 December 2018,5/10,"I was waiting impatiently to watch this acclaimed movie as I love ambitious, thought-provoking dramas. My disappointment couldn't be bigger! I kept checking the watch, was not able to identify with the main character, felt no emotion, no compassion, nothing at all except for the overwhelming feeling of boredom. I guess my dog was much more interested in the movie which proves that they can see the world in black and white.
Sure, the cinematography was beautiful but that is about all. I have no idea what the point of the movie was. Hatred towards men?
I also don't believe that a normal woman could show so little emotion when losing a boyfriend, baby and - above all- fighting for lives of the kids that were in danger of getting drowned. Is she a doll or a machine?
It is hard to believe that this movie is already called ""a movie of the year""and aiming for most of the prizes of the season."
ROMA,23 December 2018,2/10,"I like to think of myself as a fairly educated and sophisticated person. Ivy league undergrad degree. Play 3 instruments. Avid reader. Speak 4 languages. So here comes this hearalded film lauded worldwide as artsy, a masterpiece, etc. I couldnt wait. I also couldnt watch it till the end. I was bored to tears. It was slow, tedious, and I really couldn't emotionaly invest in any of the characters except for the family dog. I tbink al the critcs are just a bunch of effete intellectual snobs hopping on a bandwagon"
ROMA,25 December 2018,9/10,"This movie is absolutely beautiful. It's full of raw emotions, and although it's just a simple story about a simple family it brought me to tears twice. This is one of the best movies of 2018 hands down. Although the storyline may seem a bit slow, it is overall a masterpiece."
ROMA,14 January 2019,9/10,"Watching cinema is a conflicting experience. We all have a rational self, looking for the values that we can think long after the movie ends and that we can share with our friends. We also have an experience self, striving to live in the moment and feel what the characters feel or creators might want to suggest. While the rational self looks for causality and rules, trying to extract the essence, the experience self is ignoring all rules and essence, trying to get it all in.
A movie to be enjoyable, needs to solicit a harmonious interplay of both selves. And a typical good movie makes us care about the characters in order to follow the story. Usually the balance is tipping greatly towards the story to comfort the rational self. A more artistic movie will challenge us to give up some of our need for rationality while rewarding us with more intuitive truths. This may feel uncomfortable, and only the better ones will succeed in finding a new harmonious balance. Citizen Kane is an example of such movies. Films that make us relinquish (almost) completely the rationalism for the sake of experience are extremely rare. Most of the people feel frustration and discomfort doing so, so the rewards in feeling these experiences must be very high to rebalance the two selves harmoniously. How they do it, is pure genius. Code Inconnu is an example of such movies.
Michelangelo Antonioni (Red Desert), Jacques Tati (Playtime), Andrey Tarkovsky (Stalker), Michael Haneke (Code Inconnu) are among those geniuses that got closest to experience cinema. And now, Alphonso Cuarón with his Roma.
Direction: 10, cinematography: 10, acting: 9, subject: 8, plot: 6 (but it doesn't need)."
ROMA,25 January 2019,1/10,It is basically from Dora the Explorer with the Kids Diego and that. Going on the Adventures of Mexico City.. Basically that. Dora is the Girl. Diego is the lover. All set out. Dora the Explorer Stars in The Adventrures of Dors; in Roma.
ROMA,25 February 2019,1/10,"I cant understand whay the critics love this movie?! For what?! Its Cinematography?! Oh c'mon, do you look for a documentary and music video or A MOVIE?! Lack of storyline, boring dialogues (i mean dialogues without any purpose) and ..... .
Positive point: Cinematography
Negative point : Whole movie."
ROMA,26 January 2019,3/10,"I left after 40 minutes.
I have no rating.
But I left because it's painfully boring.
It's only my opinion, I like movies with a higher pace."
ROMA,30 January 2019,2/10,"The most overrated movie of the year, very slow nearly most of the film nothing happens, you feel some scenes out of context...
Technically the movie might be good but it didn't do anything for me."
ROMA,11 March 2019,3/10,"If you really want to see another ""MeToo like"" political correct movie, this is it. More ""american"" than any american movie.
Only camera is interesting. Sometimes. A little bit like from old movies like ""Once Upon A Time ..."""
ROMA,10 March 2019,1/10,"As a big fan of Alfonso Cuarón's ""Y tú mamá también"" this was an eagerly anticipated Saturday night form of entertainment. Unfortunately this turned out to be an overly pretentious black and white cinematic letdown. Not only was the plot extremely depressing but I personally felt that men were being unfairly represented in the movie. I'm all for gender equality but not all men are guilty of violence and sexism on this planet. Another opportunistic move to jump on the #metoo movement from film directors to try to rectify the past. Don't be fooled by the early reviews, I've just wasted 2 hours of life on this."
ROMA,24 March 2019,1/10,About as entertaining as watching paint dry. As others said I forced myself to watch it as it was so critically acclaimed. By who?! Boring and depressing. Thank goodness it did not get the Oscar for best film.
ROMA,27 March 2019,9/10,I have been disturbed for days. I get flashbacks of the newborn..why are the babies legs so long and skinny...is it symbolic..or artistic license ??
ROMA,18 May 2019,10/10,"Either you lived in Mexico in the 60s or you want to know how was it, its accurate and moving."
ROMA,20 October 2019,7/10,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie, which is why I've felt the need to publicly ruminate on it. As a filmmaker, it was very hard to watch without simply marvelling at the sheer technical prowess of it and I spent most of the film wondering 'how the heck did he/they do that?' which may have detracted from the emotional impact of the film. Scenes that come to mind are the riot out of the window and the rescue from the waves. The birth scene is another example. But having had time to process the film, I just don't feel it had the emotional impact it should have done; I felt too separated from the human drama and there is something detached and almost voyeuristic about the way it has been shot, despite the fact that the performances are essentially flawless and entirely believable - an amazing achievement in itself. Many films have made me cry and this should have been one of them but it didn't emotionally land with me, and without that sense of connection with the characters, I'm left wondering how effective it is as a piece of cinema. It's an exquisite piece of filmmaking by a master practitioner, but it didn't affect me anywhere near as much as I wanted it to."
ROMA,29 December 2019,1/10,"Lost 2 hours of my life with this trash.I guess this is to be expected coming from Netflix.Netflix original junk, you will spend 2 hours watching a dog having a dump, enjoy"
ROMA,29 January 2020,9/10,"This is a great movie i you have ever spent time in a warm developing country between 1965-2013.
It is a deeply personal film with insane detail, it's not for the average westerner.
Of course you may enjoy the film with it's intimate themes but you won't understand the importance and accuracy of Alfonso Cuarons portrayal of the atmopshere. It is a work of art."
ROMA,22 January 2019,1/10,"How can I get my 2hrs back!!!!! The worst movie ever made, period!!!!! It's a political stunt by Hollywood liberals to take a stab at Trump. Though he sucks, you didn't have to push a crap movie down our throat to get back at him for disparaging Mexico. Movie had no plot, no storyline, nothing!!! The only thing good were the 70s cars. WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! Do not waste your time!"
ROMA,14 March 2020,1/10,How can this movie won something when nothing speciall is happening?Disappointed!
ROMA,9 March 2020,6/10,"Apparently just like me, so many people find out the pannings inthe movie. There are so many pannings that I cannot help assuming that photographer is asked to do panning as much as possible by director, even if some of them may bore some audiences.
The only highlight in it i think is the incredible beauty in the scene. I like the fantastic shot best where Cleo is giving a birth to her child. The crop right on the medical crews' necks, leading our attention right towards where the director wants.
The frames in it is extremely inspiring for me.
But still, I almost fell asleep while watching it."
ROMA,4 April 2020,1/10,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Only kept watching because I was hoping it would get better. It was like watching a snail play a snail in a movie. Best acting? The only people that would say this is a great movie are people who want to say they saw something in it that nobody else could see.
ROMA,5 April 2020,1/10,Film doesn't offer much. Didn't like it and was very boring.
ROMA,9 July 2020,10/10,"The film opens on a stationary shot, a bird's eye view of cascades of soapy water washing over a stone-tiled drive-way. It is not until over three minutes of the same shot -- interrupted only by the reflection of an overhead aeroplane that makes its way across the surface of the water -- that the camera slowly tilts upward to introduce us to Cleo, the live-in housekeeper of a middle-class Mexican family. But it is within these first couple of minutes, before any characters are shown, that the essence of the film is encapsulated: it is a quiet piece that captures the simple and mundane aspects of life in a way that enthralls the audience for its full 135-minute runtime. Although it defies many filmmaking conventions, the film feels familiar and effortless. In some ways, it is an epic without the conventional narrative structure of conflict and resolution. Drawing on many of the characteristics of traditional drama, the film's emotional palette touches on a whole range of feelings with moments of comedy, tragedy and everything in between. Roma is a visually arresting and exceptionally powerful masterpiece that, two years later, still feels rightfully deserving of all the praise and accolades it has received, and then some.Written, directed, produced and edited by Alfonso Cuarón, Roma is a semi-autobiographical film which paints a vivid and visceral portrait of Mexico City in the 1970s, taking place in the Colonia Roma neighbourhood where Cuarón himself grew up. One of the most striking and memorable elements of the film that anyone will recognise upon first viewing is its refreshing use of monochrome. However, there is more to the black-and-white nature of the film than meets the eye. Originally shot in colour, a monochrome filter was applied in post-production and the tonal values were adjusted to create a more crisp and ambient image. Personally, this serves as a constant reminder that Roma is a historical piece interlaced with memories drawn from the director's own childhood experiences. In addition, the use of 65mm film gives a rich and detailed quality that only adds to the compelling realism of the film as we witness Mexico from the perspective of an ordinary working-class woman.Roma is equally a masterclass in cinematography that can be enjoyed by everyone from the casual viewer to the aspirational film student. Abandoning his recurring collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, Cuarón takes on the role of director of photography for this deeply personal project. The shots are lush, exquisitely choreographed and if you were to choose any frame from the film, print it out and frame it, you would likely end up with a delightful work of art to hang up in your living room. Notably, the film primarily employs long shots that keeps us at a distance from the characters but close enough to feel immersed into the lives of the characters. There are great examples of horizontal panning in interior shots that follow Cleo as she walks through the house, tidying up the rooms and switching off the lights at the end of the day. Meanwhile, tracking shots are used as the characters weave through bustling streets, which feel alive and genuine thanks to the spectacular sound production. Roma features no official soundtrack, with the viewer only hearing what the characters can also hear: the usual busy chatter of the urban population, drivers honking their horns in the congested traffic, snippets of radio music played in the background. All of this produces an authentic representation of Mexico as remembered by Cuarón.Yalitza Aparicio in not only her acting debut but a leading role shows great promise with a convincing and understated performance that is profoundly moving but never excessive. Similarly, impressive performances are given by the established actress Marina de Tavira as Sofia, the mother of the family. Thankfully (and crucially) the child actors in the film are well cast, which is too often an uncommon occurrence in many films featuring children. As a result, Roma is able to consistently engage the audience with natural dialogue and steady pacing. Overall, Roma succeeds in expressing an artistic vision with subtle motifs such as water, planes and cars cropping up throughout to contribute to thematic undercurrents. Significantly, we can derive interpretations of visual symbols from the film but these never come across as heavy-handed; instead, they are objects and devices in the background of the film that are astutely implemented into the set design to spark intellectual discussion over what ideas might be expressed regarding themes such as childhood, gender roles and social class.Roma may be distinct from previous works in Cuarón's filmography which includes the critically acclaimed space thriller Gravity and the gritty dystopian sci-fi Children of Men, but all of his films feature one common thread: his works are all an illustration of the human experience. Roma is but a small segment of history with an ambiguous, neither-happy-nor-sad ending that shows that the world continues to turn, that each and every one of us is living a uniquely complex life occupied by ambitions and dreams, fears and impulses, triumphs and disasters. Undoubtedly, this is his magnum opus and leaves cinephiles and critics alike eagerly awaiting Cuarón's next release. Ultimately, what we have here is a rare and unforgettable slice-of-life drama which confirms that Cuarón is a master of his craft and, when considered as a sum of its parts, Roma stands as one of the finest achievements of film in the 21st Century."
ROMA,23 February 2019,2/10,"I can see where this film is going, but I only made it through 20 minutes - 5 minutes of that were the opening credits. It is soooo dull. The slow panning of every shot will drive you insane and shouting the the screen to just move!! I'm sorry, but this is only for people with PhD's in fine art or slow deaths."
ROMA,13 January 2021,10/10,"It is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen - very emotional, great cinematography and acting. I dont understand any negative opinions about this movie, so dont care about it and go watch this masterpiece."
ROMA,31 January 2021,10/10,"If you are looking for an artsy film then this is the one for you. After reading the bad comments I was confused. What were they expecting? Superheroes? Anyway, the cinematography was gorgeous. There was a story to those who think otherwise. It was a very raw film with no film score and the acting was so realistic at one point I was convinced this was a documentary. You empathise with the main character, Cleo, and after what she goes through you just want to reach in and hug her. There is so much love between the family and Cleobury it warms your heart. However, at times it was heartbreaking to see what life was like in Mexico City in the 70s. It is a bit long but well worth it. I can see why it won so many awards."
ROMA,11 February 2021,10/10,"Why movie is different than a story book or an audio book?
ans: because it boosts our imagination with the visuals. It gives a skeleton to our wobbly imagination.
Now I don't know what people think, when they think about story but to me this movie has lots and lots of story in it. I guess people want some kind of mcu universe moviemore, spicy, raunchy and with lots of cgi. Well if you don't find sweet, beautiful, emotional stories in this film then i am sure no one will ever gonna make you find the brilliance of this film. The stories are based on true events from cuaron's own life... and this is how life generally is... playing with your brother when you are a kid, visiting your relative's home to your cousins, watching tele at the evening... thats how it is with some bits of happiness and sadness here and there just like this movie..."
ROMA,26 September 2019,1/10,"I can't believe how I got on the Oscar's trap. I even managed to look it through. Now I wonder if I'm a martyr or a hero. At first, I decided that I was blunt with ages, then calmed down. I'm glad I'm not alone in my disappointment. The whole description of the movie is locked in one word - Boring."
ROMA,13 February 2021,10/10,"I admit this movie is not for everyone. But if you really love cinemas, you have to admit Mr. Cuaron did a phenomenal job. His best work."
ROMA,27 January 2019,10/10,"Never seen deep details like this , i still wondering how they made it , i said again
Amazing"
ROMA,23 February 2020,1/10,Is it an award? Are you kidding me? Waste of time. It's one of the two worst movies I've ever seen.
ROMA,20 December 2018,,"The usual hyped critical acclaimed biggest piece of junk since ""Birdman "" by the artistic bores of the world - Watching a car pulling into a garage & rolling over dog excrements is not artistic genius it's boredom Then watching maid wipe floors make tea r the highlites of this Artistc garbage besides watching 2 ducks fornicate -000 Stars Better off watching a slug go across the sand"
ROMA,27 January 2019,10/10,"Having spent 1968-1969 in Mexico, and living in Roma Sur for a month, I can attest to the scrupulous accuracy of the portrayal shown in this outstanding film. Echevarria the President was a kind of Diaz Ordaz lite, who had ordered the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre of students during that Olympic Year. The actress Aparicio was born for the role she played so convincingly, and the hospital's doctors and nurses were most extraordinary in their performance of a stressed major city facility. Those best appreciate the film who lived however briefly in the time and atmosphere."
ROMA,28 December 2018,1/10,"I've decided to spend 5 more minutes of my life - a much more worthwhile experience than the last ~ 2 hours I'd spent on watching this ""movie"" - to leave a few, last words regarding the ""masterpiece"" I've fallen prey to watch (yeah, ""awards"")...I absolutely don't care how hard was to make this movie, how difficult was to make the cuts, how astonishing was the camera, etc, etc... At some point art becomes a goal in itself, and that is the point where it should be left to the author HIMSELF to look at it, admire it, dissect it, whatever... but not to the audience.What this movie is NOT is a piece of art for a purpose, WITH a purpose.Snobistic, decorative, pretencious, infinitely unimportant, piece of indulgency is what it maybe is. Not worth a trailer, god forbid 2 hours of your life."
ROMA,24 January 2019,9/10,"I started ROMA a month ago, and dropped it in the first five minutes. It broke movie rule #1 - hook me with a compelling teaser immediately to justify the next two hours.
After watching the attention it got at the Golden Globes I decided to give it a second shot.
It made a mess of me.The beauty of Roma's story is it's utter lack of explosions, fire fights, and gratuitous breastage. It drops our guard, making the combination of bourgeoisie life, thinly sheltered from 3rd world life, and challenges addressed in nuance, gut wrenching. The film provides regular tropes, and addressed them in ways that betrayed my suspension of disbelief expectations over and over, until the final vignette had me climbing my chair and bawling in anxiety. But it wasn't the only scene that accomplished that. Cuaròn's cinematography slow burns, and builds with little fanfare that creeps under your skin without your permission.
It's gorgeous, raw, humanist storytelling. The best thing I've seen all year."
ROMA,25 March 2019,1/10,"The only things I got from this film is that life is a hierarchy of despicability. Males are despicable. Rich people are despicable. White people are despicable. Some have multiple despicabilities. At the top of the heap is the White, rich male."
ROMA,24 February 2019,3/10,I need to watch it again because I definitely missed why it is receiving so many accolades. I couldn't keep my eyes open.
ROMA,12 January 2019,10/10,"This film is true to its time, its place, and human nature. It's a complex emotional memoir told with a focus on, but not the point of view of, an indigenous maid in a very typically middle class family in Mexico City. I found it evocative of Ingmar Bergman with a touch of Luis Buñuel."
ROMA,28 January 2019,2/10,"Sure it is technically efficient but it has nothing to appeal to a wide audience; only to aficionados of technique. A very hackneyed story, absolutely emotionless with respect to feeling anything about the characters, distant and cool in projection and a relentlessly boring story with zero entertainment value.Now the other film with 10 Oscar nods, The Favourite, while not likely to be widely popular either, had an excellent plot acted by hugely inspired performances of the three female leads. The thrust, feint and parry of their power stuggle to win the favour of a befuddled Queen was truly magnificent. Deserves all its nominations. In contrast Roma is not worthy of our attention."
ROMA,4 March 2019,10/10,"Beautiful story not understood by people out of our Latinamerican context or that have not lived our Latinamerican context. This is a portrait of our childhood and some middle class families in the 70s and 80s. Some people think that this movie is like the emperor with no cloth, but the truth is that some people are blind and they can not see the beauty of Latinamerican culture, because they have not lived in it. Have you ever heard about something called otherism?, it is when you reject a culture because you are not able to empathize with it due to lack of knowledge. Otherism emerges from the rejection and discrimination of western culture to east cultures (See Edward Said). In this case it wouls be Latinamerican culture. This movie is not for all people; it is for artists, and sensitive people; it is a true poem for Latinamericans."
ROMA,23 December 2018,10/10,"I have never written a review but this movie was so well done and so moving I had to:::This movie has nothing to preach to or sell you. It is only an intimate portrait into human life that allows you to view in Incredible detail.The best type of theme and/or ""moral to the story"" is best hidden (subtly) in the fabric of the story; nuanced in and to only be exposed through the life lived and not the life TOLD.This movie tells you nothing, it only shows you what it is like to be Cleo. Many times it is in the still shots of her quiet reactions to the events unfolding around her that I am moved the most and learn something about the human condition.Lessons of humanity (or the human condition) have been preached and written into countless films for over a century; (There is nothing new there), but in my opinion Roma transcends this method of story telling by not teaching you anything... Roma lets you take part in the suffering, in the mundane, in the laughter,in the beauty of life. Thats the importance of this movie. You are not going on a journey to learn something about these realities of life. You are experiencing them with someone who doesn't have the answers.Alfonso has created a hauntingly beautiful glimpse into his characters experience. It is not a cinematic spectacle or a philosophical statement on life. It is an intimate viewing of what it is to be human without a hollywood narrator and without an emotional score to direct the way we should be viewing it.It is one of my favorite films if not my favorite. A nearly perfect film in my opinion."
ROMA,16 July 2019,10/10,"A masterpiece of art! The characters are real, no fake! And the production design is great!!
It reminds me Vittorio de Sica films from the fifties."
ROMA,1 February 2019,,It's a good movie but I expected something a bit better. I didn't like that the main male characters are both represented as bad persons. That makes it a feminist movie...Great acting and photography just the movie tempo is a bit too slow at times with lots of empty shots. The movie style is totally Fellini as the title so I didn't find it too original.
ROMA,22 January 2019,3/10,"While I get this is an art film (hence the B&W cinematography), this film really had no point except to depict survival in chaos. I do not understand how this film elevates indigenous people of MX as they continue to be servants or trinket buskers to this day in most of MX. This is not a rising above scenario for either the mother or the servant. Instead the color of MX was subverted for B&W, interesting dialog was eliminated among the servants, the true way healthcare works (Pay before you get care, but instead she has a magical employer who pays), and weird sequences depicting martial arts that have only tangential association with the plot. All in all, boring and marginally interesting to watch due to my prior working in MX."
ROMA,5 January 2019,6/10,"Scenario is catchy, a great period drama. But the first half is extremely boring to me. Movie couldn't get me in. Second half is better."
ROMA,30 March 2019,1/10,"If you decided to make a film based on ""a year"" in someone life, at least choose someone who is interesting. Very boring movie, no story line, no drama, no acting skills, a lot of scenes is very long and have no meaning at all. If this movie will end up getting high rates, I will actually ""create"" a movie about myself were half of the scenes is me climbing the stairs, other half staring at nothing..."
ROMA,5 March 2019,9/10,"Although the pace is a bit slow, the film weaves a wonderful and heartfelt story. A very well crafted film!"
ROMA,28 April 2019,2/10,"There's no story, I hated the black & white filming, constant noise and distraction from screaming kids and chattering people, nothing but unlovable characters. Despite the terrible panning, I give them credit for at least filming live action and not filming in a studio or filling it with CGI. Overall I found it utterly pointless."
ROMA,12 March 2019,4/10,"Calling this movie overrated is an understatement, because it's literally about nothing. Instead of going to the cinema and spending money there, hire a real cleaning lady to clean your house to see what this movie is about. I had to force myself to finish it. Are you telling me they could not find any better foreign film? Cinematography is not that great either as others claim to be. Is that really part of the best 2018 had to offer? I don't think so. Why is this nominated for an Oscar is beyond me."
ROMA,31 January 2019,10/10,"I saw ""Roma"" last night, and loved it. It's not often that something so different from the mainstream comes along. It is exquisite to look at; the cinematography blew me away. The entire movie relies on one camera shooting in black and white. It's no wonder it racked up so many Golden Globe nominations. It is art, pure and simple.So how is it different?1. Most films are heavily edited with lots of cuts from closeup to closeup and from angle to angle. Roma's scenes are shot with one camera in one place, panning through and around the scene.2. Most movies rely on closeups to boost the actor's impact, and to establish an emotional connection between the actor and the audience. I can't remember any closeups at all. As a member of the audience, there is this sense of being in a natural space with the actor, at a distance.3. Most movies punch up scenes and underscore plot narrative using music and sound effects. Roma is almost eerily quiet and natural.4. Most movies rely on plot and action to build momentum. The ordinariness of Roma's plot, its prosaic-ness makes it profoundly relatable. It feels real, increasingly so, as the story unfolds.5. Meta-narrative and subtexts are incredibly subtle, but there is visual and narrative irony everywhere. It is nuanced, but somehow hits home.6. Many characters these days are over-developed and over-wrought. Roma's characters possess an almost documentary quality of reality. They are gentle and affectionate and human-scaled.7. Most movies rely on atypically beautiful actors. Roma's roles are filled with people you might encounter on the street or in the supermarket. The lead actor (Yalitza Aparicio) is a Mexican woman with indigenous features that may or may not strike one as beautiful, depending on one's ability to see and understand her. Her humility, depth, modesty, loyalty, and humanity grow throughout the movie. I found myself coming to love her character and care about her a lot.8. Most black and white movies today are visually contrasty with an almost film noir look about them. They are usually very stylized through use of lighting and idiosyncratic camera angles. If there is one word to describe the visual impact of Roma, it is luminous. I assume that it was carefully lit, but it feels like the film was shot with available light. The scenes in the countryside have the luminosity of a Bierstadt or a Moran, but without the contrived, romanticized feel. The Mexican landscape is just exquisite. I've never seen anything like it.9. The film is shot with the technical virtuosity of great architectural photography. With only a couple of intentional exceptions, there is zero lens distortion in the film. Verticals are kept perfect, and the geometry built into the architecture comes through with clarity and impact. The Roma neighborhood in Mexico City, for which the film is named, is distinctively Mediterranean and mid-Century. It was originally inhabited by Syrian Jews, Greeks, and Turks, and those sensibilities show up in the buildings and details. There is a strong sense of place in the film as a result.10. Most of the time, the camera's aperture is set to leave the entire scene in focus. In several critical moments, the cinematographer opens the aperture, softening the focus and riveting the eye on the character. It is, like everything else in the film, very subtle but it works beautifully.In summary, this was one of the freshest film experiences I've had. Many film-making effects and techniques that are used to penetrate the shell of contemporary cynicism and hold the attention of an ADHD audience are completely absent. This film impeaches notions of what's necessary to build and keep narrative and emotional momentum. If there is one word to describe its artistry, I would say it is ""brave."" Cuaron relies on the best parts of himself and his company to build story, empathy, and impact. I so admire him."
ROMA,2 February 2019,1/10,"Inguardabile, lento, inutile, hype creato dal nulla, delusione totale"
ROMA,25 January 2019,1/10,This black and white debacle was pointless and without merit.
ROMA,24 December 2018,10/10,"Tecnicamente perfeito. Um filme belíssimo. Obrigado, Alberto Cuarón."
ROMA,28 December 2018,10/10,Perhaps loved it due to the fact that I'm from the same genaeration of the filmmaker and partly familiar with the same era and its social class. But no doubt it's a masterpiece and will stay tall in film history.
ROMA,24 December 2018,10/10,"Really impressive. I must say that it took some time to get really into the movie , around 30 minutes, but that merely has to do with my (unconscious and unwanted) expectation of a plot. But it's all about life, the simpleness, the unexpected misery, the joy that you can get of simple things, family. You don't need a traditional plot for that."
ROMA,3 February 2020,1/10,"This film is about two women in 1970s Mexico: a living-in maid named Cleo, and her upper-middle class boss, Sofía. At the beginning of the film, Sofia is abandoned by her husband, a doctor who is cold and pays zero attention to her, and is also a distant father. Meanwhile, Cleo is knocked up by her boyfriend, a martial artist and political activist. From the cold interaction between the couple, you can tell they have a purely sexual relationship. In fact, he leaves her at the exact moment she announces she's pregnant. Her lack of an emotional reaction seems to say: ""damn it, this is an inconvenience.""
Both Cleo and Sofía spend the entire movie feeling sorry for themselves. But, deep inside, they don't care much about their problems, or at least not enough to do anything about them (and if they don't care about their problems, why should the viewer care?). It's hard to understand why they lament, given that both men are complete jerks: selfish, aggressive, and lacking in any kind of virtue. The logical thing would be for these women to be relieved to get rid of these men. One would expect them to take action to emancipate themselves and find their true selves. But no, they keep on feeling sorry for themselves during two long hours of film.
To be fair, Cleo does do something to get her boyfriend back, or at least get financial support from him. She visits him in the village where he lives. He predictably rejects her and threatens to beat her up if she returns (making a series of ridiculous karate moves to intimidate her). She, as always, remains and leaves.
It is obvious from the beginning of the film that Cleo does not want the baby. And in a conservative culture like Mexico in the 1970s you'd expect her to be torn between keeping the baby and aborting it. This is a source of conflict that the director could have used to create dramatic tension and explore the inner world of the character. Instead, Cleo takes a totally indifferent attitude and carries the baby to term because why not.
Sofia's plot is even more inane: it has no conflict or drama, just a long series of expositive scene, put there to convince us that she loves her husband and she is desperate for him to come back. Sofia forces her children to write letters to her husband, begging him to return. Sofia rejects a man at a party. Sofia complains to her mother explaining what she feels. She also complains that the husband does not send her any money (lack of money is a constant complaint on her part, but it seems to have no consequences: the family's standard of living remains the same throughout the movie).
The film ends (spoiler alert) when both women decide, for no particular reason, that they no longer care about being abandoned. In a deus ex-machina moment, Cleo loses her baby, which she didn't want anyway. Cuarón saves her from having to decide whether to have an abortion or not, a decision that could have revealed something of Cleo's true character. But there's no space for conflict or drama in this film. Afterwards, she simply returns to her secluded life as a maid. Meanwhile Sofía decides to fend for herself by working (what a hard and surprising decision by someone that has no money) and gets a job without any difficulty. Chloe and Sofia are probably the most passive characters in the history of cinema. They never take risks. They never change.
It should be mentioned that this ""story"" (if it can be called that) is supposedly about two women from different social worlds who support each other. But this support comes down to things like this: When Cleo reveals to her boss that she is pregnant, Sofia (surprise) does not fire her. Instead, Sofía takes her to the gynecologist. Later, Sofia sends her mother to a department store to buy a crib for Cleo. These favors do not involve any cost to Sofia and are therefore, from a dramatic point of view, meaningless. Cleo, on the other hand, does nothing to support Sofia. Towards the end of the film (spoiler alert), the family is on the beach and Chloe throws herself into the sea to rescue the drowning children. But this act has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The scene is there to provoke a moral arousal in the viewer. The scene is also intended to create admiration for a character who, in every other aspect of life, is coward. When they come out of the water, Cleo cries because of her guilt that the baby died. The family hugs her and tells her something like ""everything will be alright"" (more support without cost and hence meaning).
As for the supporting characters, these are life-size cardboard cutouts. All the children do is play and cuddle with the maid. I think there were four of them, but since they had no distinct personality, they were totally indistinguishable from each other. The husband and the boyfriend were, as I said before, one-dimensional, and their only role in the film was to be hated. There was, however, a moment in the film when the husband ha a sympathetic gesture: he encounters Cleo in the hospital, when she is about to give birth, and tells her ""everything will be alright."" More exposition that is insufficient to give the character a positive edge.
Rome is a pretentious, shallow film. An artsy packaging hides its total lack of humanity. Don't fall into that trap."
ROMA,4 January 2019,6/10,"Don't let yourself be fooled: its cinematography is wonderful, the work of the lead actress, splendid, but the story is empty, the narrative lacks emotion with the exception of one scene, the topic contributes practically nothing to the viewer's worldview, and its approach to ethnic and class difference is too benevolent.In his particular Amarcord, Cuarón is unable to submerge us in the world he's portraying, fails when it comes to help us understand the political and social forces acting upon his characters and, above all, forgets to give us something that matters.Its most relevant feature: an indigenous lead."
ROMA,19 February 2019,1/10,"Photography is good, but If you've been to latin america, there is nothing that can really take your breath away in this film.
There is no story line, not a film for everyone I guess."
ROMA,25 December 2018,8/10,"At 01:18:00 on training scene, we see the watching people's back and their shadow is lying on their behind but when the angle changes to these people's faces, the shadows appear on their front. A simple mistake."
ROMA,24 December 2018,2/10,"If your time is important, pls avoid this movie, you will waste 2 hours watching a movie that nothing happens."
ROMA,8 January 2019,8/10,"I am amazed at how most people have missed the obvious depiction of racial dynamics in Mexico and how well-portrayed they are in the story. Part of the value of the story is precisely that depiction rarely seen or even mentioned. Another value is the historical massacre of protesters that took place by Mexican authorities when the Olympics took place in Mexico City. And that was 1968, not ""the early 70s."" The value of the film therefore is more than technical brilliance: it tells the story of poor Indians working for Mestizo and/or white Mexican families and the lives of those people in the 1960s."
ROMA,20 February 2019,9/10,"A movie about the ""strong"" men driving through their lives in style without scratches, perfectly avoiding all the obstacles and about the ""weak"" women hitting every corner while cleaning all that sh.t left behind..."
ROMA,3 February 2019,5/10,"Not for me.
I can appreciate Cuaron's work with the camera but that's about it.
The movie is sooooooo slow loks like I spend my entire weekend on it. If you having second thoughts about watching it or not I strongly recommend you don't.
But I can totally get the fuss about the movie and it's importance. Anyway I'd wish I've liked.Press F to pay respect.F."
ROMA,8 December 2018,6/10,Everything is overstaged. You feel the crew. Actors are not so great. I did not beleive in this movie and characters. A few nice moments but the staging broke my experience.The camera framing was amazing and the locations outstanding.
ROMA,30 November 2019,1/10,"Really don't understand all the hype about this movie, it took me three days to finish this because everytine I used to fall asleep after 20 min.May be I'm a fool, really don't understand why did it got so many awards"
ROMA,14 March 2019,1/10,I am so disappointed to know that this piece of non sense no story movie has won an Oscar. Shame shame shame.
ROMA,16 December 2018,5/10,"Whoever says that this is the movie of the year (some of them says last decade) dont give an ear to them.. absolute time wasting...

ROMA,10 March 2019,2/10,"I don't know what this thing with oscars is lately, but years back only really good movies deserved it like The Godfather.
I tried to watch this movie because yes of the Oscar. I'm not gonnalisten to that any longer.
All those movies who are getting an Oscar these days, i don't understand half of them.
So I started this movie and was waiting and waiting for wat exactly? Nothing happened!
After one I thought I'm gonna stop with this, take a nap and then google it.
Then if found out on this website that I'm not the only one with this opinion.
So I stopped after one hour and I'm glad I took that decision, had enough time to watch another movie at my free Sunday."
ROMA,28 September 2019,9/10,"I saw the movie a year after it released so i knew the reviews about the movie before i see it. I know why lots of people get bored with this movie and this is why you can not watch this good work every time of the day. So i decided to see it as a documentary movie.
It is not that easy to make an interesting movie from an uninteresting storyline.
It is completely a deep movie just more than a boring movie."
ROMA,31 December 2018,1/10,"I already wasted over two hours watching the movie so i will not waste time writing a long review. Movie is super boring period. I dont get the high rating, is the worst movie i have seen in a long long time."
ROMA,19 December 2018,4/10,"Really boring film, I decided to let it before it finishes.. I hope I can get some time later to finish it because it seems the story has some kind of interesting plot (or I'm not getting why it has so many good reviews). But for me, being a latino guy, this was like watching a boring day in my neighborhood.."
ROMA,13 January 2019,2/10,"If a film only needed to contain nice film views this would get a better reviw. The underlying story you get after five minutes, after that thats nothing more to this movie. Dont bother watching it.If you think this is a masterpiece, you sligthly have the iq to open a door, so atleast I will congrats you for that."
ROMA,26 January 2019,6/10,"Mmmm I dunno
Average but there is something good andan attracting."
ROMA,27 February 2019,2/10,Took ten minutes of this movie and I was out like a baby and it usually takes a lot to knock me out because of my prescription for Adderall. I tried to watch it the next night thinking maybe I was just really tired. Well I fell asleep again and since I turned it off an hour ago I'm wide awake. It's 3:44am right now. Now that I can't fall asleep I'm going to do one more experiment and go out the movie back on. Will report back.Update: changed to a two star because there's value in something that can put you to sleep so well. I got the movie back on at 3:49 am and I was out in ten minutes. One of the bad things though is I remembered those ten minutes of the movie.
ROMA,30 December 2018,2/10,"Great shots, looks so real... But boring.
I don't understand the good reviews, nobody judge the movie based on the pure enjoyment it gives.
Don't waste your precious time!"
ROMA,20 January 2019,10/10,"You do not have to be Mexican to get this movie... it's by far the most poetic, clear in its message foreign movie I've seen this season. It transcends timelessness and nostalgia in a black and white veil of perfection."
ROMA,19 February 2019,1/10,I heard it was a great movie. I sat there and wasted time waiting for it to be a good movie. It is not a good movie. All hype and now i am pissed i even watched it.
ROMA,26 January 2019,4/10,"I kept watching in hopes of being captivated, to realize that there was just not much to the movie."
ROMA,29 January 2021,1/10,"I didn't make it to the end. I just couldn't take it anymore. What a waste of time. Most boring movie, ever!"
ROMA,1 February 2019,1/10,"I really wanted to watch this movie with the faith in the director and ocsar nominations, I was utterly disappointed as 1) The screenplay or the story telling does not help you get attached the lead character
2) Camera pans out and tries to hook you to a scene but it's just futile as there is almost nothing dramatic happening
3) The screenplay play is so slow that you are automatically prepared for the scene and hence there is no surprise or wow factor
4) Too many logical loop holes, like she is pregnant for 3 months and it seems as if she had an intercourse only the day before, not sure why the car gets trashed so many times, not sure how maids get somuch time to go out and have fun while it's depicted as they work so hard, where is kids grandmother when their mom talks to them about the divorce, you would rather have your mom with you than having the maid when the kids are told about a
divorce....I can go on like this
5)No background score?!"
ROMA,19 February 2019,1/10,"If you watch in fast forward, you wouldn't miss much..."
ROMA,24 February 2019,2/10,Just saw Green Book last night and today Roma. Night and day. Entertaining and touching Grren Book versus boring and slow Roma. I made myself watch Roma but I will be sad if it wins Best Picture.
ROMA,14 January 2019,9/10,"People may think it's boring but trust me If you are a fan of magical realism novels, then you'll see how outstanding this film is."
ROMA,27 January 2019,3/10,"This movie has been hyped so much and so many of the reviews are so positive...makes me wonder....did we watch the same movie?!? Why in the world was it nominated for so many awards- including best picture and best director for Golden Globes and Oscars to name a few??????Is it because it's done in black and white and set back in the 70's that makes it so 'special'? Is that a reason so many people have jumped on the bandwagon? Something like, ""well so many said it was so good so if I don't think it's good then I must not be getting it so I'll just say it's good too, so I am not left out and/or seem uncultured""? Is it because of the back story of the movie or the fact that Alfonso directed it, wrote it and shot it (which is no easy feat) so it deserves a lot of awards?It is WAY too long!!!!!! WAY TOO LONG!!!! It took forever to actually get to anything with any meaning or impact- I'm talking about 1 1/2 hours into it. We were watching a screener because we are voting for various movies, or not, and we were both baffled as the hype (and we are obviously both in the business). This in no way at all screams best picture to us. At all. Should not have even been nominated.He held on shots that had no reasoning behind them- no impact and/or added to the narrative AT ALL. The transitions were terrible. So many of the times you didn't know what was happening and/or how much time had gone by. There were huge gaps in the story. There was an earthquake and a fire that had ZERO impact on the story- ZERO. A guy broke out into song for no apparent reason. Weird choicesCut it down to 1 1/2 hours and you might have something good. MAYBE have something good."
ROMA,16 February 2019,5/10,Espected to see a great movie but ramain disapointed.
ROMA,17 December 2018,4/10,"Excelente fotografía que no acompaña la historia, anodina, que cuenta"
ROMA,23 December 2018,8/10,If you are expecting american style Hollywood movie... Avoid watching Roma. This movie is more on the artistic side of films. If you are looking for a different type of cinematic experience then you should definitely watch this great movie.
ROMA,3 February 2019,9/10,"Elegant. That's the best word I can find for the velvety smooth tracking shots, the slow revolutions around the set and the long takes that were undoubtedly meticulously planned, yet acted out with a natural air that lets you fade into the scene yourself.Not sure if I'd call it 10 Oscars good, but the cineaste in me felt moved by it and understands what makes it a critical dream.
A sort of masterful homage to the post-war neo-realists.Called Roma because they live in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City."
ROMA,7 April 2019,10/10,"If u need cinematic twists, unreal drama, that happy ending for every episode in a movie... this movie is not for you folks.
This movie is a cinematic experience. The way Alphonso have portrayed the screenplay through the perspective of Cleo just outstanding. Her world, her worries, her strengths, her courage everything is confined within the movie in subtle ways possible.
Especially if u keenly watch the things happening in the background and what is happening in cleo's life.
Definitely a lesson for budding film makers.
Cinematography excellent 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Take a bow Alphonso.
I cried, smiled and seems to have lived with those characters in ROMA .
Thanks To the crew of this movie."
ROMA,4 January 2019,9/10,Excellent cinematography and heart touching work. Felt so real. Superb direction and camera work. Beautiful acting.. very different from others.. must watch..... new artistic levels reached. Bravo.
ROMA,24 January 2019,3/10,"It was O.K. for a T.V. drama but not a great movie cinematography aside. It was very predictable. Well, not entirely, I thought the kids would drown but why did the mother think she needed to get the tires checked when kids were playing in the surf? And why did Cleo need to dry the kid off instead of watching the ones in the water? We left thinking ""is that all there is?"""
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,The scene with the dog poop in the car port sums up my feelings on the film
ROMA,19 December 2018,6/10,"I think the photography is very good as well as the atmosphere of the 70s, but her performance and the script is very flat, she needs acting classes, I think the movie is overrated."
ROMA,26 December 2018,1/10,"This film could only be described as a total waste of time. I have no idea how it got rated so high! Blunt, colourless, vertigo-camera-slow-mo-unravelling garbage of a film."
ROMA,25 February 2019,1/10,"Nothing special, nothing artistic, nothing worth to watch!
I wasted 2 hours of my life!"
ROMA,30 March 2020,1/10,It's a very bad movie. absolutely a waste of time...
ROMA,28 October 2020,9/10,Beautiful tale about social disparities in developing countries
ROMA,8 February 2019,2/10,"The film tells the life of your neighbor, the poor woman or your friend, who is going to have a blessing and loses her, bored from beginning to end. speak of a social issue of which in this part of the world (South America) we are already saturated, Cantinflas captured it in each of his films and the novels of any channel also pass it. Win the Oscar maybe for the money that his director injected to show it as a wonder in European countries and the north where the same situation exists but TV does not saturate them with the same song. 180% NOT entertained and NOT recommended. 1000% Bored."
ROMA,26 May 2020,6/10,"While most of the critics praised the movie and it had so many nominations and wins, to me Great movie boils down to a very simple emotion: was I touched or not?-It is not a bad movie, no, God forbid, lots of work, effort, sweat and intricate nuances were put together. Lots of technicalities like deep background good quality Sound, black and white Color etc. All right, so? I think lately we started to fixate to much on the ""technical characteristics"" of the movies. Let's not forget Movie is and art form and technicalities are not the priority of the Arts.-They say it is based on the Director's personal childhood story, fine, I respect that but what is so special about this particular story?! Nothing, there are millions of stories like this one in Mexico and elsewhere. In the art of movie-making the Story must be relatable, sure, but also Unique!-And finally, in my humble opinion, it was too slow, I got bored! I know, many say that this is the uniqueness of the movie that it unfolds on a ""normal"" slow pace but it is not interesting like this! Sorry, Director.Maybe Roma deserves Best Movie title among foreign language movies but not because it was the best but because there was none better and it did not deserve all the fuss around it definitely! Again, not a bad movie, six stars max and it did not really touch me. I apologize."
ROMA,20 February 2019,,"I could hardly hate this movie more. The slow pace is annoying and I could not get myself to care about anyone in the story. Every shot seems to linger 30 seconds too long. Even while showing forest fires and street riots, it feels like nothing ever happens. Just characters all talking at once, kids screaming, drunk adults shooting guns randomly, and everyone but the maid ignoring the dog. As a gruesome treat, a half dozen dog heads are shown stuffed and mounted on the walls in a bedroom where the kids have to sleep."
ROMA,9 November 2018,5/10,"I've seen the word immersive thrown around, and yes this is an immersive slice of life in 60s/70s Mexico City or thereabouts. You feel like you are are there and these are real people going about their lives, and you're just watching from the sidelines. Cuaron can really pull you in like that. The problem is that once you're there, it's kind of boring. Unremarkable dialogue, plot....this movie plods along and then ends and yeah you may have seen some peoples lives as they were at a particular time and place, but did you need to?Don't get me wrong, the quality of the film is top notch. Cinematography is awesome as usual. How the sound played across the room in the theater was pretty cool. Some parts here and there are really good. I understand why there are great reviews, but what we have here is a movie for cinephiles. Still better than Widows though."
ROMA,19 December 2018,10/10,The level of detail Cuarón uses to tell the story of Cleo is astounding. I don't know much about the technicalities of cinema but I know every frame in this movie was like a poem. I find it incredible that this is Yalitza's first acting credit.
ROMA,21 December 2018,1/10,"As I said. A movie about my grandmother just walking around her house and doing the loundry, cleaning the dishes or crying about her lost husband would be less boring than this movie. This is my first review ever and I wanted to say that I don't understand what's really the point of this movie. Very slow, showing only trivial events. Please don't waste two hours of your life with this movie."
ROMA,19 December 2018,9/10,"In Roma every aspect of cinema ranging from performance to cinematography to sound design to raw gut punch moments are carried out with such care, detail and love that you can't help but be deeply immersed in the world that Cuarón builds; it's so vivid and detailed it feels like Cuarón was able to trap the past in a bottle and pour it onto the big screen for all to see.
There is a strong emphasis on the visual in Roma, as Cuarón has taken the mantle of director of photography, (a position usually reserved for long-time collaborator, friend and three time Oscar winner Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki) and sets out the film's own unique visual vocabulary which is undeniably beautiful but also wonderfully effective at commanding your attention and casting that wonderful spell that tricks you into forgetting that you're watching a film.
As the opening credits play out over a singular shot of a tiled floor being mopped, the water reflecting a window of light into the sky where planes can be seen slowly drifting overhead, we know that we are in safe hands and oh boy do these hands feel soft and warm. The film oozes compassion and empathy, as Cuarón is most interested in examining human hardship and how women are, as the mother of the family tells Cleo, completely alone in this world, and cinema as Cuarón imagines it, is super effective at describing the afflictions of the individual. Though the film is dedicated to Cleo, the point of view of the film is not restricted to her's alone, Cuarón often places the eyeline at a child's height which helps create one of the film's most interesting dynamics that children are often completely oblivious to the darker more painful narratives swirling above their heads.
The film is not that interested in hitting plot points or setting up character arcs, in fact it takes pride in the way it ignores most of the storytelling tips you'd find in Robert McKee's ""Story"", and that is one of Roma's biggest triumphs, it is able to devote itself to observing characters slowly change as life has its way, the film has an enormous amount of time for simply watching it's characters behave, a luxury that most films can't afford.
Roma is beautiful, unique and full of compassion and fully deserving of your 2 hours 15 minutes."
ROMA,1 June 2019,1/10,"It was a very bad movie. It was extremely boring. This movie is very famous, but it is a very bad movie, sorry for the producer of this movie"
ROMA,20 December 2019,3/10,"Really just a boring film with black white screen ,.i dont get what the point from this film ,waste time.
U want see a great cinematography film just watch The Fall (2006) thats a true worth it cinematography film u will get everything with those film story telling and everything."
ROMA,30 December 2018,10/10,"This movie shows you life. It shows you that everything goes on, even if you don't. It doesn't matter if you are rich, or you are poor, tragedy hits us all"
ROMA,11 December 2018,10/10,"This masterpiece is unbelievable, amazing, outstanding, every great word in the dictionary."
ROMA,26 January 2019,8/10,"I would just like to mention how this movie depicts everyday struggles of women. Especially in the scene where the martial arts trainer is showing his special trick that only Masters can do and the trainees agree and admire him after their attempt. But Cleo can do it also without any effort, which goes completely unnoticed, as well as her life strengths in general. One mans special skill as an ordinary task of average woman. It was epic."
ROMA,20 November 2019,9/10,It is superb. I thought the scenes in Mexico City are fantastic.
ROMA,12 June 2019,10/10,"Before watching this, I didn't know too much about it except that it was going to be a slow, visually-oriented, foreign language film. I have seen and love many films of this type by filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Satyajit Ray, Wong Kar-wai, Akira Kurosawa, and Bela Tarr, but I know that you need to be in the right frame of mind to invest in and enjoy them. It was over a year before I finally felt like I was in the right mood, but once I watched this it was a powerfully moving experience.After watching Roma, I was disheartened to see the overwhelming number of one star reviews posted here on IMDb. I can only surmise that the critical and award season hype around this film, combined with the popularity of Netflix, is what led so many people to watch this movie without knowing what they were getting themselves into and having such a negative reaction to it.Unlike films that try to fill every second with action, dialogue, jokes, drama, and a fast-paced plot, this film lingers on moments that feel true to human life. Cuarón shows more than he tells, which can come off as pretentious to those used to the over-explained and generic plots used in blockbuster movies to accommodate as broad of an audience as possible. You may feel somewhat bored during parts of Roma, but for a thoughtful and patient viewer, the quiet spaces in this type of film make you as much a participant as a viewer by giving you time to think your own thoughts and feel your own emotions."
ROMA,18 December 2018,4/10,"I'm Mexican and I needed to set subtitles on for this film. The whole movie feels like watching people acting in a stage, kind of rehearsing and not really ready to release the film."
ROMA,2 January 2019,2/10,"I get that it's artistic. I see what they are trying to convey...but WOW. Boring. So boring.
And so much noise and chaos and dogs barking and kids yelling and arguing...nothing happens and it's just stressfull to watch. 2 hours and 15 minutes wasted."
ROMA,31 August 2019,1/10,"This thing was an Oscars contender?
As others have said - Emperor has no clothes.
You want to appear sophisticated rather than call it like it is, then yeah.
I stopped half way through bored as hell. I wondering if i was missing something significant in the movie and googled the reviews. Phew, found that it seems like a common sentiment.
I rarely write reviews here but felt compelled to try and save other people from this misery.
I can't believe this same guy made 'Gravity' which was excellent."
ROMA,15 January 2019,2/10,"This 2 hour and 15 minute movie should have been cut down to 90 minutes. Also... why are they hiding the fact that this is a movie in SPANISH. Call it what it is... a foreign language film. It is NOT being marketed that way in the USA.Most of the VERY long tracking shots go nowhere. When she is going to the restaurant and meets a new man, we do NOT need to follow her walking for 2 blocks along the sidewalk. We do NOT need to follow her as she turns out the lights in the house. We follow her room by room by room by room.... etc. We never find out why she left one of the light ON in one of the rooms and then she tells her maid friend to turn off the lights while she is washing dishes.The cinematography is nice but BORING. We don't need giant wide shots in order to wait for someone, in the far away background, to enter the frame. The final shot it STUPID. Where is she going?????Cuaron is in love with his own directing. We are not."
ROMA,28 December 2018,1/10,"Good if you have trouble sleeping, yaaaawn😴
Not much happening, so slow."
ROMA,14 January 2019,8/10,"Beautifully shot. Impressive long takes as per with Cuarón. Very emotional later in the film, however slow start drags it down to an 8 in my opinion. Well worth a watch if your in the right mood."
ROMA,25 February 2019,3/10,"Yes has some beautiful cinematography but it did not engage me whatsoever. I really couldn't get into it at all. Forced myself to finish it because I thought it would have a point but in the end it was pointless, at least to me. I really wanted to care about these characters."
ROMA,23 January 2019,10/10,"Every single thing about this movie is arts. Each scene is just painting.
The story will get you I promise. Watch it without any doubt."
ROMA,9 June 2019,10/10,"This is what cinema can do. A meditative love poem to the people who often go unnoticed. This was absolutely spectacular. This film cannot be graded on a rubric; it is a masterful work of art. He didn't make this film for you, so he doesn't owe you anything."
ROMA,8 January 2019,2/10,Creative cinematography but no strong characters or storyline.
ROMA,21 March 2020,10/10,This movie is all about the skilled cinematography and a brief glimpse into some common people's lives. I enjoyed it very much.
ROMA,12 January 2019,1/10,I take that back... this is 1 of the worst movies of this decade. It really is that bad. How anybody could rate this higher than 2-3 starts is beyond me. It makes me question the intelligence of people giving such high ratings.
ROMA,19 January 2019,7/10,"Honestly there is nothing to watch this movie only stunning photography and only 4-5 minute movie climax scene.
I got headache while watching this movie"
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,Don't know if it was good or bad. Stayed with it for nearly 15 minutes and there were no subtitles. Since I do not know Spanish it was time to move on.
ROMA,23 January 2019,2/10,"I thought if I watched this I would understand the hype. I don't. I get that its artistic, technically well done. I like more story and plot to my movies. I see about 95% of movies available locally and try to access other acclaimed movies and I just don't understand how this is nominated for best film...foriegn language film yes, not in the main category. I read someone compare watching this film to watching paint dry and I would have to agree. Very disappointing after all the hype. Someone hired a great publicity team!"
ROMA,20 December 2018,,"If this movie took place in my yard, I'd draw the blinds"
ROMA,13 January 2019,4/10,"I see lots of films but I can't remember a more over rated film. If this film wins the Oscar for best movie, I'll be very disappointed. Unless you grew up in Mexico in the 1970-80's, I don't see how anyone would enjoy the movie. We kept waiting for it to get exciting. It was a very boring movie. Everyone I've spoken to agrees. Last but not least, I didn't find art in all of the various shots of dog excrement on the driveway of the family home.In contrast, I just saw the Polish movie Cold War"" tonight and found it a much better movie...so thoughtful and well done. Beautifully shot in black and white and excellent acting. A very moving love story. If you have a choice between Cold War and Roma, definitely go to see Cold War!"
ROMA,18 December 2018,8/10,"Review of Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma""It has become expected of Alfonso Cuaron to create a deep emotional and personal connection with the audience, through strongly developed characters and complex but familiar stories combined with often elaborate cinematography, involving music and plenty of symbolism and metaphor - as he did in previous films such as Children Of Men, Y Tu Mama También and Great Expectations - in his latest showing ""Roma"" he might have taken it a step further.Sometimes subtle and sometimes bold, Cuaron brings you deeper than his other films by shooting in wide format to focus you line of sight and then punch you with memorable scenery, in a low contrast black and white to distract less from the storyline, in mostly natural lighting to make you feel familiar to the environment, with still shots or slow basic camera movements that framed the entire family rather than one character so you'll know is not a story of someone rather that somethings, and with sound production that is so intricate and so masterfully recorded and mixed that is worthy of is own review (and an Oscar).And as far as the story... while your first impresión of Roma might be of a documentary, Cuaron only referenced his upbringing while propelling into a much broader story. And while it may seem lengthy, it's merely just long enough to to carefully present the details.
Roma is not so much a portrait of the once opulent Colonia Roma of Mexico City but largely a display of modern society, specially of the role of women, with all their joys and sorrows, their influence over men and the influence of men over them which happens to be destructive at times.The global appeal of this story is subliminally injected trough the casual passing of an airplane, the karate practicing boyfriend, the the summer home family outing with an American family or the fathers work trips to Quebec but mostly with the story not focusing so much on the idiosyncrasies of Mexican culture but on the very broad appeal of the events of the film. he alludes to the broader appeal in a scene were the family is watching on TV, two astronauts struggling in space, reminiscent to his film Gravity, where we were at the edges of our seats by events that none of us will ever experience while Roma is so personal that is sure to strike a chord with anyone breathing.Cuaron presents all of this through the story of Cleo, a indigenous house maid for a wealthy Mexican family in the 70s. Throughout the film we're presented with the social disparities that plague not only Mexican society but global. Such as in a scene where Cleo prepares a soft boiled egg for one of the children and as she shakes some salt on it, the child takes the salt shaker and pour his desired amount on the egg. Cleo deeply cares for the children and they love her as well but this scene clearly shows us how the children as much as they may respect her see her a mother figure they also have entrenched their role of masters. Or when Cleo was welcomed into the family room to share a tv show with the family and as she sat down one of the children embraced her only to be later asked by the mother to make a tea for the man of the house. You see the Mother embrace and comfort Cleo as a member of the family and the children tell her they love her as she tucks them away while later taking out family frustrations on her.And while these disparities exist, Cuaron also shows how we are also all alike. By a forest fire at the summer home where both the wealthy and the help end up trying to extinguish the flames. In a scene worthy of cinema history by the way. A scene so loaded in meaning. Where all of us were united against the fire. Or when Cleos relationship deteriorates at the same time as the Mothers. They both suffer loss and betrayal in levels devastating to each and that only brings them closer and makes them equal.This is a film about many aspects of life and in many beautiful scenes we metaphorically see how life continues in the face of disaster such when babies are saved from falling debris from an earthquake by the incubator they're sleeping in. Or when we see street vendors pass by as the family is braking apart. But we see this even brighter towards the ending of the film where despite the hardship endured by the family, where the mother facing her new life with four children with her head held high and where Cleo is forced to face her deepest fears and accept her reality, they all drive on.It is not a coincidence that this story of struggle is depicted through the experiences of women. Cuaron clearly places women in their rightful place as pillars of an ungrateful society. Throughout the film you see Cleo scooping up the dogs poop and washing the floor from the garage so the master doesn't run it over with his big fancy car. The message couldn't be clearer.This film places women of all walks of society in a common trait. That of the carriers of life.Alfonso Cuaron has always succeeded in bringing us films that are as emotionally connecting as they are visually rich. Is this a masterpiece for him? Maybe. For cinema? Most likely."
ROMA,8 February 2021,1/10,Much like the dog eggs often scooped up from the symmetrical tiled floors in the car port this movie is a big pile of 5hit.Absolute waste of 2:11:10s never to be reclaimed. Don't waste your time.
ROMA,18 December 2018,9/10,"I've read a number of reviews here - quite a few, in fact. Here's what I've come up with.If you're going to see 'Roma' for character development, you will be disappointed. There really isn't any to speak of, and I don't think the director was interested in it, either. What Cuaron IS interested in is SHOWING things happening to people and their reaction to it, something akin to Eisenstein's 'Potemkin'. You don't 'know' those sailors, or the woman on the steps with her glasses: they are archtypes, but very human, reacting to events. This is what you have in 'Roma'. Most of the dialog reinforces it. For the most part, it is banal. There are no long speeches, no philosophising. The events can be mundane, dramatic, horrifying, emotional. I think what Cuaron wanted was for the audience to react to those events on a viceral level, as the people in his film do, expunging the personal with something universal. On this level, I think he succeeds. Furthermore, the camera is often at a distance from the people and events he photographs, re-inforcing the objective over the subjective.As for a dramatic arch, there is one, but not in any traditional sense. The exposition lasts much longer than normal, and the drama that follows is compressed by comparison. Some viewers were put off by this. I was not.There is also much talk of 'slice of life' concerning 'Roma'. I suppose it is a slice of life. But here time is purely cinematic, not in any sense of things happening in real time.Visually the film is very controlled. You have very few cuts, and what cuts there are, are very unobtrusive. What you have are long takes - panning and revealing, often in great detail, sometimes revealing something very simple. This emphasis on what the camera does was sometimes bothersome for me. One can be too conscious of the camera. But more times than not, the 'revealing' compensates for this stylistic rigidity. It is a question of accepting the director's style.Very few have commented on the sound design of the film, which to me is one of the marvels of 'Roma'. Cuaron uses surround sound creatively and expressively, not just of things coming and going. One is completely immersed in the sound of a barrio, or a country home, a festival, or the ocean, often heightening the sound for emotional effect. The audio becomes a crucial factor in the ambience of the film.Another wonder of 'Roma' is it's iconic imagery. I'm not going to mention what those images are, but I can think of three. (I can think of four in all of Bergman's output.)And lastly, there is no traditional soundtrack. Just ambient sounds.I highly recommend this film. But I think one has to go with an open mind. This is NOT a Hollywood film, where most things are spelled out for you, as in point A to point B to point C. And I think a viewer has to work a little in order to take in what the film is SHOWING, not what it is TELLING."
ROMA,10 March 2019,4/10,"Beautiful picture, but no story at all. Alao, a few bad tribute scenes to Buñuel"
ROMA,3 December 2018,10/10,I saw this film at the Cairo International Film Festival. It is a cinematic masterpiece and the best film in 2018
ROMA,27 January 2019,4/10,"It took three starts for me to get engaged and through this film. The black and white cinematography is strikingly clear and beautifully lit but the long panning shots grew tiresome. Dialogue is sparse, to say the least. There isn't enough action or emotion to overcome the long silences. It's a story about a maid/nanny for a middle-class family going though a marital separation. What's much more interesting is a NYT's story about the lead female character and how she came to get the part with no previous acting experience or ambition to become an actress."
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,"Black and white photography can be stunning, or not. The scenes in this movie left me cold. There was little story and less character development. Most of the negative reviews seem to agree on one thing, that the cinematography was stunning. You could walk into a room with an iPhone, turn the color off, and get much the same shots. Some directors overuse close-ups. Eventually I longed to see the actors faces up close. The absence of close-up shots really diminished this movie."
ROMA,25 April 2019,4/10,"I acctually saw this in a theather with no expetarions what so ever. So what my verdict?Every single frame of this I would gladly hang on my wall. Its really beautiful!
Other than that, the movie is extremely overrated and really boring.
There is one, or mabey two scenes in this, overlong film, that I actually felt something but I would not reccomend it to anyone."
ROMA,12 June 2020,4/10,I wasted my time to watch this boring movie 😂.. ...
ROMA,15 December 2018,9/10,In the future it will be l one of the most important movies of this period
ROMA,2 February 2019,5/10,"Come on people, photography is beautiful, then what?Okay, I get it. This is a movie about ordinary people's lives. There are quite a few great moments, like the ones at the maternity, the beach and the riot. But there are so many boring/pointless scenes that they honestly make watching this movie really difficult."
ROMA,8 April 2019,2/10,As an average consumer i am definitely super bored. I watch this all day. Of course because there were a lot of pauses but I can't just leave things unfinished...but in this case this quality of mine was really unnecessary.
ROMA,1 September 2019,1/10,Boring at!!! I have never seen such a boring movie in my life. One of the worst movies by far
ROMA,21 September 2019,4/10,"You can tell the same in 90 minutes: too long!!!
Seriously wath something else"
ROMA,10 January 2019,8/10,"""Cauron really shows an incredible amount of restraint here, a remarkably understated film from the filmmaker that has previously dealt in bombast, what with Children of Men and Gravity."
ROMA,24 January 2019,1/10,"That is what I would give this movie. I've seen many movies in many different genres and I don't get the hype over this ""film."" It is so lacking of any storyline. A maid and her friend being nannies or maids in the 1970s. Yeah and? How is this movie up for best picture? How can any Netflix movie be up for best picture? It might be a good idea for the academy to limit what movies can be considered for the Oscars. This is a prime example of why Netflix films should NOT be in the Oscar running."

ROMA,29 December 2018,3/10,"I am old enough to remember the reasons people did not like many independent movies in the 60's and 70's. Right from the beginning this screamed ""art film"". Yes, it was well shot and very professionally done. And of course, the current fad of ""men bad, women good "", was the message. It is not feminist, it is simply anti-male. I am on my way to the PSIFF and I really hope that sanity will prevail."
ROMA,15 July 2021,10/10,"If you used to look around as a kid you probably had many questions. Is my mom happy? Why are adults always so serious? What are the things that they keep hiding from us?This movie takes you through a journey in the life of the unsug hero of your childhood: the one who always knew were your lost socks would be found, the one who guaranteed food would be on the table everyday, at the right time, cooked the way you liked... The one who would almost never hear a ""thank you"", but never demand it.Cuarón answers the questions of his childhood and examines with great care and attention the roles that created the world in which he was brought up through many different dimensions: class, gender, age, politics, culture, language, offering a beautiful portrait of a point in time that created the mexican society of today and still resonates with him.I never write reviews but after seeing the scary reaction in the review section here I had to come defend this movie. People complain about the characters, or the slow pace, or the subtitles... But what really got me is that people say it had ""NO STORY"", and that proves the point of the movie beautifully - this is (to some extent) the story of most of us, and the fact that we can't recognize that contribution in our past is heartbreaking.Like your grandma, like your mother, like your nanny, Cleo is a woman too, and she has a story deeply entangled in your own. But you have to open your heart and come into her world... And then you'll find out about the most kept secret in history: it's the hard, invisible, underestimated and unpaid work of silent women that has kept this world spinning."

I genuinely think Children Of Men is one of the best films of the last 20 years.
I genuinely think Gravity is the best 3D film ever made and probably the best Hollywood space movie based on real life ever made.
Yes, I think Alfonso is awesome.
When the world says the that, this is what happens.
Directors crawl up their own backside and make crap like this.

Alfonso Cuaron has certainly done greater than this. From my point of view this movie has nothing special, it is seemingly boring, not a consistent plot, extremely distant characters, overall a waste of time.

ROMA,24 February 2019,4/10,"My wife and I both really wanted to like this movie, but it was a huge disappointment. It's essentially a 2 hour home movie.

Maybe the direction is incredible but only coz I don't understand. Movies has to be entertaining first they comes the other instruments, the movie is very poor in al aspects, very normal story happens everyday to millions of people, doesn't have a start or an end, it's just filming one boring simple life"
ROMA,10 March 2019,2/10,"A film about nothing, i mean, which part of the whole story is remarkable enough to make a movie about it? It´s just filled with a lot of unnecesary scenes, that doesn´t have impact on the storyline. For example, the earthquake scene (doesn´t even count as a spoiler), what is the point of it? Nothing happens after it, it is just for doing a camera panning? Like that one, there are at least 8 thinhs that happens in the movie with cero impact. It is really frustrating, you finally see something is going to happen, and five seconds later, nevermind nothing happened.
Amazingly boring story, i´m having a hard time imagine how people enjoyed this, besides of the camera work, and the cinematography, which in my opinion, is just not enough."
ROMA,21 January 2019,4/10,"This movie is the film equivalent of noise music. It's only labeled as a movie because nobody's quite sure what else to call it. No matter how good the shots are in the film, and how impressive it is that extras actually did their job, this movie is still a boring slog that doesn't warrant spending 2 hours and 15 minutes of your time with."

ROMA,3 October 2020,4/10,Si certo grande tecnica e premi meritati. Ma fare cinema è raccontare ed emozionare. L'ha fatto Roma? No di certo.
ROMA,28 April 2019,10/10,This is a masterpiece. The acting is superb and the photography is brilliant. The story is very touching.
ROMA,28 February 2019,6/10,"Roma reminded me of a couple of other awarded modern ""classics"" in its structure and, let's say, intention. Movies like Manchester by the sea - also produced by Netflix - and Moonlight gave me the same feeling of frustration: a huge sensation of emptiness, contrasted by the aesthetical pretentiousness that their auteurs evidently have.When I watched Roma, I was already aware that the technical elements were a must-see: Cuarón's cinematography, for instance, was said to be astonishing. Indeed, for a cinema amateur like me, these factors looked fairly enjoyable, and composed a great artistic atmosphere, stylistically speaking. In a nutshell, I can only praise this superficial aspect of the picture, and I agree with Roma's lovers that it make the movie, at least, watchable.The big problem is that this perfection is not accompanied by emotional captivation. The point is not exactly the lack of storytelling - there are movies based on mere daily life that contain the necessary deepness, like the Brazilian picture Aquarius. None of the sub-plots Cuarón created managed to emotional catharsis, and this seems to be not due to the banality of the events themselves, but to the prioritization of the picture as shape. The director seemed more occupied with maintaining and expanding his recognizable trademarks, and not with developing the emotional conflicts of his characters - or making a comment about the implicit power relations between a maid and her boss.To conclude, I couldn't forget to mention the contradiction of a movie that, intending to be an art project in its very physical meaning, was not done to be originally exhibited in cinemas, excluding exceptional sessions. To paraphrase Almodóvar's state about the Palme d'Or, it would be kind of paradoxical to give a Best Picture award at the Oscars to a movie which was not meant to be watched in the big screen."

........"
ROMA,23 December 2018,3/10,"First a couple of disclaimers: I am a ""sort of upper middle class"" Mexican born and I was 16 yrs old on 1971, the year described in the movie. Most of what comes about is truthful, I would dare to say it seems autobiographical from Cuaron's point of view. Women, married or single were treated badly, cheated on, abandoned and ignored. Women are objects in most of our modern societies, so that rang true. Women that worked as house help were also mighty mistreated like Cleo was. They are loved because they are indispensable, necessary for a family to have certain status or appear they do, mos often than not, they were underpaid because room and board was included in a working arrangement, which brings me to my furious point of contention here. Mexicans of certain status that can afford to keep a small staff were and maybe still are slave owners, period. The help will get Sunday off but coming back from your day ""off"" they will find a filthy kitchen and disarray all over the house. So, what is the point of the movie? I lost you Alfonso, I lost you. Was he trying to show this abuse? or was he trying to show a time photo about a mediocre middle class family? I did not get it, and that is fine."

ROMA,28 February 2019,4/10,Overrated....The photography is impressive but the content is very poor. So many latin american movies did far better.
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"Many reviewers have commented on the realism and slice of life perspective Roma gives, but it also has a touch of mysticism or magical realism. Cleo is like a superhero for the family's children. The television performer in the TV show within the movie, who also reappears when Cleo searches for Fermin, named Professor Zovek, claims to have powers. He closes his eye, raises his arms toward the sky and clasps his hands together, and bends one leg so that one of his feet is placed alongside the other leg's knee. Although the crowd laugh at his supposed power, they try to perform the minor feat and fail--only Cleo is able to do it. When Professor Zovek hears the crowd's laughter, he asks, ""What did you expect, for me to lift a jet?"" A moment earlier, in fact, when he was performing his stunt, a large jet is seen and heard flying directly over his head, very intentionally in the shot. At several points in the movie, a jet can be seen flying over Cleo's head, particularly in the final sequence when she walks up the staircase to the roof of the house. Furthermore, Cleo's inner self has the ability to affect the real world, in good and bad ways. Major events like the fire and the earth quake erupt out of the events that are happening to Cleo as she journeys through the realization that she has become pregnant with a child whose father doesn't want any part of it. However, her ""powers"" also extend to the good, as she is able to save two children from drowning, despite not being able to swim, near the end of the movie.Roma is not nearly a slice of life, but Cuaron's directing makes the camera shots very obvious because of their beauty, and his directing and writing of the movie's plot puts Cleo in a role above everyone else. She is so important that her inner life affects the outer world, often for the better."
ROMA,15 February 2019,3/10,"Beautiful beautiful film. No deying that the cinematography is right up there among the best.However, people saying that there's something beautiful in this depiction of a 'normal' life are seriously deluded as to what actually makes a great movie. Nothing happens in this movie! Nothing! It felt like I was watching a mash-up of beautiful still images and camera panning shots. Like re-watching The Revenant, but only watching the scenery shots.I wasn't entertained (and I don't necessarily mean in a laughing manner) at any point during this film, and I would never recommend anyone watch it.On a final note, as we've seen a lot of this lately in Hollywood, it's no surprise that this movie also is men-hating-porn for your average feminazi as well as single moms and dried up +40 year old housemoms. Just notice how every single important male character is depicted.The only scene which really caught me was the final one, because the lead actress finally beautifully broke her Kristen Stewart-stoneface.This is just porn for your feelings. Get over it, and realize it should never have been nominated for anything other than Best Cinematography, and maybe Best Director."
ROMA,16 February 2019,3/10,"I went to the theater expecting to be wowed--instead I was shocked at how critics have missed the problems with this film. There are some intelligent hints of a brilliant film in the opening shots---but the film contains serious anachronistic errors (in costuming, in when training in martial arts became a public phenomena, etc), but most importantly, just basic human reactions to difficult situations into which the characters have been inserted.
I would not expect some younger or foreign viewers to catch some of the anachronistic points---but long before a film is edited together and marketed to the public someone in production should have caught these items and fixed the story line----the worst being the birth scene (since when does a woman who is crowning not scream her guts out? What kind of medical team would be more worried about whether they have their scrubs on than getting the patient medicated---or noting that the baby is coming to fast to do that?) and the ocean scene.
And we learn nothing from this film---yes, so apparently in Mexico we are to believe that an upper-class family loves their servant like a member of the family---but the basic theme is that men are jerks. Nothing new there.An okay film, with great photography, if paired against low-budget foreign films--but not worthy of any prizes except photography."
ROMA,11 January 2019,1/10,"This was the most monumental waste of my time ever.
There s not even any meaning to this film, it is completely pointless.
If you have a maid, just film her daily life with a handycam for a few days and you will have made a more interesting film than the film-maker.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."

ROMA,10 October 2019,8/10,"Please don't be put off with all the reviews that say this film is boring! At least 3 major things happen, one of the events on their own would normally make a fabulous movie. Yes it's beautiful and poetic, I think that it's perfect in black and white, gorgeous! But it also packs a punch with the things that happen to the wonderfully rounded characters. It's a strong woman's story, so I guess if you find that boring, look elsewhere."
ROMA,12 January 2019,5/10,The movie is overrated its The 1st hour was boring I was looking forward to watch the movie I'm so disappointed
ROMA,25 February 2019,1/10,A 2 hour movie of a white wall of paint drying would be a cinematic masterpiece compared to this film.
ROMA,8 December 2018,6/10,"If you're overly artistic, this movie is for you. But if being overly artistic isn't entertaining for you, skip this film. The plot is nothing special. It literally is about a very small portion of a woman's life... and nothing interesting if happening. The plot is mediocre and it's more about the direction/editing/long uncut scenes. Didn't keep me entertained. 100% a critic/movie snob movie. If you're the type to watch movies once in a blue moon, skip this one."
ROMA,10 December 2018,4/10,"The movie wasn't ""bad""; I just didn't find it entertaining and feel it is highly overrated.
I am pretty open to enjoying different genres- although i tend to avoid horror and hyper action.
Roma is really short in any forms of basic entertainment. This is how Roma checks some important boxes:
Good dialogue: none, zero
Mystery: none
Educational: no
Humor: none
Interesting characters: no
Twists: none, very typical stereotypes.
Emotions: Some- the one real emotion Roma brought out was sadness; but in the most simple and predictable way.I did find the main character likeable, but that's not enough to carry a movie. It seemed more like a dry documentary than a commercial movie. Can't recommend:("
ROMA,30 January 2019,10/10,Love this movie! The observation & detail of each scene are just amazing. Highly recommend it.
ROMA,25 May 2019,7/10,"First of all I have to say Roma is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. Every shot looks like it was well thought out. There was an obvious theme of water throughout and every shot emphasizing water was oddly satisfying to the eye.The acting was great. The actress portraying Cleo was especially impressive. Specifically with her facial acting.However I will say Roma misses out on much emotional punch. There is little music which I feel could have greatly improved the emotion of the film.In addition the film has a lack luster story. I understand that the film is putting the audience in the point of view of a 1970s maid in Mexico during the political turmoil occurring at the time, which was effective. It really opens your eyes to how much Cleo did for this family, and how much her help went unnoticed by others. The end was satisfying because after saving the two kids, she had in a way restored herself after losing her child. In addition, she recieved well deserved praise from the family. But back to the lacking aspect, the story did not have enough excitement for me. We simply followed the semi-interesting life of this maid. I need more.Overall Roma was a true beauty of a film. The camera work and images were top notch. A quality addition to foreign language film."
ROMA,29 December 2018,1/10,"I seriously can't understand all these great reviews about this terrible, terrible movie, I am honestly thinking that people got paid to write them.I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. Just a long and boring drama about what could be a regular person life.My advice: don't waste your time like I did, I am even writing this review for you."
ROMA,10 February 2019,8/10,The story centers on the maid of a middle class family and their everyday life over the span of one year. It is very interesting to see the characters seemingly unperturbed by things that would be relatively shocking to other cultures. A great look into 1970 Mexico City.The film can feel a bit slow at times with creeping panoramic shots and no dialogue. I didn't see the need for it to be in black and white. I had to constantly remind myself that it was set in 1970-71.
ROMA,17 September 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuarón might be my favourite living director, jesus that was brilliant. Where to begin with this masterpiece...Well - to start - 'Roma' is one of the most beautiful films of the decade, every shot is masterfully executed, blocked, framed, and detailed. Cuarón himself was the cinematographer in this project, and he did a phenomenal job. You can't help but have your jaw on the floor the entire runtime. Right from the opening shot I knew I was in for something masterful. Cuarón's signature long takes were ever prevelant here, and each was as masterful as the last. Sometimes he lingers on a subject beautifully to exentuate a point, or makes a small adjustment to a shot - giving it a completely different meaning. The symmetry and pure brilliance of every single scene sends chills down your spine. I won't spoil it, but there's a particular shot near the middle of the film involving a man singing, where Caurón plays with the contrast between background and foreground so powerfully it got even got a few tears rolling.Cuarón's visual motifs find their way across the film, tying the somewhat loose plot into a resounding and heart wrenching force. Again - no spoilers - but he uses planes, water, cars, dogs, and themes of birth and death to represent metaphorically or sometimes literally how characters feel and how their relationships to eachother are. The lead performance from Yalitza Aparicio was great, especially considering this is the first film she's ever acted in. Hats off to the casting director for plucking her out of obscurity and having her end up delivering such a resounding performance. I really hope this movie will jump start a career for her.This film is a grandmaster at the top of his game, and is breathtaking perfection from start to finish. Alfonso Cuarón returns to his Spanish roots for a passion project he's been talking about since 2006. He excercises almost total creative control by wearing a lot of hats on the production. He directed, co-produced, wrote, edited, and photographed this film. A complete 180 from his last three studio works (although some of them are masterpieces), ROMA exercises more storytelling prowess than them, and no one will be calling this film 'style over substance' no matter how beautiful it is. 'Roma' is another Cuarón masterpiece, and I'm happy that it will be seen to a vastly larger audience because of the Netflix distribution. However, that is also a double edged sword - because this is a film that is best seen on the big screen, but I'm still pleased more people will be exposed to this masterclass in filmmaking. I urge you to watch this the second you have the chance, because Cuarón has made one of the best films of the decade."
ROMA,19 January 2019,1/10,"How this won anything is beyond me. How others rate it so high is also beyond me. I swear it is a solid 6 minutes before the opening credits end and the camera finally moves. After that, its just a whole lot of nothing. No romance, no drama, no comedy, no tension, like seriously, NOTHING. Even the acting is suspect, but that's mostly because the script and directing is so poor."

ROMA,8 January 2019,8/10,"""I just watched this film and I didn't really like it that much as everyone else does. But I have no idea why I don't.""This film creates exceptional reality with the details of the characters, and how they traverse with each other in their day-to-day lives. The way that the characters related to one another, and spoke with each other was just as if we went away for a short time into our cinemas or screens, to view a family 50 years ago go about their lives. It was an amazing film to experience as an aspiring filmmaker, but because of all that realism, I felt it left something crucially important out.Watching this film was like going out on a date with an attractive girl/guy who had all the great features they can have, but there was no real personal connection with me. They just sat there on the date in front of me, telling me about their lives and what they did, instead of having any real relation with them about what they do or have done.The reason that I think most people dislike this film (for the odd reasons they state) is that there was no film to audience connection, or in other terms, that it was passive. Yes of course there was continual heart warming emotion displayed throughout all areas of the scenes, but some of the scenes conveyed too much realism (yes too much) to not even address the audience watching the film. And no, if you are thinking that the film should have been more active with the viewer, with on-the-nose dialogue, or voice-overs towards the audience, no. I just wanted a reason to keep watching, that's what connection is within a film. Yes the acting, cinematography, editing, etc was all superb, but there was no real reason I wanted to play along with the film.I felt that it was as if the film was so well executed it won the hearts of many cinema lovers, and filmmakers, but it did not cater for the audience of the world who aren't into the minor details of cinema. A good story is something that the audience should be apart of from the opening scene, to the ending shot- as to be honest, I sadly didn't feel within this film, like the quote stated above.It spent too much time looking good for the people, instead of really delving into the hearts of the audiences, which is what I personally love out of a good film. As a filmmaker however, I can definitely say I will be watching this again and again due to its immaculate execution of filmography and craft.Thank you Alfonso Cuarón.8/10

ROMA,15 December 2018,1/10,"The worst movie in 2018
.................................................................................."
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This is one of the if not the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. The sound is perfect, the colour is perfect, the pacing is perfect, the performances are perfect. I had my jaw wide open at certain scenes just unable to take in the beauty. Juggles between surrealism and neo realism seamlessly with endless dreamy symbolism shook up by the harsh realities of 1970 Mexico. I think for the camera work alone this one will be discussed academically in film studies for years to come.
Will be going to see a second screening of this for sure!"
ROMA,8 February 2019,1/10,"Much ado about nothing. I don't like the movie. If it wasn't from Mexico, it didn't worth anything."
ROMA,16 December 2018,10/10,"Alfonso Cuaron out did himself with this precious gem, from the beautiful shots, environment, and the detail added to specific scenes. A movie that will stay as the best of the 21st century and become a classic in the future."
ROMA,16 December 2018,9/10,"First off, if you pause the movie at any mintue it is a work of art. Camera work is amazing, most beautiful movie of the year. The story is a little slow at the beginning but it catches up later. It is the most complete movie of the year, and if it does not win at least an oscar definitely someone has something against Cuaron.
The story has every thing it needs, it has an emotional appeal, at different moments, tension rises. Just all in all wonderful"
ROMA,12 January 2019,4/10,Totally beyond me how this won awards. Very indulgent tosh.
ROMA,2 January 2019,1/10,"There are better movies on netflix like zombeavers and sharknado 6. do not waste your time watching such a boring, failed pseudo art experiment."
ROMA,27 February 2019,1/10,"I watched this because of all the Oscar hype. I found it extremely boring, parts unconnected, and of no redeeming value. It's about a maid who gets knocked up by a rotten guy. She works for a doctor who ends up leaving his wife... and has a dog that craps in the carport. There are scenes that make no sense. Perhaps this is a stinker because it's in Spanish with English subtitles... the problem with that is that the viewer has no idea who is saying what. In short... if I never see this movie again it'll be too soon."
ROMA,2 February 2019,3/10,"Some beautiful and well planned shots but no story at all, really boring."
ROMA,14 September 2018,1/10,"Cuaròn's latest film, ""Roma,"" borrows its title from the upper class Mexico City neighborhood where the director grew up. The film is an ode to Libo, Cuaròn's indigenous nanny, whose fictional name is Cleo (interpreted by the excellent Yalitza Aparicio). Cuaròn specifically dedicated the film to Libo while accepting the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. In the same speech, he professed his love for his country as well.""Roma"" tells the story of the relationship between Cleo and Sofia, the family's matriarch, as they witness the social changes that affect Mexico as a whole and, subsequently, their relationship as well - since the latter is permanently stained with an unsolved (and unsolvable) heavy socioeconomic and class division. Meanwhile, news of a terrifying clash between students and a paramilitary group spread around the city (the 1971 clash ended up killing 120 people). Cuarón said in an interview that this violent act ""scarred Mexican society permanently, and transformed Mexicans as individuals.""I disliked this film, for both filmic and moral reasons. I found its aesthetics too unfit for a story about the suffering of Mexicans. Cuarón puts too much emphasis on the beauty of its craft, and such embellishment clashes with the ugliness of this historical moment in Mexican history. I have a huge problem with the film's jarringly clean aesthetics, which mirror Cuarón's endless quest for visual perfection (he also shot this film), despite the fact that the subject matter of this film isn't so glossy. Aesthetics is a language. Cuarón speaks the sophisticated language of Hollywood (courtesy of Netflix and the $100M budget) to tell the story of the people of Mexico who have been left behind. To me, the dissonance is unbearable. Last but not least, the visual approach is nothing new - despite the desaturated, B/W look.Then there are the moral issues. In Mexico, there are 3 million domestic workers who aren't legally registered, without any access to welfare. They are basically slaves. Needless to say, the overwhelming majority of them are indigenous. This is a class and race issue. Cuarón loves Libo. He loves his indigenous maid. But Libo continues to live her life and an underprivileged woman in Mexico, while the director lives in Hollywood. Cuarón has not spent a single word denouncing such social disparity in Mexico. He hasn't done it in a single interview. Why? Doesn't he care about the condition of indigenous maids who are basically enslaved by the rich? Perhaps he just cares about his Libo, and that's it? Love without restitution is an empty word. Personally, I am tired of empty films made by empty directors. I may be the minority here, but I really disliked ""Roma.""Thanks for reading."
ROMA,16 January 2021,,Beautiful film with real life elements that makes one feel nostalgia for an older period of time or just their childhood. Everything was especially incredible to look at. This film is for ones who would actually enjoy a slow paced story that doesn't have a big incident or happening to drive it forward. It's a slice of life movie that just feels heartwarming and lovely to watch and the beautiful cinematography makes me feel like I'm actually there with them.
ROMA,12 January 2019,8/10,"Don't expect action in this movie, there's no shoot outs or car chases and if you want to be 'entertained' watch the Hollywood blockbusters. What you will get is cinematic gold from one of the best. The storyline is simplistic but the characters are played out brilliantly. I couldn't believe how long it was and yet I was totally immersed in the cinematography and the attention to detail was sublime. Even the opening scene showing the maid doing a menial task of washing the dog poo off the tiles you see the shadow of a plane flying overhead depicting another world outside her world. I also liked the little love heart in the liquid from the spilled cup on the floor. The backdrop is the 70's and the socio political divide of the time and place, but ultimately its a film rich in humanist emotions and experiences. I loved it."
ROMA,27 January 2019,4/10,I really tried...Loved the camera. Great cast...But the movie was really boring...Not telling any significant story whatsoever...
ROMA,14 April 2019,10/10,"This is my first review on here. This movie was beautiful. Yes, there wasn't a crazy story. But it was still a good movie with an amazing cinematography.The scene were Cleo is the only standing in balance was one of the most stunning scenes I've seen."
ROMA,21 July 2019,9/10,"At first, to agree the many other comments prior to this: the film needs quite an effort to get used to the very long lasting shots and slowly developing story. But once gotten into it, it offers a wonderful insight to life.For life is not all action, one unique and memorable event to the next with nothing in-between. Such as many other films make the illusions. Instead it's all about the big problems, and, more often than not, the smalls. There are many unexpected burdens everyone gets to bear on his shoulders. Yet, most of them aren't much bigger than the making of food for the kids and looking for them not to run too far away on the way to the cinema.But there is another message as well. There is really just a small number of people that really care for you, if there even are some. Most obstacles have to be faced and passed alone. There is no big fame and admiration that comes for the many countless helpers in the world that do not just make the meal for your kids, but might even save them from drowning in the sea.In the end, the film gave me the impression to life that life doesn't always have to be big with excitement making you feel as high as mountains, and pain as deeply cutting as seas. It's most often just the simple being at some place, and working at some place, and being with others at some other place, that makes life life. It's the ordinary every day routines that belong to life as much as the biggest emotions and most memorable experiences.It's really a film that does not entertain but needs you to open up your mind and see the beauty in the simple things of life."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"I have been working my way through a large number of well regarded films dating from the late 1930's to today and this is the most banal movie imaginable. Virtually no plot, interminable slow boring cinematography, characters of little inherent interest and no growth throughout the picture. The critics have either been self-deluded enough to jump on a bandwagon or I suspect want to pick a Mexicain movie, any Mexican movie, to be Oscar material to thumb a nose at Trump. Do not waste your precious two hours watching this."
ROMA,23 January 2019,1/10,"Absolutely one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. I don't even see great acting whatsoever.... and then...it abruptly ends...Yawnnn, what a waste if time."
ROMA,9 March 2019,,"First i was excited to watch the movie since it won an oscar but i was disappointed and bored it was almost like i was forcing myself to continue watching it, the camera work was good but i couldn't find a storyline. In conclusion: i just waste my time."
ROMA,17 February 2019,8/10,"Slow? Oh yes ...like good wine...take it slow and enjoy. The lead actress is perfect. Storyline is sad yet uplifting, slow yet interesting, crazy yet realistic, it is thoughtful and paints a portrait of a woman's inner strength unparalleled by anything you will see on the silver screen. Quiet moving yet deeply touching. I liked this film...but alot of people may find it hard going....watch it like you are watching you mother's past life unfold....and then you will love Cleo and what she stands for..great film."
ROMA,13 March 2019,8/10,"They says you love once in your whole life. Being captured by ROMA just happens once too, it was that last scene at the beach that catched me this way, it just happend once in the 2 hours of the film but enough to remember this movie forever. Congrats Cuaron!"
ROMA,15 December 2018,10/10,"From Academy-Award winner Alfonso Cuarón, director of ""Gravity"" & ""Children of Men"", with his newest picture, ""Roma"" he draws inspiration from very personal regions of his own childhood. Set in Mexico City, 1970 (and parts of '71), predominately in the neighbourhood of Colonia Roma - of which the film is titled. The civil unrest and class warfare of time are seen through the eyes of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), the gentle maid of Sofía (Marina de Tavira) and her family. Upon falling pregnant, the naïve Cleo must navigate her way through the trials and tribulations that not only befall her, but the evolving city of Mexico around her.With Alfonso Cuarón in more than just the directors seat, he also produces, writes, edits and - perhaps most impressively - cinematographs this piece of film. From a technical aspect, ""Roma"" is without a doubt a masterpiece. Shot in gorgeous black and white, and comprised of many dazzling long shots that capture even the smallest of details, adding to the intimacy; as well as serving as Cuarón's notable artistic signature: combining long shots and skilfully-choreographed long takes, to maximum effect - whether it be humorous or poignant.Thematically-deep, perhaps ""Roma's"" most notable theme is that of the place - or more so the perseverance - of women under the thumb of a patriarchal society. Cleo, our protagonist, is the heart of this film; she lives a relatively modest existence, vacillating from her duties to Sofía, and occasionally frequenting a short-term boyfriend; but the obstacles that face her - as well as Sofía - are testament to the endurance and strength of women - with Cuarón clearly modelling these characters with some thought of the woman in his life in mind.Upon the films ending, this specific audience member was left in a stunned silence; hypnotised and truly moved by what I had just watched. ""Roma"" is a film so narratively-rich and deeply heartfelt, conjured from such a personal place in the directors own life. Cuarón can add this to his ever-growing list of masterpieces: ""Children of Men"", ""Gravity"" and now: ""Roma""."
ROMA,8 December 2018,10/10,"Roma is the latest movie of a Mexican filming director, and Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón.
Through this amazing piece of art, Cuarón opened his memories and releases a package of a pure personal and family intimacy.all of this wrapped with tenderness and warm moments, but at the same time with a raw reality that spread on the screen the cruelty of the broken human condition that belongs to all of us.
In the midst of the daily battles that we all fight, and through the lenses of a normal mid class family in the Roma neighborhood in Mexico City, Cuarón depicts the surroundings of everyone's life in the 70ths, with all the dynamics of people's lives, coming and going in the everydayness of our broken and fullness humanity, describing the relationships that represents to belong. The normal and little details are presented with a masterful hand through the lenses both technically and emotional of Cuarón's eyes...
There is not a typical villain or a stereotypical hero that we can hate or inspire us from a Hollywood movie type. There is no cultural holocaust to wipe out the views of others, instead we all are there...and from the normality of everyone, a simple and humble character emerge to slap all our pride, racial, cultural, economical bias and divisions. This character's powerful and tender personality is presented in the midst of a social and political turmoil to let us know that a simple act of presence and care could be the difference between life and death. That's the power of this movie, it makes us reflect and feel deep inside of us our humanity with outstanding normality, humbleness and emotion, the kind of movie that you'll never forget"
ROMA,9 December 2018,1/10,"Pretentious, self indulgent and lacking in substance. I carried the burden and high expectations of 3 friends during this glorified home movie. No doubt we'll have movie elitists desperately evangelizeing this film to non believers and blaming our immature cinefile pallet. Call me old fashioned but I'd prefer substance over form and maybe some level of storey telling.
The film is simply a year in the life of an upperclassman family and a Cleo there long time servant played out with an historical violent uprising set in the background. There is no social commentary made with regard to the Cleo's poverty stricken family or the power disparity between her and the employer.If you need to wax on about the graceful pace, cinematography and obscure metaphors without mentioning a story then you know you've got problems. This guy certainly knows how to make a movie, what he doesn't know is how to make it interesting.
If your desperate to escape the ubiquitous marvel movies like I was, sadly this movie is not an option. This is a movie equivalent of ""Slow TV"" on Valium. I would seriously choose to watch a 24hr train journey then endure this overhyped movie. It certainly demonstrates how Netflix doesn't care about quality of content just more content and no doubt they are chasing awards for a film that will be inaccessible for 99% of the viewing public and watched by only a few."
ROMA,9 December 2018,10/10,"Yes, I've spent childhood on 70's Mexico CityYes, I lived in a middle class 'hood just couple of km's (miles) east of ""Colonia Roma""Yes, my father used to drive large car (a 67 Impala) that barely fit on the ""patio"".Yes, he used to ""honk"" when coming home at night expecting someone to open, hold and close the gate while parking the car.Yes, I had a ""Mixteco"" speaker nanny that became very much part of family for 20 years, that got pregnant from her boyfriend, lost first newborn girl but was able to raise a second girl.Yes, afilador (bycicle guy that sharps knifes) and ""camotes"" car walked on the streets making it's own particular whistles.Yes, all the mornings we listened the radio station which only purpose was to provide ""exact hour"" minute by minute, stuffed in between with quick commercial jungles, just to rush with enough time to make at school early.and so on and on and on.....So yes I got deeply touched by this movie and I don't expect any person that did not lived all the above to feel this much emotionally engaged by this movie.But doing it in such and artistically manner, with the level of detail and the level of acting that Cuaron and his crew makes this a great feel. This is a beautiful movie even if you don't have the background to fully appreciate this masterpiece."
ROMA,24 February 2019,10/10,"Represents the spirit of cdmx greatly. Although there being plenty of controvercy, I very much welcome netflix efforts to give producers/directors these kind of opportunities to produce high budget arthouse cinema. Wish there would be more like this. Picture is beautiful and the story truely touched me."
ROMA,17 December 2018,6/10,Clearly a masterpiece but it has left me and my pregnant wife traumatized. There are certain people who SHOULD NOT watch this film. This film should COME WITH A DISCLAIMER
ROMA,17 December 2018,9/10,"I'll confesss, I was hyped for this movie and watched with all the intention to love it. Turns out, that wasn't required.The first thing I noticed and the thing I loved the most about Roma, is the way it's shot. Any other director would have preferred a more vintage black and white look. But Alfonso Cuarón decided to go with a 65 mm lens, giving the movie a pristine, non-grainy look, like a modern day memory of a past. The soft contrast and the bright highlights look beautiful. The fixed camera and slow pans are add to the aesthetics of the beautiful imagery. The framing and composition are meticulous. It is a beautiful looking movie.Next up, the characters. The central character is the maid, Chleo played by first time actress Yalitza Aparicio. She's awesome. She is a silent character. Not that she's mute or that she talks rarely, it's just when you look at her in her maid clothes, doing away the dishes, she'll strike you as a sweet and silent person. I really cared about her character, I was invested. I was scared when she was scared, happy when she was happy and sad when she was sad. That's the movie's biggest achievement in my opinion. The other characters are nicely fleshed out as well, especially the mother's character. The child actors were surprisingly good, too.The story of Roma is a deeply emotional and personal one. But not everyone can relate to it. As of me, I could relate to it and I loved each moment of it.Bottom line, Roma is a visual masterpiece. The plot isn't something groundbreaking, but the presentation more than makes up for it. Don't miss it."
ROMA,17 December 2018,10/10,"I don't have much to add, other reviewers did a better job, but this movie was fantastic, even better the second time.If you have a Netflix account it's a no brainier, just sit back and enjoy a masterpiece."
ROMA,10 February 2019,1/10,The cinematography is not bad but the lack of story and everything else makes it a dull and flat movie easy to forget. Personally a waist of my time.
ROMA,18 December 2018,6/10,Very boring from the first till the last minute. Don't even give it a try. The only thing that is interesting are other reviews with 9s and 10s. Like Emperor's new clothes.
ROMA,20 December 2018,9/10,"Have to admit this is just my type of storytelling. this film reminds me of another Japanese directer Hirokazu Koreeda.It tells a story in the eye of a maid in a Roma family. Nothing fancy about the shooting technique, and barely has spectacular scene. But just with this almost documentary way, we got to see the huge gap between classes(the maid Cleo and the family she's serving for ). And the obscure connection between them, as humans. For Cleo and her mistress, it's the sympathetic feeling they shared. It's the rare and incredible thing done in this film, to tell the emotion that is so sophisticated to show on screen."
ROMA,22 December 2018,1/10,"I really wanted to like this movie. I love movies from this genre, and I loved past films from this director. But this is really just an overrated vanity project. It is slow, pointless, and worse, morally repugnant. Apparently Cuaron thinks it is A-OK for a family to virtually enslave indigenous people so long as they take them to the doctor and the beach. When I wasn't bored I was disgusted. Please do not support this type of self-indulgent trash - the critics Netflix obviously bought and paid for to promote this garbage should be ashamed of themselves."
ROMA,23 December 2018,2/10,"Aesthetically beautiful and captures the era of 1971 perfectly. I found myself however just staring at the screen with not much of a thread to pull me along. If the story resembles one of two women struggling against oppressive males then fine, but on that alone it is a weak endeavor. I must say there are some impressive technical elements of longshots that for production value are worth noting."
ROMA,23 December 2018,1/10,"OMG this movie is pornographic filth. My elderly mother burst into tears and scolded me for dirtying her mind, her home and her television with it. If a man were to do to you on the subway what this movie does to you in your home, he would be in jail and rightfully so. My mother says she feels like she has been sexually assaulted and I understand why. There is no need to inflict this kind of degrading filth on people - the film makers, actors and Netflix execs who approved this should all be charged with sex crimes. We thought we were watching a nostalgic ""love letter from the film maker to the women who raised him"" and were instead visually sexually assaulted in our own home."
ROMA,28 December 2018,1/10,"This really was a terrible terrible movie!! Do Not watch it. It's just waste of time. Forget about the awards, there's absoloutely nothing in this movie. I still can not understand why this movie got so many awards & complements! :-/even 1star is to much for it."
ROMA,30 December 2018,6/10,"...and that's it. A visually stunning film but with a flat, meandering, plot. The movie was 2+ hours long and I was still emotionally disconnected. That's a problem. When all four people watching the movie with me were checking their phones during the movie it's safe to say it is boring. Perhaps it should have picked one story line and stuck with it."
ROMA,30 December 2018,3/10,"Lo único salvable es la fotografía. Es larga con muy mala actuación y sin historia.
Se rescata la vida que había en los años 70 en México y te pone en esa época con gran facilidad. Creo que solo los que vivimos besa época podríamos entender esa parte que el director busca plasmar.
No tiene una historia que pueda uno seguir y tampoco pude entender algún mensaje que pudiera destacarse."
ROMA,31 December 2018,2/10,"There was nothing interesting about this movie. The actors did what they could with a boring script I guess. I cant blame them. The story was very slow paced and uninteresting. I started to think someone was getting paid to write all those positive reviews for a movie that doesnt live up to just about all of them. Just when you think some drama might happen to draw you into the film, you find yourself disappointed and feeling deceived, especially when you see all the rewards thrown at this film. Save 2 hours of your life...Try another film. ""The Invisible Guest"" is a great example of a drama with everything you could want in a drama! Not this film."
ROMA,12 January 2019,1/10,A godawful film. Such a waste of time. A stream of consciousness drudge work that only the indie/artsy crowd might love. It has some redeeming value for the cinematography but at it's best this is so boring that there is no wonder it didn't make the big screen....people would have been walking out and demanding their money back. Pathetic and pointless.
ROMA,23 January 2019,2/10,That's 2 hours I'll never get back. Overrated and boring. Makes me not want to watch any Netflix originals. Wish it was in color so I could have enjoyed the cars which were the best part of this otherwise bleak and boring slice of life.
ROMA,2 January 2019,1/10,"We read a number of reviews and heard the hype and settled back to watch this almost perfectly crafted piece of artistic cinema.One review said the first hour was a little slow, but viewers were being 'Marinated' so the impact of later events would be greater. Actually it was more like, the first hour was so incredibly dull that any sort of character interaction or plot would be welcome. If you were to flip back and forth between this movie and the Aquarium Channel you hit the same levels of excitement.We found the characters were almost completely undeveloped, Cleo was wooden and somewhat morose except for a couple of short sequences in the movie. You never really got any sort of connection with her, or any other character in the movie. The plot was a number of disjointed and mostly unconnected vignettes.I must say the endless shots of piles of dog poo were very artfully done. I understand that there was social commentary in there, and metaphor, but without a semblance of plot or any sort of character development this movie is nothing but a pretentious waste of time.This could have been a very good movie if Cleo had shown some sort of character that you could get attached to."
ROMA,4 January 2019,1/10,"I am not the kind of adventure movie fan, but this movie is just to much of 'nothing going on'. Maybe I am not among the targeted audience, but the movie is really about nothing. Life experiences highlighted are so overused...never mind saying that the main character says 10 phrases in 2 hours..."
ROMA,5 January 2019,1/10,"... for dullest movie of the year! Utter dross and artistic wankery. Cinematography aside, this movie is incredibly slow and boring. If you watch movies to be entertained you will be sorely disappointed, however if you watch movies as an alternative to going to a museum then you might like this. There is very little depth to the characters and the storyline is almost non-existent. It reminded me a little of the great Italian films off of the 50s & 60s such as the Bicycle Thieves except that those movies had a storyline and kept me captivated throughout. Complete tosh."
ROMA,5 January 2019,9/10,I saw this film and was compelled to join IMDb and write my very first review. So let's get into it. My only issue was that the film had subtitles. This is a personal opinion of mine. I always find it more difficult to connect with the characters and engage with the story at full potential during movies with subtitles. And I found myself a few times looking at my cellphone during the film as a result of this. If you don't mind subtitles then you won't have this same issue. If you do mind subtitles then I highly recommend you give it your all to finish the movie till the very end and give it your focus. It's an amazingly beautiful film. I was blown away by the cinematography. Genius. Masterpiece. Jaw dropping beauty. Women endure so much and for me at least this film highlights their strength dignity love compassion brilliance and at the same time places a spotlight on their flaws and their fears. It's a slow movie but it builds up to a shocking climax where even though you want to look away you simply can't because you don't even want to blink an eye as to not miss even one moment of this artwork.
ROMA,6 January 2019,1/10,"If you want to know what this film is about all you have to do is watch the opening credits. Repititon of the same shot...
I felt no sympathy or empathy for any of the characters in this film, oh except for that poor dog. Cooped up all day in the yard, crapping and pee-ing and barking.
Art Direction and Cinematography alone do not make a great movie, they only enhance ""The Storyline"" of which you can easily some in one sentence - Maid gets pregnant in 1970's Mexico. Upstairs Downstairs it was most definitely NOT!"
ROMA,7 January 2019,1/10,"This just won the golden globe for best picture -and best foreign film- do we thought we'd watch it. My husband lasted 15 minutes but my son and I stayed longer on Netflix to watch, with high hopes for a story. There was none.
Yes, it had great cinematography and ft ""artsy "" but that doesn't make it a movie.
It was Boring and over-rated...
I love artsy movies and ones with a good story line but it's just not in this one...
Now I just hope it doesn't win oscar best picture-"
ROMA,14 February 2019,4/10,Amazing cinematic movie but the story line is boring
ROMA,18 April 2019,3/10,"I didn't enjoy the film, finding it slow, tedious, lacking engagement, with my only genuine concern being for the poor dog that never gets walked.
The user reviews largely reflect my view scoring between 1 and 5. This makes the headline review rating of 7.8 out of ten somewhat baffling?"
ROMA,27 January 2019,7/10,"I decided to do a movie of Roma for a couple of reasons. It's not widely-released in movie theaters in the US and it will not be apart of the AMC Theaters Best Picture Showcase (#AMCBPS) despite being one of the eight nominated films for Best Picture. Why? From what I read, in short, the movie rights were not released to American theaters only to Netflix.Colonia Roma is a neighborhood in Mexico City set in 1970 and 1971. It is not the name of the leading actress like I thought. This movie is said to be 90 percent of scenes from Director Cuaron's childhood memories based upon a nanny he adored named Libo (hence, the tribute during the credits). The story is mainly about a nanny, Cleo, who struggles with her life once she becomes pregnant and abandoned by the baby's father. While at the same time, she nurtures four children of a mom (Sofia) that also becomes abandoned by her husband. I won't write much about this storyline to avoid spoilers.However, here are several random notes to give you some perspective. The entire movie is told via English subtitles so don't look away; you need to be focused. The riot in the movie is known as the Corpus Christie Massacre. There's one male nude scene. There's a very graphic scene involving Cleo's baby at birth that is a little disturbing; so brace yourself. Cleo and Sofia share a knowing look of despair without words when a wedding is taking place next to them while they eat ice cream with the children. It's obvious the pain the two women are feeling as they both struggle putting their life back on track after their devastating heartbreaks. I found it odd that the children got painful sunburn during their beach visit but the mom didn't have any sunscreen. Interesting that huffing in the 70's is equivalent to juuling now. How many dead animals can one person have in one house? Oh my! Taxidermy overload. Also noteworthy was how families back in the day had one television and everyone sat together and watched the same TV shows. The scene I adored the most was when Cleo laid head-to-head with PePe (the youngest child) while he was mad at his brother who just hurt his feelings. This scene showed you how passionate and aware Cleo was about those children. Cuaron filmed this movie in Mexico City, which resulted in several misdated appearances regarding the airplanes and automobiles seen. Finally, the ending took me by surprise as I thought there was going to be another scene to wrap up the story, but it wasn't. Let me know if you felt the same way.You will likely enjoy this movie despite the subtitles. The problems women experienced in the 70s is the same today but now more women are smarter, stronger and better equipped as Female Masterpieces to survive life's roadblocks and setbacks. Catch it on Netflix before the Oscars air on February 24."
ROMA,9 January 2019,2/10,"It took me four attempts at watching this flick. After the Golden Globes awarded Roma best foreign film and director I decided to finally grind through the finale.
I still can't explain the theme of the story other than various events in the daily life of Cleo.
If this is the best foreign film for 2018, I'll not likely watch any of the other contenders!!"
ROMA,9 January 2019,1/10,"I got interested to watch it by discovering its high rank in IMDB and some other review lists. after watching, have to say its the most boring movie I've ever seen. 70% of the time you will see housewives are serving children and their parents as you can expect before. no up and down! no movie soundtrack and you will see the main character of the film is doing what she got as an order! so boring ended with boring end! It's first time that I felt I wasted whole my time watching a movie! hope no one deceived its rating score again!"
ROMA,9 January 2019,4/10,"I was listening to a radio reviewer giving such high praise on this netflix movie that when I came home from work, my partner and myself had to watch it. I have often said that if a movie does not capture you in the first fifteen minutes, then you will have problems. I have seem many good movies that all have this in common. Some movies have captivated me in the first two and a half minutes such is the magnificent direction. So what of Mona then.The high definitition black and white cinematography is beautiful and so are the choice of actors. But both of us found the movie to be very dull and slow moving. Often I had to hit the fast forward button. For folks to give this a 10/10 reminds me of a few professional press reviewers who may give a movie 5/10 only for me to thoroughly enjoy it. Sometimes viewers just do not see things the same way and that is part of life.One of the redeeming features of this film was the birth scene using a rubbery figure which totally gave away what was to occur. My partner enjoyed the masterful stick display by Fermin. So many long sticks she said to me.Unfortunately this film was a long and drawn out process that failed to engage us both and had very little to no entertainment value. Masterful photography and an arduos storyline unfortunately do not make a great movie."
ROMA,19 January 2019,10/10,"The plot is very interesting because is constructed on a strong narrative base, there are points of Climax and very dramatic moments. The end is a lot sweet, could be nore interesting with a break in the plot, like the Ghosts of The Others."
ROMA,15 January 2019,1/10,"If you liked Solaris (I endured the original -- I imagine that the remake was equally, uhm, ""artistic""), you're likely to be thrilled by Roma. If you don't like Solaris (I loathe that rubbish), this is, maybe, half a notch up from it (at least there's some dialogue in Roma).The cinematography is the only aspect of this movie I found endearing, but despite being a big fan of black and white imagery, I wish it were in color, as that would have really taken me back to my childhood (I grew up in Latin America in the 70's, even though my family was blessed by only one live-in maid and my family's friends didn't own huge ranches in the countryside).I was able to decide that this movie was going nowhere (for me at least) when the dude in the Sasquatch costume stopped to sing while a fire was raging in the forest. Went to bed shortly after that.Today, remembering how bored I was, I felt compelled to sign up in order to be able to write a review."
ROMA,16 January 2019,1/10,"I've nevera seen something so borring, this movie online likes to the guys who think that they are film critics if you sant to sleep is the best movie for you"
ROMA,17 January 2019,3/10,"You know what you are going to get when the intro spends 5 minutes looking at about a square yard of floor tiles being washed - a slow, tedious film.
And you don't even see the water, the mop or its wielder till you've nearly dropped off.If subtitles, shooting in B&W and lots of panning make an 'art film' this is one. If there is more to it, it's not even that.And the photography is the highlight, there is no story, we have no more idea about these people at the end of the film than at the start, we have no insight into their characters or aspirations.I love subtitled art films usually so I was hugely disappointed. I was just was bored. Utterly bored. At least it's not just just me."
ROMA,22 January 2019,9/10,"I am going to say that Aparicio is the best actress to ever star in a film, ever. The film's characters are the clinically well acted and have genuine realistic dialogue and interaction. They feel too much like realistic people: Cuaron must have been spying on an actual family for a few years to get communication and characters this well. One field with it drastically suffers in though is it doesn't really have one story it has 50 we don't care about and even though it was specifically set in the 70s, a time of great turmoil, it takes no use of the political atmosphere
Nonetheless, if Aparicio doesn't win best actress I will shoot myself"
ROMA,22 January 2019,10/10,This movie is a fine example of the beauty in humanity.
ROMA,22 January 2019,2/10,"No story, boring, average actors....Cinematography is great."
ROMA,23 January 2019,1/10,I felt compelled to make sure everyone knows that this was the most boring movie ever made in the history of movies. It was worse than watching paint dry. Don't waste your time.
ROMA,23 January 2019,10/10,"Roma is, besides an increadibly cinematography, Roma has the unique south-america aeshtetics.
The film trought history, it's frames and permorances the experience of a female being in a colonizated and violent country dominanet by the imperialist North."
ROMA,23 January 2019,5/10,Very slow. It takes so long to get to the next episode. I realize there are many who have hard lives. I don't think this one is worth sharing
ROMA,25 January 2019,9/10,"I have never written a review before, but after reading what was written thus far about this film, I felt compelled to speak about this film honestly. My brother first watched this film and said it was ""dumb"" and nothing more. So I decided to watch it with my father, who grew up in Mexico until he was 14 and came to the states. After the film was over, he turned to me and said, ""Wow. I can relate. That's what it was like (growing up in Mexico)."" I was so appreciative of this film and the connection it made to my father and to me. It was BEAUTIFULLY shot and told and honest story. My father also commented on it's originality, which I agree with. I can see how some might take this as a ""dry"" or ""boring"" film. This might be from the viewers who expected explosions and CGI and action and all the things that the current industry seems to pass off as good story telling. It might also come from the viewer who does not have the cultural experience or background to appreciate this very specific and heartfelt story. If it does not win any awards, I will be shocked. Exceptionally done, ROMA."
ROMA,6 March 2019,3/10,"Derivative, self-indulgent, self-promotion by the new darling of the critics. Nothing new that warrants all the hoopla."
ROMA,26 January 2019,9/10,"Seemed slow and boring. Then I caught the movies pace, felt the warmth of the air just by the striking cinematography, dogs barking, birds chirping. When I find myself talking and thinking about a movie often I realize it had a great impact on me. The love of family including the hired help and genuine real time portrayal of daily life of this family in Mexico impressed me. Thank you for creating a thoughtful movie that varied from the chaotic, action, animated, mindless, typical movie out there these days."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"Terrible movie. Essentially about a maid who inexplicably loves to be a maid and otherwise has no emotions or thoughts. Less a film and more a series of loosely connected episodes with little to no meaning, humor, or feeling. Is every critic being bribed? User reviews seem to differ significantly."
ROMA,27 January 2019,1/10,"A few points about the movie:1. In terms of the information content, you can compress the movie to less than 20 minutes (17% of original length)2. The quality of the story is I would say is less than 3 out of 10.3. Visually speaking, by making a movie black and white you don't become classic, it's like those fake Rolex watches that you can buy for $9.99Definitely recommend it if you are planning on having a fight with your partner or you are planning on a separation or a divorce."
ROMA,1 February 2019,2/10,"The only reason I've just made my account here is that I wanted to share with you how disappointed I was after watching this movie. I really thought that if a movie is nominated to the Oscar award, then it means that it's special - worth seeing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not an amateur who's already satisfied when there's some action in the movie. I also like more sophisticated creations, but in this case I didn't see anything special at all. Firstly, I could sum up the whole movie in 2 sentences. Secondly, the way it was made was interesting, but not sooo extraordinary, come on! If such movies are so appreciated, maybe I should make mine, of course in black and white while doing groceries."
ROMA,10 February 2019,1/10,"Do not waste two hours of your life watching this ""movie"". A completely irrelevant story and in a format you want it to end as soon as possible. Any maid who got pregnant and the guy was not responsible, and a family that the husband left ... Nothing more."
ROMA,11 February 2019,1/10,"After forcing myself to watch this film to the end I just cannot understand the positive comments concerning the film. The film had no interest for me, I felt no emotion, I felt nothing. Someone mentioned the Emperor's New Clothes !!!. After seeing the BAFTA awards and some of the comments I think I have to admit to myself that I know nothing about film art and must be a complete moron on the subject. Some excellent nominations this year and they pick this film. I cannot remember watching a film that had so little interest for me. I have studied the positive comments and still cannot understand why it is claimed to be so good.
Please someone agree with me."
ROMA,28 February 2019,1/10,"Had to be slowest movie I have ever watched. All along am wondering when the plot would be showing up? Girl gets knocked up, biological is a louse, baby doesnt make it.Why did Fermin come in store shooting, what was that about?Okay she has a cathartic moment at beach where the she should have let the rat kids drowned. So what"
ROMA,15 February 2019,1/10,I had lost my time two times by watching shape of water and birdman and by watching this exhausting movie it's gonna be the third time.
ROMA,18 February 2019,10/10,About an hour into the movie we see an add for Banca Serfin which at the time was the Banco de Londres y Mexico - it became Sefin in 1977
ROMA,26 February 2019,5/10,"The photography is the most beautiful thing in the movie.
But the evolution of the history is slow and weak, seems like a lot of divorce cases...The main message ""the show must go on"" is given..nothing special."
ROMA,20 February 2019,1/10,"I dont understand all the hype around this movie. There is no story, nothing at all. I would summarize it as a boring reality show from Mexico City in 1970."
ROMA,24 February 2019,2/10,I want to be entertained. Why do critics forget why movies are made. Comedy or tradegy have a plot. Create characters we care about. Black and white very nice. Recreation of 1970's Mexico very well done. Does it deserve best picture? No. Does it deserve my time? A hard no.
ROMA,24 February 2019,10/10,"I loved this movie. Everything are carefully and beautifully staged. Like a theater play. The director must be rehearsed many times to come to this effect. Might be using a timer to time everything. Just like AI, everything are precise. Carefully staged hence not a dull moments in the movie. Water means woman. Airplane fly and fly and fly. Prime time TV show in the afternoon. She waited the glass was filled then turn around and broke the glass and you know something bad will happen. So meaningful. She came up, she saw her master, then fire in the woods. There's little fire for kids, big fire for adults to pour waters to, everyone had their parts. Celebrity points the finger to the sky at the exact time when airplane fly over his head. Shopping at the right place at the right time to encounter the riot and the ex and then give birth right after. So dramatic, so Hollywood. I cried like a baby. Also loved the kid good looking boy band hair style after swimming. All embraced together at the end and still no one blocking the beautiful sun. Many staged act, one scene after another. Good surround sound. Every character knows the exact time to go in and when to act to the camera at the right position in every frame. Not one second more, not one second less. Many scene has the Hollywood magical sunlight. Everyone had a glow in their head when firing the gun. The smoke, the dust, the shadows, Beautiful. Eye popping. Like a girl with a beautiful make up. Kids knew when the adults will finished their conversation then go into the camera then talk. Just like seeing a well staged play. A new kind of film. A well staged black and white documentary commercial art film. Good job. After watching this movie, I love Mexico and suddenly, I felt like I am a good person and that's feels great. I also got many likes in my account from my friends after saying good things about it. Now I know how to get more LIKES. Easy. Also knew how to predict what kind of film will win at the awards. Also easy. Like a prophet. Want to go to Mexico to enjoy the everyday magical Hollywood sunlight and stand still to look cool. Love Mexico and this film. Hope the movie gets as much best picture awards as possible then more people will watch the film. And after seeing it everyone in the world will love Mexico more and more like me and the world will become a better place."
ROMA,26 February 2019,9/10,"""Roma"", directed by Alfonso Cuarón,is an evocative little gem set during Mexico's ""Dirty War"" of the 70's where clashes between students and the government resulted in a fatal bloodbath.Cuarón uses the scenario only as a supportive framework to his core narrative-the journey of Cleo,an indigenous live-in maid and babysitter employed in an upper/middle class Mexican family.""Roma""works predominantly due to its brilliant directorial touches and luscious black and white cinematography that aptly captures the troubled mexican milieu of the times on the one hand and the vagaries of life on the other.Cuarón uses imagery masterfully to mirror the multi-layered conflicts of the film.The soapy tiled floor,a broken tea cup,the ungainly family car and the constant presence of a household pet are delicate nuances that give us an insight into the characters' internal dilemmas.Through his portrayal of two women from diametrically different strata of society and their devastating personal calamities,Cuarón shows us that life is the greatest leveller -that tragedy affects everyone albeit in different ways-that the cycle of life and death is an intrinsic part of all human existence-that sometimes real family is defined not by blood but by choice.The film unfolds at a leisurely pace and culminates in a powerful gut wrenching scene that is cathartic and honours the dignity inherent in both women.Unlike the director's other efforts namely ""Gravity""and ""Harry Potter 3""( the only 2 that I've watched )""Roma"" is rooted in realism and is a fitting ode to the country of his birth and the people who shaped his life.It's a well deserved Oscar for direction,cinematography and film in a foreign language."
ROMA,26 February 2019,5/10,"OK, we're supposed to feel so sorry and guilty for the poor, taken advantage of house slaves. We're supposed to hate white people more, we get it. The truth? Latin America STILL is taking advantage of their poor who are in so many houses in Latin America washing their toilets and floors and cooking their food and raising the kids for those Latinos with a little money. Yet we don't talk about that now because we're too busy hating whites because they don't want more of us losers in the USA, the USA already allows in ONE MILLION LEGAL IMMIGRANTS EVERY YEAR, yet the liberal racist press refuses to talk about that. You know why Latinos speak Spanish instead of Aztec, Incan, Mayan, Toltec, Chiappa? Because the people from SPAIN came over and killed the leaders, stole the gold, raped the women and forced the rape children to speaky spainish and be Catholic."
ROMA,2 March 2019,9/10,"The cinematography almost made me nostalgic on the past. I cried,the movie made me cry.So much realistic movie about life."
ROMA,3 March 2019,2/10,"Mild spoilers - although given this film had barely any plot, that doesn't mean much!This is the first review I've been moved to write on imdb, because I've never seen such a massively over-rated film in all my life. For the first 10-15 minutes I thought that it could have potential. It was certainly beautifully (if a little pretentiously) shot, and the character of Cleo seemed a sympathetic and relate-able protagonist. It took more than an hour of waiting in vain for something to happen, before it began to slowly dawn on me that it never would.The film is far too long, with massively over-indulgent lingering shots throughout.
However, my biggest complaint was the script, it became clear the writers has decided to entirely abandon every convention which normally makes a story compelling: no character development, virtually no dramatic tension (and what little there was seemed quickly forgotten) and no plot resolution or catharsis. It was as though the writers had a load of ideas, but instead of properly developing a few good ones they just threw scraps of them all into the film and hoped they'd hang together.For the entire length of the film, every time there seemed to be some potential for drama or character development the scene would simply change. For example (here comes the mild spoiler), at one point a forest fire starts near to the house where the main characters are staying. ""Fire!"" shout the men outside and everyone grabs buckets of water and rushes to deal with it. An opportunity for dramatic tension, I think! What's going to happen? Is someone going to get hurt? Maybe one of the children runs away? Possibly while everyone is distracted that groper guy will try to rape the mother? Nope - a man wearing some weird costume stands 'every so artistically' in front of the camera (with the fire beautifully framing him, of course) and starts...singing? Then, with no context or explanation he wandered away and.... Bam! Scene cuts to the children playing football somewhere and sometime entirely different. Fire never mentioned again. No explanation, no context, no development of plot or character just on to the next thing... You learn literally NOTHING about any of the characters throughout - not even the protagonist!Wrong! Just plain bad, flat writing of the worst kind! I give it 2 instead of 1 because one can't deny it looked nice, but the script barely better than The Room, with none of the charm of spoon photos!"
