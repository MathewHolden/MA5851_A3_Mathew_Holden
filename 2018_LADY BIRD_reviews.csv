LADY BIRD,19 March 2018,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" suffers from a curse all Oscar-hyped films have....when you have heard so much about them for so long you can't help but feel a tiny bit disappointed. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film or I disliked it...but the hype really made it tougher to love the movie more....something that the filmmakers have no responsibility for in any way.Apart from all the great press and many Oscar nominations, I actually knew very little about the movie. Heck, for a little time I thought it was all about LBJ's wife!! It turns out to be a dandy story about a rather typical teenage girl...facing a few typical problems as well as a mother who is very uptight and critical.So what did I like about the film? Mostly the acting...which seemed very real. In particular, while I hated Laurie Metcalf's character (the mother was very annoying and easy to hate), she did a GREAT job with her...and showed she's more than just a lady who was a regular on ""Roseanne"". Many other nice performances as well....and I like how the staff at the Catholic school were NOT all monolithic and angry but represented all sorts of folks. Overall, worth seeing and a good film that suffers a tad due to super-high expectations from me...but hopefully not you."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,10/10,"With one of my favourite trailers of the year, the awards attention, the theme of coming of age and the critical acclaim, 'Lady Bird' very quickly became one of the year's most anticipated films for me. Deliberately didn't see it at opening weekend though, just in case it was busy and difficult to get tickets, after the insane opening weekend of 'Black Panther'. 'Lady Bird' in no way disappointed. With the above, was hoping that it would be one of my favourite films of the year and it turned out to be exactly that, the awards attention and acclaim more than fully deserved. This doesn't just fly, 'Lady Bird' actually soars and have not seen a coming of age-themed film in recent memory this sparkling or honest or with this amount of humour, brains, heart and charm. Have seen it mentioned as a passion project, and if it was the passion and hard work can be seen all over.It is a very appealing film visually, with beautiful and colourful cinematography and with editing that flows succinctly and cohesively. The music is has energy yet knows when to understate itself when needed. In her first film as solo director, Greta Gerwig directs with a nimble touch, the comedy is light on its feet and she avoids making the emotional elements heavy-handed or tonally jarring.The script is one of the year's best, my personal pick actually for this year's Best Original Screenplay Oscar of the nominees. The comedy sparkles in wit and is genuinely hilarious, done in an honest and true to life way yet with some cringes like it would be in real life too. Over-sentimentality is avoided in the more emotional and dramatic scenes, there are some really sweet and poignant moments and an endearing personal touch.Found myself really emotionally investing in and relating to the mother and daughter relationship, their bonding bringing tears to my eyes and then making me smile and laugh when botched and leaving me with hope at resolution at the same time. The coming of age/angsty elements have a truthfulness, authenticity and twinkle and it was very easy to identify with them if in the same position growing up, they're often very funny but also very heartfelt and charming.Story is immensely engaging throughout right from the riotous opening to the more emotional and avoiding-being-too-pat ending, anchored by the mother and daughter relationship that entertains, moves and provokes thought. Didn't mind at all that it wasn't ground-breaking, due to not expecting it to be as coming of age can be predictable. Enjoyed the way the characters were written, and appreciated that the film broke away from the typical archetype of school teachers being over-disciplinary and without humour.Performances are never less than great, with Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf fully inhabiting their characters and phenomenally. It was wonderful for both to get awards attention with both giving two of the year's best performances. Lois Smith twinkles too in her role.If Lucas Hedges (who has grown quite a lot) and Timothee Chalamet (not as good as his truly remarkable performance in 'Call Me By Your Name' but showing why he is one of the most promising recent rising stars) continue to go down this promising path they are likely to go on to big careers.Concluding, fabulous film and one of my favourites of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
LADY BIRD,2 September 2018,8/10,"Laurie Metcalf and Saiorse Ronan playing mother and daughter in this coming of
age story set in Sacramento, California. Young Ms. Ronan has quite the senior
year and deals with all kinds of issues before going off to college.It usually works out this way, that one parent is in the role of disciplinarian while
the other is kind of the soft touch. I well recall in my brother-in-law's family my
sister-in-law did the disciplining while my brother was the soft touch with the
kids. Sometimes that places undue hardship on the one who enforces the
rules. Something that Laurie Metcalf is conscious of. Especially when Ronan
goes to dear old dad to soften the blows and dad is played by Tracy Letts.Sex is very important as the family really likes a boy from her theater group
Lucas Hedges. He's like the perfect All-American Catholic youth from the
parochial school. Due to issues on Hedges's part it can never be with them
though they try.Not getting Hedges, Ronan settles on Timothee Chalamet to be her one and
only first. He is, but there's a lot less to Chalamet than meets the eye.Back in the 80s there was this great film Heaven Help Us which really took
Catholic education to the cleaners. It takes a few hits here, but the nuns are
really fleshed out 3 dimensional characters and some actually possess a bit of
the wisdom their calling says they should develop.Lady Bird earned Oscar nominations for Ronan and Metcalf for Best Actress
and Supporting Actress. Additionally it was up for Best Picture, Best Director
and Best Original Screenplay.Most of all the audience will truly root for Saiorse Ronan to make some sense
out of this we call life. Or at least figure some of it out."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,9/10,"It's 2002 Sacramento. Christine MacPherson (Saoirse Ronan) demands to be called Lady Bird. She has a combative love hate relationship with her hard-working mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf). Her father (Tracy Letts) is struggling. Lady Bird is desperate to go to college in New York despite her mother's money concerns. She has a crush on Danny who is surprised that she actually lives on the other side of the tracks. She abandons her best friend Julie to get close to rich girl Jeanna and rich slacker musician Kyle.Greta Gerwig brings a personal touch to the mother-daughter relationship and her home town of Sacramento. There is a warmth to their verbal combat. There is real heart to their portrayal. There is biting humor and quirky gentleness. There are real insights into the mother daughter connection. Only one scene troubled me. Saoirse dials up the ""Please talk to me"" scene to eleven when a nine would be more heart-breaking. I see the emotional push but it gets too manufactured in that one scene. Overall, this is an outstanding film with some great laughs."
LADY BIRD,7 December 2017,10/10,"This is a stunning tale. Christine, ""Lady Bird,"" is a teenager, getting ready to graduate and move out of Sacramento. Her parents are polar opposites. Her mother, a victim of alcoholic abuse as a child, has trouble saying a single positive thing about her daughter. Lady Bird is creative and alive and her own person. What I like was that she had foibles and normal teenage propensities. She is looking for love and thinks she finds it, but circumstances leap in front of her. She wants out, but her mother does everything she can to block her independence. They are strapped for money and the mother thinks Lady Bird is too big for her britches. We are introduced to characters that are never over the top. There are few, if any, Hollywood explosions. They talk and interact and they are incredibly believable. The biggest problem is that Lady Bird's mother leaves the daughter no avenues, and so the girl must lie and deceive. There are several peripheral characters who are portrayed with admirable restraint. I look forward to seeing the next offering from this first tie director. Great movie but not for everyone."
LADY BIRD,20 April 2018,6/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a new American movie, actually a 2017 release already, but here in Germany it took until 2018. This one runs for a bit over 90 minutes and was written and directed by Golden-Globe-nominated actress Greta Gerwig. If you see that this was not only nominated for 5 Oscars (without succeeding though), but also won over 100 awards and was nominated for another 200, then there is no doubt that this was one of the big players this awards season, especially because it also took home the Golden Globes for lead actress Saoirse Ronan and Best Comedy/Musical. It is a really good movie I cannot deny. Maybe I would not agree that Gerwig's direction is outstanding enough for an Oscar nomination, but taking into account that this is just the second film she directed, it is damn impressive. And the script is Oscar-worthy in my opinion. Gerwig succeeded so well here in giving all the characters, the ones with a lot of screen time as well as the ones with very little, so much shades that it is a joy to look at. This especially includes the title character. She is not an angel and actually she can be pretty mean as we find out during the breat surgery scene or the abortion scene. But that also has to do with some of her insecurities and inner conflicts. Even those guys, who are eventually depicted as the ones that are not helping the protagonist are not depicted as real antagonists or as downright evil. All the characters feel so realistic and I not even once had the impression that I was watching fictitious people, but real ones. And once more Ronan proves that she is a star in the making, although that's maybe not fair looking at her film history as she is a star already and easily among the very best actresses from her age group now, maybe even the number one. It only seems a matter of time till she gets that Oscar. I think Roseanne's Laurie Metcalf here was in the early lead to take home the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but lost pace when Janney took over and dominated the race. Metcalf's character is the far more subtle one from the two, but even if she was really good, I think that most of the character's memorability results from the way Gerwig wrote her. Can also add here that the dialogue writing is exquisite.It's all about Lady Bird and her life in this coming-of-age story, especially the boys falling for her or actually rather the boys she is falling for as the ones played by very young recent Oscar nominees Chalamet and Hedges may have other things on their minds than Lady Bird. But it is also a good movie about friendship and making the right decisions about the people you really want to care about because they care about you. And of course the protagonist's relationship with her parents, especially her mother plays a crucial part here just like the parents' struggles in general. Her brother and his girlfriend are included too, more for comedic reasons mostly. Comedy is also a field where this film succeeds pretty well, never in a way that is in your face or try-hard, but very subtle yet very entertaining, just like you've seen it in films that have Gerwig star as an actress. Looking at her young age, I think we are really in for some great stuff from her hopefully in the next decades. I am positive it's gonna happen. This film here is definitely closer to a ****/***** than to a **/***** for me and I very much recommend checking it out. There isn't one scene really here that will stay in your mind overall, but there also is not a single scene that was weak or truly forgettable in my opinion. It's really tough to find a flaw with this film. If you like coming-of-age tales about female characters, then it is really a bit of a must see. Fittingly with Chalamet in here too, you could say that this is the straight, female-centered equivalent to Call Me By Your Name from the same year. And finally, I also found it interesting how time has passed far enough already that the events of 911 are a historic background in films already. Oh boy have we gotten old. Soon those who turn 18, weren't even born when the attacks happened. My oh my. But it was included in a pretty interesting manner here. So what are you waiting for. Watch these 1.5 hours. It's not one of these movies that is infinitely better to be seen on a big screen compared to a small screen, but it is one of those movies that you don't want to miss out on. Go for it. Oh and I realize I am still not finished and would finally like to add that the title makes very much sense here because the film basically ends the moment that lady bird flies up in the air and disappears. Another nice idea. That's all folks!"
LADY BIRD,11 December 2018,6/10,"Lady Bird is a well acted film, it has a very good and touching performance from Saoirse Ronan. However as a coming of age drama, it offers little that is new and is also not that quirky.Lady Bird is set in Sacramento in 2002. Christine AKA Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) has a spiky and difficult relationship with her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf.) At the start of the movie Lady Bird throws herself from a moving car after arguing with her mother and her arm is in plaster.Life has not worked out for Marion as she had hoped. Her husband has always been financially insecure, now lost his job and battling depression for years.Lady Bird is going to a good Catholic high school. She wants to go to a college in the east coast, a big city like New York. Marion is worried that they may not be able to afford the college fees.Lady Bird becomes embarrassed about her upbringing when she makes new friends who are hipper or just richer. She makes out that she comes from a better part of town and she also drops her old friends. Lady Bird takes up with slacker musician Kyle who she loses her virginity to. She later realises that Kyle was just shallow and used her.Only later does Lady Bird figure that she has been hard on her mother and appreciate what her parents did for her.Maybe because I have been a parent to teenagers, have a daughter going to university. I can understand Lady Bird wanting something more, being unsure of life which is not uncommon for people of her age. I also understand her mother's concerns, thinking she is being taken for granted by her daughter and being fearful for the future with financial stresses.I think Lady Bird realises when her relationship with Kyle does not go as expected. She knows that she still has a lot of growing up to do and begins to appreciate her friends and family."
LADY BIRD,11 January 2018,7/10,"""Lady Bird"" is an inspiring film for teenagers and practically the directorial debut the unknown Greta Gerwig, who is also the writer of this sensitive coming of age story. Saoirse Ronan has wonderful performance in the role of Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a teenager with typical adolescent problems. Troubled relationship with her mother and siblings; high-school pranks; romance; sex; disappointments with boyfriends and friends; financial problem; dream on going to college and improving life, all these elements are realistically explored by Greta Gerwig, maybe based on her personal experiences in Sacramento. The optimist conclusion with the growth of Christine is another plus in this original film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Lady Bird: É Hora de Voar"" (""Lady Bird: It Is Time to Fly"")"
LADY BIRD,18 April 2018,8/10,"Growing up is a hoot ... well for the observers or rather viewers of this that is. And if you have a really good movie like this. You can see why this had an impact at the Academy Awards, especially under the recent #metoo movement. Even if this was made way before and surely never thought to be a flagship of a movement like some make it to be.If you like a good story, with great characters and really good (and funny) dialog, this is a movie to watch out for. If you've seen the trailer you may know a couple of the biggest jokes already, but the movie still works. One thing you also get from the trailer is the offbeat humor. You can tell if you like it or not. Quality wise there should not be anything to complain about"
LADY BIRD,4 February 2018,7/10,"I can't be the only person who thought this might have been about the wife of the thirty-sixth President of the United States, but I didn't see any other reviewers mention it. So I guess that puts me at the outer spectrum of IMDb users by age because that's the first thing I thought of.I don't know, I thought this was a fairly entertaining picture but I don't see how it rises to the level of a Best Picture nomination, sneaking past a film like ""Mudbound"". You've got your typical teen-age angst going on with Lady Bird and her friends, but none of it came across as truly character defining. The principal players were all competent enough and I thought Saoirse Ronan carried herself well as the title character. It was pretty uncanny how she and Laurie Metcalf resembled each other enough to where they could actually have been mother and daughter. The father though (Tracy Letts), probably could have been a bit more grief stricken over losing his job, especially with college coming down the pike for his daughter. I read another review that thought the best line of the picture had to do with Sacramento being described as the 'midwest of California'. Uh-uh. For that I'll have to refer the viewer to the dance scene when Sister Joan (Lois Smith) instructs Lady Bird and Danny (Lucas Hedges) to ""leave six inches for the Holy Spirit"". That double entendre observation cracks me up even as I write about it."
LADY BIRD,6 August 2018,10/10,"Greta Gerwig has been of the queens of the indies for a few years now, so it makes sense that she wanted to branch out by turning to directing. And her Academy Award-nominated directorial debut is nothing short of a masterpiece.The title character in ""Lady Bird"" is a high school senior in Sacramento in 2002-2003. A real oddball who doesn't fit in with the Catholic school that she attends, Lady Bird hopes to attend an east coast school, much to her parents' chagrin. Part of the conflict presented by the movie comes from the contrast between Lady Bird's aspirations and her parents' economic means. But no matter what happens, the characters press forward with their lives. Specifically, Lady Bird and her friends come up with all sorts of things to do, some of which the Catholic school won't find too pleasant.The movie makes sure that we can understand the positions of all the diverse set of characters (even though not all of them are sympathetic individuals). The entire cast gives it their all, and turns it into one fine movie. I recommend it.PS: What I mean by calling Laurie Metcalf the winner from ""Roseanne"" is that the show got cancelled and the star is now disgraced due to a controversial tweet, but Metcalf not only starred in this movie - and received an Academy Award nomination for it - but she's won Tonys for some Broadway performances, plays Sheldon's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"", and voiced Andy's mom in the ""Toy Story"" series."
LADY BIRD,17 March 2018,7/10,"Clips of this movie were shown on television many times throughout Awards Season, it looked like a quirky kind of film, not the usual kind to receive big award nominations, it also marked the Oscar nominated directorial debut for actress Greta Gerwig. Basically in 2002, Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Saoirse Ronan) is a senior student at an all-girls Catholic high school in Sacramento, California. Lady Bird longs to attend an Ivy League college in ""a city with culture"", but her family is struggling financially, and her mother Marion (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Laurie Metcalf) tells her she is ungrateful for what she has. Lady Bird and her best friend Julie Steffans (Beanie Feldstein) join their school theatre program, where Lady Bird meets Danny O'Neill (Lucas Hedges) from a neighboring all-boys Catholic high school, they both audition for the schools' joint fall production of Merrilly We Roll Along. They develop a romantic relationship, her mother is disappointed when Lady Bird joins Danny's family for Thanksgiving dinner, but their relationship ends when Lady Bird discovers Danny kissing a boy in the bathroom. From the insistence of her mother, Lady Bird finds a job working in a coffee shop, there she meets young musician Kyle Scheible (Timothée Chalamet), they begin a romantic relationship, and she and Julie drift apart. Popular girl Jenna Walton (Odeya Rush) is reprimanded by teacher Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith) for wearing a short skirt, Lady Bird suggests she and Jenna bond by vandalising the Sister's car, but she gives her home address as being that of Danny's grandmother's home to appear wealthy. Lady Bird is given a role in the disjointed spring production of The Tempest, despite this she drops out of the theatre program. At the coffee shop, Lady Bird reunites with Danny, consoling him as he expresses his struggle to come out as gay. After Kyle tells Lady Bird he is a virgin, she loses her virginity to him, but he later denies saying this. Jenna discovers that Lady Bird lies about her address, while Lady Bird discovers that her father Larry (Tracy Letts) has lost his job and has been battling depression for most of his life. Lady Bird begins applying to East Coast colleges, despite her mother insisting that the family cannot afford it, she is overjoyed when she discovers she has been placed on the wait list for a New York college. Lady Bird sets out for her high school prom with Kyle, Jenna, and her boyfriend, but they decide to go to a party instead, Lady Bird asks them to drop her off at Julie's house, there the two rekindle their friendship and go to the prom together. After Lady Bird's graduation, her mother discovers her applying for out-of-state colleges behind her back and stops talking to her. On her eighteenth birthday, Lady Bird's father shares a cupcake with her, he assures her that he and her mother still love each other, he jokes they will not get a divorce because they cannot afford it. To celebrate reaching legal age, Lady Bird buys a pack of cigarettes, a scratch card, and an issue of Playgirl, she takes and passes her driving test, and she redecorates her bedroom. Lady Bird learns that she has bee accepted to the New York college, she can afford the tuition with financial aid and the help of her father. Her mother refuses to see her off at the airport, she does have a change of heart and drives back, but by then Lady Bird has already left. In New York, Lady Bird finds thoughtful letters written by her mother, salvaged by her father, and she decides to start using her birth name again. After leaving hospital, following a night of heavy drinking at the party, she chances upon a Sunday Catholic mass, then calls home, speaking as Christine and leaving an apologetic message for her mother. Also starring Fences' Stephen McKinley Henderson as Father Leviatch, Jake McDorman as Mr. Bruno, Laura Marano as Diana Greenway and Jordan Rodrigues as Miguel McPherson. Ronan does an impeccable American accent and with her dyed red hair is a fantastic representation of a flawed teenage girl on the cusp of adulthood, and Metcalf is terrific as the equally flawed mother who only wants the best for her daughter. The film goes through pretty much every motion a teenage girl would when approaching legal age, the difficult relationship between mother and daughter is one of the big draws in the story, and the script is witty and endearing, it is not afraid to show eccentricity and be unconventional, a likeable coming-of-age comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Original Screenplay for Greta Gerwig, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
LADY BIRD,12 February 2020,9/10,"Christine ""Lady Bird"" MacPherson is an artistically inclined high school senior who dreams of leaving Sacramento to attend a college in New York. Her mother encourages her to have more realistic dreams as she is neither top of the class nor from a wealthy family. Lady Bird is somewhat embarrassed by the fact that she doesn't live in a wealthy part of the city. The film takes place over the course of her final year at a Roman Catholic high school. During this time she experiences romance and changing friendships as well as getting in some trouble.This is very much a film driven by characters rather than by plot. Many of the things Lady Bird gets up to could have come from any other coming of age drama featuring a teenaged protagonist... that is not a problem though; it follows genre stereotypes because they work and feel real. Nothing that happens feels unrealistic. The central relationship in the film is that between Lady Bird and her mother; Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf are great in these roles. The rest of the cast are solid too. There are plenty of laughs to be had; these are unforced and come through the situations rather than the obvious gags; a prime example being Lady Bird's comments during a lecture on abortion. Writer/director Greta Gerwig did a great job, in this her solo directing debut. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2018,,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. This is one of a handful of movies that received lots of Oscars buzz, was nominated for best picture and Ronan for best female actor. As such I expected it to be better and more worthy than it turns out to be.Oh, not to be misunderstood, it in fact is a very good, very interesting movie and all the acting is first-rate, but it is a story that in general has been done many times. A teenager struggling with school, college choices, first loves, and constantly at odds with a mother who has a hard time complimenting her daughter on anything. To me it is not a ""best picture"" contender in any year.I am a great fan of Saoirse Ronan, she is funny in person and one of the better young actresses. I loved her in ""Hanna"" and I loved her in ""Brooklyn."" Here she is ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, with the name she gave herself. Her mother is Laurie Metcalf (Sheldon's mother on Big Bang Theory) as Marion McPherson. Lady Bird has a much nicer relationship with her dad, Tracy Letts as Larry McPherson.They live in Sacramento, which Lady Bird detests, and is anxious to leave. She has her sights set on a college out east, maybe even in New York City.Good coming of age movie.Oct 2018 edit: I watched again and came away with a somewhat better impression. It is as much about the mother's difficulty seeing her daughter grow up and go away as it is about the daughter wanting to spread her wings and go to college out east, far from Sacramento. A really good family drama with many funny moments."
LADY BIRD,26 July 2021,8/10,"Lady Bird, starring Saoirse Ronan, is the story of a young woman in a Catholic high school, where they check the length of your skirts, make you stand apart while dancing, and have anti-abortion lectures. I went to Catholic school - all right on.Lady Bird's real name is Christine, but she has renamed herself Lady Bird. She has a volatile - understatement - relationship with her mother (Laurie Metcalf). Conversations start out fine and end with things like, ""Well, go to community college, go to prison, and then come out and go back to community college.""Lady Bird considers her home town of Sacramento ""the midwest of California"" and wants to go to school in the east. Her mother tells her they can't afford it, as her father (Tracy Letts) is about to lose his job, and ultimately does. Her mother also says that Lady Bird doesn't have the grades.Lady Bird appeals to her dad to secretly help her with financial aid applications, and sets about applying to a bunch of schools. This turns out to be a problem later on.The film is fun, with the theater department doing Merrily We Roll Along and Lady Bird falling for the leading man, who invites her to his house for Thanksgiving. Then she meets a rocker.Lady Bird is intimidated by her wealthier friends, and at one point sort of drops her best friend (Beanie Fellstein) to hang out with beautiful Jenna, who has a tanning bed and whose skin is luminous. Can't wait to see her when she hits 40.All of this is very much what kids go through in high school, which makes it fun and brings back memories. Lady Bird is determined to make her own way in the world. She feels her mother doesn't understand her and hates her. We've all felt that way.""Lady Bird"" leaves you with a smile on your face as she enters the world. It won't be the same with her in it."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,,"This film tells the story of a high school girl who tries to find herself in the world, amongst her peers and the adolescent turbulence.""Lady Bird"" is a charming film about real life. The characters are believable, and in fact I can relate to multiple characters in the film. The story does not feel formulaic. There are no outrageous drama or overly cliched characters, but the story just keeps me interested in it. The ending is a nice resolution, wrapping up and referring back to various moments in the film. I like it."
LADY BIRD,18 August 2018,9/10,"An instant masterpiece from writer/director Greta Gerwig. A young woman, Lady Bird McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), has a very confusing and emotional senior year of high school in Sacramento, California trying to convince her overbearing mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf), if she is going to have any future at all it must involve an east coast education. Popularity, romance and teen angst is dealt with in her own unique and personal way. Entertaining and insightful with hints of dark comedy. A witty and gritty rated R film leaving you with the sense that when all hope seems lost. . . it is not. Miss Ronan is flawless and Laurie Metcalf is outstanding. Also in the cast: Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein, Odeya Rush, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalmet and Lois Smith."
LADY BIRD,1 September 2020,6/10,"Saoirse Ronan is ""Christine McPherson"" (aka ""LadyBird""). In the final year of her high school life, she has to deal with all of the conflicting influences as her adulthood - and future - looms. She has a strong relationship with her father; a more torrid one with her mother - and generally resents what she perceives to be her family's rather hand-to-mouth existence in Sacramento. It's a tale of her emotional development, her boyfriends (Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet) and of her journey to adulthood that is at times poignant, at times self-indulgent but unfortunately, for me anyway, pretty disengaging. Her character is selfish and thoughtless - although not unsophisticated. Like many a story of our adolescence, it is fascinating for those it effects but is little more than dreary hormonal stuff for observers. This is the latter, I'm afraid, with plenty of well trodden clichés to make 94 minutes seem quite a lot longer... Not for me, I'm afraid."
LADY BIRD,23 February 2018,7/10,"Saoirse Ronan made a lot of friends with Brooklyn so inevitably her name above the title will surely put bums on seats. She's definitely not your usual leading lady, hardly a head-turner but neither is she chopped liver and her quirkiness makes up for a lot. When interviewed recently to promote the film Ronan made no effort to suppress her Irish brogue but playing a native Californian she is convincing. Although it covers more or less one year in Christine's late teens the film is more a series of vignettes - similar to Meet Me In St Louis - than a straight A- to - Z story but no worse for that. Christine is strongly drawn which means it's likely that audiences will either love or hate her but Ronan aquits herself well, as she did in Brooklyn and if Frances McDormand wasn't a Best Actress nominee in the same year who knows ..."
LADY BIRD,1 July 2018,8/10,"Sacramento, 2002. Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is in her final year of high school. She longs to leave Sacramento and go to college on the East Coast. However, her protective, obsessive mother, pessimistic at her chances, is determined to keep her in California, and ideally nearby to home. Lady Bird's final year of school will be one of discovery, new experiences and finding herself.Sweet, emotional movie, dealing with change, growing up and figuring out who you are. It also deals with parent-child relationships and how these shape us, and how the other party's intentions and motives are often misunderstood. Takes a while to find its focus though. While you figure the movie is a coming-of-age sort of thing, for the most part it feels like it is drifting. Not that this is boring - writer-director Greta Gerwig fills these scenes with humour and many relatable and engaging events. It is more like there wasn't an obvious point to all this.The last few scenes more than make up for this, as everything comes together in profound, emotional fashion. Great performances by Saoirse Ronan as Lady Bird and Laurie Metcalf as her mother. Both received Oscar nominations. Greta Gerwig received a Best Director nomination and a Best Original Screenplay nomination while the movie was nominated for Best Picture."
LADY BIRD,27 November 2017,7/10,". . . about ""only the good die young,"" which seems to be an undercurrent of LADY BIRD. Carefully marketed to fit with concurrent release LBJ, LADY BIRD is bound to disappoint because it omits the JFK death scene. In fact, it seems that virtually no one dies during LADY BIRD, whether young or old, good or otherwise. Back in the days when many if not most Americans paid their bills by snail mail, the original LADY BIRD got her mug on a set of postage stamps for chopping down highway billboards or something. LADY BIRD tries very hard to be equally subversive, showing young Catholic girls munching on The Holy Host (aka Communion Wafers) while sharing tips on the best way to masturbate in the shower or bathtub. But no one's head does a 360 here, so this is definitely not your granddad's EXORCIST. Instead, LADY BIRD is set in Today's LBGT-Q World, where the New York City Universities are still empty because no one wants to step-on-a-crack, and have a Windows on the World busboy fall on them to break-their-back. It's not so much outtakes from RENT as it is another brick in the wall of bologna writer\director Greta Gerwig has been churning out as a career-long obsession with the art house sausage factory's meat-grinder of low-budget chick flicks."
LADY BIRD,26 November 2017,10/10,"LADY BIRD (2017) **** Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalamet, Odeya Rush, Lois Smith, Jordan Rodrigues, Marielle Scott. Hilarious and poignant dramedy written and directed by actress Greta Gerwig (her big screen debut as both) about a headstrong, independent seeking teenager (Ronan in an Oscar worthy turn) who wants desperately to break free from her drab life in Sacramento, California with her future set on for an East Coast liberal arts college. Her only deterrent is her loving but piece-of-work mother (Metcalf who also should be a lock for an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actress and a career high performance), whose complex way of raising her family hinders there fragile relationship to boot. Glimmers of JD Salinger, Wes Anderson and John Hughes exist in the fun, funny and super sharp indie; one of the year's very best films."
LADY BIRD,28 November 2017,9/10,"I've always had a complicated relationship with Greta Gerwig as an actress. On the one hand, there's something very off putting about her, as if she's always being weird on purpose to turn others away before they have a chance to reject her. On the other hand, there's something fascinating about her that makes me want to return to her again and again.Watching ""Lady Bird,"" her wonderful, biographical coming of age film, made me understand Gerwig better. Saoirse Ronan plays the Gerwig surrogate and manages to both channel Gerwig's odd idiosyncrasies while at the same time create a completely unique and original character. The story picks up as Lady Bird, as Ronan's character prefers to be called, navigates her final year at a strict religious high school and contemplates going off to college and escaping the stifling environment of working-class Sacramento. Complicating that escape is the contentious relationship she has with her mom, played marvelously by Laurie Metcalf, who never misses an opportunity to criticize her and reminds her that she won't amount to anything even as she encourages her to make something of herself.""Lady Bird"" is the best kind of movie. It simply gives us a full- blooded character, full of complexity and contradictions, and asks us not to agree with her or side with her or even necessarily like her, but rather to spend some time with her and see if by the end of her story we can understand her. Ronan's performance is a minor miracle of acting, as is Metcalf's, and it will be a crime if both aren't recognized during awards season.Speaking of terrific performances, there are two others in the film to note, one by Tracy Letts as Lady Bird's dad, and Lucas Hedges, as a conflicted boyfriend. ""Lady Bird"" is a reminder that there are many different ways to define success, and that life, and the people that live it, can be many things at once. Grade: A"
LADY BIRD,1 May 2018,9/10,"Christine, 17, rather pretentiously calls herself Lady Bird. She has ambitions which may exceed her ability to fulfil them, the usual mixed relationships with her contemporaries at school, burgeoning sexuality, and a relationship with her mother which is mostly fractious, although it has moments which reach both extreme highs and (more often) extreme lows. In short, she is a fairly unremarkable teenager.If I was going to level a criticism at this film, that would be it - this is a slice of everyday life, with nothing in it to mark it out as any different from your life or mind: mild family dysfunctionality, and aren't we all familiar with that to a greater or lesser extent?But, going beyond that, Saoirse Ronan adds another superb performance to her CV - it surely can't be long before she notches up her first Oscar. And Laurie Metcalf, as her mother, is superb. She brought me to tears more than once.This small film about ordinary people behaving like ordinary people pleased me a great deal."
LADY BIRD,15 November 2017,9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Ben Affleck, Greta Gerwig proves her significance and brilliance is most apparent behind the camera, rather than in front. Her first feature film flying solo as writer and director is without a doubt, one of the year's best. Surely she has benefited from having a very talented live-in muse and mentor and partner in Noah Baumbach, but this extraordinary film is clearly Ms. Gerwig's passion project  and it's a thing of beauty (character warts and all).Ultra talented Saoirse Ronan plays Christine, aka ""Lady Bird"". She claims it's her given name – a name she gave herself. Entering her senior year of Catholic High School in Sacramento, she's the typical blend of teenage insecurity, bravado and restlessness. Her never quite satisfied mom is played by Laurie Metcalf, in what is probably her career best performance, and definitely worthy of Supporting Oscar consideration. A brilliant opening scene finds mother and daughter sharing a cry, which quickly devolves into one of the endless stream of arguments that make up half of their relationship. Their scenes together are sometimes caustic, always realistic, and likely to hit home to many mothers and daughters watching.Lady Bird is convinced she must escape 2002 Sacramento and live on the east coast, where she assumes culture thrives. This is the age where every teenager is convinced an amazing destiny awaits them  not stopping to contemplate what talent they possess that might actually contribute to society. Lady Bird is an average student who seems to dream not of greatness, but rather of some vision of life where she will be appreciated for simply being herself. So much of what happens is grounded in the reality of high school life, friendships, and family. She jumps at the chance to be friends with the ""it girl"" who controls the ""in crowd"". Leaving her lifelong best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein, Jonah Hill's real life sister) in the dust, Lady Bird finagles her way into Jenna's (Odeya Rush) inner circle of rich kids, including the cooler-than-cool Kyle (Timothee Chalamet, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME). He's the bohemian-wannabe type we've all come across. Her attraction to Kyle results in confusion over her relationship with nice guy Danny (Lucas Hedges, MANCHESTER BY THE SEA). The film touches on many familiar topics, and the script elegantly handles each piece of the puzzle and gives each character their due. Lady Bird's middle class family is going through some financial difficulties after her dad is laid off. Tracy Letts is superb as the dad who is beaten down by a life that's nearly passed him by, but he staves off his own depression just enough to provide the basic strength needed by his wife and spirited teenage daughter. Mr. Letts and Ms. Metcalf aren't TV sitcom parents carefully positioned as punchlines for clever kids, like what we typically see. The emotional bond between parents and offspring is perfectly awkward and deep. Mother and daughter have their shared escapes, while father and daughter share some secrets. There is also a complex sister-brother dynamic, as well as the common issues of school days – teenage girl self-respect, class warfare, teacher crushes, and the pressures of extracurricular activities. Lois Smith has a couple of outstanding scenes as a wise and observant nun who sees Lady Bird for who she is, and provides the necessary guidance. Welcome comedy relief is combined with an editorial statement on the ongoing reductions in funding for the arts, as the football coach (Bob Stephenson) is put in charge of the drama department.Ms. Gerwig's excellent (quasi-autobiographical) film defies traditional categorization. It's part teenage comedy, coming of age, family drama, and character study – yet it's also so much more. Have you seen much of this before? Absolutely, and it's likely at least some of this has occurred in your own life, though you may not always enjoy being reminded. What is enjoyable is watching the work of a skilled filmmaker and exciting new cinematic story teller."
LADY BIRD,4 January 2018,9/10,Saoirse Ronan has the ability to get the viewer's sympathy like no other actress. Her sweetness just makes all she is going through so much more involving and moving. The subject matter is a young girl in high school discovering relationships with boys and struggling with her very strange mother played by the excellent Laurie Metcalf. Things like this have been done before but never quite so lucidly. Watching her deal with her gay boy friend then the douche bag boy friend then her difficult mother are played out in such a spontaneous manner with very well written natural sounding dialog. Makes you want a part 2.
LADY BIRD,8 September 2018,10/10,"Writer/director Greta Gerwig has very successfully captured the aura and the terror and the reality of coming of age in 2002 in Sacramento California with this gleaming little film LADY BIRD. The cast is uniformly excellent and the musical score is a fine homage to Stephen Sondheim's genius. This is a fast paced, funny, touching, and realistic story about a very odd young high school senior trying to find her niche in life.Christine ""Lady Bird"" MacPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is a high school senior from the ""wrong side of the tracks."" Her parents - mother (Laurie Metcalf) and father (Larry McPherson) - work to keep their two children (Lady Bird and Miguel - Jordan Rodrigues) afloat during very difficult financial times: the mother works as a psych nurse and the father is job hunting after being let go from his employment. Lady Bird longs for adventure, sophistication, and opportunity, but finds none of that in her Sacramento Catholic high school. LADY BIRD follows the title character's senior year in high school, including her first romances (Danny - Lucas Hedges who is gay and Kyle - Timothée Chalamet who has played the field), her participation in the school play, and most importantly, her applying for college. The film also includes substantial comments on losing virginity, homosexuality, coming of age, obesity, and family conflicts. Her best friend is Julie (Beanie Feldstein) and her mentor is Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith) - all of whom offer splendid performances. Coming of age stories are common - but this one is special on so many levels. The film deserves all the awards for which it was nominated. Recommended."
LADY BIRD,9 September 2018,10/10,"Lady Bird aka Christine McPherson was perfectly played by Saorsie Ronan as a senior high school student in Sacramento, California. Laurie Metcalf was splendid and perfect as her mother, a psychiatric nurse. Her parents had sent her to Catholic school to avoid the horrors of public school. Steppenwolf Theatre Company is well-represented with Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts as her parents. Lois Smith played the mother superior. The cast is first rate and the writing is subtle and believable. This film was done by a female film director and screenwriter, Greta Garwig. The film has a believable quality to enjoy and behold as Christine goes through her senior year and trying to escape her home life."
LADY BIRD,20 March 2018,,"In the bonus track of ""Lady Bird,"" the talented writer-director Greta Gerwig discussed the theme of her film as growing up and despising where you are from, then recognizing the beauty of your surroundings at a later age. She seemed to believe that this was a universal part of growing up. But the truth is probably closer to that being Gerwig's personal experience and not necessarily a part of the human condition.The structure of the film was the coming-of-age of the main character called Lady Bird. Growing up in Sacramento, she apparently hated her home town so much that she adopted the dream of attending school at one of the Ivy League institutions. Lady Bird was not a particularly good student. Nor was she interested in the academic programs of Yale or Columbia. She only saw those prestigious institutions as her exit from Sacramento.This would have been a better film if the absence of basic human values had been explored in greater depth. Lady Bird is in effect mortgaging her future and digging herself into a financial nightmare to attend Columbia. And, when she is finally admitted and begins school, she lands in a hospital emergency room after getting drop-dead drunk. So much for the idealistic young college student!Another problem with the film was the troubled relationship of Lady Bird and her mother. In the bonus track, Gerwig noted that the story of Lady Bird and her mother was a ""love story."" But it was never made clear why the mother was not more supportive of her daughter. It was almost as if the mother wanted her child to fail in life. The mother was a psychologist who counseled people in a hospital. Yet in her home life, no matter what the daughter did, the mother would find a way to criticize her and often demean the daughter in a troubling way. The passive father would never intervene and consequently enabled the continuation of this toxic relationship. And are we to believe that the young woman throwing herself out of the car in response to her mother's tongue lashing is a funny scene?As the film progressed, the mood became more and more depressing. Are we supposed to admire Lady Bird when she cheats her way through her math class? Is it possible to admire the mother and daughter, when their favorite pastime is to walk through open houses on Sunday? Are we supposed to empathize with a leading character with such wide mood swings that she becomes a Jekyll and Hyde?Sadly, this indie film project is way overrated. Despite the hard-working cast, the overall effect is a self-indulgent cinematic memoir and a deeply troubling slice of Americana."
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,8/10,"Saoirse Ronan is great in the role of an adolescent girl that has to grow up in Sacramento. We go with her through all the important stages of her age: relationship with parents, boyfriends, BFFs, the desire to try new things while being afraid of them and not truly appreciating the old, lying to herself, lying to others, being lied to, understanding herself, and so on. So far so good, but then the movie ends. If you were looking for some sort of amazing story with a strong moral, this is not the movie for you. But if you are looking at a well acted well constructed film, you are in the right place.I thought the acting alone made it better than average, but there was also the way scenes were constructed. Other directors would have made this into a three hour movie, but Gerwig jumped often and skillfully over banal moments and focused on the personally important ones. I liked the film, although I felt I wanted something more, either more interesting anecdotes or some grand finale.Young girls might learn something from the film, but I am not sure it's the right thing. The main character is narcissistic, egotistic and doesn't mind lying, cheating or stealing to get her way. Yet it is a real character, a real person, not some fantasy of what people should be. I appreciated that."
LADY BIRD,5 June 2019,7/10,"The ""Lady Bird"" of the title is neither the insect nor the former First Lady who was married to President Lyndon Johnson. It is rather a reference to the main character, Christine McPherson, who for reasons best known to herself prefers to be known as ""Lady Bird"". Christine is a teenage schoolgirl at a Catholic high school in Sacramento, California. I have never been to that particular city, but in the film it is portrayed as one of America's main redoubts of dull, conformist, middle-class respectability.The supposed dullness of her home town is the main reason why Christine's great ambition is to attend a prestigious university in ""a city with culture"", preferably on the East Coast. This ambition brings her into conflict with her parents, who are in financial difficulties and would prefer her to study somewhere cheaper and more local. The film also deals with Christine's relationship with her best friend Julie, that with her boyfriend Danny (who turns out to be gay), her attempts to ingratiate herself with the school's ""in set"", epitomised by ""most popular girl"" Jenna and upper-class boy Kyle, with whom she has a brief affair. The film ends with an account of her early days at university.Films about suffering, dysfunctional American families have never really been my favourite genre. There have been some decent ones, such as Robert Redford's Oscar-winning ""Ordinary People"", but plenty of others which fall well short of this standard, ""Lymelife"" and ""The Lifeguard"" being two examples which stay in the mind for all the wrong reasons. Even that master of comedy, Woody Allen, fell flat on his face when he attempted a film of this type, ""September"" (aka ""I Wannabe Ingmar Bergman"").I have to admit, however, that ""Lady Bird"" is one of the better entries in the ""suffering families"" stakes. This is partly because the McPhersons are not completely dysfunctional; beneath all their squabbling and bickering there is a genuine reserve of affection and family feeling. There is, moreover, an excellent acting performance from Saoirse Ronan in the title role. For a twenty-something who has lived in Ireland from the age of three, Saoirse makes a very convincing Californian teenager. There are also good contributions from the supporting cast, especially Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts (did his parents want a girl?) as Christine's long-suffering parents. Writer-director Greta Gerwig's script is both humane and literate, creating some well-written, sympathetic characters, making this a very watchable film despite my scepticism about the genre to which it belongs. 7/10"
LADY BIRD,14 December 2017,9/10,"Writer-Director Greta Gerwig's 'Lady Bird' is a beautiful, beautiful film & is undoubtedly ""The Movie Of The Year"" for me. This sensitive, affecting & wholly satisfying coming-of-age story, is about relationships & aspirations. Gerwig, with her god-given talent, colors up the screen with humor & gut-wrenching honesty. After all, its a personal story!'Lady Bird' Synopsis: In the early 2000s, an artistically-inclined seventeen year-old (An Oscar Bound Saoirse Ronan) comes of age in Sacramento, California.'Lady Bird' works best when it focuses on the mother-daughter dynamic. So when the protagonist, who proudly addresses herself as Lady Bird, her mother (A Stellar Laurie Metcalf), gives her a reality check. The hardworking middle-class mother lives it up for her family in Sacramento, while daughter Lady Bird wishes to dream beyond her financial circumstances. Lady Bird believes in flying away from her restricted boundaries, while her Mother is practical & fighting everyday to keep her family as one. The dynamic & the extreme contrast of the mother-daughter is what makes 'Lady Bird' so special as well as affecting. No matter how much they disagree on, for whichever matter that may be, they are eventually there for each other. While it takes a while for Lady Bird to realize that, its pretty evident how the Mother always supports her. Its pure emotion & its executed with complete honesty.Gerwig deserves an Oscar for her work here. Her Screenplay is a work of beauty, while Her Direction, is understated & effective. Gerwig, a tremendous actress in her own right, shows us her powers as a storyteller with 'Lady Bird'. Please do her proud, Academy! The Globes made a blunder recently, which should be a topic of discussion at least for the time being, or more. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume Design, all contribute beautifully to the narrative & pay homage to Sacramento, with detail.Performance-Wise: Ronan & Metcalf are flat-out fabulous. Ronan, one of the bravest & most charming young talents working today, is priceless as Lady Bird, delivering a truly heartfelt performance, that is sure to connect with many a teens out there. Metcalf, on the other-hand, is magnificently restrained as the Mother with reality as her only option. Metcalf commands the screen & comes up with one of the years finest performances. Ronan & Metcalf, together, are a force to reckon with. Of the rest of the cast, Lucas Hedges & Timothée Chalamet leave a strong impression. Others too lend great support.On the whole, 'Lady Bird' is a Triumph! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
LADY BIRD,15 November 2017,,"""I wish I could live through something."" Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan)Nothing in the constantly funny and stunning coming-of-age film Lady Bird will surprise any audience. It's all been played before: conflict with mom, loving dad, high-school romances, gawky and hip girl friends, amateurish school play, agony about college admission, and nuns who restrain and nuns who nurture.She has indeed lived through ""something"" up to her waning adolescence, but as in the case of her hometown, Sacramento, she has to look back at it to see that she has lived there fully and uniquely. Right now, before graduation, the city is to her ""the Midwest of California."" The real difference from other growing-up stories is first-time solo writer/director Greta Gerwig and Saoirse Ronan (who plays Christine ""Lady Bird ""McPherson). Together they craft a lovable, flawed heroine with such a sense of herself and her future that she is unafraid to taste life in its entirety, blessed or broken. Forget Julia Stiles in 10 things I Hate About You. Bird is better.As in most films where a young girl is taught in a Catholic high school, the nuns are the looming moral force for restraint and also dream, embodied in the principal, Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), a realist who knows Lady Bird is a creative and independent spirit. So, too, in a different way is Lady Bird's mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf), whose tough love is constant, but whose love is there if only Lady Bird would see it. Mom's agony at the airport when Bird goes to college is as anguished a mom/daughter parting as you will ever see in a comedy.Moments of humor are plentiful and low key, e.g., when Sister Sarah's reality check with Lady Bird, ""Math is not your strength,"" is met with Bird's ""that we know of, yet."" While Mom's realism is minute by minute, Sister Joan gives hers out slowly with equal portions of quiet love.While actress Ronan has already tasted life from an adolescent heroine, Hannah, to a young adult in Brooklyn, Lady Bird could be seen as a retro acting gig. Bird is so strongly mature yet naïve that this role defines Ronan's wide-ranging ability. So, too, great Greta, a directorial/writing genius who should outstrip Woody Allen by the time he fully matures."
LADY BIRD,5 December 2017,10/10,"Everyone remembers their high school years and how for many it was about acceptance and the need to fit in and be liked and popular by the right crowd. And director Greta Gerwig shows this with this picture and what it's like for a young girl to grow up and come of age, while making memories and life and love is learned along the way. Yet ""Lady Bird"" is blended with laughs and feel good emotions of joy and tears that will make any watcher relate and feel like it's real to their own memories of high school.The story is set in early 2000's in California with Christine(AKA Lady Bird)McPherson(Saoirse Ronan) a young girl who's a little stubborn and lazy in book matters as she just doesn't apply herself in an educated manner. Her sights are set more on travel and seeing culture of arts and life on the east coast as she wants to go away to college in New York. Also Lady Bird wants to make more friends and be popular by being in the school play.Yet she's behind the 8 ball as her mom Marion(in a great turn from Laurie Metcalf) is over bearing and conservative and worries and challenges the thoughts of her daughter as she tries to shelter Lady Bird by sending her to a catholic school. Still Christine fights the system and wants adventures in other forms by exploring romance and you guessed it wanting to have sex and lose her virginity! Lady Bird is like many young girls as she wears sexy colored bras, and has sex and goes to the prom with the boy she enjoyed passion with and loves listening to her favorite band boy music(good to hear ""The Dave Matthews Band's"" ""Crash into Me"" from the late 90's early 2000's).Thru it all after graduation this little lady takes flight and spreads her wings to freedom and escape. Still thru the journey of experience and discovery Lady Bird is left with emotions of love and memories that will never be forgotten as time and growing pains help form her. Overall good film of learning life and having experience all while reflecting on how and why it makes one become who they are."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,8/10,"One year ago, no one on the earth could have foretold that the next female Oscar BEST DIRECTOR nominee would be Greta Gerwig (the fifth overall after Lina Wertmüller, Jane Campion, Sofia Coppola and Kathryn Bigeolow, the only winner), not even Ms. Gerwig herself, if I may presume, yet, miracle transpires in the form of LADY BIRD, Gerwig's solo feature directorial debut (previously she co-directed the Independent Spirt Awards nominated mumblecore NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS 2008 with Joe Swanberg), an effervescent coming-of-age story takes place in her hometown Sacramento.Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Ronan) is a senior student in a Catholic high school, the film roughly covers her last year before starting her tertiary education, ""Lady Bird"", a named given to her by herself, has a headstrong streak written in her genes, like gazillions of other pubescent spirits peopled around our globe, she revolts against her quibbling mother Marion (Metcalf), and at the same time, desperately seeks for the latter's validation, she wants her mother to like her (as a person), not just love her (because she is her daughter), a sagacious point poignantly reverberates with audience in its universality and intimacy, and the truth is, there are many such sensible touches populated in Gerwig's stimulating script, which can be partially accounted for LADY BIRD's runaway success, because empathy and amenity are like ambrosia, really as scarce as hen's teeth under the designation of ""chick flick"". Lady Bird embraces the ""me against the whole world"" scenario with brio and chutzpah, throwing back talk both at home and at school in order to snatch the evanescent one-upmanship, and makes erroneous choices in her romantic quests, both Danny (Hedges, unexpectedly versatile in projecting a tenderness that is contrarian to his braggadocious Oscar-nominated turn in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA 2016) and Kyle (Chalalmet, what a killjoy!) are anticlimactic episodes, the one with whom she attends the high school prom is actually her best friend Julie (Steffans), romance is transitory, but friends are for life, another lesson learned after her inept hobnobbing with the popular (yet vacuous) gal Jenna (Rush) in order to catch the attention of the cool boy Kyle. All in all, the most intense bond is of course, the familial one, on her pursuance of severing the umbilical cord, Lady Bird eventually comes to terms with her christened name, her modest, imperfect family, her benevolent and supportive father Larry (a heartwarming Letts) is laid off and has been combating depression for a long time; her double-shift engaged nurse mother Marion's constant nitpicking just mirrors her own apprehension that she couldn't help her daughter to become the best version of herself in spite of the fact that she has maxed herself out. TV and stage veteran Laurie Metcalf is given a rare opportunity to shine on the bigger screen to epitomizes an ordinary mother's broader spectrum of parenting angst and she kills it, not just in that tear-jerking car-roving moment.Time and again, Saoirse Ronan vanishingly conceals her ethnic traits and flawlessly transmogrifies herself as a flawed American teenager in this Bildungsroman, a fiery but sensitive, opinionated yet good-natured girl who only finds what home and family means when she finally flutters away on her own. Greta Gerwig's LADY BIRD is a rewarding, uplifting and funny passion project equipped with heart, brain and felicity, one simply hope these fantastic characters will be kept in Gerwig's next directorial outing, as we are compelled to wonder what will happen next to the extraordinary Lady Bird and her family."
LADY BIRD,9 February 2018,8/10,"This is a nice little comedy drama about a Catholic school girl who comes of age in Sacramento, California and aspires to study the arts in college in New York. We get to see a pretty captivating look at her high school days, from dealing with rebellious friends to uninteresting boyfriends. Also, her sometimes rocky relationship between her and her mom were emphasized in the movie, as well as her love/hate relationship with Sacramento - which both made the movie quite interesting. The girl was a brat though, and some of the things she had done and said were quite jaw-dropping. Too bad she didn't quite get reprimanded for that - it would have been quite the satisfying result. Being a Sacramentan myself, it's nice seeing the city serving as a backdrop for a motion picture, let alone a Best Picture Nominee. Seeing familiar Sacramento places on the big screen, from the State Capitol to the Tower Bridge, from the Crest Theatre to the Tower Theatre, and from Gunther's Ice-Cream to Sac International Airport was a real treat.Grade B"

The film was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote 'FARANCES HA' and 'MISTRESS America' (with director Noah Baumbach), which she also starred in. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tray Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timothee Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Stephen McKinley Henderson and Lois Smith. It's received unanimous rave reviews from critics so far, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well. I really enjoyed it. The story is set in Sacramento, over the school year of 2002 and 2003. It revolves around a senior named Christine McPherson (Ronan), who has changed her name to Lady Bird. Lady Bird struggles to get along with her overbearing mother (Metcalf), and she applies to multiple colleges outside of Sacramento, against her mother's wishes. She also struggles to get along with the other students at her school, and romantic relationships with boys her age are especially a challenge for her. The story concludes with Lady Bird going to college, and you'll have to watch it to see where she ends up going.The movie is a great coming-of-age tale, that seems to perfectly capture a time and place in a certain person's life. Ronan is awesome in the lead, and Gerwig definitely proves she's a talented filmmaker as well. The film is funny, sweet and it touches on a lot of important issues, I think, to a young person Lady Bird's age. The relationship depicted between her and her mother is also really touching at times too.

LADY BIRD,23 January 2018,5/10,"Allow myself to introduce myself. Bird. Lady Bird. Oh, don't forget the quotes to make it super kewl.There are many positives about this movie and not many negatives and yet, this movie seems overblown with the praise it has received. I absolutely love these quirky, coming of age, real life drama/comedies. But, maybe I've seen too many of them. Or, I've seen far too many better ones.Yes, this movie is honest and yeah, the drama feels totally real - not to mention some of the comedy is funny. The acting is fantastic, especially by the parents and ""Lady Bird,"" herself, very good. Plus, I loved, for once, they portrayed a Catholic School in a positive and progressive manner. But...Again, I've seen this all before. With much better and deeper dialogue and emotion. Juno might not have been the first, but it was the biggest modern eye-opener for this subgenre to me and I loved almost every aspect of that true and real story. (Plus it had 10x the soundtrack this one tried to have.)There's just not much story here, other than one girl's struggle with her struggling parents, her need for popularity and her yearning to get out of the West and meet the East. You won't get too many surprises in this story from maybe one or two scenes, but you will get less conflict than most family dramas and that was definitely comforting.Planning on leaving this movie a better person, or running to your nearest friend to highly recommend like most films that fit these highlights? Think again. But, simultaneously, you won't regret seeing it and will say it was good and worth seeing. Just...on home streaming. Absolutely not worth paying an admission/parking price for a movie theatre ticket.***Final thoughts: Before I go, I will give a huge kudos to one of my life-long favorites, Laurie Metcalf - the mother. Despite the movie's title and the world circling around the daughter, Lady Bird, it's the mother, or Metcalf, that completely steals the movie and if she wins Best Supporting Actress, I'm behind that vote. Heck, frankly, she could also be considered for Best Actress for this since she's in the majority of the feature. Just think, on the eve of the 2018 Oscar Noms, they'll just stick her in the ""Supporting"" role since the title targets her onscreen daughter. Shame. She definitely could've claimed the top Actress award. Easily."
LADY BIRD,3 October 2019,7/10,"For my girlfriend, and a lot of critics, Lady Bird is a powerful, deeply involving movie. For me it's a fairly interesting slice of life thing.This coming-of-age story focuses on Lady Bird, a high schooler with some ambitions, a fraught mother-daughter relationship, and iffy taste in boys. It is purposely small, a movie of finely observed details that captures the subtleties of life. Which is great if you like that sort of thing.Perhaps my underwhelmed reaction is because Lady Bird's life is so unreflective of my own. It is very much the story of a fairly normal high school life, with unfortunate relationships and shifting friendships and the like. My own high school life as a weirdo-loner was closer to what you'd get if there was a sequel to Welcome to the Dollhouse. So while my girlfriend saw her life writ large on the screen, I saw people who wouldn't have talked to in school having experiences I missed. And while I do have a fondness for high school movies that portray a sort of fun life I would have liked to live (i.e. The Breakfast Club), the ""real"" high school experience doesn't look all that appealing, although I would certainly have traded it for mine.Like Lady Bird, I grew up in Sacramento. I always hated the place, but my girlfriend loves it when we go out to visit my mom, so even there the movie clicked with her in a way it didn't with me.The film is sometimes touching and sometimes funny, and it does what it sets out to do very well. It's just not a movie I can love the way others do."
LADY BIRD,30 July 2019,9/10,"At seventeen, I dreaded that first puff thinking it would instantly turn me into an addict...
At seventeen, I was checking my height every day wishing for a growth spurt that never happened...
At seventeen, I wanted to lose ""it"" so badly I was losing my mind...
And don't get me started on the high school diploma...So many things we yearn for at seventeen that the resulting confusion and the impossibility to stay focused might be the age's defining trait, a volatility in spirit that befits the nickname of the heroine Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, played by Saoirse Ronan. More 'bird' than 'lady', she flickers from one ear who'd listen to a mouth who'd advise with one unshakable certitude in her mind: she wants to leave Sacramento, a city that became the epitome of static boredom.Indeed, if there's one thing we resent at seventeen: it's boredom, even nerds want to have fun ... at seventeen, we're all little birds who want to learn about flowers and bees. Now, being a teacher in a Catholic secondary school, handling kids from eleven to fifteen every day, I was wondering whether the film wasn't infantilizing teens much, guilty of a nostalgia-driven naivety, but in fact Lady Bird's immaturity says a lot about how things have changed since 2002, when teens weren't young adults but plain teens.In that palindrome of a year, the second after 1991, I turned 20. 1999 wasn't too far and at seventeen, I was wondering how I was going to celebrate the New Millennial. Eventually, I went with my best friend in a restaurant full of adults, I looked ridiculous with my white shirt and a black vest borrowed from my uncle, my buddy was a big stocky guy wearing a purple shirt and beige pants with side pockets, and boots, and as if it wasn't enough we had to wear cones... so we celebrated 2000 in a ""Superbad"" way and after that we went for a night walk in our equally boring hometown, I'll forever cherish even the lamest memories.Sorry for the digression but in a film where a girl can suddenly jump off a car, unpredictability shouldn't be a big deal. So I was saying kids would laugh today at Lady Bird and her impressionability when it comes to the things of s-e-x, but it's not about what the film shows but what it doesn't, even I was caught off guard. The environment looked so familiar that I forgot it was a time without social networks, when wireless phones were only used for communication, mail still meant paper and that went for adult magazines too (I plead guilty for that one) and the one shot on a computer is the father (Tracy Letts) playing solitaire.I love how subtle these indications are (though the references to September 11's aftermath get a bit repetitive), Greta Gerwig doesn't overuse the context but builds around it the emotional bonding between Christine and her world. With her strong personality, she would definitely be on Instagram today and posting videos where she rants about her Mom, I didn't notice how lucky we were to escape from that, we were immature in a time that allowed us to grow up. And ""Lady Bird"" is quite the coming-of-age story.And it's tricky to make a good coming-of-age story because you've got to draw an audience into liking a character who might not have anything to do with you, generation-wise.Here's another digression: coincidentally, the film I saw before was ""I Never Sang For my Father"", a movie made a decade before Gerwig would be born, but I found in the tense relationship between Gene Hackman and Melvyn Douglas some eerie parallels with the mother-and-daughter issues between Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, showing that some things just never change. Both films depicted that failure to communicate, the same obsession for the mother to keep her daughter close to her (the father didn't want his 40-year old son to remarry and go to California), it was out of protective instinct because parents know life better as the ones who make ends meet, so they don't allow children to make the same mistakes, they forget one thing, mistakes are part of the learning... that's the parents' mistake.There's a beautiful moment where Christine tries on new clothes for the prom and one thing leading to another, she asks her mother why can't she have a nice word for once, the mother tries to get away with a ""I love you"". But what follows is such an intelligent aversion of that cliché I daren't to spoil it, the film might be one of the best written of recent years, it doesn't try to sound ""hip"" all the time like ""Juno"" but unveils a real wisdom and acute knowledge of people's vulnerability, no one is to compliment or to blame, and Lady Bird isn't a pretentious nickname (nor the films is) but a pious hope.So many things have been said about Gerwig's nomination for directing but this has been diluted in a year of gender-driven polemics while the film flies over these considerations with the lightness of a hummingbird, and the writing didn't get the credit it deserved. The actors all excel but with such beautiful lines, you can't miss, I was impressed by how realistic and down-to-earth the film was, made by someone young enough to relate to Lady Bird and old enough to take some perspective and admit that parents weren't wrong.""Lady Bird"" follows a simple chronological storyline, filled with romantic subplots (Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet play the opposite love interests), interactions with friends (including Beanie Feldstein as the BFF) but just when the film swims in familiar waters, Gerwig avoid the usual traps: drugs, violence, social comments etc. and proves that the best way to keep an edge is not to try to be edgy all the time... this is a sweet movie whose ending resonated deeply in my Millennial heart."
LADY BIRD,26 February 2018,8/10,"The characters in 'Lady Bird (2017)' are all so fantastically realised (even those that have mere minutes of screen-time) that you could almost swear they were real, even though the piece is rooted firmly within the cinematic 'suspension-of-disbelief' scripted area as opposed to the ultra-realistic 'mumble-core' improvisational one. It really is this keen focus on its core players, via its phenomenal script and superb performances, that allows it to be so believable and compelling, despite the fact that it is seemingly about the totally mundane. It seems as though you are just watching the life of this young woman and yet is totally captivating, a charming look into the extremely honest trials and tribulations of a person trying their best to find out where they fit in this world, and it feels like one of the most 'down-to-earth' in its genre whilst also being one of the most endearing and best written to boot. It's mature, intelligent film-making that still knows how to be fun; a wonderful, uplifting experience. 8/10"
LADY BIRD,19 November 2017,9/10,"Sometimes a film doesn't need to involve an elaborate plot or characters. Sometime a film does perfectly fine by showing regular people in regular situations. Lady Bird deals with a young woman, who happens to prefer to be called Lady Bird, as she goes through her senior year of high school, applying to colleges, and doing what girls do at that age. Saoirse Ronan plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, who is a rebellious and eccentric young woman who wants anything but staying home in Sacramento for life beyond high school.The film moves at a rapid pace and for a good chunk of the film you don't really know the direction the film is taking. ""So what is really the point?"" is the question I continued to ask myself. But in reality, the answer was right in front of me. This film is about a mother and a daughter, the trials and tribulations they go through, but how they ultimately realize the love they have for each other is mutual though constantly tested. And even though this film is certainly a comic of age story, it by no means is your typical romantic coming of age where boy meets girl or vice versa.This film is a coming of age story of a mother and daughter. Both tremendously played by Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan respectively. What I found so compelling is that as weird as Lady Bird can be in her approach to life, it's still written in a way that is relatable to the average person. In fact, I can't say that I know first hand what that relationship is like, being a guy, but there's something so special about the way these two people rip each other apart but are aware of the meaning of each other's presence in their lives. Writer-director Greta Gerwig does such a beautiful job of presenting this scenario in several scenes throughout the film. And really, I shouldn't expect anything less from her with the particular choices she has made with acting in the last decade or so.From Gerwig's fast moving script, to the bold choices made by Metcalf and Ronan, to the strangeness of Lady Bird's character, all the way to the heart breaking moments towards the end, Lady Bird is easily one of my favorite films of the year. There are a few subtle lines and scenes near the ending that I won't forget and are some of the more powerful things I have seen/heard in a film this year. Major props all around. I love Lady Bird.9.5/10"
LADY BIRD,22 November 2017,,"It's hard to know what to say about Lady Bird. Currently it sits at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes with about 150 reviews, which is a testament to how truly likable the film is. It would be hard to see many people disliking this, if any. Despite its acclaim, it's a relatively simple coming-of-age film. We've seen many like this, and while there are many good, even great ones, Lady Bird is one that truly captures the difficulty of growing up and the gratitude that sometimes escapes us about the sacrifices others have made for us. It's simple, but a film with a lot on its mind, and it translates to the screen incredibly well. Both Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf deliver some truly powerful, genuine, authentic work, and I really hope both are able to get Oscar nominations for their work here."
LADY BIRD,27 July 2020,8/10,"Such a lovely, touching film. It travels through a period of life much covered in cinema, the final year of high school, but it does so with great style and its own unique voice. The performances are excellent, it has a sharp script, and Greta Gerwig's direction is brilliant. I loved how the Catholic school wasn't reduced to clichés and how developed these characters were. Argh, so many people carry around secret pain in this film, and while at times there is a lot of bluntness in the mean remarks (especially between mother and daughter, my god), there is also a lot that is buried and left unsaid. When the powerhouse moments come, like the title character telling her friend she won't reveal his secret, they are full of emotion, but Gerwig wisely doesn't overplay them. Gradually we see the real theme, which is to appreciate what you have around you in life - your children, parents, true friends, and your hometown, even if it is ""the Midwest of California."""
LADY BIRD,16 March 2018,,"Exuding passion, affection & honesty throughout, Greta Gerwig's solo directorial debut is a labour of love that's heartfelt, nostalgic, whimsical, amusing & above all, genuine. Crafted with care, told with sincerity & radiating a sense of warmth from the first frame to the last, Lady Bird is an amalgamation of everything that one would imagine Greta Gerwig to be.A dream start to Greta Gerwig's filmmaking journey, Lady Bird is a cinematic equivalent of joy that's as lively, friendly, cheerful, jubilant, gleeful, lighthearted, adventurous & vivacious as its creator. Commencing a new chapter in Gerwig's life on the best possible note with a promise of greater things to come, Lady Bird is definitely worth a shot."
LADY BIRD,28 December 2018,8/10,"Even though I was never a rebellious teenage girl at a catholic school in Sacramento, I still found myself relating to this quirky movie. Lady Bird captures the essence of what it's like to be a teenager. And while Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf really shine, each cast member adds something to the film. There's a lot to love about Lady Bird."
LADY BIRD,27 August 2021,6/10,"The plot was interesting, but it was a bit of an exaggerated movie. Acting was good though."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,8/10,"Lady BirdThe best thing about Catholic school is that it accepts pregnant virgins as students.However, it'll be awhile before the pupil in this dramedy even gets a miraculous kiss.Quirky Catholic high school senior Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) struggles to find her place amongst her straight-laced peers as she waits to live out her Ivy League College fantasy far away from her overbearing mother (Laurie Metcalf). It's not until she joins the school play that she finds her calling, and her new boyfriend.But her affluent new friends begin to affect how Ladybird perceives her status, her family and her old friends.Although it comes with all the angst, awkwardness and senseless rebellion you'd expect, it's the hilarious and touching mother-daughter dynamic that elevates writer/director Greta Gerwig's vision, and sets it apart from your standard coming-of-age account.Moreover, teenage girls hate their mothers up until they need them to babysit.

LADY BIRD,5 July 2018,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.The best 3 words that describes ""Lady Bird"" (2017) are: charming, real and amazing. What a great and ""not by a book"" coming of age story it is. Script and acting in this movie were simply brilliant. Saoirse Ronan gave one breathtaking performance. Script by writer and director Greta Gerwig was simply terrific - this kinda simple story glued me to the screen for the whole 1 h 35 min - watching this gem time flies in a sec.Overall, while the story of ""Lady Bird"" itself isn't nothing new or original, powerhouse acting and mesmerizing script carries this movie to the heights. Great, funny, warm and amazing movie."
LADY BIRD,14 October 2018,6/10,"""Some people aren't built happy, you know.""Why is this film nominated for five Oscars is really a mystery clear to me. ""Lady Bid"" is quite an ordinary story about a pretty much ordinary life of a very ordinary teenager. It could have been about mostly anyone. None of the characters and none of the events stand out from the average everyday life of an average middle-class member. They could literally take the camera and choose an accidental passer-by and record a few days of his life. The story does not bring absolutely nothing original nor interesting, and the characters are totally clichéd. A teenage girl, who thinks that nobody understands her, has a great relationship with one of her parents and is in constant war with another one. Adopted brother is a different race, a fat girl is a good person and a true friend, a beautiful rich girl is empty and shallow. She falls in love with a handsome guy who turns out to be gay and then loses virginity by being sexually exploited by an arrogant boy who has a band. In the era of forcing political correctness and tolerance, they tried to respect gender-racial-economic-sexual diversity, but essentially failed in the character development and writing of a story that would have some point. Technically speaking, I have no objections. The acting is great, camera, directing, music, everything is in place. But the movie is pointless. It is not dramatic, it is not funny, not scary, it's not exciting, it's not a damn thing. There are films that ignore the essence to enchant us with form, there are those who ignore the form by concentrating solely on the essence. The best are those that have both the form and substance at a high level. This movie will not impress you with either. The little essence I have found in it has been seen countless times, and often in a much more impressive form. And yet, I was not bored, because it is easy to identify with the main character, and the actress and her performance are very appealing. All in all, if you see it you will not regret it, and if you skip it you won't miss much.6/10"
LADY BIRD,27 January 2019,9/10,"Golden Globe winner Saoirse Ronan for her performance in Ladybird, Ronan is able to capture the emotive and playful, wrenching, and gripping nature of a screenplay that offers a truly stunning coming of age drama. Lady winner of Golden Globe best director, without overly dramatizing the typical adolescent angst, this movie incorporates the multi-dimensional experience of mother-daughter relationships, friendship, the evolving sharp wit and adolescent dream of independence and ferocious highs and lows of the developing mind. With great pacing, dialogue, and relational performances, Ladybird exudes a truly captivating fusion of events during an eventful year in the life of a female teenager, from religious questioning and scandalous behavior to a reckoning of real life and consequences this movie is parents, about community, and about an American dream."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2020,7/10,"Diehard fans of this coming to age teen angst motion picture written & directed by Greta Gerwig will indeed give me the bird; but they can't deny that this loosely semi-autobiographical fictional version of the director time in Christian high school has a lot of clichés & standard tropes and archetypes that are very common in other high school genre films. For example, the sequences where Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) get a makeover and ditch her nerdy friends to join the popular crowd, only to find out that they were awful people before reconciling with her original friends is something seen a lot, especially in comedies like 1987 'Can't Buy me Love' & 2004's 'Mean Girls' which this movie surprising mirrors a lot. Not really Best Original Screenplay material. Regardless of that, I did like how writer Greta choose 1934 George S. Kaufman & Moss Hart's Broadway production 'Merrily We Roll Along' as the school stage performance as the plot of that play details young friends who gradually drift apart when one of them became obsessed with being popular. It's a great use of foreshadowing. To add onto that, it was also a nice touch to see Julie Steffans (Beanie Feldstein), the best friend that Lady Bird dumps plays Mary the character in the play where the main character abandons. Nevertheless, the film continues to fall into recycled common threads such as the uber large unrealistic full of booze party at a rich person's house with no adult supervision and everybody trying to lose their virginity in every room cliché. That also has been done to death. Yet the biggest similarities of this film to others has to be 2012's drama 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' with the way the pacing of that movie highlights major events of the high school year. While Stephen Chbosky's film has a clear path direction in what sequences they wanted to show. Greta's movie is surprising all over the place with moments of Ladybird dealing with her parent's financial struggles, making friends and even life post high school. While this large range might make the film seem more well verse; there is a lot of things that the film tackles that has no pay off or resolution such as supporting characters struggles with suicidal thoughts, cancer and coming out gay. We never really get any full details what happen to them. Even the idea of having the settling take place in a strict Christian institution in Sacramento during the beginning of the 2003 Iraq War doesn't really come into play that much. No signs of Islamophobia toward Muslims Americans. No debate if the war was just cause or not. Not even a mention of side characters wanting to join the military for patriotism reasons or protesting against it. The movie doesn't even talk about the insane couther culture of California that much despite having the quote from author Joan Didion in the beginning. Nor why Christine choose the nick name 'Lady Bird'. A metaphor meaning should been mention. After all, it could had represented the complain that spending more money on questionable just international conflicts like the Iraq War does indeed choked off services better suite to fight the war on poverty. Similar in the way people argue that Vietnam War cause harm President Lyndon B Johnson's 'Great Society' in the 1960s. There is a lot of comparisons between then president George W. Bush's action with that of LBJ. Sadly, none of this is explored. It's clearly no 1968's 'Slouching Towards Bethlehem'. Instead the film had a small discussion about abortion which doesn't really led much to anything. It is mention but never really explored. After all, I'm still wondering by the end of the film how she was able to come back to school after the whole pro-life/pro-choice quarrel suspension. Then there are pointless redundant scenes where arguments randomly break out and quickly disappears as soon as they came. Did we really need the forced drama for the sake of loud yelling in the clothing store? The opening and give me a number sequence were good enough. Honestly a lot of these small conflicts with her strong-willed mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) really felt like mindless futile first world problems filler for the movie to reach a one hour and 34 minutes. Some of the drama was really avoidable. Regardless of the fact that their characters can come across as somewhat self-centered, nasty and temperamental at times. Both Metcalf & Ronan give out a really good overall performance that highlight how very complex, misunderstood, and flawed their characters really are. It made the time comprehending their feelings worth investing. After all, they're not quite annoying awful people. Both actresses deserve their Academy Award nominations. Ronan's Irish accent is barely noticeable. As for the supporting cast, they were equally as impressive despite their limited screen time. As for the comedy. The humor was mostly a miss than a hit with me. The cinematography was shot well, but not as special as people make it out to be. In the end; the film is pretty average for a best picture nomination movie. No wonder why it didn't win any Academy Awards. Still I'm glad it wasn't a mumblecore like movie. Things honestly get done in this film. I really hope that Gerwig does indeed make a spiritual successor to this movie modeled on the Neapolitan Novels of Elena Ferrante. That will be very interesting. Overall: Lots of poignant, even tragic moments mixed with all the ridiculousness of youth but clearly not the best I seen from Gerwig and Ronan's work. 2019 motion picture 'Little Women' is much better. Regardless it's still an entertaining movie. It just didn't soar high with me."
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,9/10,"It's surprising to learn that Lady Bird is a debut feature. Armed with a commonplace story but written with complete conviction and contemplation of the characters, writer-director Great Gerwig transcends all her past work with one short reel of 90 minutes. The supremely talented Saoirse Ronan plays 'Lady Bird', a school-going teenager at the height of adolescence. At first look, it seems like a boring rehash of that 2014 Richard Linklater film, but enter 15 minutes into the screenplay, and you will find your hands over your face with spread fingers trying to consume but not fully consume the idiosyncrasies of this lady as she communicates with her family and friends with a touch of awkwardness. Lady Bird is a refreshingly pleasant film that is driven by its imaginative dialogues between characters, a strong and relevant soundtrack, and most importantly, the performance of its cast. Ronan is effortless, but for me, it is Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts who take the pie. The former is always seen in a scrub, indicative of the fact that she is always on character. I almost thought that Metcalf was playing life, and makes me wonder if she has issues with her real-life daughter. Letts is this passive person who impresses you with his subtlety. But, more than him, it is Timothée Chalamet who comes out of the ring and wins you over in terms of subtlety. There is surely this charm about the actor which makes him instantly likable regardless of his character's shady shades. It can be difficult to add all this characterization and dialogues in a film that competes with the speed of light, but Lady Bird never falls short and manages to convey what it had in mind since the start. Equally funny and dramatic, it is one of the most fun films I have seen all year, and I can't even contain the happiness of seeing David Wallace here. (Looks like he sold Dunder Mifflin. LOL.) Lady Bird is fantastic. no doubt. TN."
LADY BIRD,30 December 2017,8/10,"This was a surprise,of a film that i will characterise as ''a girls movie''-with lots of family issues,friendbattles,strange love relationships,religion,virginity,sex,humour,warmth,and most of all a well deserved happy ending.
it is also a film about school and education,economics of scolarships etc. not being too familiar to u.s education system,i can surtainly understand that choice and abilities are as important as breathing for the average american youth.
the one who runs this flagship of a film,ms ronan,which i saw in the film''brooklyn'',makes a smashing performance.. there were at least 4 occations that took me so by surprise that i nearly started crying,of her grief,and happiness,and great immersion. she reminds me a bit of kate winslet,with a very clear sounded voice and dictation,important for a tinitusius viewer.
i can understand that some might find the pace in the movie a bit slow,but that was washed away by the connection it made to my own youth experiences.directors choice of locations are excellent,and very nice editing and musical score."
LADY BIRD,4 February 2018,,"""Lady Bird"" is the sort of films that you enjoy with breezy ease sitting in the cinema. That, you can say about a lot of other movies. But it is among a very few that you will think about afterwards, again and again. Some of those ""very few"" you think about with a heavy heart, even pain. Not so for ""Lady Bird"", which you think back on with a warm smile on your face, as if savoring the aroma after a delightful cup of coffee. That's what makes this film unique. The subject matter is more than familiar, and can be described with off-hand phrases like ""been there; done that"", ""coming of age"", ""slice of life"" etc. etc. There is no argument that LB is all of that. The plotline, if there is one, is about how in the high school year 2002-3, an ordinary 17-year-old girl in Sacramento lives her life, ponders her future and, forgive the old cliché, trying to find her own identity. What makes this film so special is writer and director Greta Gerwig (I have not forgotten Saoirse Ronan who won Best Actress, Musical or Comedy in Golden Globe; bear with me), a native of Sacramento and at about the same age of the protagonist at the time of the story. What she brings to the film is intimacy, affection and attention no one else is likely able to. 
 
Christine McPherson calls herself ""Lady Bird', officially, a name ""given to me, by me"", to assert her individuality. As if holding us by the hand, she takes us through the ""I am seventeen going on eighteen"" journey as we see her grow right before our eyes. I am not going into the details. There is nothing that you have not seem before. But what a marvelous journey offered by Gerwig, the fifth woman ever nominated for best director by Oscar, in recognition of this exquisite piece of work. But, as I said, I have not forgotten Saoirse Ronan. Since ""Atonement"" (2007) when she dazzled Hollywood with her portrayal of 13-year-old Briony Tallis, Ronan has been marked as going places. A Golden Globe a decade later is by no mean too late as Hollywood is entirely free from discrimination, in age, I mean. Here in LB, her performance is flawless. It is no accident that two of the most prominent film critics have used the word ""precision"" to describe it.Nominated for Oscar Best Supporting Actress is Laurie Metcalf playing her mother. The interaction between this pair of strong-willed mother-and-daughter, based ultimately on love, is something to behold. The two young men who play LB's two successive crushes are also Oscar caliber. One is last year's nominee of Best Support from ""Manchester by the sea"", Lucas Hedges (who also has a relatively minor role in this year's strong Oscar contender ""The billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri""). The other, Timothee Chalamet, is nominated for Best Actor for ""Call me by your name"" in this year's Oscar. The rest of the support cast is uniformly strong, completing the community of people surrounding and interacting with LB: a ""good guy"" of a father, two siblings, the best friend, the principle of the Catholic high school, and a few more.""Lady Bird"" has 5 Oscar nominations, all heavy-weights: are Picture, Lead Actress, Directing, Original Screenplay and Supporting Actress. And this is the only time I recall a film review in a prominent media using the word ""perfect""."
LADY BIRD,16 June 2018,5/10,"Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf were both excellent and convincing in their respective roles. The film depicts so well how passionate, adventurous and high-spirited young people are, with so many dreams to fulfill. Despite it being a very good film, I did find it to be a talkie, though, and I'm not really into talkies, or dramas for that matter, as I generally find them too slow moving. This was no exception."
LADY BIRD,1 May 2020,6/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a seventeen years old girl life from school and her relationships to her family and her friends.Despite that I did not have high hopes from this movie I was really surprised since it's a nice movie. I liked it because its plot was very interesting and through the whole duration of it something was happening without have any filler scenes. I have to say that the interpretation of Saoirse Ronan who played as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson was simply outstanding and I really liked it. Some other very good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tracy Letts' who played as Larry McPherson, Laurie Metcalf's who played as Marion McPherson and Timothée Chalamet's who played as Kyle Scheible. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is really worth watching it and I am sure that you will like it."
LADY BIRD,2 May 2018,7/10,"At first glance, this second feature from actor-turned-writer/director Greta Gerwig appears to be yet another quirky and twee little indie feature which made the cut as the obligatory low-budget entry into the Best Picture category at this year's Academy Awards. Yet Gerwig wasn't brought in by Noah Baumbach to co-write Frances Ha and Mistress America for nothing. She has a unique voice, and a keen eye for the smaller moments in life that most people didn't realise they had forgotten or missed. Lady Bird is riotously funny, incredibly relatable (for both sexes), and features two incredible lead performances. It's also profoundly authentic, and will have many female viewers (and some male) squirming in their seats as their own awkward memories of adolescence come pouring back.It's 2002, and Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is an artistically-inclined teenager on the verge of leaving her Catholic high school and fleeing her home of Sacramento to attend college. She longs to be different and stand out from the crowd, opting to go by the nickname of 'Lady Bird' and dressing in a grungy, non-conformist way. She shares a relaxed relationship with her depressed father Larry (Tracy Letts), but struggles to communicate with her ball-busting but well-meaning mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf). The film covers her final days of school and her struggles to find her identity. Best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) is always there for her, but Lady Bird is more interested in pursuing her burgeoning sexuality and trying to fit in with the cool, richer kids. All the disappointments of teenage life await her, but she firmly believes that life will only truly start once she escapes her childhood home.The focus is primarily on Lady Bird's concerns, but this is also a story of a young girl struggling to communicate with her mother. Marion does all she can to help her daughter find the best life for herself, such as working long shifts at the hospital and maintaining a steady routine at home, but she is also burdened with unrealistic expectations and emotionally scarred by her own abusive childhood. Their relationship is summed up in the opening scene, as Lady Bird opts to jump out of a moving vehicle and break her arm rather than listening to her mother voice an opinion. The dynamic forms the film's backbone, and their quick-tempered back-and-forths will be familiar to many. Both Ronan and Metcalf are outstanding in their roles, finding sympathy for their characters when they are at their most flawed and unreasonable. Gerwig finds the perfect balance between light and dark, taking the edge off when events get a little too familiar with some beautifully-timed comedy. Lady Bird will no doubt launch Gerwig onto bigger and better things.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
LADY BIRD,9 December 2017,10/10,"Lady Bird (2017) was written and directed by Greta Gerwig. It's a coming-of-age story about Christine McPherson, portrayed by Saoirse Ronan. Christine hates her name so much that she insists that everyone call her Lady Bird. (She's not kidding. She means it.)We follow Lady Bird through her senior year of high school in Sacramento. Although Sacramento is the state capitol, it's really California's ""fourth city,"" after Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. Lady Bird has a love/hate relationship with Sacramento. She recognizes its beauty, but she really wants to get out of it. Lady Bird lives ""on the wrong side of the tracks,"" as she says. I had to smile when I saw her home--many people would love to live in that house. However, her parents expected a different career trajectory when they were young, and they were unable to stay on that trajectory. This was their starter house, but it's still their house.Lady Bird's mother loves her, but she's obviously compulsive, and she never let's up. Laurie Metcalf portrays the mother perfectly. There's another actress who really hits the mark--Beanie Feldstein, as Julie Steffans, Lady Bird's (sometimes) best friend.This is a movie that you don't want to miss. Saoirse Ronan is a brilliant young actor, and director Gerwig know to bring these skills onto the screen.We saw Lady Bird at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. However, it will work as well on the small screen. Lady Bird has a remarkable IMDb rating of 8.5. It's a pleasure to see a film this good getting the recognition it deserves."
LADY BIRD,7 April 2018,4/10,"Saoirse Ronan is always a pleasure to watch and it is imo only her presence that makes that movie slightly interesting. If I compare Lady Bird with e.g. Girl, Interrupted (Winona Ryder) the coming of age theme is very conventional presented (Girl, Interrupted embeds or mixes the themes of mental illness and coming of age) and well, in Lady Bird almost nothing happens. Even the dialogues are boring and many times cliche. Where all the praise come from I really cannot understand - without Saoirse Ronan nobody would mention that movie or call it a ""masterpiece"". Lady Bird is imo not a strong comedy nor a strong drama. Only for fans of Saoirse Ronan recommendable and/or adolescents who feel ""misunderstood"" and strained by the rest of the world."
LADY BIRD,26 February 2018,8/10,"""Another one? Seriously. Will these ever stop?"" is probably what you are thinking. The answer is simple, the process of coming-of-age is relatable. A relatable story is one that viewers will warm to. Lady Bird is no different. It packs heart, plenty of character and subtle witty humour. A young girl, who titles herself ""Lady Bird"", is brought up in a catholic school and is at the stage of moving onto college. As with other synonymous films of this sub-genre, our teenage protagonist experiences their first love, family conflict and identity crisis. All part of the long process of growing up. This is nothing new, you may find its unoriginality to be a flaw but if it isn't broke...don't fix it. Also the short runtime results in a despondent narrative due to the amount of content being rammed into it. Despite the meaty plot, Lady Bird just works. So simple, yet incredibly effective. Addressing problematic themes of religious upbringing, materialism, guilt, wealth and the all important identity crisis when being a teenager. Gerwig may not be the most experienced director, but she definitely puts herself on the Hollywood map now. Nothing too fancy, a few quirks here and there but her reliance of the static camera position allows the actors to own the screen. She enables them to bring out the characters by simply giving them the whole screen. They are fundamentally the vital aspect. The characters themselves are fully realised and developed quite nicely, none of the events felt forced or coincidental and so the natural progression, particularly for Lady Bird and her mother, was presented efficiently. Ronan and Metcalf had a luminous chemistry together that felt both loving and prickly simultaneously. Hedges and Chalamet provided decent supporting roles also. I honestly don't have much else to say, if you've seen any coming-of-age film before then, really, you've seen this as well. Its formulaic approach is a small detriment to an incredibly acted, directed and written drama that will provide smiles all round."
LADY BIRD,20 December 2017,10/10,"""Don't you think they're the same thing? Love...and attention?"" This is one of the countless wonderful lines in Gerwig's stunningly beautiful directorial debut Lady Bird, and it happens to perfectly encapsulate my feelings for the movie itself. A concise and encompassing capture of a high schoolers senior year, I consistently found it to be completely lovable...and at worst, comfortably enveloping. With a unique rhythm of ultra-authentic and calm-yet-rapid-fire rhythm, it's a near-perfect vision that soars at every angsty turn.
Like a lower-middle class Clueless, Lady Bird is the story of a teenage girl learning how to balance school, friends, work, college applications, boys, and family. But unlike Clueless, she doesn't benefit from trust-fund parents who can pay for her every whim. Ronan is great at the center of this world, both in the film and in her own head. However, Metcalf is the gem, playing the loving but familiarly flawed mom with an exactness and perfection rarely seen. These two strong women, and the surrounding cast, carry the entertaining and thoughtful dialogue beautifully (""Just because something looks ugly doesn't mean it's morally wrong""; ""Different things can be sad...it's not all war!""; ""You're not gonna get in a car with a guy that honks, are ya?).
Most impressive is how it so perfectly captures time: both the early 2000s era, and that specific time between childhood and adulthood. I, for one, painfully recognize myself in Lady Bird; the forced quirks, a desperation to be liked, overwhelming self-awareness, a longing to rebel against a desire to please parents. Unfortunately, our lives are rarely this funny, this moving or even this honest."
LADY BIRD,21 November 2017,9/10,"Coming-of-age films from green, independent filmmakers have a tendency to hit their mark at a surprisingly higher rather than other stories, but something about Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" feels more like a bull's-eye. Her semi-autobiographical snapshot of a high school senior exploring her identity has an assured wit and a firm grasp on the emotional truth of that life stage.Even though she's playing someone close to her age, Saoirse Ronan continues to display a dazzling versatility as Lady Bird/Christine, a young woman at a Catholic private school who dreams of escaping her native Sacramento to attend a college or university on the East Coast. Consequently, she rejects the pragmatism of her middle-class, blue-collar parents (Tony winners Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts), namely her well-intentioned but admittedly cold mother. Determined not to let anyone put her in a box, Lady Bird subconsciously turns her senior year into an experiment in self-discovery, hoping to fashion an identity that suits her and the vision she has for her life.Gerwig's script is not guided by plot so much as story lines that emerge and drift away, some of which are fleeting and some of which run throughout the course of the film. In addition to college acceptance, there's her foray into drama club, a couple romantic interests and her ongoing challenges with her mother. The film comes together with brilliant editing, especially the moments of comedy. With the help of editor Nick Houy, Gerwig demonstrates uncanny comedic timing in the way she constructs scenes. ""Lady Bird"" earns and accumulates laughs early and effortlessly, and so much of the force behind the humor comes from quick, well-timed edits. Also, her cast is clearly having a blast making this movie and she makes sure the camera is there to capture the funniest, most authentic moments.The editing also plays into the dramatic elements as well. Gerwig has incredible belief in the viewer to connect the dots and intuit the emotional consequences of the bigger moments in the story. The film's first big moment of melodrama, in which Lady Bird makes a startling discovery in the bathroom, jumps immediately to some several minutes or hours later, when she and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) have an emotional moment to Dave Matthews Band's ""Crash Into Me."" Most films would've resorted to melodrama and really stewed in these moments; Gerwig keeps her film moving.it's amazing what she fits into 94 minutes. The mileage she gets out of each scene and the moments she includes in this story is a lot of what sets ""Lady Bird"" apart. She's able to trim all the fat because the meat of the story is so substantial. Every interaction, every character brings something to the table and exhibits this universal truth that there's a side to everyone that isn't visible in how they appear and behave, a lesson Lady Bird badly needs to learn. The most tender and sensitive example is in the mother-daughter relationship that in many ways is the central dynamic of the film. Lady Bird and Marion represent the clash of idealism and pragmatism that are so often at the core of teen-parent discord and the scenes they have together perfectly encapsulate that tension, but also the love and bond. Metcalf's performance captures all the love and devotion and the stubbornness and frustration that makes her both the ""villain"" of the film and the one you sympathize with. Marion and Lady Bird are so authentically realized in the writing and in the performances that it's almost like being able to step back and objectively look at your own parent-child relationship.Although most audiences won't quite relate to the film's ""love letter to Sacramento"" aspects, dreaming beyond or feeling attached to where you grew up is still a universal sentiment, one that Gerwig handles with care because in so many ways that push-and-pull embodies a lot of the wrestling that ""Lady Bird"" does on the more micro level with its characters. So many films touch on this aspect of growing up, but ""Lady Bird"" makes and arrives at these critical points with the kind of authenticity and thoughtful, intentioned writing that the film feels as though it's a collection of someone's actual lived experiences and relationships. Gerwig's voice and Ronan's performance meld into one truthful story that hits all the funniest and most sincere notes without lapsing to clichés and conventions, a truly special feat of filmmaking from a first-time director.~Steven CThanks for reading!

LADY BIRD,21 December 2018,8/10,"Lovely feel good story which made me choke up a few times fighting the tears, but in the end the over all mood of ""Ladybird"" is really an allout feel good one. The story is about the struggle between a strictly catholic raised teenage daughter and her coldhearted mom. I think it is impressive that the director was able to create a story which made me long back with joy to that dreaded teenage period. Everybody struggles through it and this struggle is captured with so much fuzzy warm details and with such a blissful mood that ""Ladybird"" feels like a small wounded bird that you must protect from dying. And that is exactly the attitude the coldhearted mom has when she is raising her child, trying to protect her from every kind of misfortune to a degree where the protectiveness becomes damaging by itself.It could have been a more hardhitting quirky story, but every slightly darker emotion was always drawn neatly between the lines. It isnt a Disney kind of fairytale about growing up, no way, but every darker emotion only gets attention for a few moments and then it is on to the next happy go lucky scene. It has somewhat of a constant cheery, superficial feel to it, not really going too deep, when it could have chosen to do so. That's my only small criticism. I dont think it is worthy of an oscar, but it is definitely a warm and fuzzy feel good coming of age tale, which I would like to see more often then just this once."
LADY BIRD,8 March 2018,5/10,"I didn't really like it. I feel the urge to put at the start of this review, to get it out of the way. Why, is a harder question to answer. The performances are good, particularly from Saoirse Ronan as the titular character and Laurie Metcalf, as her suffering mother. The film makes Sacramento look appealing and even romantic, even if Lady Bird herself is dismissive of the town's charm. Everything apart from the Lady Bird herself feels very believable and genuine... from the beats of a mother / daughter relationship, the ""world building"" around the supporting actors to the natural look with makeup and costumes. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd seen it all before, like it was following a well worn ""quirky Indie film"" template and I'm not sure, by the end of it, I really knew what it was all about. I felt like the themes wanted to be too appreciate the life, family and town you have, because the grass isn't always greener, but nothing happened to Lady bird in New York to really justify that sort of revelation. I understand the reasons for the Oscar buzz that surrounded ""Lady Bird"" but I can't see it being in the public consciousness in a few months time."
LADY BIRD,22 November 2017,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" (2017 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Christine McPherson, a/k/a Lady Bird, ""my given name since I gave to name to myself"". As the movie opens, Lady Bird and her mom are driving back to Sacramento as they are listening to an audio tape of Grapes of Wrath. Lady Bird laments ""I wish I could live through something"" and then lets herself fall out of the car, breaking her wrist along the way. Now in a cast, we get to know Lady Bird's daily life as she enters her senior year in high school at the all-girls Immaculate Heart of Maria. Lady Bird also has to deal with her overbearing mom. It all makes her want to go to college on the East Coast... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of noted actress and writer Greta Gerwig (Frances Ha, Mistress American, Maggie's Plan, and most recently sensational in 20th Century Women). Here Gerwig writes about something very familiar to her, as she grew up in Sacramento (but she refuses to call the film auto-biographical): the struggles of a teenager on the cusp of the liberating (?) years of going to college and setting out a life's journey more within her control. Even though the movie is just an hour and a half, it is jam-packed with non-stop plot developments, but the over-arching theme is clear. While billed as a comedy-drama, the movie is more drama than comedy, indeed the movie is bitter-sweet, but in the end more sweet than bitter. Gerwig provides outstanding direction to her two lead performers, Irish actress Saoirse Ronan (as Lady Bird) and Lauren Metcalf (as her tough-love mother). I can't help but feel that the movie is also Gerwig's love letter to her home town of Sacramento (a place I've never visited myself), making it look very warm and inviting. Bottom line: ""Lady Bird"" is a wonderful 'little' movie, and in that sense the complete opposite (and perfect counter- programming) for yet the latest salvo of superhero action movies from DC Comics (""Justice League"") and Marvel Comics (""Thor Ragnarok""). To each their own, but I'll take ""Lady Bird"" any day.""Lady Bird"" received immediate critical acclaim upon its premiere at the Telluride Film Festival earlier this Fall, and surely will be receiving a number of Oscar nominations early next year. The movie went wide this past weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (exactly 4 people, including myself), but positive word of mouth will hopefully boost better attendance in the days and weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a character study that will feel very familiar to many of us, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Lady Bird"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
LADY BIRD,11 November 2017,8/10,"I remembered Greta Gerwig from ""Frances Ha"" which I didn't really care for so I was more than surprised to discover that not only can she direct (as evidenced by her efforts here with Lady Bird) but is a talented screenwriter as well (yes, she also wrote the screenplay!). Her story is set in (of all places), Sacramento, and stars the consistently strong Irish-American actor Saoirse Ronan as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, an off-beat adolescent in her senior year at a local parochial school, hoping to get accepted by a good school on the east coast (as opposed to a state university which her parents can afford).Christine calls herself ""Lady Bird"" in order to stand out from her peers, and her mother Marion (played by Laurie Metcalf in a potential Oscar-winning performance) can't get used to the new appellation. The conflict between the two is the highlight of the film, as Christine's mother is hard on her daughter at almost every turn, wanting the best for her but insisting on good behavior. Christine, on the other hand, resents her mother's interference in her life and consequently struggles with her self-image. Gerwig's portrait of the wayward adolescent is spot-on, as Christine exhibits that perfect mixture of arrogance and wisdom, typical of gifted but confused teenagers.Gerwig is intent on eschewing the usual clichés of coming-of-age narratives. What impressed me the most was her sympathetic treatment of the parochial school priests and nuns, entrusted with educating kids who are not exactly what you would call devoted Catholics. You wouldn't expect a priest (Father Leviatch) to be conducting auditions for a Sondheim musical (in this case, ""Merrily we Roll Along"") but that's exactly what he does and later bemoans the unenthusiastic audience reaction, exclaiming that they ""just didn't ""get it""—he's also the same priest who conducts a group therapy session exhorting the students to be the ""first one to cry"" (and of course, it's Father Leviatch who is the first to emote!).There's also another hilarious scene with the football coach (another priest!--Father Walther) who subs for Father Leviatch (who eventually resigns due to depression). The coach directs Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" as if it's a football game and the beleaguered drama students all must cope with the coach's crazy approach.When Christine is suspended after falling afoul of a teacher who promotes a pro-life stance (relating that her mother was considering an abortion—and this particular teacher wouldn't have been born had her mother gone ahead with her initial decision), the Mother Superior, Sister Sarah Joan, confides to Christine that that the anti-abortion teacher is really a blow-hard and she actually found Christine's comments (that led to her suspension) to be amusing. Hence, Christine gets off lightly with Gerwig emphasizing the humanity of the nun in charge.There are multiple twists and turns in the plot that keep the story fresh throughout. When Christine discovers her first love, Danny, is gay, she stops speaking to him out of anger. But later she forgives and hugs him, after he reveals that he'll probably be rejected by his family if he comes out of the closet. Similarly, the theme of forgiveness is also played out in Christine's relationship to her best friend, Julie, with whom she has a falling out over her new relationship with Jenna, a ""bad girl"" to Julie the ""good."" After Christine falls for a second boy, Kyle, she again endures disappointment when she discovers that he's already slept with six other girls and is no ""virgin"" as he had told Christine earlier. This leads the emotionally devastated Christine to reconcile with Julie, and in another delightful twist, they end up dancing together at the Senior Prom!Last but not least, Christine's father, Larry (a low-key but highly effective Tracy Letts), despite having lost his job, provides emotional support for Christine along with helping her fill out financial aid applications. Much to her mother's chagrin, Christine is accepted by a college in NYC and her mother isn't talking to her as she jets off to her new life at the university.An overdose of alcohol (which lands her briefly in the hospital) perhaps is the trigger that helps her to grow up and realize that her mother loved her all along, and she is now ready to start her freshmen yearbin New York as a full-fledged adult!With the usual ubiquitous glut on the market of coming of age stories, Greta Gerwig manages to infuse her tale with a rich tapestry of intuitive observations of life, making her freshman effort an extraordinary winning one, deserving of all the accolades already heaped upon it."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,6/10,"I kind of like films like 'Lady Bird'. Coming of age, teenage dramas where the characters have infinite charm and deal with things we all remember fondly (or not so) from our adolescence. A particularly fond one from recent memory was 'Edge of Seventeen'. I like them as films, but they have to be something truly superb to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. For me 'Lady Bird' was not quite that good.I never read any other opinions or reviews of films before I review them myself, so as to make my review as purely mine as possible. I read in the trivia section though that this has been a nearly perfectly reviewed film. I'm going to be fascinated to read a number of those reviews. That's not to say I can't see someone giving this a good review - it's a perfectly good film after all - but for no one to have found fault in it is incredulous to me.Saoirse Ronan has been nominated for Best Actress in a Lead Role. She was good without really blowing me away. She had charm and innocence and likability down, but she wasn't given a whole lot of emotion to work with in her character. It's hard to see her winning. Laurie Metcalf was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress and again there simply wasn't enough for her to work with to have any chance of winning the award. She did well with what she was given, but never blew me away by any means.I would describe 'Lady Bird' as forgettable. A solid, well made, well acted film that I will likely never recall ever again. There is nothing there that will stick with me. When I think back on the great Best Picture nominees over the years (even the ones that didn't win, 'Amour' 'The Green Mile' etc.) they have moments that will stick in my memory until the day I die. 'Lady Bird' had nothing like that in any way, shape or form. Not a bad film, I had just hoped for more."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,8/10,"Saoirse Ronan stars as a 17 year-old student at a Catholic high school who dreams of getting away from Sacramento and making her way to New York and a college far away from a domineering mother. Mom is well played by veteran character actress Laurie Metcalf. The usual mother-daughter fights ensue, leading to a tear jerker ending. In between, we experience the common place teen angst in the form of first loves and first kisses. Ronan is great, although she was better in Brooklyn a couple of years ago. I am still livid over the Oscar's mistake of not awarding her best actress for that film. I have added this movie to my best ten list for 2017."
LADY BIRD,15 May 2019,7/10,"In spite of the fact that a lot of important issues-motives-expressions are approached, the narration in total was not a wow! thing to me, particularly the events leading to the ending and the ending itself. The things those late teens thought and did are not contrasting to many others in other countries (when living in a small place and/or with religious background) and the mood of the depiction varied a lot, sometimes too much.Yes, the performances are catchy, with several famous performers from different generations (e.g. Metcalf/Letts, Hedges/Chalamet), but apparently I expected more - based on some reviews, and accolades. Thus, ""only"" 7 points from me, and a recommendation - If interested in coming-of-age stories, you better watch Scandinavian works."
LADY BIRD,6 September 2020,7/10,"Lady Bird was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2017, earning a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It is certainly a well-acted film with a cast of brilliant young talent, i.e. Saorise Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, and Lucas Hedges. But it was an overhyped film. The central character was so selfish and unlikeable. Of course that was the point and she had to learn, grow and accept her mum, but that doesn't mean I want to spend time with her.There were some great character moments like when Lady Bird discusses her dad's depression and Ronan is a fantastic actress. But it was a 3 out of 5 film."
LADY BIRD,11 March 2018,,"In the year 2002, Catholic high school senior Christine McPherson, self-named ""Lady Bird,"" is an impetuous girl literally from the wrong side of the tracks who's at a critical stage in her life: she's continually at odds with her mother, despises her mundane life in Sacramento, and wants to go to college on the east coast in a city with culture. Her ordinary life suddenly takes a turn when she has to deal with popularity, discovering boys and romance, and coping with the problems of people other than her own. Cute, quirky, and thoughtful coming-of-age story is one everyone can relate to, with the all-important themes of teen angst, adolescence, and ambition; colorful dialogue, well-drawn characters, and believable situations are only elevated by a talented cast of actors. Twenty-three-year-old Ronan perfectly embodies the spirit of a self-absorbed teenager in all her complexities, making it easy for viewers to recall a similar time period in their lives. ***"
LADY BIRD,20 July 2019,7/10,"7/10 - not my favorite nominee, but interesting coming-of-age drama"
LADY BIRD,1 December 2017,6/10,"I saw ""Lady Bird"", starring Saoirse Ronan-The Grand Budapest Hotel, Hanna; Laurie Metcalf-The Big Bang Theory_tv, Uncle Buck; Beanie Feldstein-The Female Brain, Neighbors 2:Sorority Rising and Lucas Hedges-Manchester By the Sea, The Grand Budapest Hotel. This is a teenage girl coming of age story that covers most of the plot points you have probably seen before, but it is executed decently. Saoirse plays a 17 year old girl in Catholic high school in Sacramento, California in the early 2000's-I think I remember seeing a sign saying 2002 or 2003. She longs for adventure and wants to go to college anywhere but where she lives-she wants to go to New York, in particular. The main problem is money. She lives in the poor side of town and she is not making good enough grades for a scholarship. Her mother, Laurie, is a nurse working double shifts to cover bills. Beanie is her best friend at school and Lucas is her first boyfriend. Saoirse and Laurie are close-they talk about everything-even though they do get into disagreements. It's rated ""R"" for language, teen partying and sexual content-brief graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. Oh yeah, I feel I must mention that the brief graphic nudity is from a men's magazine that Saoirse is looking at. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but I'm not the target audience. I would wait until it comes to cable. If you are more inclined to these types of movies, you may enjoy it more than I did."
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,7/10,"Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is determined to flee from Sacramento and Catholicism and the provincial setting she finds herself in. At loggerheads with mom, umbling and stumbling through school and friendships with frustrated entitlement her flight is more Woodstock from Peanuts than graceful swan. Spending more time dreaming than applying she longs to head east where she will be able to realize her potential.Lady Bird is a bittersweet growing pains comedy featuring another fine performance from Sarise Ronan ( Brooklyn) as the title character navigating through teen hood. Neither wide eyed innocent or corrupt youth Christine resorts to conniving to gain acceptance as she deals with a myriad of challenges that Ronan provides the right combination of sympathetic and annoying to.In addition to the original quirky Christine writer director Greta Gerwig populates her cast with supporting characters (Laurie Metcalf's everyman mother deserving note) facing their own quiet desperation that enhances but at times wanders astray from Christine's path that to Gerwig's credit does not sell out at the end. Lady Bird more than earns its wings."
LADY BIRD,25 January 2018,7/10,"An eccentric, erratic young lady seeks direction in the twilight of her high school years. Alternately addressing her need to rebel, to cast away everything she once held sacred, and to remain true to herself, she frequently just acts on impulse, then later deals with the regret and repercussions. As many of us do, during the moody, impressionable years of adolescence. She's not quite sinking, but not quite swimming, seeking a way out but also realizing how much the familiarity and security of her long-term hometown means to her. It's a time of transition, of can't-go-back decisions, and the weight of those choices looms over both the titular character and her loved ones. For the first time, the heaviness of the real world is infringing upon her, from her family's financial struggles to the slim chances of acceptance to any of her dream schools, and it's no easy road for anyone: herself, her selflessly supportive father or her imposing (and constantly fretting) mother. It covers a lot of emotional churn and introspection in a relatively low-key way, almost exclusively through casual dialog and dinner-table debates. The conclusion is a bit off-putting - it doesn't end, it just stops - but in some ways, that's a better tonal match than the more theatrical scene that could've been chosen a few minutes earlier. Rich and human and familiar, if not transcendent."
LADY BIRD,1 December 2018,7/10,"Ronan plays the titular Lady Bird, facing the challenges of adolescence - parents, boys, school etcThis is a real triumph. Whilst Gerwig takes us to pretty familiar territory, the script is terrific, hitting teenage angst on the head perfectly. By keeping each scene really tight and avoiding drawn out melodrama she manages to land so much, so well, in a fairly short time span.This is all of course delivered brilliantly by terrific performances from Ronan in the fun title role and Metcalfe as the difficult matriarch."
LADY BIRD,25 May 2018,6/10,"(Flash Review)This was a nice and quirky coming of age film but for me wasn't as amazing as all the hype it got. Lady Bird, a name she gave herself, is an artsy, strong-willed, counter-culture, high school girl looking to get out Sacramento and into the happening colleges in New York City as she is feeling repressed by her Catholic School and sub upper class family. The film follows her college plans as well as a couple interesting romantic relationships and best friend friendship issues as she also attempts to define who she is or who she wants to become. Along the way, many current social topics are touched upon, occasionally feeling forced. The acting was very good, the tone was realistic and candid while the cinematography wasn't very memorable or striking. While this was quality, I feel like I've seen this before a few times."
LADY BIRD,23 January 2020,7/10,Great coming to age dramity that keeps you laughing and entertained for the 2 hours.
LADY BIRD,1 May 2020,8/10,"It's so nice to see not stereotypical teen movie. It's as good as a comedy as it is drama. The story is very relatable, misunderstood teen girl tries her hardest to be heard. I loved it, it was charming and memorable."
LADY BIRD,26 January 2020,8/10,"You can identify with this movie regardless h being a teenager or not, it shows how cold streets are and how different life is when we are younger."
LADY BIRD,29 January 2020,9/10,"This was a wonderfully odd experience for me. I'd heard such exceptional things about this, I was sure it couldn't live up to it. Fortunately, this movie resonated with me, hard. Every character in this movie felt like someone I knew in high school. Lady Bird's desire to buck the trends and fight the norms felt so familiar. As someone that was also forced to attend a small, religious school this really hit home for me.Obviously that is not going to be the case for everyone. Still, there is a wonderful film here, full of incredible and often subtle performances. Absolutely a recommend. It also happens to be included with Prime so, assuming that is a service you have, there's no reason not to watch it."
LADY BIRD,28 March 2020,9/10,"With some impressive performances, a down to earth atmosphere, and some playfully hard to watch situations, Lady Bird harnesses the best of its coming of age tale when it is doing something different than the rest. Saoirse Ronan leads a stellar cast in this small teen drama coming of age tale, and rocks it with every turn. Ronan's performance doesn't just feel like your sympathizing with the character, but that you are her, and her talent explodes upon the screen. Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts also give impressive performances as Lady Bird's parents, and both of them (especially Metcalf), deliver their dialogue with such astonishing emotion. Though the performances throughout rock, and the writing is stellar for the most part, Lady Bird's biggest flaw is it's cliched nature. The film has several cliche instances throughout that seem to be in almost any coming of age like tale, or a generic version of one, and it bummed me out that this wild character didn't go in the wild directions I knew she could have. The film also seems to end abruptly, and has little reason for doing so, leaving you confused rather than deeply satisfied. In the end, Lady Bird is a very impressive narrative and a great debut for Gerwig as a director and writer. The film may seem to lack a conclusion and contain various cliches, but the performances, sharp writing, and delightfully awkward scenarios make for some of the most human filmmaking I have seen in quite some time, and with that, a very human film itself.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
LADY BIRD,3 December 2017,9/10,"Christine, or Lady Bird, whichever names suits her is a strong and lively character, ready to express thoughts and opinions; yet there's still some innocence left in her, with much to learn along the way. She has been raised with enough freedom to express her opinions and to have some dreams, which might or not might come true, depending on the family situation. What's apparent is that Lady Bird could easily get lost, but she has a mother who is the family's rock, though her manners could antagonize everyone from the start. What's important is that she loves her family, and she does it fiercely.We accompany Christine through her senior year, as she lives through those special moments. She starts asserting herself, making difficult choices, trading friends, showing her independence, and going through the growing pains of her first love. For a few moments, I was afraid that we would go the expected path, but ""Lady Bird"" goes deeper in the character study of the family, and we get a sense of intimacy that lets you in, to become part of the story, a close observer, feeling the lows and highs.""Lady Bird"" is memorable because of the fine cast portraying all the members of the family. They're in first light, as average as they can be, but once we are done with the film, we realize that there's nothing average about them. Each contributes his/her own special experiences, shaping each other's lives, and allowing them to be an influence in theirs."
LADY BIRD,4 October 2018,6/10,Welcome to a teenager's angst. So it goes. Good acting by Saoirse.
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,,"I don't know what this film really wanted to portray a girl, who would be the product of a lower middle class family. But how come a young high schooler could afford attending a private Catholic school, with a mother just a nurse and a father soon to be unemployed? The screenplay writers obviously didn't know how much would have to pay for a child in a private Catholic school. There's one private church school in our neighborhood from the kindergarten to high school. The tuition for the kindergarten is about $6,000 a semester, and the parents are required to involve a lot of school projects and affairs. Periodical Donations are also encouraged. This particular church has used the profits by running a private school and a church to become the largest local land and properties buyer. A luxurious single family housing project the church bought a few years ago now is under construction, boasting 4,000 sqft. living spaces for each house just next to the school. The church is also a franchise business, got several churches dotted around. God is the easy mean to get rich.Now back to this film. This leading character, a girl called herself ""Lady Bird"" educated in such school would have turned out to be such a piece of self-centered, selfish, rude, mischievous product. Her shallow and naive ambition was to go to one of the east coast Ivy League universities, obviously another private school system for higher education. I rarely saw a movie character, especially young and a female, could be such annoying and so blindly selfish. Her family by all means, is just lower middle class family, both parents have struggling career, definitely not rich, even a bit more close to poverty, yet this girl just has such unrealistic dream. Her hatred to California or Sacramento is also a mysterious thing that the film didn't tell us the exact reason why. But one thing I am sure is her hatred of being a member of a poor family, a so so student without any merit and talent, all she got is day dreams, nothing else. Some of the reviewers tagged this film as a coming of age film, but I just can't agree. The anti-social attitude of this young girl is nothing special but a common outcome of any young boy or girl whose parents are not rich enough to provide them with enough welfare. There's nothing special about this film and it's very painful to watch this girl's naive, childish, selfish and even rude attitudes toward her mother and others, like everybody owes her."
LADY BIRD,26 March 2018,8/10,"It is such a rarity - but a delight - to see a maintstream movie both written and directed by a woman. As well as being a fine actress, Greta Gerwig has written before (notably ""Frances Ha"" and ""Mistress America"") but this is her directorial début. Astonishingly (but deservedly), at the age of just 34 this made her only the fifth woman in history to be nominated for a Best Director Academy Award and the first to be so honoured for her directorial début (but she did not win).It is also uncommon - but again a pleasure - to have a leading role in a film with a decent budget taken by a young actress. Here Irish Saoirse Ronan plays the eponymous 17 year old American senior year high school student in this coming-of-age story. We first saw Ronan in ""Atonement"" but she has since proved to be an outstanding talent in work such as ""Hanna"" and ""Brooklyn"".""Lady Bird"" is clearly semi-autobiographical territory for Gerwig: the central character's real name is Christine (the name of Gerwig's mother); the narrative is set in the early 2000s when Gerwig herself was a teenager; and, like Christine, Gerwig went to a Catholic high school in Sacramento before studying at a liberal arts college in New York City.But Gerwig does not romantise her central character who has acne and a poor hair dye and exhibits selfishness and anger as well as charm and humour in a narrative that is at turns poignant and funny but always engaging. Although the focus is on one girl in one year, the supporting characters - notably Lady Bird's parents and four friends (two girls and two boys) - are well-cast with Laura Metcalf especially impressive as the hard-pressed mother. In short, a rare treat of a movie which, at just 93 minutes, never overstays its warm welcome."
LADY BIRD,27 September 2020,10/10,"Writer/Director Greta Gerwig brings her own personal story into play, delivering her Lady Bird with an enthusiastic yet defiant cheekiness, never once losing sight of the real story."
LADY BIRD,29 November 2017,8/10,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good (not great) film with sensitive direction and two wonderful performances to enjoy.SYNOPSIS: A coming of age story with mother-daughter issues.JIM'S REVIEW: The volatile relationship between parent and child has been a popular subject in the arts. That unpredictable bonding between father and son or mother and daughter makes for an interesting combination. The latter is on display in Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig's engrossing character study of a young girl's flight of fantasy or her flight away from a domineering mother.￼Set in 2002, a.k.a. Christine McPherson (a.k.a. Lady Bird) is in her final year of high school, eager to shake off her town and family and fly east to New York City to make her dreams come true. Ashamed of her middle class upbringing, she is eager to fly the coop. Her father, Larry, is so mild-mannered that he is basically ignored by his loved ones as he negotiates the war between the women in his household. Her mother, Marion, is not the nurturing type and her actions are second place to her verbal assaults. Far from encouraging, she would rather have her idealistic daughter view life in realistic terms, another words, accept the sadness of it all. So Lady Bird has no other choice but to rebel against her parents, friends, and her rigid Catholic School regime, all of which are trying to hold her back from her own experimental impulses.￼This set-up is all too familiar territory, but as the director, Ms. Gerwig captures the awkwardness of adolescence and that hormonal imbalance that signifies innocence and self- importance. Her observational glimpses into first love (and that first real kiss), teenage authority issues, and peer pressure are spot-on. The predictability factor is still there, and some scenes go on a bit long, but there are also some surprising events added to the drama about working class economic struggle that are quite telling and unusual for this genre.￼As the screenwriter, Ms. Gerwig is mostly successful. Script-wise, this coming of age tale wanders and loses focus with its plotting and the sketchiness of its minor characters, most of which remain interesting, but underdeveloped. Their fates seem to get lost in the storytelling. Yet, at the film's core is the effective mother and daughter tag team bout that makes this film so special. These two characters are rich in details and depth. Their dialog sounds refreshingly honest and natural and the two actresses excel in making their mercurial relationship utterly convincing.￼Saoirse Ronan in the title role delivers a fully realized portrayal of a teenager holding onto her dreams and defiantly expressing her independence. This talented actress plays her eccentric character as one part exasperating and and two parts enchanting. Her excellent performance is matched by Laurie Metcalf's sharp tongued and distraught matriarch. As Marion, her verbal reactions hide the love for her daughter and watching the actress' subtle expressions after words are cruelly and hastily spoken brings the necessary depth that prevent her from becoming a monster. (The film's most memorable and bittersweet scene involves an uncomfortable conversation in which Lady Bird simply asks her mother if she likes her, preceded by a hesitated and jumbled answer. That delayed response says much about the sensitive writing and nuanced acting in this film.)￼Tracy Letts is Lady Bird's understanding father and peacemaker of the family and he creates a strong character in this meek ordinary man. Also notable are Lucas Hedges as Lady Bird's first love and Beanie Feldstein as her loyal sidekick. The always dependable Lois Smith and Stephen McKinley Henderson deliver short but noteworthy moments in their smaller roles.Ms. Gerwig has directed her film with a deft vision, even if her screenplay could use more cohesion. Still, Lady Bird is fast becoming a darling of the critics and their many accolades seem slightly overdone. It is a good, but far from great, film...with great, not just good, performances by its female leads...and well worth seeing."
LADY BIRD,5 February 2021,8/10,"Lady Bird actually feels fresh and original, which is real achievement as most Teen dramas feel the same."
LADY BIRD,27 November 2017,7/10,"I'm very disappointed with what has come out this year. I usually see a few truly great movies in a given year with three or four perfect 4-star films ontop of those. That has not has happened this year. We've gotten some heavy CGI-oriented action extravaganzas with just a few films I could actually take seriously. Even the ones I could take seriously weren't enough. Lady Bird is one of those.Saoirse Ronan may win her first Oscar as the titular character. Her name is Christine, but she prefers to be called ""Lady Bird"" (just like Hank Hill's dog). She lives in Sacramento in the early 2000s and desperately wants to blossom out of her town as high school is ending. She must deal with the shenanigans of being a young woman about to go to college and finally getting out of her weird catholic high school.Notice the word I use: ""shenanigans."" Because that's exactly what this movie is about. The movie follows trivial and everyday events in Lady Bird's life. None of these feel special. None of these things are moving. There was no take-off point. The scenes that were good were finished way too quickly and interesting things were ditched too soon and moved onto something else. Why? The most popular element of praise I've seen for this is people praising its dead-on realism and its very little amount of potential clichés. Just because a movie is very real, is that really worth a perfect score? Just because its original, does that automatically make it great? That answer to both questions is no. It's all in the execution. A movie could be totally original, but if it isn't executed well, who cares? And do you realize how many movies are just as realistic as Lady Bird that are far superior? Too many to count. Has the film industry gone that far downhill?As much as I am badgering this, it is definitely thumbs up. The characters were relatable, there was warmth and love, and the acting was all mighty fine. Was I underwhelmed because of hype? No. I just heard through the grape vine that this got good reviews. That's it. it wasn't until after that I checked out the extent. The main reason I'm not on board with everyone else is it didn't hit me. I appreciated everything this had to offer, but almost none of it did anything to me. To me, a perfect score (or near perfect score) is the strength of the positive reaction I get. Frankly, nothing this movie offered was strong. I'm not at all saying suicides needed to be involved or there needed to be sex and cheating, just a better and more complex script. Because let's face it, the movie is very basic, has no reach, has little layers, little subtext and is only skin deep.Definitely thumbs up. It's more than a marginal thumbs up. But I certainly hope the hype doesn't grow. And I REALLY hope I don't get so annoyed by how high its acclaim gets and become sick of it like with other movies.7.5/10"
LADY BIRD,25 November 2017,9/10,"Lady Bird is my latest write-up. As you might have already discovered, it has nothing to do with the 36th President's late wife. So yeah, ""Bird's"" ending left my mind up in the air as well as on the edge of something. Still, this is a near-perfect film. It's definitely one of 2017's best.Lady Bird gives people like writer Diablo Cody and director Kelly Fremon Craig a run for their money. It has the blueprint of a familiar teen drama but so what. ""Bird"" shoots from the hip and dives much deeper than stuff like Juno and The Edge of Seventeen.Every sequence in ""Bird"" feels raw, unflinching, and just plain genuine. Every actor nuance is blessed with unassuming clout. With whip-smart dialogue, grainy locales, and keen direction by actor turned director Greta Gerwig, Lady Bird puts coming-of-age candor through the almighty ringer. All the characters (including the lead) are fully realized and no one harks a false note. Did I mention that Sacramento, California is this flick's unheralded star? It's true. So true.""Bird's"" story involves one Christine McPherson (played by Saoirse Ronan). Christine is a high school senior. She insists on being called ""Lady Bird"" and the pic never quite tells us why. She lives in Sacramento but wants to get out. Being from a lower-class family and having a love- hate relationship with her overbearing mother (Marion McPherson played by Laurie Metcalf), Christine dreams of attending college in New York. That way she'll make a ton of money and eventually thumb her mom's nose in it (in an unconditional, loving way of course).In retrospect, I'm hoping that Ronan and Metcalf get well-deserved nominations at the Academy Awards (for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively). Also, I'm rooting for Gerwig's truth to life screenplay to get some recognition as well.Overall, Lady Bird has the makings of a tender, persona study. It also contains a seething, coffee shop soundtrack and unfeigned acting of the highest order. With this film, the ""bird"" is undoubtedly the word! Rating: 3 and a half stars."
LADY BIRD,16 April 2018,8/10,"From the studio that shocked the Oscars last year with the upset Moonlight over LaLa Land, comes Lady Bird, a coming of age tale set during the Clinton/Bush Jr years about a high school senior living on the west coast with her mom who wants to move to the east coast so that she can go to college in the big apple. She, like many other people in her clique, has issues. Wackiness then ensues, complete with humor, sex, and a killer soundtrack from that era. Ms. Ronan shines as Lady Bird. Greta Gerwig is a great director!!"
LADY BIRD,3 December 2017,9/10,What a great little movie about real people with real problems in real scenarios with very real emotions. There's a lot to get behind here from the mother daughter dynamics to the high school friendships to the coming of age story. Great performances where everyone gets to have little moments that define them and their role and you're left with a sense of a time and place and person that you rarely see anymore. Just a fine little story that worked on almost all levels. Well worth checking out and Gerwig shows some real promise for the future.
LADY BIRD,10 November 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird is the semi-biographical directing debut of noted indie actress Greta Gerwig. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, a Sacramento teen whose uneasy shift into adulthood bears unpredictable and transformative results for her, her friends and her family. She dreams of moving as far away as possible for college, in part to avoid her contentious relationship with her mother (Metcalf). The prospect seems unlikely however given her father's recent unemployment. Thus while she waits, Lady Bird soaks in and learns from her encounters with her boyfriends, her run-ins with the well-meaning nuns at her out-of-touch Catholic School and the quirks of her dozy hometown.Much like Gerwig's breakthrough success Frances Ha (2012) (a film she also co-wrote), Lady Bird has a very frank, very refreshing honesty to it. The characters, both major and minor are flawed and sympathetic, the story and the city in which it takes place feels fleshed out; drawn with an appreciation and love that appeals to a certain sense of remembrance. It's not nostalgic – who truly can be nostalgic for 2002, a year Lady Bird notes for being a palindrome and little else. It's more like an honest examination of that awkward period in life after high school, before college where boredom, jadedness and sexual frustration can unknowingly turn you into the adult you will become.The honesty goes a long way in overcoming the usual teen dramedy clichés. While the film stops just short of surprising audiences with the wholly unexpected, Lady Bird nevertheless spins its web of story lines in a unique configuration. The expected mother-daughter friction, the Catholic School repression and the pompous proto-douche boyfriend subplots are all here and accounted for but they're painted in with such care and loving detail. Like a Faberge egg this film is cognizant of tradition but encrusted with unique filigree all its own.Supporting cast members Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts are truly spectacular as Lady Bird's hardened but still loving parents. They both dominate different extremes of the parental spectrum (one overbearing, the other a little too free-wielding), yet both only want what's best for their children even if it costs them their pride, their finances and in one subplot their dignity. Beanie Feldstein and Lucas Hedges likewise make pretty good hay out their roles as Lady Bird's long suffering best friend and first boyfriend respectively. While it would have been nice to see more of Hedges exploring the deeper complexities of his character, what ends up on screen, works in serving the overall narrative.Saoirse Ronan isan interesting choice as an avatar for Gerwig's personal tale of adolescence and turmoil. The film requires her to be funny, charming, excitable, aggressive, and a bit of a brat depending on the circumstances. And while the young actress hits all those notes, she does so with an uncomfortable passivity that often risks making the movie about her environment as opposed to about her. One can't help but compare Ronan to the fearless Hailee Steinfeld of last year's Edge of Seventeen (2016) and wonder if by this time next year, we'll still be talking about the self-absorbed but not too self-absorbed Lady Bird? That along with the strong inference that Lady Bird is a lesser, spiritual prequel to Frances Ha means the film, for all its positives doesn't go all-the-way sort of speak. It's an honest movie and a lovely movie but not as truly transformative or life-changing as could have or should have been. The bad news is that means The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) will stay in the popular consciousness for only that much longer. The good news is hopefully that means Greta Gerwig is just getting warmed up. With a movie that ultimately feels as custom made as this one, I'm very, very excited to see what she comes up with next."
LADY BIRD,7 December 2017,10/10,"In a year filled with many surprise treats, it should come as no shock that while most people await a certain high-profile space opera, one of the year's most charming and engaging films should emerge under the radar. That being writer/director Greta Gerwig's absolutely fabulous slice-of-life comedy-drama ""Lady Bird."" Starring the stunningly talented Saoirse Ronan along with a cast of other magnificent performers, this coming-of-age tale hits you right where it counts, supplying laughs, gasps and even a tear or two along its incredibly efficient ninety-minute run-time.Christine McPherson (Ronan) is your typical angsty, unsure teenage girl. She has aspirations for bigger things despite her humble upbringing, worries about boys and her classes at an uptight Catholic High School, and is trying to find her way in the world. Oh, and she's also rebelliously began to try and rename herself ""Lady Bird"" in predictable defiant-teen fashion. The film follows her through a year in her life in 2002, as she observes the world changing in the post 9/11 climate, tries to figure out both familial and romantic relationships and eventually begins to figure out the person she really is, all while facing an uncertain future.The peculiar thing about the film is that, in a sense, we have seen this all before... just not QUITE like this. In the scope of coming- of-age stories, the tale of ""Lady Bird"" might seem all too familiar. And yet, the movie excels splendidly thanks to the thoughtful and sensitive writing and direction and the awe-inspiring turns from every single actor involved. Greta Gerwig guides the film's amusing story and wildly identifiable characters with a sense of confidence and glee. It really is an exceptionally assembled film in terms of pacing, structure and visual aesthetics. It has a mild sense of gritty realism that keeps you thoroughly invested in the story, while injecting just enough exaggerated moments of levity to tickle the funny-bone with some regularity. It's simply charming start-to-finish, and I look forward to seeing what Gerwig cooks up next if this is her solo directorial debut.Saoirse Ronan continues to prove to be a revelation amongst her peers, delivering a character that is both troubled but well-intentioned. Likable but not always inherently good. Much like any person. While I'm somewhat ashamed to admit this is the first film I've seen where she's had a starring role, I'm definitely interested in seeing the rest of her work. She's just amazing. Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts are great in supporting roles as Lady Bird's supportive but long- suffering parents, and both are given a lot of great moments to build off of and a surprising amount of development. Timothée Chalamet and Lucas Hedges are good fun as some of Lady's earliest romantic conquests and are good representations of realistic figures one encounters in life. And special commendation goes to the adorable Beanie Feldstein, whom portrays Lady Bird's best friend, Julie. Feldstein is just a ton of fun in the part and the chemistry she shares with Ronan builds up much of the film's heart.I'm almost at a loss for words when trying to think of a single thing to say against the film. And I just... can't. It's a film that's virtually without fault, meeting and excelling at everything it sets out to do. The cast is amazing. The direction exceptional. And the writing simply sublime. And it is a film that I can with some certainty is among the best of the year. And so, I'm giving ""Lady Bird"" a perfect 10 out of 10. Please give this charming, entertaining and oft-heartfelt film a shot! It took me by surprise, and it might very well do the same for you."
LADY BIRD,13 January 2018,1/10,"There are things which will always remain a mystery to me - for example, why so many people love that awful abomination that is Once Upon A Time In America, or that boring thud, Godfather II? The same conundrum is this 2017's teen drama, Lady Bird. I was waiting eagerly to watch this, I watched this - so, what can be said? Not much. This is a very shallow, sliding on the surface, empty misfire of a film, and what is more incredible - we have seen this all many times before. We sure have. I am sorry, people, what merit is in showing a highly mundane, repeated trite cliche of a teen's life - what didn't we see before? Catholic school? Teenage love? Firstsex? Troubles at Math? Depression? Conflicts with Mom, as well as with siblings? Come on, guys, we saw this time and again.
Saoirse Ronan is nice, but nothing more than that - she never managed to break out of ordinary, highly predictable lines and verses. Laurie Metcalf is nice, too, but again, never above average. 
OK, consider this is just an average bland movie, I can buy this. What I cannot buy, is this screaming approval of happiness. Ok, maybe, I am old and am not touched by this teenage angst anymore, but come on, even this stort could have more depth and color. Here, we see a cold, shallow, gray depiction of life of people we do not feel compassion to or like. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film as ""unique and original and fresh and wonderful"" and ""appealing"" - well, I must disagree - there is nothing unique, or original, or fresh here - in Russia amd all around the Globe we saw better efforts. I know I will be not understood, but here I stay - this is a very poor movie, even in comparison with worse movies of 2017."
LADY BIRD,2 April 2020,8/10,"Directed by Greta Gerwig. Starring Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Beanie Feldstein, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, Odeya Rush, Lois Smith, Jordan Rodrigues, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Bob Stephenson, Marielle Scott. (R)Christine (Ronan), who prefers to go by ""Lady Bird,"" is the typical bored teenager yearning to be free; in this case, trapped in Sacramento--the ""Midwest of California""--while pining to get accepted to an East Coast liberal arts college. Directorial debut for Gerwig, who also wrote the script, is a remarkably assured first outing, funny and upbeat without ignoring the discomfort and delusion that comes from experiencing high school, a smart and crisply-edited coming of age story that should appeal to most anyone to at least some degree. However, anyone who's seen a few other coming of age stories will recognize a lot of familiar elements (ditching the best bud to hang with the popular crowd, the hot crush turning out to be a heel, etc.)--insight and originality are limited commodities here. Chief selling point is the relationship between Lady Bird and her mom (Metcalf, in an excellent performance), one of frustration, disappointment, sacrifice, things left unsaid, hidden wounds, and hard-fought commitment.84/100"
LADY BIRD,23 December 2018,5/10,"Lady Bird at times tends to come across as a movie maybe trying a little too hard to be everything to everyone. Many scenes work well and manage to capture some of the essences of growing up - while others play out to bursts of somewhat obvious sensationalism. This is a writer/director trying to include comments that tick all the boxes on all the issues that plague the society we have created in today's PC and gender challenged era - right up to abortion issues (leaving us with only a smug, juvenile slant on understanding the many complex issues involved) Greta Gerwig dresses-up her story in a treatment looking a bit like a 'sophisticated' step-up from the mumblecore stylistic approach. Her surface examinations of these contemporary themes look earnest but can also seem like tokenism or simple topicality.Lady birds Mum (Laurie Metcalf - who just about takes the acting honours) is mostly depicted as a neurotic psychiatrist - while Dad (Tracy Letts) is presented as a wishy-washy but lovable character, who is broke and losing his job but, seems not to register any due concern. This will please immature youths going through similar life situations or older viewers who may be able to identify with some experiences but, this is not the classic the Academy and certain others are making it out to be. By today's standards, it works reasonably well on the surface, while still not being quite as good as the treatment we could, and should, be having on these themes.It's interesting to note: a BBC study described it as the most overrated by critics of the of the 2018 Oscar nominees. The movie also happens to open with the words of the great John Steinbeck, as if by association, we might think this script will live up to the quality of these writings, well.....maybe next time?"
LADY BIRD,1 March 2018,9/10,An outspoken teen must navigate a loving but turbulent relationship with her strong-willed mother over the course of an eventful and poignant senior year of high school.
LADY BIRD,30 November 2018,7/10,An American comedy-drama; This is a heartfelt coming-of-age story capturing the bittersweet transition from adolescence to adulthood with a vivid storyline. It explores themes of identity and naiivety and selfishness. It's witty and manages to be comedic and real and leaves you with a sense of empathy for Lady Bird.
LADY BIRD,27 February 2021,6/10,"Lady bird is an overrated film to be honest. It's a pretty derivative coming of age story. I don't get what the hype is all about, I mean 99% on Rotten tomatoes, come on! the 7.4 on IMDb is more accurate. I was misled into thinking this film is a gold just like I was misled about ""Booksmart"". Both films share similar themes and have even somewhat similar story but they're both an ok films at best, definitely not worth the hype or the high scores. The protagonist is bratty, self-indulgent teenager who I found to be irritating half the time. The film's plot is extremely mundane. The only interesting thing I could say about this film is the odd relationship between Lady bird and her mother. But even that is utterly predicable as we already know it's only a matter of time before the 'big misunderstanding' and then the 'patch up'. So much for a Oscar nominated movie."
LADY BIRD,5 April 2018,4/10,"Great acting as usual from all the participants, Saoirse is fantastic in whatever she does , it has excellent dialogue and humour but for me it was just another in a long line of the so called ""coming of age"" movies - How many more of these do we have to sit through?Another man bashing movie where all the men are weak, effeminate (or gay) and useless; even her father is weak and ineffective - The agenda behind the writing is becoming the case in many movies now with the LGBT and BLM agenda its pretty sad and even sadder that so many of the people reviewing this and giving it high marks cant even see the trees for the wood or the wood for the trees. Are people really so gullible these days they will swallow any old propaganda and join the sheeple-revolution? This is what the #metoo third wave feminist nutbag brigade love ; A woman acting like a man. This is really all this film is - a male coming of age movie with the genders reversed and all the gullible females have fallen for all the old tropes and third wave feminist claptrap.Metcalf is fantastic in whatever role she plays, loved her performances ever since I first saw her in the excellent comedy Roseanne! She brings a lot to the party! The superlative Saoirse Ronan so what could go wrong?As a guy I cannot really get into this because its really a film for women and no amount of cajoling can convince me otherwise.
To me although it had all the elements there for a good movie it was merely another average film that very few men will be able to empathise with for obvious reasons unless of course you are one of those sad specimens of man-womanhood they call a mangina!If you are a guy looking to impress a new girlfriend then this is the film to take her to see but while you are watching it you can go for a little snooze!"
LADY BIRD,15 October 2018,3/10,"For a movie nominated for best picture, I was expecting more substance. This one lacked that, and then some.The main actress is decent enough to watch. And I admire Greta Gerwig. But the story just did not do anything for me. It started off nice, and it did get more interesting, in the path of a teen comedy film. But it just got boring, and I could wait for the movie to be over. But the good thing was, at least, I had to at least watch it until the end.See it if you want, may be good for some boring night in."
LADY BIRD,21 August 2020,5/10,"The real and no doubt heartfelt reviews on this film are lost on me. Yes, it is good, but it is not particularly exceptional. Young woman finds her way in life and the scenario in various films of the past have treated the same theme. The acting is above average, and only Lucas Hedges stood out as the very promising actor who should have lead roles. Timothee Chalamet gives a performance that paled in comparison. Hedges has a quirky look and is riveting to watch because he makes acting look easy which it is not. He also seems oblivious to his good looks which is refreshing and he is not pandering to the viewers. His performance in ' Boy Erased ' was exemplary. Saoirse Ronan in my opinion acted well, but her performance in the better film ' Brooklyn ' she was outstanding. I give the film a five for the mother/daughter relationship and how well written it was, but the surprising scene in the car I saw coming and seemed melodramatic. I do not know Sacramento as a city but the religious aspects of the film depressed me as being on one hand critical and at the end sort of validated. I did not buy the change in tone and neither do I think the R rating in the US or the 15 certificate in the UK justifiable. Yes, there is a Gay kiss between men; yes the valid word Vagina is used in a classroom, but then this was made in 2017 not the early 1950's. The film should be shown in classrooms and when are we going to grow up about sex ? Without spoilers the ending failed completely, and the direction, much applauded was good but nothing special. We all see films differently and this film was lost to me. I like the ordinary to be extraordinary. Rohmer could do it as well as the Dardenne brothers, but this one did not."
LADY BIRD,4 November 2017,,"Greta Gerwig has been an ""it"" girl on the indie scene for several years. It may be a bit ironic that her most acclaimed movie would come when she stepped behind the camera with LADY BIRD (she previously co-directed NIGHTS & WEEKENDS, and co-starred as well). Here, Saorise Ronan is the stand-in Gerwig as a character named Christine, who like the real Gerwig, is a rebellious teen in Sacramento California who dreams of New York City.Christine has re-dubbed herself ""Lady Bird"" and is going to a Catholic High School and is going through all the usual growing pains. Grewig has made a name for herself with her quirky characters and there's more than a bit of that to wade through here. It takes some time to get past the notion that Ronan is giving her own performance here and not just doing a Greta act (similar to many a Woody Allen lead performance by 'substitute' Woodys). As fiercely individualistic as Gerwig is as an actress, Ronan gives Lady Bird a bit of a softer and more vulnerable side that is more effective than if Gerwig had performed it herself. Kudos to her for embracing it.Most importantly, Gerwig does an excellent job at keeping the movie rolling along at a brisk 93 minutes, with some scenes being literally seconds long - nothing self-indulgent here (although there is a scene or two that could have been allowed to breathe a bit). The cast, including several young actors is uniformly fine. Laurie Metcalf as her tough mother could have used a little leavening. As written and performed, she comes off a bigger harridan than is what was likely intended. Some of the offbeat mumblecore touches stick out as unnecessary, but, what separates LADY BIRD from so many of them (including, frankly, a number of Gerwig's movies), is that there is genuine heart and compassion here, not just ironic detachment. Further grounding things is a keen appreciation of middle class life with the scenes of shopping at thrift stores, window browsing for homes they can't afford etc. - or, as Lady Bird sardonically refers to it: ""Coming from the wrong side of the tracks."" Credit, too, for not ending in the conventionally expected way. Just a warm sigh."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird recently made history as Rotten Tomatoes' most highly rated film (which was lost shortly after and came back to Toy Story 2 and has a very positive rating on Metacritic which is 94, I admit I did not find this masterpiece that the criticism found, is a good movie, but I found it slow and did not see so much originality too, reminiscent of Boyhood for example, the plot he is good, but it is nothing impressive, but the performances are above average, Saiorse Ronan every time Laurie Metcalf is great in the film, and the rest of the cast in my opinion is fine, but not as well as the two mentioned, and Greta Gerwid does. a great directorial debut, does a great job, but her direction is not something to win the Oscar, because it's not a difficult direction, it's not hard to imagine Lady Bird being run by another director or director, but it was an excellent I start and hope to see m Her movies, is Lady Bird good? Is it a masterpiece? in my opinion no, it's a good movie, but I can not see the movie winning so many prizes in oscar in main categories, maybe in best actress for Saiorse Ronan but just that. Note 7.7"
LADY BIRD,7 January 2018,7/10,"Christine McPherson aka ""Lady Bird"" (Saoirse Ronan) is in her senior year in a Catholic school in Sacramento, California and desperately wants to go to a liberal college in the northeastern US. This causes conflict with her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf).Lady Bird is someone who can be inconsiderate, selfish, insecure, good-hearted, ambitious beyond her abilities, naïve, fun, and able to redeem herself. In other words, she is a confused teenager on the cusp of adulthood and Ronan plays the part superbly.Like the recent ""Florida Project"", ""Lady Bird"" is a series of short scenes that collectively make a fine film. It has sharp directing by Greta Gerwig who also wrote the screenplay. There are also engaging sidebar stories including other characters that add greatly to the main mother-daughter conflict: the despair of losing a job later in life; financial burdens; periodic depression; the inner-conflict of being young, gay, and Catholic; the futility of social climbing; the belief that ""there"" is better than ""here"".The coming-of-age genre is so common that it's difficult to raise the bar. ""Lady Bird"" at least meets the standard and then some though it could have been more. In fairness, the two lead performances do stand out especially that of Metcalf. She shows so much push-pull with her daughter while trying to come to grips that her daughter will soon leave home. She also has the brilliant ability to let the emotions build gradually and then attempt (as we do in real life) to resist them until the attempt is futile. No wonder Metcalf is winning so many awards and award nominations. While she gives a rich performance, I believe the film would have been greater if she had been given even more screen time. - dbamateurcritic"
LADY BIRD,30 November 2017,9/10,"The first shot packs the story. Mother and daughter sleep together in matching profiles. The serenity of the shot catches their essential bond, which their respective prickliness does its best to fray in their waking hours.Lying there, they look alike. As the father later explains, both women have such strong personalities that their clashing is natural — but their underlying love remains. Both women move through trying times with men. Mother Marion is a hospital counsellor who has to guide a grief-stricken priest. He was apparently not saved by directing his school production of Merrily We Roll Along. His ""They didn't get it"" suggests the rollicking audience missed the depressing undercurrents to which he was attuned. His successor is made of sterner stuff: directing The Tempest with the blackboard strategies of his football coaching.At home Marion has to deal with husband Larry's long battle with depression and his loss of his job. This while dealing with emotional teen Christine and adopted older son Miguel with his live-in girlfriend. The latter explicitly confirms our sense of Marion's ""big heart.""Christine grows through three beaus. The first turns out gay, the second an insensitive pretentious creep and her third — entering NYC — with their first kiss provokes her drunken puke. In consoling her gay guy she shows her mother's heart. She also briefly abandons her closest girl friend in vain hope of befriending the class's wealthy, snobbish beauty. As Christine grows through her tribulations Marion survives them.The film closes on two notes of reconciliation. On the long distance phone Christine tells her mother ""Thanks"" and ""I love you."" That's realizing the tacit harmony we saw in the first shot. Their unity is also the point of intercutting shots of mother and daughter driving through Sacramento. Equally important, Christine accepts herself — finally going by her given name Christine instead of yet again insisting on the ""Lady Bird"" with which has all along tried to romanticize herself."
LADY BIRD,19 March 2018,9/10,Lady Bird delves into the perilously fraught relationship between mother and daughter. Couple that with the coming of age story of Lady Bird a senior at a Catholic High School wending her way through relationships both romantic and friend with sometimes disastrous results.Fantastic movie. Well done acting. Not to be missed.
LADY BIRD,1 July 2018,8/10,"When Christine McPherson, or Lady Bird as she prefers to be called, discovers she has been accepted into Public Ivy UC Davis, she curls her lip in disgust; it's a mere thirty minutes away, when really she dreams leaving her nest and flying away to the Big Apple, or at the very least Connecticut. Her entire existence serves as an affront to the modest Sacramento, her style a personal rebellion. The only thing pinker than her streaked hair or prom dress is the cast she sports after flinging herself out of the car mid-argument in the opening vignette, in protest of her mother's parental suffocation. It's a wonderful scene of conflicting perspectives and overlapping dialogue, all timed to perfection by a mother and daughter each trying to get their own word in.It helps that Saoirse Ronan is capable of tuning into any frequency that the film calls for. In truth, she's better coy than cutting and sardonic anyway, as if you feel a huge weight lift off her shoulders in the quieter moments where she isn't keeping up the facade. When she's in the classroom trying to impress the 'cool' girls, her neck is craned forward and her eyes dart around to make sure everyone is hearing and seeing this. But watch her fumble through an approach to a potential crush (both times) and you see the self-consciousness cascade from inside her, and it feels real.In many instances it is the dialogue's authenticity that shines through, juggling the messy and often hilarious contradictions of a teenager's mind: Lady Bird and her best friend Julie throw dirty looks and scoff at the popular Jenna's petrol-guzzling land rover, only to rapidly switch tack and gush at how pretty she is. Later they are lying on their backs with legs up on the wall, munching on communion wafers (""They're not consecrated."") and barely holding in their laughter as they compare their delicate usage of shower handles. The camera zeroes in on this odd little vignette through an upside-down overhead shot, and it is the perfect encapsulation of the film's milieu, a lull in the day of a small-town Catholic school for two girls who only dream of graduation and beyond, and must meanwhile entertain themselves.Lady Bird fends off her micromanaging mum, all the while crossing paths with the usual caricatures, although Gerwig tries her best to sidestep expectations. Amongst them is queen bee Jenna (who's cooler than we expect, and plainer in her ambitions - not that there's anything wrong with that), first crush Danny who is eventually revealed to be gay, and second crush Kyle, who flirts the line between hilarious and infuriating with his constant posturing. The intention behind the mockery is to highlight the hypocrisy of the upper middle class, but Gerwig makes him too easy a punching bag, constantly sporting a cigarette (hand-rolled, naturally) and a Howard Zinn book but not a cellphone (although he whips one out to make detour before prom, further drawing attention to his phoniness). Then again, isn't he exactly the dreamy type that Lady Bird would fall for, only to look back on as Christine and groan as the audience does?Lady Bird believes she has already outgrown Sacramento, and merely asks for the room to spread her wings, but her mother, in a searing performance by Laurie Metcalf, only asks for her to be considerate. Neither are entirely in the wrong. The film's journey is an exercise in empathy building, for two women to slowly but surely see the other's perspective, like how she confronts Danny with a hostile expression but ends up as a shoulder to cry on. Or, after an underwhelming first time, the camera pauses to consider Kyle's father, who has worked his whole life to ensure that his child has a future to look forward to, and is now wasting away. Eventually, one must let go of her fear, and the other, her anger. Standing in New York, the centre of the world, she considers her modest nest, Sacramento."
LADY BIRD,19 August 2018,3/10,"But its inconsequential. Like. A more ""realistic"" version of a Disney movie?The plot bits are the same than the ones of any Disney picture only on a realistic setting/context.This story was told a gazillion times before and this movie doesn't give any reason to be considered special.I literally already forgot about this movie, and I watched it not long ago.The three is for the sex scene, which is something I hadn't seen before (at least in this type of movies), and because the acting is really good, only again... inconsequential.If this is an Oscar contender movie, then the Oscars aren't that great."
LADY BIRD,17 November 2017,10/10,"Saoirse Ronan plays Lady Bird. We all knew a Lady Bird. In high school, in college, at work. Male or female. The misfit toy, the square peg, the rebel without a cause. Someone nobody thought was anything, but in reality, extraordinary. Extraordinary by just being who they are and unafraid of what others will think of them in doing so.Lady Bird is a triumphant film of 2017. Only one emotion swept through me as I sat and watched. Pure joy. Lady Bird is an entirely memorable character. In some ways, a feminist answer to Max Fischer from Rushmore. The way she navigates through her humble catholic school upbringing is hilarious. She uniquely adapts to the pitfalls of the coming-of-age. The discovery of love, sex, popularity, rejection and the anticipation of college. At the same time, Lady Bird wishes she was something more and much to the chagrin of her own mother, who wishes she could just be normal. Laurie Metcalf's performance as Mrs. McPherson is heartbreaking and real. A mother in the cross- hairs of unconditional love and utter disappointment in her daughter. Lady Bird's dynamic with her mother thought the film is chilly and dismissive, but deep inside, she fully appreciates all that she has given to her, and vice-versa.As a former socially anxious, awkward teenager, I can certainly relate to wishing I were somewhere else, wishing I was someone I wasn't and perhaps unappreciative of what I already had. Lady Bird doesn't just simply rehash the coming-of-age story for us all to harken back to way back when, but to reflect in an adult manner, what it means to have a family that cares about you through it all. For that, Lady Bird is worth every second of your time. You'd be unfortunate to miss it."
LADY BIRD,1 January 2018,8/10,"12/31/17. Maybe 3 1/2 stars. This is a gem of a movie that is worth catching! It really is about the mother and daughter relationship at the point when it is the hardest relationship to be in - those adolescent years. Ronan is at the edge of 17, awkward and unsure of herself, her feelings, her future, etc. One thing she is sure of - her mother may love her but doesn't like her. The nuanced difference is extremely important as Metcalf is extremely careful in parsing the semantics - love is not like, and she loves her very much. The McPhersons are a lower middle class family that struggles to makes ends meet. Mom is realistic about expectations, but Lady Bird is free of those expectations, and wants to take flight to a more cultured territory, New York. This movie is about coming of age for those who dream of a better life in a country that is not as classless as it is portrayed in the mainstream. We secretly wish Lady Bird will find her happiness."
LADY BIRD,3 November 2017,8/10,"This film received very high praise from early screenings and it wasn't hard to see why. Saoirse Ronan is a star, absolutely blowing everyone away in Brooklyn. Then you have Greta Gerwig, a force in a few Noah Baumbach films, with a highly anticipated directional debut. Was incredibly hyped for this one all the way through. It feels short because the film just flies by but its rather excellent. Very satisfied with the turnout for this one.The film is about Christine McPherson (Ronan) who has given herself the name ""Lady Bird"". She is a high school senior in a Catholic school who struggles through what a typical girl of that age goes through. She faces the trials and tribulations of dating boys, losing her virginity, trying to be popular, feuding with her best friend and mother, and ultimately trying to figure out what to do with her life. Things are tough for her and she examines her relationships with friends and family to ultimately come to the best decision for herself.The film sounds like a typical film plot. In many ways it is. Yet everything about the film is done so well in the expert hands of novice filmmaker Greta Gerwig. The dialogue is sharp, hilarious, and witty. The character development, interaction, and acting are all strong. Saoirse Ronan is at the very least sealing an Oscar nomination for best actress and might even go on to win it. It seemed like such an effortless performance for a girl who completely disappears into the character idiosyncrasies of Lady Bird. Its a wonderful coming of age film that hits all the check marks and does so very effectively.I can't think of any complaints. The film feels so real and identifiable. Its exactly what you want and is a very impressive debut from Gerwig. The film has a nice touch at the end and does what it needs to do to remain funny and touching. I don't mind a good coming of age comedy every year (Edge of Seventeen taking the cake last year). I expect this to be an award contender for at the very least Ronan's performance and Gerwigs writing and directing.8/10"
LADY BIRD,17 March 2019,10/10,"I watched this movie in the beginning of 2018 and re-watched it today, I didn't know if I would like it then but I got blown away in how well made the movie is, the crew behind it have created a piece of art. The cast portrays the characters in such a realistic way, you feel the emotion in a powerful way. Greta Gerwig directed and wrote the movie, making her the true star of the movie as she created a coming of age story so moving and loving about a relationship between daughter and mother, it's a masterpiece in its genre.The ensemble cast is superb, but the two that stand out is Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf who portrays the daughter and mother, simply Oscar worthy performances. How we get to see everything from Lady Bird's perspective is what makes it great but you can also see the depth of the other characters like the mother. A character that has a lot of problems similar to the protagonist but us a viewer can see that she's actually a great mother but can't help her own problems. Wonderful wiring for the characters."
LADY BIRD,20 November 2017,10/10,"I love ""Lady Bird"". Watching Writer and Director Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" is seeing life happen. Saoirse Ronan plays self-named ""Lady Bird"" Christine, the Catholic Girl School senior doing her best to leave her hometown in Sacramento in 2002. Laurie Metcalf plays Marion – Christine's Mother, who is the workaholic nurse covering double shifts to make ends for her family. Her husband, Lady Bird's Dad Larry, played by understanding Tracy Letts, who suffers clinical depression is laid off from his job. Lady Bird has a ""step-brother"" Miguel, played by bright Jordan Rodrigues, the UC Berkeley graduate working at 7 Eleven. Lady Bird and her Mom have the biggest hearts, yet often not gracious for each other. Lady Bird's chaste boyfriend Danny, played by Lucas Hedges, confesses ""Your Mom is so hard on you"" Lady Bird defends, "" She loves me."" In the moving scene, Lady Bird and Mom shop for prom dresses. Lady Bird asks her Mom, ""Do you like me?"" Mom replies ""I want you to be the best version of yourself."" Lady Bird says, ""What if this is the best version?"" Apparently, that isn't enough. They break your heart. Ronan and Metcalf have profound authentic screen partnership. Ronan is raw, hysterical, and compassionate. Metcalf is strength and tenderness in her quiet and measured words. ""Lady Bird"" is hilarious and touching in humanity. It celebrates being and loving the best version of yourself, acknowledging the unconditional love of those who see and listen you as greater. Director Gerwig's debut feature boldly looks at life touching all our hearts. In the opening car ride home after visiting State universities Lady Bird and Mom argue. Lady Bird wants to go to college back East. Her Mom reminds that they can't afford that, and besides she doesn't have the grades. Hysterically, Lady Bird opens the car door and leaps out the moving car. Later we see her back in Catholic School with pink cast on her broken arm. Gerwig brilliantly captures our attention. Lady Bird's best friend is Julie, played by kind hearted Beanie Feldstein, who is the sweet girl who suffers some over her appearance. Her divorced Mom has a live-in boyfriend. Math whiz Julie crushes on her teacher Mr. Bruno, played by Jake McDorman. Lady Bird would like to be on the Math Team, but she isn't good at math as Sister Sarah Joan, whimsically wise Lois Smith, points out. Instead the Sister convinces her to try acting in a play with another school. It's love at first sight for star Danny, gentle Hedges. Danny from the big Catholic family betrays Lady Bird in the surprise reveal. In her cultural exploration she jettisons BFF Julie for rich girl Jenna, haughty Odeya Rush, and pursues her romance with mysterious loner musician Kyle, charming Timothee Chalamet. Turns out mysterious is really the conspiracy theorist kid with the tragic family. Meanwhile, Lady Bird enrolls her Dad (Lett) to help her apply to East coast colleges unbeknownst to Mom. Lady Bird does her best to invent that best version of herself. Ronan makes us laugh and cry along the way. I laughed so hard while Lady Bird and Julie lie on the church floor eating communion wafers discussing the uses of ""shower heads"". When Ronan compassionately hugs Danny, who confesses his fear, I cried. When she holds Julie who doesn't have a prom date, who says ""Some of us aren't built for happy."" I had the biggest smile. As exasperated Mom tells her daughter, ""It's never enough!"" that breaks Lady Bird's heart and ours.""Lady Bird"" has the biggest heart of any movie I've seen. Ronan makes this so. Ronan and Metcalf reveal that unconditional love of Mother and Daughter in their fierce words and silence. They touch with their humanity. We are all the better for it. In the end saying, ""I love you"" is more than just thanks. That expresses the best version of ourselves. I think ""Lady Bird"" is the best movie of the year. At least it is my very favorite."
LADY BIRD,8 March 2019,9/10,"It's weird to think that 2003 was 15 years ago. As someone who graduated high school in 2004, Lady Bird (2017) hit me right in the nostalgia. While there have been plenty of coming-of-age films over the years, Lady Bird simplifies the experience to a quick-paced trot through the senior year of high school for the titular character (portrayed to great effect by Saoirse Ronan). All the trappings of the coming-of-age story are there, including experimentation with drugs, sex, and alcohol, but done in a way that is still innocent and child-like. In the end, Lady Bird is about independence and defining who we are as individuals.What really hits home in the narrative of this film is the things we do to make ourselves stand out. From declaring that our name is different from the one our parents gave us to choosing which friends we spend our time with, we inevitably realize that we're seeking approval and acceptance from others. The trick with these statements of individuality is that they can sometimes backfire, pushing those who already loved us away at the expense of gaining approval from those who could care less about us.What I found interesting about this film being set during the 2002-2003 school year was how it didn't stray too much from its focus on Lady Bird. Sure, there were hints about the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and the downfall of tech companies during the dot-com bubble, but they were used more as drivers for sub-plots and didn't need anything more than a passing mention. There were plenty of sub-plots in Lady Bird, but they never distracted from the main storyline, acting merely as moments to let the audience know what's happening with the other characters Lady Bird interacts with regularly. Of course, with a scant 94 minutes to cover a year of independence and maturity, these sub-plots needed to be short.A simple and timeless example of how teens find out who they are, I give Lady Bird 4.5 stars out of 5."
LADY BIRD,10 January 2018,10/10,"Teenagers today may think their more advanced then teens of the past, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. True, technology has made the world smaller for them and they have a greater access of content, but as soon as they enter high school, a lot of those kids cannot fathom a world where despite talking about serious issues, they are still treated like children. They wouldn't believe it, but that's been the American teenage lifestyle for a long time. They want to be seen for their individuality and their enthusiasm to try and make a difference. They definitely deserve to be heard, but perspective is something that cannot gain until they experience it.Kids need to trial the complications of school, work, relationships, sex, and even of their own hobbies. What separates newer kids today is that because of social media and an overuse of the Internet, many assume that just seeing more of that can substitute for the real thing. No matter what background they come from, they'll see the troubles of all those things once they actually encounter them. For one teenage girl, she experiences all of that and them some in Lady Bird. Christine ""Lady Bird"" (played by Saoirse Ronan) is just starting her last year in a Catholic high school where her hope is to get away from Sacramento and move to New York. She see's it as an escape from her tough willed mother Marion (played by Laurie Metcalf), her more understanding, but depressed father Larry (played by Tracy Letts), and from a place where she feels is nowhere. She talks about those dreams with her closest friend Julianne (played by Beanie Feldstien). Lady Bird is then told that if she wants a chance to get into any out of state schools, she'll have to participate in extra curricular activities to make up for her okay grades.She joins theater. At first this seems successful, with her performing in the fall play, and even gaining a boyfriend Danny (played by Lucas Hedges). When things go wrong, she continues to look for ways to fit in with the popular ""cool"" crowd, which includes rich girl Jenna, and another boyfriend, the rocker emo Kyle (played by Timothee Chalamat). She also continues to battle her mother while keeping it secret that most of the schools she applied to were out of state. On the surface, Lady Bird seems to hit a lot of tropes that many teen films have already covered. The angst teenager, wanting to be popular, getting the boy of her, dreams, you know the drill. What separates it is how the script (written and directed by Greta Gerwig) plays out many of these moments. First, many scenes are presented in mid conversation. This oddly not only feels a bit more like how adult come into teenage monologues, but this gives us more of a chance to fill in the gaps to see how much the characters know. Second, none of the things ""Lady Bird"" is trying to do isn't an overall goal, but presented as things that could help.The main relationship that is the focus is on ""Lady Bird"" and her mother. I have to give this a lot of credit given how a lot of stories tend to shoe teenage girls having the rough relationship with their father, but people tend to forget that mothers can be just as hard on girls. This is why both Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf are perfect for their characters. Their both flawed people, and seeing how things play out for them is interesting. They can both say really mean things and good things, yet it never goes too far, cause they know they need each other for their purposes.I've praised her before, but Saoirse Ronan is a phenomenal actress who isn't just a nice face, but has the skill to make herself awkward enough for her to appear normal. It's easy to notice that she has an acne-ridden face (I want to know how she was convinced to go with that), which is also something film rarely portrays. I think there is a fear that pimples or any imperfections on a woman are sinful. Not all girls will have faces and bodies of goddesses. I give Greta Gerwig credit wanting to portray teenagers in an unappealing way; harsh, yet often the case anyway for insecure people.I'll give this ten graded math quizzes out of ten. Lady Bird may sound run of the mill, but I promise that the movie does feel a lot different from other teenage movies (I still consider Mean Girls and The Perks of Being a Wallflower the best). Teenage life isn't easy, but this movie shows how they won't see the truth until the witness the perspective. Check it out, and see if you'll grow up too."
LADY BIRD,9 December 2017,9/10,"Greta Gerwig has more than earned her fair share of praise for her writing, such as scripts with Noah Baumbach like Frances Ha and Mistress America, and I find her a very warm and welcome presence in any, or pretty much all films that I see her in as an actress. She has a fine range of showing great humour and delivers and writes comedy and comedic moments very well, but she also has something about her and the films that she writes, or stars in that allows us to connect with her and just almost in a sense be around her and spending two hours, or an hour an a half with her is never boring, or a waste of time, but always these are very fulfilling and rewarding movie experiences and sometimes they can bring about great joy, or even cause you to reminisce about yourself and what certain situations were like for you that present themselves in her movies and often they can cause you to laugh, cry and even reflect, or look deep in yourself and for someone who looks for a little something more when I go to the theatre, I find these particular qualities worth very much and can instantly make a film a masterpiece in my mind. Having now just seen her directorial debut, Lady Bird, I am glad to say that everything I had just written above about her performances and her other writing credits can all safely be said for this new piece of work as well. Gerwig does not herself star in this new film and yet it is embodied with her charm and sense of self discovery and worth that most of her work brings about. Saoirse Ronan, who is a very great actress on her own, gives what I would consider to be the best performance of her very short, but what is sure to be a very lengthy career because how not just with this role, but previous ones as well, where she can totally immerse herself into any kind of character, or genre, so flawlessly and each time deliver a performance that can be subtle yet very powerful and here I think she gives a screen presence that shows just as Gerwig can deliver comedy, or comedic scenes, so can Ronan, and yet this is also a performance and film of great emotional depth and a film that requires much soul searching not just for the actors, but for us watching as well. Ronan captures what can be one of the hardest roles to nail down perfectly and that is playing a teenager and young adult who are trying to forge their way ahead in life and meeting any and all obstacles on the way. We see how at many times and stages of her life that she just wants to be noticed and accepted by those around her, from her peers to even winning the approval of her mother, who may seem distant and uncaring and yet loves her unconditionally, even if she has a difficult time showing it. We see how things for Ronan's character 'Lady Bird' as she calls herself is not always the most easy at home as her father who is a warm and deeply caring man is dealing with unemployment and because of this and other issues, has been dealing with depression issues for years. The household income is also a problem causing them to be extremely careful with their expenses and having the mother working at any and all hours and sometimes even double shifts to help care for her family. Lady Bird goes to a catholic school and yet seems to have no real exploration of faith, or any sense of a higher power, or belief system which is something that seems to change as she gets a bit older and also question the bigger and more important issues in life. There are the added pressures of fitting in at school, dating, sex and just trying to carve out her way and have a prosperous and rewarding future. Lady Bird has done many acts of rebellion and makes a lot of mistakes on the way, but this is also a sense of growing and yet after each fall she seems to pick herself up and eventually develops the emotional maturity and outlook that will get her not only through high school, but into the tricky stage of being an adult. Ronan's character brings about much joy and laughter and yet there are also times where we come close to tears and can identify with this character in more ways than one. The supporting performances by Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts, are moving and essential to this film. There were a couple of scenes with Metcalf, where her performance is so true and yet moving, I could feel tears building in my eyes, especially in a couple of select and yet beautifully moving scenes. Gerwig proves that she not only has the capability to act and write, but also to direct and put together a film that any young, or older person can identify with in some way shape, or form and is not only an enjoyable ride, but an enlightening and moving one that makes this film one that will linger long after you have watched it and is powerful enough to make you look at life and things a little differently. For this great sense of the human spirit and how great Gerwig masters writing what it means to be human, this makes the film a grand achievement that I think will only improve after repeat viewings. This is already an awards darling and expect it to continue to dominate any and all awards for very good reasons."
LADY BIRD,5 December 2017,7/10,"Here's a movie that will make every ten best list this year. Laurie Metcalf's performance will be honored this award season. Satires Ronan may be a tad old to play a high school girl. Good supporting performances all around.The movie has many moments. Ronan bails from the car rather then take her mom's abuse. She encounters her boy friend in an uncomfortable situation. She bails on her so called friends to get to the prom. So many moments that work.It's a small movie that is getting good theatrical distribution. If you miss it in theater it is the kind of mother daughter relationship movie that will play well in the comfort of your home. Is it a ""chick flick""? If so it's an excellent chick flick."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird tells the story of Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson(Saorise Ronan). Lady Bird is in her final year of high school. Christine's daily life is chronicled, in her hometown of Sacramento, California. Lady Bird is an amazing film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a simple yet highly entertaining movie, of a headstrong girl who will stop at nothing to achieve her dreams. Gerwig expertly balances the comedic & dramatic moments. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Saorise Ronan is spectacular as Lady Bird McPherson. Ronan is becoming one of the finest young actresses in Hollywood, after similar performances in The Grand Budapest Hotel(2014) & Brooklyn(2015). Laurie Metcalf is outstanding as Marion McPherson. The dynamic between Ronan & Metcalf's characters makes this film, unforgettable. Tracy Letts is brilliant as Larry McPherson. Lucas Hedges is superb as Danny O'Neill. Timothee Chalamet is awesome as Kyle Scheible. Beanie Feldstein is excellent as Julie Steffans. Lois Smith & Stephen Henderson are good as Sister Sarah Joan & Father Leviatch, respectively. Odeya Rush, Jordan Rodriguez & Marielle Scott are impressive as Jenna Walton, Miguel McPherson & Shelly Yuhan, respectively. Lady Bird is a must watch. Go, relive your rebellious teenage years again."
LADY BIRD,7 December 2017,8/10,"Let me start by saying that, clearly, I am not the target audience for this movie. This is a movie to be seen by High School and College age females and their mothers.That said, I enjoyed LADYBIRD for what it was - a quirky, independent coming of age film with strong acting, a quirky central character and a strong, peculiar point of view (and voice) driven by writer and director GRETA GERWIG.So, let's start with Ms. Gerwig - she has been the Independent film world's ""IT"" girl for quite some time with such small off-beat films as FRANCES HA and HANNAH TAKES THE STAIRS, Gerwig has cornered the market on quirky, one-of-a-kind characters that Diablo Cody was known for 10 years ago. And that is an apt comparison, if you liked Cody's JUNO, then you'll like Gerwig's LADY BIRD. Much like that 2007 Oscar nominated Indy, LADY BIRD is quirky, interesting, strong in dialogue and character and low in plot. This doesn't mean it's bad, it's just meandering and takes its time getting to where it wants to go, if, indeed, it ever gets there. Gerwig's direction and writing is sure- handed - she knows exactly what she wants and how she wants to go there. I'm convinced that Gerwig will get her Oscar for this film (for Original Screenplay like Cody in JUNO) and, perhaps, just might get a Best Director nod for this as well (much like Jason Reitman got for JUNO).Speaking of Oscars, I decided to go see this film as I heard that SAOIRSE RONAN was a shoo-in for a best actress nomination (like Ellen Page Received for JUNO) and I couldn't agree more. Her work as an actress throughout the years has grown stronger and more confident and her performance as LADY BIRD is her strongest work yet. She portrays a complete character and, more importantly, a complete person who is relatable, yet unattainable. I was entranced by her character and her performance.LADY BIRD's quirkiness is counter-balanced by Laurie Metcalf's work as LADY BIRD's no-nonsense, ""get to the core of it"", unsympathetic mother. This was the surprise of the film for me. I didn't think that Metcalf had this kind of performance in her. Someone, please, get her an Oscar nomination for this work/role. As of right now, I think she is my frontrunner for Best Supporting Actor.Also lending strong work is Lucas Hedges as LADY BIRD'S boyfriend (that's 3 strong performances in a row for Hedges, following an Oscar Nominated turn in MANCHESTER BY THE SEA and as Frances McDormand's son in another Oscar favorite, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI) and another Indy darling, Tracy Letts as LADY BIRD'S father.I'm glad I saw this film in the movie theater as the pacing is slow and the acting takes it time, so - as a captured audience - I remained transfixed to the screen. If I was watching this at home, I'm afraid, I'd have started looking at my phone or some other distraction.But, if you are a teen-early 20's female or a mother of a teen/early 20's, bring a hanky, you're gonna need it.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
LADY BIRD,30 May 2020,6/10,"While perfectly enjoyable, I'm not quite sure Lady Bird deserves all the acclaim it has received. This is little more than a light-hearted coming-of-age story and simply doesn't commit itself to any particular dynamic. There is some stuff about friendship, some stuff about relationships and heartbreak, some stuff about family and some stuff about school. It's well-acted and mildly amusing but there are no risks with the storyline and no real exploration of the main characters. I did enjoy Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf's performances but overall the film left me fairly underwhelmed."
LADY BIRD,2 May 2021,8/10,"I enjoyed this film. I thought it was well written in terms of what our main character goes through during her school years. It has its moments of cringe-worthiness in terms of how she acts towards her parent, but to a degree it's understandable. Sometimes you wish she would back down and show more respect, but at the same time, it's not always hard to see where she's coming from.The characters are pretty interesting to watch. They all work well off each other in terms of the story and the conflict throughout the movie. It's amazing what she has to go through in order to get into the school she wants to enroll in.The cinematography's pretty good. The shots of California are really nice. I would sure love to visit that state when I get the chance.Lady Bird's an interestingly great movie. I like the dialogue (though some of their antics can get ridiculous), the characters and the story. Do you always side with the characters? No, but you at least relate to them in some way. If you like drama and coming-of-age, this's for you."
LADY BIRD,27 November 2017,8/10,"In one of the funniest films of the year, Greta Gerwig writes and directs about the travails of a teenage girl in Sacramento, California. Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) hopes to make her own path in life despite warnings from her mother Marion McPherson (Laurie Metcalf). With her father Larry McPherson (Tracy Letts) struggling to keep a job, the expenses of college weigh on Lady Bird. She would like to go to a college on the East coast far from Sacramento but her mother would prefer she stay close. The two of them do not always get along and their arguments escalate so far that Lady Bird throws herself out of the car in the first stunning scene of the film. With her arm in a cast, she attends the senior year of high school at a Catholic school because her adopted brother Miguel (Jordan Rodrigues) saw someone get stabbed in public school.Miguel went to Berkeley but has moved back into their parents' home with his wife Shelly (Marielle Scott) to bag groceries. Lady Bird doesn't always fit in at the school but she and her best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) find happiness on the outskirts eating the holy wafers and gossiping about boys and masturbation. Lady Bird meets Danny (Lucas Hedges) while auditioning for a musical and they soon fall in love. She attends his family's Thanksgiving dinner upsetting her mother but seeing what life is like on the wealthier side of the train tracks. However, another boy Kyle (Timothée Chalamet) catches her eye and when Lady Bird stumbles onto Danny making out with another guy in the boys' bathroom, it ends their relationship quickly. Danny struggles to come out to his family and begs Lady Bird not to tell anyone. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
LADY BIRD,8 March 2018,10/10,"When did you grow up? I am now 57, and I'm still ""working towards""! I remember distinctly though at the age of 16 thinking ""I've got there"". And then again at 18. And then again at 21. And then again at 25.... There is something sweet about the certainty of youth that only life's ultimate experiences can roughen the edges of.""Lady Bird"", the directorial debut of Greta Gerwig, features one such teen who thinks she knows it all. Looking and acting for all the world like a 15 year old (something that Margot Robbie really can't pull off in ""I, Tonya"") Saoirse Ronan plays Christine McPherson who has the given name (""I gave the name to myself"") of 'Lady Bird'. She is struggling with a lot of issues: an unreasonable and overbearing (parents: read 'perfectly reasonably but firm') mother (Laurie Metcalf, ""Roseanne""); the issues of puberty and young love; the constrictions of a Catholic school she despises; and her inability to perform to the grades she needs to get into a college of her choice. That choice being on the East coast as far away from the backwater of Sacremento (""the mid-west of California"" - LoL) as she can get.Love comes in the form of two serial male fixations: the gorgeous and artistic Danny (Lucas Hedges, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", ""Manchester By The Sea"") and the aloof and enigmatic Kyle (Timothée Chalamet, ""Call Me By Your Name"").This is a near perfect coming of age film. The plot, while fairly superficial and covering ground well-trodden before, fully engages you and makes the running time just fly by. And there is just so much talent on show. The script by Gerwig is chocker-block full of great and memorable lines; Ronan is pitch-perfect as the irascible and cock-sure teen; Tracy Letts (""The Post"") is magnificent in the less showy role as the ""good cop"" dad, struggling invisibly with his own demons; and Metcalf gives an Oscar-nominated performance that really should give Alison Janney a run for her money... a drive away from an airport conveys just perfectly every college-age parent's emotional low-point.Where perhaps the film overplays its hand a bit is in the ""wrong side of the tracks"" line. The household while struggling is by no means trailer-park poor (compare and contrast with ""I, Tonya""): perhaps this is the depths of financial desperation found in Sacremento? But I doubt it... there still seems to be money available for fancy cowgirl outfits.Which leads me to the rating, which seems to have been a common rant in the last few weeks. I would have thought that there was nothing like this film to turn the mirror of reasonableness on a young teen, perhaps helping them to treat their parents better, work harder for college or make better choices. Yet it has a UK 15 certificate. And for what? There is a full frontal male photo-spread in ""Playgirl"" (I want to say ""it's a penis, get over it"", but if forced I would have frankly just snipped the 50 milliseconds out to get the lower rating). And there are a few (only a few) F- and C- words. I have the same problem here as with ""Phantom Thread"" - here is a high-class film that a young teen audience would absolutely love to see. I think the BBFC have got it wrong again here.I cannot recommend this film enough: a tale of teenage life love and resolution that is hard to beat. Possibly one of the best coming of age tales I've ever seen. On the basis that it looks like I will never get to see ""Call Me By Your Name"" - the only major one I've missed - before this Sunday's Oscar ceremony, what a great way to round off my Oscar-viewing season."
LADY BIRD,30 April 2020,4/10,"Every now and then comes along a film that is totally hyped by the clever clog film critic fraternity. When you actually see it for yourself you are left totally underwhelmed! Lady Bird is such a film.In some quarters it is actually rated as one of the best films ever. Now come on! So what is the premise I hear you ask?Well, it is basically a semi-autobiographical version of director Greta Gerwig's teenage years. It explores the relationship between an overpowering mother and her independent minded daughter. The daughter called Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson (Saoirse Ronan).The film does have some funny moments in the interchange between Lady Bird and her mother. Lady Bird wants to leave home so desperately that she has applied for college in New York to escape her Sacramento, California roots.It's a good job the film was only 90 or so minutes long or I would have lost interest early on."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2019,8/10,"Same feeling i had to the film before
a film with strong characters that kind of gives me a good strong nostalgia feeling
kind of a guilty pleasure cause i feel like people would rate this lower usually but glad to see it is given a good praise."
LADY BIRD,26 September 2018,4/10,"MEH, THIS is BORING.
I feel like I am the only one that didn't enjoy this movie"
LADY BIRD,10 January 2018,9/10,"It's easy to look at films like Lady Bird and think of it as being a pretentious piece of cinema, but there's so much explored under the surface here that makes almost every one of those arguments invalid. I may be slightly biased in terms of enjoying dramas like this, but I genuinely feel that many people will be able to relate to at least one aspect of this movie. This is the definition of an indie film making its way into the mainstream and I must warn that it's not going to be for everyone. Here's why I think you may just fall in love with this movie under the right circumstances.Following a young woman as she awkwardly makes her way through her senior year of high school, Lady Bird explores popularity, family issues, jealousy, and numerous other issues that teenagers face on a daily basis, so if you go into this film having already experienced those years of your life, I guarantee there will be a section of this movie that you can relate to. This is what makes movies like this worth watching, at least in my opinion. It's really just a slice of life about a woman who goes by the alias ""Lady Bird"" throughout the majority of the film. There are many off-beat sequences and characters throughout this film that may turn many viewers off, but I believe they're saved by a tremendously committed performance by Saoirse Ronan.Ronan's performances have always been highlights of every movie she chooses, and Lady Bird is no exception to that statement. Her interaction with her friends, family members, classmates, and teachers all felt incredibly realistic. There are moments where her lines of dialogue do feel scripted which took me out of a few moments, but her delivery is always incredible, so that makes up for the fact that you may feel like you're watching just any old indie film. Her performance makes this film soar, but I think the real star of the show is the editor.The way this film's put together almost felt like a master had been at work for years on a passion project. The editing choices and the overall flow of each and every scene are truly what hooked me on this film more than I thought I would've been. Quite honest, the editor of this film played his own role in this movie, making a possibly boring aspect of the story unique to watch. The use of certain songs being played over and over again also became its own character in the story. Although this may not make it on my list for best films of 2017, I can truthfully say that Lady Bird is one of the more technically impressive films, even if not for effects.In the end, Lady Bird didn't blow me away in terms of storytelling, but the way the film is put together impacted me greatly. That, along with terrific performances and a solid exploration of the psyche of teenagers, really had me applauding by the time the credits began to roll. Personally, I felt as though there were many aspects to love about this movie, but I can't see everyone having the same reaction as I did, especially average moviegoers who aren't used to out-of-the-box filmmaking.As far as the story goes, many independent films have tackles this premise throughout the years, but it's all about how your film is presented and how it emotionally impacts its viewers, and I feel as though Lady Bird does that beautifully. The re-watchability isn't very present here, but it's a nearly flawless one-time viewing experience. Highly recommended to film fans."
LADY BIRD,15 February 2018,8/10,"What a delightful surprise! this 8th nominated Best Movie turned out to be. The trailers didn't impress me much but this is one instance where the trailer doesn't show the best spots in the movie..
Saorise Roman is wonderful in this role , so different from her Academy Award nominated role in Brooklyn, which makes me think after 3 nominations this may just be her year to win.
Her character LadyBird is so likeable and yet at the same time rebellious and a free spirit wanting to break away from the chains of her adolescence and life in suburban Sacramento.
There are two ""coming of age"" movies up for Oscars this year LadyBird and Call Me By Your Name both very different locations and families but in my view Lady Bird is the better movie because in just over 90 minutes instead of over 2 hours it tells the tale of the angst of growing up in a realistic and not contrived way and all the characters are believable especially the mother played wonderfully by Laurie Metcalf . Even though I don't have teenage children ( thank God) but I was able to remember and identify with LadyBird and her determination to want something better in life than her parents had amid huge objections and attempts of control from all the adults around her.
I still predict Frances McDormand will win best Actress but it wouldn't be the first time this award had a tie as the result, if they could do it for Barbra Streisand and Katharine Hepburn they could do it for Francis and Saoirse.
LadyBird is perhaps not the ""best film"" of 2017/2018 but it's up there with them and the acting and script is superb."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,8/10,"A dialogue heavy coming of age drama about a free spirited teenage girl, who prefers to be known as 'Lady Bird' growing up in Sacramento.Set in 2002, we follow the girl's life as she studies and clashes with her mother over almost anything and everything, they have a strange hate / hate relationship that I couldn't really fathom, the emotional scenes are where they interact but mostly fail to connect. The themes are conflict, friendship, family, friction, social classes, and homophobia. I really enjoyed and was engaged throughout.Recommended."
LADY BIRD,14 June 2020,8/10,"This review contains spoilers.Lady Bird is directed and written by Greta Gerwig and stars Saorise Ronan as the titular character, Lady Bird. Lady Bird is a coming of age tale of a teenager preparing to enter college. Along the way, Lady Bird and her family encounter problems of their own.Lady Bird is expertly written. Each of the characters feels distinct and has their own motivations and personalities. The writing and dialogue is the greatest positive the movie has to offer. Greta Gerwig has outdone herself by capturing her hometown feelings of Sacramento into the script. The story's heart and soul are in two characters, Lady Bird and her mother. The movie starts with these two discussing colleges. It is here that Lady Bird makes it clear what her intentions are. She dreams of leaving her past behind and going to college on the East coast. However, her mother does not agree with the plan as she sees Lady Bird as being selfish. The family had undergone financial crisis with much of the parental backstory being told through dialogue. The movie pulls at heart strings of bad teenage mistakes, family troubles, and parental failings. It is the ability to merge through the writing that elevates each of these individual tropes into a solid package.I did find the movie a little blandly directed but that does not detract from the overall experience. I highly recommend Lady Bird.Grade: A"
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,8/10,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)A fantastic coming-of-age story with so much realistic yet heartfelt moments. Wonderful acting from Saoirse Ronan who carries this movie beautifully with tremendous class. Excellent performance from Laurie Metcalf as well.Extremely well-directed with seamless editing, grounded yet good-looking cinematography and fabulous execution of the dialogues, either by using long takes or by the above mentioned flawless editing.Just a couple of issues. The story ends up falling into the genre predictability (save only one or two plot points), even though I need to heavily praise how unconventional and unique it is in approaching each typical situation. There are also some cliche characters who are purposefully stereotypical but a couple of them stretch the line a little bit."
LADY BIRD,26 December 2017,8/10,"Greta Gerwig learned a lot of Noah Baumbach and improved those skills with this great little gem. Its a truly outstanding coming of age feature with a lot of emphasize on its characters, rather than its story which is a good thing. The film was funny, kind of sad sometimes, melancholic and had vibes of nostalgia. The screenplay was excellent and Gerwig's direction extremely solid as it depict the right edges and developed the characters and thus the film absolutely right.
Saoirse Ronan once again proves that she might be the best and most versatile actress of her generation. She turns into another wonderful performance and adds a completely new character to her resume. For sure one of the top performances. It feels like she does it with such an ease, as if she became that character. Ronan was really able to transform. Also Laurie Metcalf was outstanding. She had a lot of things going on with her and the way she made her character handle and struggle with those was also extraordinary. It was also unlike anything I have seen her doing before, far away from her usual cynical characters. 
Tracy Letts is alway great and a role like that fits him wonderfully. Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalemet were all right but nothing special. I liked Lois Smith unconventional nun character.
The soundtrack was well chosen and at the end of the film I kind of wanted a sequel .. as I really love those characters and want to see how they turn out within the years. Gerwig should consider a TV show of them or something. I would watch it!"
LADY BIRD,8 February 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird is a comedy drama written and directed by Greta Gerwig (Nights and Weekends). Starring Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, it is a bittersweet coming-of-age story with the heart of a quirky indie film.In 2002, Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is in her senior year at a Catholic high school in Sacramento, California. Throughout her final year as a student, Lady Bird learns to find her place in the world, who her real friends are, and how important her family is.Despite not actually being an indie film, Lady Bird certainly gives off the vibe of one. Its themes of social acceptance and going with the flow of life are very similar to other coming-of-age films such as Juno and, to a lesser extent, Napoleon Dynamite. The acting and characterisation is solid. Saoirse Ronan gives one of the best performances of her young career to date and breathes a strong amount of life into the titular character which makes us, the audience, feel sympathetic towards what she is going through. Laurie Metcalf is also noteworthy as her mother Marion, an equally as strong woman coming to terms with the fact that her daughter is no longer a small child.I rate it 8/10"
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,5/10,"Maybe if I was not nominated, I would like it even more, but being nominated for a better film and direction, means that winning it is the best movie in all aspects of the year, I'm sorry, but I think it lacks a lot. It is also difficult for me to empathize with a character that I do not like, such as Lady Bird, who is still a real spoiled girl.The script, I do not think it's something incredible, in fact it seems very normal, it's the reflection of a typical middle class family, nothing more. There are no sufferings that many families do not have.The actors are all great, maybe it's the best section of the movie. In fact you manage to empathize a lot with the father and I get to feel sorry for the mother. But I can not with the daughter. She has achieved with her interpretation, falling badly, that has been achieved and it is not easy to do it, the problem is that it is not easy to change that feeling and the film does not get it.I think the movie has the last ten minutes left over, I thought it was over and suddenly I see that it continues, but to not tell anything. Only the last plane and did not need the rest for that plane.Photography is very bad. It says nothing. It is an independent film photograph. It does not treat it anywhere, so it does not help anything in history.I think the address is simple and sometimes even bad. The problem of not knowing how to put the camera in its place is that sometimes I do not know things that should be seen, I explain it in the spoiler zone. It has a good tempo, yes, it does not bore me, but it does not reach more, nor is it a movie that catches me in the armchair.To be the best movie of the year should have a high note in all sections and this does not.Spoiler:When the boy cries and hugs Lady Bird, you do not see her face, the actor is struggling to do well his role and the director is taking him so that you only see the side, as if he did not cry, total, no go.When Lady screams at her mother, asking her to speak to her, you do not see the mother's face. With the situation that the mother has to be there, it would be essential to see her, but she takes it from behind."
LADY BIRD,16 February 2020,7/10,"Soarise, Timothee, Tracey & Laurie put in solid (if not inspiring) turns in this reasonably interesting coming of age drama. It holds your attention but doesn't stand out from all the other very similar dramas or maybe I lack the correct chromasonal mix to appreciate this."
LADY BIRD,26 December 2017,6/10,"A very honest and realistic coming of age film. Lady Bird portrays the confusion and self-discovery of the teenage years which is also affected by the class difference in the life of a high school student. Saoirse Ronan looks like a real teenager going through all these instead of looking like a supermodel which many such films opt to do. However, it can't be said that there was anything that hasn't been shown before that was here or there was anything exceptional in filmmaking techniques. Even though a very good film it's no instant classic as many claims it to be."
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,9/10,"I thought for sure this movie was being overrated. Nope. Great characters and great dialogue. Often that's more than enough. In this case, every moment felt real...the humor and tension all sprung from that place. While the film struggled a bit to find its ending point, that's probably because the director had the same problem I did: she didn't want it to end."
LADY BIRD,5 February 2020,7/10,"Trapped in small town America, dreaming of something bigger, artistic, sophisticated and free. Popular film fodder. Why do we watch films, enjoy films? Maybe not always, but often escapism right? Lady Bird is more than escapism though, yes it's about dreams, but striving for them, chasing them in the face of everyday challenges of the real world and low expectations fostered by others. Adolescence, navigating school, society. It's not that Lady Bird has a bad life, she has a loving family, good friends, but families are tricky, life is tricky. This film is oddly... grounded. Almost dull, run-of-the-mill. Not a lot really happens. Saoirse Ronan, plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson. Why Lady Bird? Why not, she's just looking to stand out, be different, be happy. She's desperate to leave Sacramento, to find excitement, to have experiences. This is all familiar movie territory, but there's perhaps a reason these themes get revisited. They connect with us. We're all constantly coming of age, it doesn't stop when you turn 18, 21, 30... So despite this being a teenage American girls story, like all good stories, there's something here that's bigger, artistic, sophisticated and free."
LADY BIRD,10 December 2017,3/10,"This is not the type of movie anyone would recommend to someone they like. Therefore, the jagoffs on this site seem to think it's okay to recommend to strangers. I don't go to your house and take a dump in your bathroom sink and leave. This is what it feels like with these ""glowing"" reviews of one of the most self-indulgent, explanation of the Millenial jerks who populate this world today. Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is a talentless, subpar student who is determined to propel herself out of the duldrums of Sacramento, California in hopes of a more enriching life in college on the east coast. The reality is, she is stuck in middle class Hell. With a Dad who battles depression and a mother who battles...well, the world. Of course this sad movie needs to saddle itself with quirky brother whom we spend a TON of time wandering how this relationship transpired since the guy is a Mexican. Oooooo...clever. See, Lady Bird is a Catholic school girl delinquent who thinks she has the small town world figured out. Though she is woefully hobbled by...her own naivete, she has no other reason to leave town other than...? She isn't talented in anything. Has no ambition. And quite honestly is annoying. Saorse Ronan plays the titular character, and she does well. But the shining performance HAS to go to Laurie Metcalf. The overbearing yet cautious mother who refuses to allow Lady Bird breathing room. The massive problem with Greta Gerwig is that she wants it all. She wants the ""Sixteen Candle"" scene where Paul Dooley sits at the edge of the couch telling Molly Ringwald how they forgot her birthday (in this movie, they switch it, where her father celebrates her birthday). But they also want you to get a taste of Millennial angst. Here's a hint to Gerwig...no one cares. You're annoying. Everyone in this movie is annoying. Except Metcalf. To that extent, she is, of course needs to win the Oscar for rising above poor over-treaded material. If you've had the slightest sense of a teen movie...this is it. Every single cliché you can think of. The morons here who believe this is unique...Jesus, watch any adaptations of S.E. Hinton. It's far more accurate. You know..because we haven't seen that 2-pump chump joke in comedy before."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2021,8/10,"From Frances Ha, Greta Gerwig showed me her skill as an actress so to see her behind the camera for once made me interested. I'm pleased to say her directorial effort was a success.Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story about Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson living in Sacramento as we see her relationship with her mother, friends and people she meets along the way.From this film, I'm able to see a lot of potential in Greta Gerwig's career as a writer and director. What Gerwig brings to us is a charming, relatable, funny and even nostalgic film about adolescence. Many coming-of-age stories come and go but Lady Bird works in many ways. Gerwig takes a very realistic approach to this story and presents us with characters that are interesting to watch and may have come across in our own lives. Every single character felt like a real person and had a great sense of purpose to Lady Bird's growth and life. I especially loved the relationship between Lady Bird and her mother. The ups and downs they both have together was executed so well and made me truly care about them. Gerwig's script is amazing in particular. The dialogue she has written adds to the factor of these characters feeling real. They interact in a way that almost feels unscripted which contributes to the grounded nature of the film's world and characters. The script is also filled with funny moments. The film does have its fair share of dramatic scenes but there is a lot of comedy involved that managed to land.I thought every single performance was great. Saoirse Ronan is extremely good here and gives one of her best performances as Lady Bird. Laurie Metcalf is also very good as Lady Bird's mother. Beanie Feldstein was also great especially considering how she hasn't acted much. She was very funny and likeable too. Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet were also pretty good in their roles.The only problem I have with this film is the inclusion of a very clichéd storyline involving Lady Bird and her best friend. Whilst I understand it may seem relatable and important for the development of Lady Bird's character, it was a storyline that had been done many times before.Apart from that, I found Lady Bird to be an enjoyable watch. Greta Gerwig has done an incredible job for her first solo directorial feature. There were snippets here and there that I could relate and I'm sure there are parts that will be relatable to many people's lives."
LADY BIRD,9 April 2018,7/10,"The greatest thing about this film is its balance. It's funny, it's touching, it's emotional and it's heartfelt. Some scenes will make you laugh out loud, others will make you shiver and some will make you feel happy. Every emotion is perfectly measured out. Not one single scene is overdone or melodramatic. The theme of the film is classic: growing up. Christine is seventeen and she wants to be different. That's why she calls herself Lady Bird. She lives in Sacramento ('The Midwest of California') and she hates it. That's why she wants to move to the East Coast ('where there is culture'). She attends a high school run by nuns called Immaculate Heart, but she feels she doesn't belong there. That's why she applies for Ivy League universities, defying advice and common sense. All the coming-of-age ingredients are there: the longing for greater things (already in one of the very first scenes), the parents who have forgotten what it's like to be a teenager (one parent in particular, in this case), the joy of turning eighteen, the urge to get away from home.... and I could go on. Because all this has already been done so many times on the big screen, it's difficult to stand out. But director Greta Gerwig has managed just that. Not by adding anything special to the mix of familiar themes, but by showing them just as they are. And by applying the perfect mix of a laugh, a tear, a shiver and some goosebumps."
LADY BIRD,5 June 2020,8/10,"What worked:
amazing screenplay; raw, realistic. It's so pleasantly surprising to see Greta's work. She knows way better what human psychology is and is able to portrayal in her every works, this movie not being an exceptionSaoirse did one of her best workWhat did not work:
I am not complaining but I was expecting an alternate, little bit different ending.Final verdict:
Of course recommended. Every work of Greta is recommended"
LADY BIRD,7 January 2018,6/10,"While the performances of Ronan and Metcalf were very good and the mother/daughter relationship was decently explored, the plot and themes fell short and prevented it from being enjoyable to watch. Many of the character and relationship arcs, such as Lady Bird and Kyle or Jenna or her best friend, were extremely predictable and flat, showing no nuance or multidimensionality. Themes like religion were attempted to be explored but weren't really, and many of the key moments seemed sloppily and not tactfully done, of which the bathroom scene is a prime example. All in all, not a bad movie by any means, but also not one which I found enjoyable to watch and one which I am not left with much to ponder beyond generic and simplistic ideas of mother/daughter love/hate relationships, struggles in exploring sexuality, social pressures in high school, and so on."
LADY BIRD,5 February 2018,5/10,"I've had a few people get upset at my calling this movie overrated, but I honestly did not enjoy it much at all. Yes, the acting is good, not Oscar-worthy in my opinion but good. Otherwise, I was bored, underwhelmed, and unimpressed. I can sort of see where people are coming from when they hail it as an incredibly emotional work of art, but I cannot agree with them.I was expecting this to be similar to the Perks of Being a Wallflower, but really it turned out to be like the high school movies that came out during the early 2000's in a lot of ways. Now, high school movies like Mean Girls and 10 Things I Hate About You may not be that emotionally resonant or deep, but they can at least be entertaining. Perks of Being a Wallflower I actually found to be a rather boring movie, but I was at least able to look back at it and get something of value out of it. Lady Bird does neither of these things. There were a couple of light moments that I was amused by, but I would not call it a comedy. The social conflicts that Lady Bird has with her friends is rather standard, which calls the value of the movie into question. I know it's maybe a bit harsh to give a movie an objective value like that, but I just don't feel like this movie needed to be made since it didn't bring anything new to the table. The mother-daughter relationship was better in that regard, but it wasn't given as much attention as the weaker relationships in the movie.It was pretty easy to tell this was an autobiographical work. I don't think that is objectively true, but from what I have gathered the movie is largely based on Greta Gerwig's own high school experiences. Going into the movie I did not know this, but I knew it must be true as I was watching it because there was no other explanation for the aimlessness (or even nonexistence) of the plot. There were a few big dramatic moments, but most of the movie is just stuff happening and Lady Bird getting emotional about it. Again, I can sort of understand how people might relate to this, but there was so many things that happened that weren't relevant to each other. Yes, life does not obey narrative rules most of the time, but narratives are meant to put our lives into perspective a little more. And in my eyes, this movie just threw narrative out the window. The point that this frustrated me the most was during the prom night scene when Lady Bird goes back to Julia. Considering how bad of a friend Lady Bird had been to Julia, I felt like she did not deserve Julia's sympathy unconditionally.On the upside, there was some decent talent that was showcased here. The acting was pretty good from all parts, particularly Laurie Metcalf. Even though I strongly disagree with Greta Gerwig's nominations for best director and best screenplay, I don't think she did poorly in either regard. I would encourage her to pick a different story to tell next time around, but I would not discourage her from making another movie of her own.Despite everything bad that I've said about this movie, I've talked to many people who liked it. So I won't tell people not to see it. If you want to see it because of the hype around it, just know that it's rather similar to Boyhood in that its charm lies in being true to life and relatable rather than telling a good raw story. If you love this movie, good for you, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Overall Rating: 5.2/10."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird - It's somewhat like what you'd get if you'd crossed ""Ghost World"" with ""Juno"" but not as good as either of those. It's not bad, just not great either. It's adequate in every department, but fails to reach greatness and also lacks that certain something that made the aforementioned movies stand out, it is worth a watch though!"
LADY BIRD,10 January 2021,4/10,"Lady Bird (Or: How a Self-Centered, Insufferably Egotistical Young Girl Bullies and Berates Her Family for Circumstances That Are Outside of Their Control, Never Appreciating a Single Damn Thing People Do for Her).
Good Lord, Lady Bird is a despicable character. And perhaps that's a testament to Saoirse Ronan, who plays her, because there's no doubt in my mind that nobody who exists in the real world could be as insufferable and ungrateful as her character is. This film, through a series of events rather than anything resembling a concrete plot, details her ""coming of age,"" offering very little of substance both in terms of the story and in character development. Every single time this character shows something even remotely resembling character development, it's completely destroyed as, in the very next scene, she's treating people the exact same horrible way. We get a little bit of character development at the very end but there's no doubt in my mind that, had this film been just a little bit more longer, she would've continued to bully and abuse her mother, who works hard to give Lady Bird a good life. It's just a shame that she's such a closed-minded privileged brat that she can't appreciate everything that was done for her.
Laurie Metcalf is absolutely phenomenal as Lady Bird's mother, a hard-working and tough yet loving mother who, as I said, wants her daughter to have the best. She's a terrific actor, using her eyes to reflect the sadness and remorse she feels at her daughter's childish discontentment, and it's done so well that it brings a tear to the eye of the viewer who is forced to be a fly on the wall to witness the detestable brat's behaviour.
Timothee Chalamet is good, as expected, but his role isn't as big as it ought to have been. And the script was written by someone who really doesn't understand how adolescent boys talk, because the dialogue was both forced and extremely unnatural. It's a likely possibility that Timothee was contracted into this film, rather than actually being enthused about the project.
The cinematography is beautiful, as is the music. The music really tries to be emotionally manipulative to make you feel a certain way, but it doesn't really do its job. The film itself has a quality score but the script lacks the buy-in for a viewer to really care about the emotional moments. Even with what was intended to be a high-emotional conclusion, it just falls flat. It feels dead on arrival, incomplete.
This is one of those instances where you watch a movie just because you like an actor that's in it. I'll admit, I'm guilty of that here. I want to see everything Chalamet was in, but this one gets a hard pass from now on. Lady Bird needs to seriously get over herself."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,10/10,"As I always do, I first read the comments of those reviews at the bottom of the list because they give me a ""rudder"" as to the believability of the comments to follow. After seeing the film, I must admit that I find these comments dare I say, silly.Diane and I viewed the film and emerged with similar thoughts as to its intentions. It is an obvious thought to report that the film was just a copy of male traverses through adolescence but set in a female perspective. The lead actor relates situations about maturation from a female perspective, but that is what distinguishes this film: it is a FEMALE perspective rather than the more typical male passage. I do not consider it detrimental that the script deals with similar occasions in the life of young adults.
I trust that the considerable talent behind this film will continue examining the difficulties of female adolescent passage through the minefield of maturation. I consider it a critical examination of both sexes and both generations."
LADY BIRD,14 October 2018,7/10,"I like a good coming of age movie, and that includes this one. But Oscar nominated? That seems like a stretch. There were some good story interactions, but when it started out early with Lady Bird jumping out of a movie car,(in the trailers so not a spoiler) I really expected it to be more wild like that throughout. It was much tamer after that, and it did feel realistic. Stylistically, it was cut very quickly, from one shot to the next which keeps you paying close attention. Overall, I'd recommend it for those who like the genre, just forget about the Oscar hype."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,10/10,Ladybird was not what I expected. Yes it's a coming-of-age of a young lady and the conflicts with her dominate mother. But it's has a deeper sense of loss of innocence and how youth is wasted on the young. Often young people are in a hurry to grow up. When in reality we should live in the present and not worry about the future so much. Because in the end it all works out. Good acting and emotionally compelling story.
LADY BIRD,14 February 2020,10/10,"...being the social and economic underdog, and to those parents you think you hate or forget to think about at all. Lady Bird is this and so much more other things. But Greta Gerwig, channeling her best traits and letting the material breathe the essence of her mumblecore background and not the totality of it, ensures Lady Bird, this layered, rich film, feels simple and easy. It's often hilarious but in between it's incredibly raw and emotional. The apparent simplicity creates a sort of transcendent link between Gerwig's characters and you. I think that's probably what led to it's success. It's sort of universally real and universally honest in its silliness and it's sadness."
LADY BIRD,22 March 2020,,"Worth watching for the acting and the view of Sacramento - nice to see a different city than the usual US cities - NY, LA, San Francisco, etc...Unsurprising it has received so much praise as it ticks all the PC boxes dutifully - an alternative girl who doesn't wear make up, her fat friend, a gay guy unable to come out, parents with economic problems, a short fling the heroine has with 'cool' friends and trying to fit in with them - ditching fat friend, etc. Well, I won't hold that against it. Mostly entertaining and well made. Only looked at my watch a couple of times. Liked the dad best as the mum seemed a bit of a nutter and the daughter heading in that direction."
LADY BIRD,14 December 2020,1/10,"This girl was a narcissist asshole! Such a selfish, rude, self-centered jerk. I just spent the movie wishing I had one of those TV Bricks from the 70's to chuck at her head every time she was on the screen. Laurie Metcalf, sadly, couldn't save this Titanic failure of a story. How did it get 5 Oscar nods?? Must have been from a bunch of super snooty narcissist who relate to this train wreck of a child. ICK!! :O Thank God it didn't win any Oscars!! I would rather shove shards of glass under my finger nails than watch this TRIPE again!! PASS!!!"
LADY BIRD,8 December 2017,7/10,"This realistic coming of age story and ode - of all places - Sacramento, California brings an economic and family relational honesty largely missing from Hollywood movies. The biggest achievement of the movie is getting something original and human released by the modern film business. Having made that familiar complaint, likely the international grosses will be paltry - not sure Bejing movie ticket buyers will get many of the Central California references. Domestic audiences will leave with a similar reaction after viewing last year's ""La La Land"" - ""it was very good but not as incredible you hear"". Saoirse Ronan will land a well-deserved Oscar nom for her lead performance. This will cement TheWestchestarian's reputation for pop culture soothsaying given the prediction made in a review of Peter Jackson's awful ""The Lovely Bones"" on the eventual stardom Ronan would achieve based on her first movie."
LADY BIRD,29 January 2018,7/10,"There are many ways to tell a coming-of-age story, but all of them have similar moments of joyful and painful transformation from childhood to adulthood. While clichés are inevitable, the bitter-sweet dramedy Lady Bird (2017) offers a more nuanced portrait of angst-ridden transition to maturity. It stands out from the pack for the beautiful way it frames the story inside the universal love-hate mother-daughter relationship.Like most teenage-girl films, this one feels like a prolonged melodrama because that is what it is. In a typical act of rebellion, 17-year old Christine (Saoirse Ronan) re-names herself ""Lady Bird"". The inverted commas are for anyone who doubts her authorship or right to call herself whatever she chooses. Her depressed but genial father Larry (Tracy Letts) has not been able to find work and her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) works double shifts to keep the family afloat. ""Lady Bird's"" Catholic upbringing in Sacramento is increasingly claustrophobic and her one dream is to get into an east-coast college that has ""real culture"" despite her grades and family finances. In the middle of this stock-standard middle-American family, the quirky brat ""Lady Bird"" battles her tough-love mother while juggling regular problems about friends, romance, and school....like any other teenager.In the absence of an original narrative there is an abundance of great character acting, genuinely funny moments and a finely paced script. The film's heartbeat pulsates in the unbreakable cord between mother and daughter. When it finally loosens, as it must, ""Lady Bird"" reverts to Christine and metaphorically turns into a butterfly. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful in this role, although at 23 years of age her adulthood sneaks through the 17-year old girl she is meant to be. Her facial expressions eloquently convey the crushing moments that mark the transition from girl to woman: like her first lover telling her that ""you are going to have so much un-special sex in your life"", or her priest's warning that ""we never escape our past"" when she is desperate to do so. Ronan's performance relies on reciprocation and Laurie Metcalf is cast to perfection as her maternal foil. The pair switch from brawling cats to best friends in a single blink without loss of authenticity.The joy of this film lies in its unembellished realism: there are no big belly laughs or comedic skits, just many little things that make you smile. ""Lady Bird"" is a heart-achingly ordinary, funny and smart girl from the ""wrong side of the tracks"". Some viewers will recognise parts of themselves, others will enjoy the film through the lens of nostalgia or catharsis. For most, Lady Bird offers a mirror of the emotional, physical, sexual and transcendent moments that shapes our journey into adulthood."
LADY BIRD,20 November 2017,9/10,"Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a teenager in Sacramento, California in Greta Gerwig's solo writing/directing debut. She is not a terribly good student, nor does her family have any money to speak of, but she is committed to attending university in NYC. The film follows her episodically through her last year of high school, showing her relations with friends, boys and her intensely critical mom (Laurie Metcalf). This is a low key, extremely engaging film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but didn't really blow me away as I was watching it. It snuck up on me though ... it has some really beautiful moments that surprise with how they deal with familiar material in novel ways. Playwright Tracy Letts (""Bug"", ""Killer Joe"") is great in a low key role as her father."
LADY BIRD,22 August 2020,2/10,"Nothing original here: just the usual cliches about teenage life.Rather than watch this, try The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)."
LADY BIRD,9 January 2021,7/10,"This coming of age drama tells the story of a late teen girl out of high school and her relationship with family, boys, and mother. It's witty and enjoyable in a sense it's not yet a familiar high school drama. It goes more into a spontaneous depiction of teenage angst and a financially weak family, avoiding the crude humour you usually get in the genre. Aside this, the film is filled with great acting, by far depicting the mother and daughter relationship.By the end though you feel it's a usual teen drama you have been watching and not an Oscar worthy nomination, you still sense a feeling of gratitude. Overall, it's a film that needs to be watched by pre teens to reconcile their remorse.Rating: 2 stars out of 4"
LADY BIRD,25 November 2017,8/10,"A perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes says something. Maybe something more about ourselves than the movie itself. Lady Bird is a charming, engrossing, well-written and acted film. Greta Gerwig would have to concede that her movie breaks no new ground though it certainly covers excellently a niche within a genre; i.e., American high school coming- of-age, as well or better than most. Especially the mother/daughter relationship; e.g., Laurie Metcalf's airport circle cry could jerk tears out of a crash dummy. But the RT hype tells us we are so starved for quality with the state of multiplex fare that we'll elevate a fine take on a tried-and-true vehicle to Citizen Kane status. Call me a snob if you will. I wholly expect and maybe deserve ""2 out of 50 liked this COMMENT"" feedback. But I'm not trying to draw attention to myself or play the devil's advocate. Everyone loved Lady Bird and I had a nice time with it. However, after the tears dry and the gushing ends, it's just a nice movie."
LADY BIRD,26 December 2017,,"Greta Gerwig is the biggest winner of ""Lady Bird"", proving herself to be one of the most promising young directors. What I like her most is that she is a minimalist, in the sense that she uses the most economical way to express the maximum information. Take one scene in the film for example. When Christine (Saoirse Ronan) receives the notification letters from the universities, only key information ""regret"", ""unable"" and ""wait list"" is shown to the audience. Also, when the audience see the ""...mbia University"", they know it's Columbia University.Lucas Hedges proves again that he is the best actor of his generation, following his breakthrough performances in ""Manchester by the Sea"". Laurie Metcalf also shines through the movie by showing a clear transition in the mother character she plays. The music score and soundtrack are pleasant and enjoyable."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2021,5/10,"The parents and Catholic school staff are portrayed as pretty decent people. That's different and refreshing compared to what I was expecting, or have seen in these types of projects. But interestingly, the lead was not portrayed as decent or admirable, and it was largely autobiographical.I don't know if that was meant to be brutally honest, or if the film maker thinks that her protagonist came across as cool and cutting edge. Maybe I'm reading her as a loser, but the story teller thinks her character is hip and misunderstood. Or maybe she does realize that the girl is a self-absorbed wet blanket.Our lead is cynical, spoiled, elitist, sullen, and ironically lacking depth or sophistication, the very qualities she strove for. But her depression is understandable, if not necessarily excusable.She lives in a modest neighborhood and house compared to her peers, and has a scrappy dysfunctional family. It's very unromantic. She has no special talents or looks to bring her good fortune, and she's depressed about it all. I do get that and have some compassion for it.She wanted to experience love and sex, but instead of holding out for something real, she grasped at shallow, inappropriate choices and cheapened her value.She hurt clergy and family with self-righteous indignation and showed little remorse. But she was ultimately supportive of friends whom she previously slighted.But a movie is not about a message per say, it's about how a message is delivered. This one tried to convey the utter frustration of your teenage life being so vastly different from what you want it to be. I did feel that from the passive-aggressive mannerisms of the actress, but I needed more anger and passion. This was too nice and I didn't believe it.The dialog was unnaturally cute and self-conscious and the frustration neutered. It was like that of 80s teen comedy Sixteen Candles, yet I don't think it was shooting for that. You have to dig deeper unless you want me to liken your project to fun fluff.I assume the message was that we should be grateful for the blessings in our life or that there is no place like home. But I barely got any of that here. I needed some statement about how ""culture"" is not all that matters, and how ordinary people and places are every bit as valuable and real as seemingly glamorous locations or pursuits. If I missed that, I apologize.Ultimately our character lacks God, Country or purpose. Apart from making this film and a few forgettable other projects, I think the film maker too, is still pursuing an East Coast artsy lifestyle, with limited talent. But that fits the plot of this film. Because despite our character desperately wanting to be talented or noticed, she wasn't blessed with much.Meanwhile throwing in some foster kids of color was just awkward and pandering. Perhaps it would have been better to have some more diversity at the school, rather than the home."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,1/10,"I really like Ronan And she Is a very talented actress,
But this movie Is the worst kind of growing up, teen drivel Ive seen In

LADY BIRD,23 June 2018,7/10,"Offbeat and off brand, Greta Gerwig's 2017 major studio directorial debut 'Lady Bird' is a tale of angst, stress and a strive for perfection and acceptance. The 2002-set film showcases Sacramento in all its glory - or perhaps, lack thereof - and puts Academy Award-nominee Saorise Ronan in the driver's seat to make an impact on audiences.Think of it as a more mainstream, female 'Napoleon Dynamite,' the themes in 'Bird' are common ones that many young adults can identify with during the confusing, competitive high school years. At the center of the film is Ronan's title character (née, Christine), who stops at nothing to escape her hometown for the east coast while battling her mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf). This rivalry dominates the entire film and helps us understand how one's environment growing up can have a major impact on their choices in life. Between jumping out of moving vehicles, disrupting assemblies at her Catholic high school and struggling with early love, Lady Bird stumbles her way through senior year in pursuit of being part of the ""in crowd.""Of course, this premise offers Gerwig a lot to work with, and her signature dramedic, deadpan tone is a constant throughout 'Bird.' Everything from the way scenes are shot to the quirky music selection are dripping with proverbial eye rolls, and they all work. Sure, there are a few moments that could cause general audiences gasp, but most of them are done in a way that is not mean-spirited or in poor taste. Aside from Ronan's A+ performance, others in the supporting cast don't disappoint, from Lucas Hedges to Timothée Chalamet.'Lady Bird' was not a monster hit, but it has the building blocks to become a cult classic for this generation, similar to the way 'Dynamite' did nearly 15 years ago, and sets up Gerwig and Ronan to become even bigger stars than they already are."
LADY BIRD,29 November 2017,5/10,"Lady Bird (2017) Oh, Greta Gerwig's Quirky coming-of-age tale, So sincere yet sweet, Parents, girlfriends, boys, college. Changing in Sacramento. Still, why the nickname? Why appear a long trailer, Although a great one? Scenes in a blender missing Crucial, instructive segments.

My somonka will be a love& hate letter to a film?) #Somonka #PoemReview"
LADY BIRD,18 February 2018,8/10,"Although this movie explores much trodden territory - a Catholic schoolgirl's coming of age movie - it's one for parents of around my age (50's) rather than the teen lead it features. In that role Saiorse Ronan deservedly nets another Oscar nomination (sadly for her she is up against the imperious Frances McDormand and therefore cannot win) in a performance that is as real and as raw as any you'll see this year.But it's not just Ronan's performance that makes this the movie it is. It's the triangular relationship between her (a disillusioned small town girl from Sacramento who dreams of the creativity and urban rawness of East Coast New York) her driven, ambitious (for her daughter) and seemingly hard-hearted, unemotional mother (Laurie Metcalfe) and her long-suffering, delightful father (Tracy Letts).How the three deal with one another and how those relationships play out are at the heart of a movie that touches the heart-strings many times. Take a hankie.It's not damning Greta Gerwig's directorial debut with faint praise by describing it as nice because it really is, in the finest tradition of the word, a truly nice cinematic experience. It has grit, humour and emotion, but the overwhelming take out is just how 'nice' it is.The first act is hilarious in which 'Lady Bird', the given name (given to herself) of Christine, her best friend Julie and her first boyfriends enact small time life, love and prom-going.The setting, in an all girls' Catholic High School, lends itself to much hilarity, with some excellently original rebellion. My favourite scene is where 'Lady Bird' and Julie scoff a tub of communion wafers whilst talking about sex. (""It's OK. They're not consecrated."")Although the gradual sexual fulfilment that Lady Bird experiences is nothing new Ronan's performance keeps you interested, and when the consequences lead to confrontations and discussions between her and her parents - rarely acted out as a three hander because Mum and Dad lead separate (although still loving) lives - the movie reveals its depth.It's the relationship between mother and daughter that is the real dramatic grit in thi particular oyster. Here Gerwig teases out brilliance by both actors and it's the result of this difficult 'ambitious-mom' tension that drives the movie.As the film reaches its climax how that plays out is what results in the handkerchief moments and leaves you emotionally satisfied in a movie that is greater than the sum of its parts."
LADY BIRD,16 February 2018,8/10,"This review of Lady Bird is spoiler free**** (4/5)CHRISTINE 'LADY BIRD' McPherson is an artistically-inclined girl who wants to be in a different place ""I want to be where the culture is"" she says to her mother. And this stunning story tells it all; 1) She wants to be a better person; 2) She never believes in herself; 3) She always tries to make herself the centre of attention. Writer-director Great Gerwig's directorial debut is a warm, smart and deeply honest drama about the turbulence of teenager's life at that pinnacle moment when they're about to leave childhood and enter the road of becoming an adult. Her writing has humanising moments, as much as she goes through the inspirational routes of other films in the sub-genre; she also hits original straights in her excellent directing. Though she never always puts us on the heroine's side, as her story tackles many harsh turns, however while watching she asks only one task simple task; that we understand the turbulence of Christine's life.
 
And we sure do. Lady Bird is an eloquent, emotional and a warmly original coming-of-age drama that sees director Gerwig as a truly polished filmmaking talent. Christine is frustrated and bored in her small town outside of Sacramento or as she calls it the Midwest of California. She dreams of going to an arts college in New York City, or at least as far away from her current situation as possible - though her despairing family a fun-loving sometimes scary mother (Metcalf) and her out-of-work father (Letts) can only afford a local college. So she's stuck in the turbulent life line of her family life and her school life. Ultimately boarding in the sense of 17-year-old narcissism. 
 
Through the film's heart there's a warm breathtaking center as our teenage heroine overcomes many beautifully set up milestones - losing her virginity through breaking up with her boyfriend (Lucas Hedges), via crushing on the cool guy (Timothée Chalamet) to losing her best friend (Beanie Feldstein). And though these moments may inadvertently sound like conventional teen movies, Gerwig's set-up is anything but. Lady Bird is a cute film but it never steps too far into the cutesy, the singular talent of Gerwig is apparent - well, for young women everywhere anyway having previously wrote Frances Ha and Mistress America her talent is clearly nothing to be trifled with. Her debut is painfully hilarious and historically beautiful and certainly unmissable. 
 
Her skill at writing cool storyline quirks, a beautiful teen story and Saoirse Ronan's characterisation of Lady Bird is something to be credited too, you have to credit her as she beautifully plays this teenage heroine so well, and you could essentially say that it's from memory. That and Gerwig's direction is something that will live long in your memory. Never has a debut been so bright, so assured and heart-warming, well, until now anyway. 
 
VERDICT Ronan gives her best performance ever in Gerwig's beautifully made debut that's better than her previous few films and her hardly poor back catalogue."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,7/10,"""Lady Bird"" is far from enchanting, touching on a subject already very beaten, and without bringing anything new, Greta Gerwig's long is a nice movie and nice to be watched, albeit a little dramatic, is not anything fancy and stands out more for the performances and objectivity of the plot. Usually films that deal with discovery and juvenile dramas tend to be too contemplative, ""Lady Bird"" no, he is sagacious and quick, his script does not have much history to tell or to reflect, so he talks little, and that is great, because we feel her plot better, which tells the story of a teenager in the discovery phase. Technically, the direction is agile, and it knows how to explore the camera angles, especially those of closed plane and internal environments, that suffocate our characters forcing them to express their feelings. Saoirse Ronan is great at the role, even though it is not very expressive, the actress convinces, but in terms of acting, the highlight of the film is Laurie Metcal, the actress who plays an extra deep and exciting role, is the thing that makes the film be remarkable. Finally, ""Lady Bird"" is not a great movie, but it is not a dispensable film, besides being nice, dramatic and fun."
LADY BIRD,8 April 2018,7/10,"The acclaimed dramedy ""Lady Bird"" is ostensibly a tried but true tale of the misfit high school lass who longs to ditch her dreary existence, skip this one-horse hamlet and make it in the big city.But as smartly written and directed by Greta Gerwig the sum of these singularly familiar parts combine to take us to a place well beyond where we typically go with such fare. Taking the helm all on her own for the first time here Gerwig weaves an uncommonly engaging story. Deftly mixing healthy hits of both laughter and tears, she guides us on a journey every bit as eccentric as it is stirring. Not every movie has to have an enduring message. Still, ""Lady Bird"" struck me with this one. The more we may try to distance ourselves from that which has come to define us, the more we are drawn ever nearer to it.And to appreciate the hell out of it."
LADY BIRD,26 October 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird was very well-received at its local premiere at the Paramount Theater for the Austin Film Festival. I found it to be a sweet, charming coming-of-age film. It is a serious film, but with flashes of humor. Greta Gerwing wrote and directed the film which seemed to be partly autobiographical in that she grew up in Sacramento, CA at about the same time as her character. The film is a meditation on what it means to be from some place and what that idea of home means in shaping who you become. She has a love-hate relationship with her city, her family and her place in both. It is also very much a story of young girl struggling with her own and her mother's expectations for herself. The script is really charming with the best scenes being those of Lady Bird and her mother. Lady Bird is struggling with sexuality, family, friendship, religion and even her own name all at the same time. Like all of us, she is trying to find her place in the world. Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Lady Bird as is Laurie Metcalf in the role of her haggard struggling mother trying to hold her family together through difficult times. Recommended to those who like drama, particularly coming-of-age films."
LADY BIRD,21 April 2020,9/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a 2017 tragicomedy directed by Greta Gerwig starring Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. Now that I finally received a copy of one of the most critically acclaimed features of the recent years, I thought I'd go right into it, even more encouraged after so many of my fellow cinephiles expressed their immense love for it. To those who are meant by this: Thank you so much for recommending this absolute gem to me. I was expecting much from it and my expectations were even outdone. I knew that Gerwig is one of the most talented but sadly underrated directors of the past years after watching her powerful adaptation of ""Little Women"" and that I have to check out her solo directorial debut. Well, not only did she direct it, she also wrote the script based upon her own childhood and especially her own catholic upbringing. While she stated that she wasn't as rebellious as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, it's still a lot of Greta in her and also, the same place she located this coming of age drama in is her hometown of Sacramento, California and it's highly inspired by her feelings towards it. Without a doubt, one of the films greatest advantage is how breathtakingly authentic the characters are that Gerwig created from her own past and experiences. Coming of age stories normally don't get along without drawing on the genre's stereotypes, there's never the zero percent clichés, but this movie here hands down came the closest to it. The film might of course depict the usual themes of growing up and being a teenager, but the way Gerwig approaches it is nothing short of remarkably original. With the characters this film revolves around she phenomenally created human beings that could not be more realistic and relatable. The familial situation depicted in here is so close to reality that it almost felt like I was accompanying it rather than just observing it. This is probably thanks to the extraordinarily emotional performances of Ronan and Metcalf who take your breath away with their indescribably genuine chemistry. Every single scene they shared together was pure cinematic gold. It definitely wouldn't have been possible without the director's highly sensitive narrative structure and the way she carefully allows the story to unfold its excellence. With a seemingly high ease she offers a lovely tale about a teenage girl who desires to come out of her hometown and how she deals with her own problems of adolescence. On the course, the film thematizes countless important topics that extremely matter to a seventeen year old girl, such as the curiosity about sexuality, the importance of true friendship, exploration of love, religion, surviving high school, family issues of all kind and many more. It deals with those topics that young women (and men) can identify with with an immense intimacy and the most touching aspect of this film is how it might be a drama that doesn't trivialise, but doesn't depict it as hopeless or desperate issues either. Instead, it's more of lighter drama that offers more of a melancholic insight to this delicate topics and doesn't want to whitewash it, but decides on focussing on the more positive view of it and encourages the viewer to be more optimistic, even if it's not all gold and glory. It's absolutely relatable for this generation and perfectly captures its struggles and insecurities and seems to take them seriously and to understand them. How many people want to get out of their hometown and share a strange form of love-hate relationship with it? Countless of misunderstood people. In the end, Lady Bird fully developed and learned about life by herself and this allows even the audience to learn something as well. About what really matters in life, i.e friendship, family and love. All in all, Greta Gerwig created a modern milestone with her colourful and wonderfully captured dramedy and gives us an extremely realistic insight into the life of a girl coming of age, while showing sympathy for this generation. It leaves it on a positive note without letting it become too depressing and edgy and almost completely relinquishes using any stereotypes or clichés. What makes it stand out is how it's not just a film about teenagers, it's a film from teenagers to teenagers, because Gerwig knows the struggles and to many people pointless problems of a generation and gives it a voice. Ronan is the killer of this whole concept and delivers so indescribably genuine. It's one the best coming of age films and such a pleasure to watch and highly touching by all accounts. Original, innovative and uniquely authentic. Just beautiful."
LADY BIRD,7 September 2020,,"This movie didn't really resonate with me, but I appreciate it as a piece of cinema and that it resonated with a lot of other people."
LADY BIRD,4 December 2018,7/10,"I enjoyed it,though given the critical acclaim for the movie did leave the screening expecting more.Probably a film best appreciated by the Women with all the strong roles in the film female led.Saoirse Roman was engaging as she always tends to be for me"
LADY BIRD,5 August 2018,9/10,"I watched all the Academy nominees' films and I need to win this award for me.
I enjoyed every minute of it was a wonderful film, a great screenplay, excellent acting all very good players in the future.
The film was quite realistic and it should be in a movie as if it was a real life I felt like I was living in a young girl I was fully aware of the years of puberty.
If I were a member who voted in the academy, I gave it to the best movie award for the lady bird.
I would like to thank everyone who has passed the test in this film 
I enjoyed it very much"
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,10/10,"Whaddayasay, this Oscar season just keeps giving and giving. Another gem that impressed me much has arrived in Estonian cinemas, and I want to give this sassy girl top marks!It's a story of an artistically inclined girl calling herself Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) who doesn't know how to be a kid any more, and tries to search for purpose beyond the familiar confines on school, family, etc.Also appearing, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, Jordan Rodrigues, Marielle Scott, Lois Smith, Stephen Henderson, Odeya Rush, making up a wonderful cast of characters among which I very much enjoyed spending some time with.""Lady Bird"" is not just authentic, sweet, funny, and well realised screen story about the pains of escaping the teenage-dom. It raises the bar for all movies about being young and trying to find yourself.Your regular coming of age (growing up) movie is mostly about showing situations and events that lead to the character(s) realizing something about adult life. You know, partying, fooling around, heartbreaks and what have you.""Lady Bird"" reaches deeper and reminds how it exactly feels to be in that stage - if one has been able to escape this at all, of course.I don't remember any other coming of age story so precisely mirroring this bleak no man's land of being able to realize that there's more to life than this but not really grasping the huge role of personal responsibility which comes with the adult life.Including the notion that the change of scenery or any other external change doesn't equal to real change itself, because whereever we choose to go and whatever we do, we take our basic problems and perspectives along.(It's exactly what I think the biblical story of Adam and Eve being forced to leave the paradise means, by the way. Or the story of Buddha, or Hero's Journey, if mentioning Bible would make you look at me funny or something.)All this mirroring comes through the main character, of course, which makes her an intriguing character in herself, defying easy characterizations that would put her on the same level with most of the young persons searching themselves that we see in mainstream movies.I am also very impressed by the creative style of the author Greta Gerwig, the writer-director of this joint. Many of the scenes are actually quite short but she has never failed to capture a lot of meaningful content in every snapshot that she offers about the characters' lives.The dialogue, the acting, the atmosphere, the duration - everything is so sharp, precise, and to the point. I would say there's no filler material, like, at all. Everything is in its right place, carries enough meaning to justify being there and leaves its mark during watching. There's nothing that I would leave out. In this sense, I'd compare the result to good poetry. In a world full of 2+ hour movies which have only medium amount of meaningful content, we need more movies like this!In addition to that, although the titular character is very much at the center of the story, Gerwig somehow has found enough empathy and ways to make everybody else on the screen live and breathe, too. They are not just figures to fill the scene and help make everything move along.Everybody feels like their own person, no matter how little screen time or impact on the story s/he has. Many are used for comedic purposes, but this doesn't subtract from their intrinsic value.For all this, I think that ""Lady Bird"" deserves the highest score available - because it's good and could not be better in any reasonable and meaningful way. Of course, nothing suits everybody, but the movie is perfect as it is. It felt so fresh that it made me feel as if this is the first coming of age movie I've ever seen.As always with state of the mind movies - more interested in the psychological state of the mind the characters are in, than just events - you have to find some strong connection point to relate to, in order to fully enjoy the movie.But if you manage to do that, you may be in for a real treat. If you don't, you will be bored because not much ""happens"". You know, the same way as ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Seinfeld"" are shows about nothing.The critics seem to agree, by the way: 99/100 and 94/100 from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.Based on what I heard eavesdropping the others leaving the cinema, I got a feeling that although ""Lady Bird"" is about the problems of growing up, it's much more suited to a bit more mature audience of movie lovers, who have already realized in their hearts that the burning question brought forth here - what's my purpose, anyway? - never really goes away.I am not sure that teenager can truly appreciate how important this question will grow in time, and how much weight it can have on our personal secret lives.All in all, ""Lady Bird"" is enjoyable and nuanceful movie, both able to lift you up with brightness that some are able to only compare with being young, and make you think about uncomfortable question that life brings if you are not able to just ""belong to the herd"".In this regard, it has a lot in common with another of 2017's movie highlight, ""Call Me by Your Name"". Just replace the gay guys with straight girl and sunny 1980's Italy with economically shaky 2002's USA Sacramento.I am proud to say that I've managed to see most of the key movies of this Oscar season by now, and the Oscar gala is still more than a week away. This fact has no real value at all, of course... but it's still nice.""Lady Bird"" is nominated for 5 Oscars: best picture, actress (Saoirse Ronan), supporting actress (Laurie Metcalf), director and original screenplay (both by Greta Gerwig).Some claim that women in film industry should get more attention and praise. I don't give any filmmaker special attention just because s/he happens to be of fairer sex (or black, or Estonian, or member of LGBT community, or whatever). The work has to speak for itself.""Lady Bird"" is a great example of how ""minority group"" really deserves the awards and positive word-of-mouth - because it's jsut good enough. As opposed to grabbing attention for political reasons - here's looking at you, ""Mudbound"", nominated for 4 Oscars.P.S. ""Lady Bird"" has already won Golden Globe awards for best actress (Ronan) and movie. It has 83 wins and 190 nominations altogether."
LADY BIRD,27 August 2018,6/10,"The Irish girl with the difficult first name ""Saoirse Ronan"". What a talented actress. just wasn't keen on her in this. Saoirse has great acting ability though. Just an ordinary coming of age movie which details her experiences going through adolescence and college and her interactions with other characters and her family. That's about it. I really like the director Greta Gerwig. So pleased this did so well with this her directional debut. Maybe a movie for the critics."
LADY BIRD,28 December 2018,9/10,"This movie completely smashed my non existent expectations, I just witnessed a modern classic. This is a simple film in its purest form, but I think that's its intent. It flows so perfectly from scene to scene, and moment to moment. The smart dialogue allows it to fully breathe, taking in all of its subtle nuances and simultaneous heft. Go watch it and become transfixed for yourself, you won't regret it."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,8/10,"I went to see this film in the cinema which only consists of
5 people, including me. The other four audiences maybe just
Go there to pass the time without knowing what is the story
about. Different than me that I do enjoy Hollywood movie
Since the 80th(although I am not an Englishman nor European)Close to the end of the film after the conversation ended, 
The film ends as well(with a long dark screen pauses)Now, that really makes it not a perfect ending.."
LADY BIRD,20 October 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird. Superbly acted coming of age film about a stroppy 17/18 year old girl and her relationships with boys, friends, family and especially her mother. Told in a series of vignettes which could've been exasperating/dull in less safe hands than first time (I think) director greta gerwig. We saw it on Mother's Day and was nice to see lots of mums and daughters watching together. Well worth a watch though if you've neither been a mother or a daughter..... 7 and a half out of ten"
LADY BIRD,11 January 2021,6/10,"I'm a sucker for coming of age dramas; maybe it's because I yearn for the past, or the fact that these types of movies are easily relatable to almost everyone who has ever grew up and went through the motions of being an everyday teenager. Whatever the reason, I was eager to watch ""Lady Bird,"" not only because it was a coming of age movie, but because it starred the ever so beautiful Saoirse Ronan. Saoirse is stunning, and she's also one of my favorite actresses - I'm a big fan of her performances in movies such as ""The Lovely Bones"" and ""Brooklyn,"" so her landing a starring role in ""Lady Bird"" also piqued my interest and excitement. And Saoirse does not disappoint.She is marvelous in this movie, encapsulating perfectly how it feels to be an awkward teenager on the cusp of adulthood. She is charming at points, and infuriating at others, as she navigates the waters of high school, dating, college applications, and a tumultuous family life. Her character of Christine, aka Lady Bird, isn't completely likeable, but what teenager is? Christine doesn't quite know what kind of person she is yet, and it is interesting to watch her interact with different groups of people and activities as she tries to find herself.In fact, all of the acting in this movie was very good. Laurie Metcalf was fantastic as Lady Bird's overbearing, and perhaps slightly mentally ill, mother. Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet also are standouts in their smaller roles, with Lucas sharing a particularly emotional scene with Saoirse. Everyone feels lifelike - people scream, yell, argue, behave badly, and put on facades as attempts to mold themselves into what they wish to be; a Highmark Christmas movie this is not. Which leads me into my negatives.An issue I had with this movie is its almost mean spirited nature. I really wanted to like and connect with the characters, but a majority of the time many of them were, frankly, evil. From a mother giving her daughter the cold shoulder while she begs for her to speak, to a girl suddenly ignoring her best friend and potentially ruining a wholesome friendship, many characters in this movie do not act like good people. Because of that, I just found it hard to root for the happiness of these characters when they were acting in ways that didn't feel very realistic to me. Now, I know the film is meant to portray the confusion of youth and the stresses of adult life, but that still didn't make me enjoy the meanspirited feel of the movie.I enjoyed how slice of life this movie was, not necessarily following a plot but instead a character. And luckily, our main character is played by Saoirse, which admittedly made me enjoy the movie slightly more than I believe I would have if another actress was in the title role. There are some beautiful scenes here, as well as some uncomfortable and awkward scenes, all of them gorgeously crafted, acted, directed. I could strongly relate to certain character traits, and certain things that characters were going through; similarly, I found myself smiling throughout, and I was, for the most part, enjoying myself. However, the meanspirited overall tone of the movie was very off-putting to me personally, and coupled with the cruel characters, ""Lady Bird"" didn't resonate with me as much as I wish it had."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird has got to be one of the most interesting and unconventional coming of age stories, it is a story of rebellion, the search for self identity and love. While common conventions in teenage dramas and coming of age tales, Lady bird does so in a smart and interesting way that results in a film both amusing and heartwarming. The film features the themes of self identity in the character of Lady Bird, portrayed wonderfully by Saoirse Ronan. From the get-go we see her as a character who hates the place she lives, Sacramento and imagines herself in a different life somewhere more 'cultured like New York'. It's that sense of furthering herself and finding who she is that drives the actions of the character throughout the film. Saoirse Ronan portrays Lady bird in a fearless, fierce and even 'badass' way that really adds the heart and layer to the film when eventually that person almost dissolves and we understand the character on a deeper level. Of course, this is also a film about love and more specifically the concept that love is attention. The core relationship between lady bird and her mother Marion played by Laurie Metcalf is the central love story of Lady bird. The attention and care that they give to each other that may seem toxic from an outsider's perspective versus the authenticity of the love and care that we as audiences also witness through the characters' own perspective. The small moments where no words are spoken yet they understand the needs of each other, such subtle details make this concept work and allows for the audience to really resonate with the authenticity of the film's portrayal of love between mother and daughter. Overall, Lady bird was a very interesting exploration of the genre and a discussion about the teenage years as the years of exploration, experimentation and the search for self identity. But also the message that regardless of what happens there is always the anchor in the form of your home/families that was beautifully established here via the relationship of lady bird and Marion."
LADY BIRD,8 November 2021,9/10,"An excellent coming of age film that has exceptional writing and wonderful performances by the sublimely talented Saoirse Ronan along with one that is also just about perfect by Laurie Metcalf as her well meaning, but annoying mother. Add in a small role for the equally talented Lucas Hedges who is perfectly cast and has one small scene that will break your heart. Beanie Feldstein, Tracy Letts, Timothee Chalamet & Lois Smith all add to to this delightful, funny & touching little gem."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" is Greta Gerwig's beautiful and insightful film, the first for which she is solely credited as writer and director. Gerwig, a Sacramento native herself and member of her heroine's generation - the movie takes place mostly during the 2002-3 academic year - knows her characters and their world very well. Her affection envelops them like a secular form of grace: not uncritically, but unconditionally. And if you pay the right kind of attention to ""Lady Bird"" - played by the lovely Saoirse Ronan (already, at 23, one of the most formidable actors in movies today) - absorbing its riffs and digressions as well as its melodies, it's choral passages along with its solos and duets - It's a worth- watch for the the constant stream of early 2000s nostalgia that runs through the entire movie and a few powerful moments: the hug between Lady Bird and Danny O'Neill (you'll know it when you see it) and the mother's drive through.Yes, Lady Bird has its moments. You will almost certainly love it. It's hard not to."
LADY BIRD,22 January 2018,9/10,"It is really rare to find an excellent film nowadays, one that tells a powerful story and this is it, this is the coming of age film of this generation.Saorsie Ronan has had great performances since the beginning, but this one just proves she was born to be in movies, her character is compelling, complicated, she's like the Goth girl in school if there were Goth girls in her Sacramento Catholic School.And Laurie Metcalf, she is a criminally underrated actress, she brings a real tender emotion to every character she plays, she deserves recognition. Greta Gerwig made a magnificent job with the script, the directing, the pacing.The message Gerwig wants to convey thru Lady Bird is loud and clear, but she makes it funny and entertaining. Definitely one of the most satisfying experiences I have had with movies recently."
LADY BIRD,10 September 2018,1/10,"I loved American Honey and Moonlight. But this one - no.
I'm suprised of the attention this movie has got, I just don't understand the very good reviews...I found it very boring, and could not connect with the characters or the story.
I turned it off after 25 minutes. 
I rather watch Moonlight one more time."
LADY BIRD,14 February 2018,10/10,"Wow, it's really amazing to talk about this movie. I think that, this is the case where the movie is 10/10 simply because you can't find a single bad thing about it.Lady Bird is fantastic well directed (Greta Gerwig is doing a terrific job in her first job as a director), has an amazing script, with absolutely stupendous acting. This is probably the best thing about the movie, you just forget that you're watching a movie, with script, scenes, scenarios and etc, in that 90 minutes you're just living those moments with those people, it's real, it's funny, it's sad, it's basically all that a life of a girl with that age is.The movie is real funny sometimes, but also touch in some pretty dramatic stuff (like sexuality) and this is fantastic, the way that all of those things are approached in something that is 90 minutes long.The cinematography is also fantastic. The soundtrack is good too.In short, Lady Bird is a fantastic film, that have almost non cliches, and simply doesn't have any flaws. Definitely one of the best movies of the year, and my favorite of the ""Best Pictures"" nominees for the Oscars."
LADY BIRD,29 December 2017,7/10,"When you hear all the fantastic praise that a new Oscar bait film is getting, you should probably watch it. Even though I'm personally not the target audience or demographic for this film I still ended up liking the film quite a bit.The biggest accomplishment and positive in the film is the directing by Greta Gerwig, which for a first time directing is an outstanding achievement. You honestly would not be able to tell if this was directing by an all time great or a newcomer. She has done an amazing job directing the film in this regard it has no faults at all. With this being her first film she has an extremely bright and interesting future ahead and I'm definitely now keen to see what she does next. The other main positive of the film are the performances which across the board are fantastic, however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly Saoirse Ronan who is fantastic in the film and brings such heart to the character of Lady Bird. For me personally this is one of her best performances that she has done and only increases her reputation. Hopefully this will open up the door for her to get bigger roles more often, she is brilliant. The other standout in the film is Lady Bird's mother played by Laurie Metcalf, she is again incredible in the role and brings elements to her character that I think everyone will recognise in their own mother. She hopefully will get some awards buzz and maybe even a nomination.Unfortunately though and I know that this is my own personal problem and fault that I feel this is film maybe a little overrated. This is partially to due my fault because well this isn't my type of film, I know thats not the films fault. I could never really connect to the story of the film but again thats my own opinion and fault, but I can understand how and why people really do connect with the story. Lastly the film is good is just nothing amazing or ground breaking in any sense so thats where I'm a little......not disappointed...... let down by the film because I was expecting a lot more considering the praise. Overall its 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its a good film and its a brilliant starting point for Greta Gerwig's directing career. As well as bringing us great directing it gives us two great performances that will really leave an impression on you after watching it. However because I couldn't connect to the film that much it didn't hit me as hard as it should emotionally, but again thats my problem really not the films. Best directing Oscar Nomination?"
LADY BIRD,9 September 2020,8/10,"Lady Bird, a teenager about to finish high school and enter university, explores the possible options to get as far away from her hometown of Sacramento as possible as she battles to find her place in the world, which in her eyes is a place dimly and artistically ""weak"". Greta Gerwig used her own reality and experience to write and direct this film, which can be seen in the intimacy and personal touch that is seen throughout the narrative. It is a story about teenagers and their doubts and uncertainties well told, contrary to what has been done sometimes in the past. The duo Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf was nominated for the 2018 Oscars with the fabulous interpretations in this film."
LADY BIRD,4 February 2018,7/10,"It did not quite live up to all the hype, in my opinion. I preferred Saoirse Ronan's performance in Brooklyn. There were a few points in the movie when I felt like I should be more invested in the story or feeling emotional, but it just didn't work for me. However, it did a great job portraying the Sacramento area and it was great to see a coming of age story of a girl, especially one that is not focused on romance. Didn't meet my expectations, but still glad that I saw it!"
LADY BIRD,22 May 2018,6/10,"I found it uneven. Good performances, but not much story. It seems unfocused and doesn't lead to much except her freedom from her family and school towards the end."
LADY BIRD,22 November 2017,10/10,"Lady Bird is a straightforward and affectively written coming-of-age story composed of identifiable characters and dilemmas regarding adolescence and family relationships with strong performances to back them up. It's marvelous how these art house films where you are essentially watching an everyday person's life go by can sneak in a subtle narrative and effortlessly absorb the audience. Lady Bird is filmmaking at its purest, another 2017 great."
LADY BIRD,21 June 2020,2/10,"I thought the trailer for this movie made it look great, and I like Greta Gerwig, so I really didn't expect this movie to turn out the way it did: as a complete bore. I stopped it after a half hour had gone by and I had barely even chuckled to myself, or found anything about it the least bit interesting or thought provoking. I'm not sure what the hype is all about, there's really nothing there."
LADY BIRD,10 December 2017,9/10,"In a revival year for movies, one with an abundance of notable gems, Lady Bird manages to stand out in the crowd. While taking on the coming-of-age angle, which has been done to death for 30something years, director Greta Gerwig makes this one different. She brings freshness to a stale genre by releasing a steady stream of humor, heart, and honesty. Gerwig's first solo directorial effort features the winning young actress who is also quickly becoming a veteran actress Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn, Atonement). Ronan shines, playing a Gerwig surrogate of sorts and showcasing a flawless Sacramento accent. Named Christine McPherson by her parents, she decides to instead go by the name Lady Bird. As she calls it, her given name (she gave it to herself). Mom (Laurie Metcalf) and Dad (Tracy Letts) are both perfectly cast joys to watch. Mom and Lady Bird flip a switch between sharing joyful moments to clashing in heated ones. Sweet and supportive dad does his best to help them both, even while fighting his own depression. Best friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein) is delightful to viewers and loyal to Lady Bird. In her search for her identity, Lady Bird tests out a new best friend and an ill-fitting musician boyfriend (Timothee Chalamet). She lies about herself to both of them, pretends to live in the rich neighborhood, lies about her parents, trying to seem cool. Classic high school move, one of the cliché moments. The movie isn't entirely original, but what makes it so special is that everything feels authentic, never crammed in to fit a template. The characters and problems could have come across as stale and vacuous, but they contain real depth and honesty, so they're always compelling. Lady Bird meets another boyfriend, Danny (Lucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea), while rehearsing for the school play. He resists the temptation of sex with her, ""out of respect."" Their relationship comes to an abrupt end but not before he describes Lady Bird's mom as ""warm and scary."" While Lady Bird scoffs at this descriptor at the time, she later recognizes the truth in it. She spends so much effort preventing people from seeing her family for who they really are that she never truly sees them herself. There's something in this movie for everyone. We may not all be now, nor have ever been a pink-haired teenage girl in Sacramento, but we all know what it's like to feel unsure about who we are and who we want to be. Lady Bird covers familiar experiences, but not only the pleasant ones. It's not an ""aww"" fest. Gerwig's directs the way Lady Bird's mom parents—with toughness and care. She explores the humor and hurt with equal deft. Her movie is heartwarming and heartbreaking. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think. Gerwig delivers a story extremely personal to her in a way that makes it feel personal to all of us. Lady Bird is a wonderous success and truly one of the year's best movies."
LADY BIRD,1 October 2018,9/10,"Just got out of Lady Bird, it was excellent! The film will probably get nominated for a Best Picture in the Oscars and we'll definitely get nominated for best actress for Saoirse Ronan. The plot was a simple, but amazingly well done slice of life style film. It really captures the emotional difficulties of a teenager and growing up. All around the acting was outstanding and the writing well done. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this film. I I really don't know how anyone could not enjoy it . 9.5 out of 10"
LADY BIRD,6 November 2021,2/10,"This is completely terrible. Its just a coming of age story of an annoying and stupid girl, who is completely spoiled. She is just so annoying and stupid, nothing even really happens, just every teen growing u[ stereotype ever, alochohol,sex, smoking. This isnt anything new and definitely isnt anything good either. Bad film 2/10."
LADY BIRD,3 November 2017,9/10,"""Lady Bird"". No, this film is not about Lady Bird Johnson! However, if you're a fan of films like ""The Big Stick,"" ""Juno,"" ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" and ""The Way Way Back,"" then writer/actor/producer Great Gerwig's solo run at directing/writing is going to be right up your alley. Saoirse Rona (""Brooklyn"") stars as the reluctant yet blooming teenage who's at ends with her overly critical mom (the always amazing Laurie Metcalf - HBO's ""Getting On""), while he dad (equally reliable Tracey Letts ""August - Osage County"" writer) sits quietly by. Since the story is a coming-of-age event, the excellent Lucas Hedges' (""Manchester by the Sea"") and Timothy Chalamet (""Interstellar"") each have a lesson to teach ""Lady Bird"". And, since every young female needs a BFF, Beanie Feldstein (""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"") fits the bill just perfectly. Gerwig presents a believable, honest, enjoyable and at times heartbreaking story that will surly touch viewers. There are no gun battles, CGI effects, loud explosions, superheroes or animated cartoon figures here to dazzle. Instead, for a pleasant 1 1/2 hours, the audience is given an opportunity to step into the McPherson family life, and the life of fellow Sacramento California youth, to experience all the various trials and tribulations youth and families must endure during this thing call life. With an indie feel, ""Lady Bird"" could both join the ranks of the film mentioned above and lead the category into Awards Season."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2018,8/10,"Every one of us can remember their senior year of high school. For some of us, it was great, for others it wasn't. No matter what the quality of that year was, we all experienced adulthood for the first time and prepared for our lives to change forever. Lady Bird tells this exact story through the eyes of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson as she tries to carve her own path while also trying to navigate the pressures of her final year in high school. Lady Bird wants to go east and get away from her hometown of Sacramento, ""The Midwest of California."" She has the feeling many of us did where we just want to get as far away from home as possible. While trying to make her decision, she constantly butts heads with her tough and loving mother that thinks she would be better off staying closer to home. Along with the decision, Lady Bird also experiences the beginnings of adulthood such as relationships, sex, and alcohol. The story is very relatable and filled with emotion. The connections between characters are stunning and give the film a very authentic feel. We witness Lady Bird's story from beginning to end, letting us as the audience relive our senior years as she is living hers.The film does follow into small traps when it comes to introducing and dealing with its characters. Some are given too little screen time to make a big enough difference, and some are given too much screen time and end up making up no difference. There is also some conventional/predictable moments that should have been changed or omitted in order for the film to distance itself more from the coming of age genre. The greatest contributor to this film is Great Gerwig as both the writer and director. Just like Jordan Peele, Gerwig comes out of the gate swinging in her directorial debut. She expertly knows how to write authentic dialogue for teenagers. None of it sounds fake or written by an adult trying to emulate what teens sound like. She also uses the camera to make the film have a grounded and time appropriate look to it (the setting is 2002).This film is littered with great acting in both large and supporting roles. Saoirse Ronan knocks it out of the park as the titular lead. She plays the role with command and confidence, which translates well into her best scenes, all of which come when Laurie Metcalf is present. Metcalf is brilliant as the constrained mother that's trying her best to keep the family afloat during tough times. She shares excellent chemistry with Ronan and the two of them make for one of the best mother-daughter stories in film. Other great performances come from Tracy Letts as Lady Bird's father who is the reserved figure in a house occupied by two women with ""strong personalities."" Lucas Hedges follows up his great performance last year in Manchester By the Sea with another respectable turn here as Lady Bird's first boyfriend, Danny. Timothée Chalamet does an adequate job as Lady Bird's other interest but underperforms when compared to his brilliant work in Call Me By Your Name.Lady Bird is a film that doesn't invent anything new in the teenage coming of age story genre, but it greatly improves on everything before it. Wonderful performances all around and great directing make this a must-see during the crowded awards season."
LADY BIRD,14 December 2018,8/10,"I must admit that this filn was very different to what I expected. I thought the film was about royalty or something like that, but what I got was this really engaging comedy-drama set in 2002. I really enjoyed it. I love the main character actressbof Lady Bird as well as all the other performances. An overall really great film, which I 100% recommend to watch. 😁👍🏾"
LADY BIRD,12 June 2018,8/10,"A striking directorial debut by Greta Gerwig, this tender, semi-autobiographical love letter to Gerwig's hometown explores the gulf between childhood and adulthood with touching, witty humor. Gerwig first gained acclaim for writing and acting in ""mumblecore"" indies; she seemed to find her own voice and persona in films like Damsels in Distress and Frances Ha. Now she brings that persona, fully formed, to the nuanced, wonderful Lady Bird. (It resembles Frances Ha, which she co-wrote, in many good ways.) And, standing in for the director on-screen, Oscar nominee Ronan perfectly adopts Gerwig's trademark sweet/scatterbrain delivery, sprinkling it with soul and humanity.
The movie is more about a time, a state of mind, and an emotional place than it is a story, and Gerwig allows scenes to wander off track in a delightful way. Even if they have nothing to do with Lady Bird, scenes sometimes follow secondary characters for no other reason than Gerwig likely found them interesting, sad, or funny. Not everything is explained. Special care is given to Lady Bird's mother, Marion, who's no-nonsense and borderline mean, but also truly loving. Metcalf gives a fine performance in the role. The overall use of music, cityscape images, and feisty rhythms round out a wonderfully personal, open-hearted movie.The movie is an experience that should be seen. It is a great debut film and deserves some praise as a great coming of age film.Overall Rating: 8.1"
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,7/10,"Fighting with your parents over your freedom to decide for yourself, struggling with financial difficulties, trying so hard to impress others to actually feel like people care about you and pay attention, doing the stupidest things out of fear of being rejected otherwise.These things, and a million of other ones, are what an almost grown up human being's life is about. Well, maybe not everywhere and not for everyone, but most of us could surely relate to what Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson goes through. What Saoirse Ronan did to her character is no small feat. With her porcelain doll beauty and those pale blue eyes, she goes out of her typical closed and emotionally restrained character and becomes someone who yells and screams and laughs and cries and breaks things on screen, making Lady Bird so intense that it's unbearable at some points.Making the character of Lady Bird so intense and hard to handle is probably both the film's best feature and its most serious flaw. In all the multitude of coming-of-age movies, the kid characters are mostly childish and they do dumb things often - but then some uncanny wisdom comes upon them and they grow up in our eyes and suddenly become reasonable and - let's be honest about this - tolerable at last. Lady Bird takes a slightly different road of dropping that sugarcoating and leaving Christine what she is - conflicted, hysterical, inconsistent and, damn, annoying! Just like the character of Christine's mother struggles to write her a letter and to choose words that would both be kind and ring true, so does the audience have a hard time accepting Lady Bird's edgy self. I certainly found it hard to do.It's curious why we people love the coming-of-age stories. The kids watch them to see that someone does understand and does care about who they are, to see someone else who'd tell them that they are not alone. And we adults watch them to seek hope that those chaotic and erratic creatures we once gave birth to are indeed our kin and that sometime soon you'd get on the same page and would be able to actually talk to each other like responsible people.In terms of promising the older generations a magical realm in which their progeny will be delivered to their hands all mature and stuff, Lady Bird isn't too reassuring. Nor does it promise us that kids secretly understand everything and it's just a lack of communication - because it's just not true. But there's one thing about this story that redeems all the facepalm moments you experience watching those kids do their kid stuff. That, just like the kids are not alone in their struggle, so aren't their parents. So there's no reason to blame the world on yourself and drown yourself in guilt and anger begotten by it - 'cause you're no more guilty than the other guy.So, if you have a bird you love - just set it free, and if it loves you back, it will return some day and somehow."
LADY BIRD,2 October 2021,6/10,"Saoirse Ronan plays a strong willed and unconventional teenage girl navigating her way through dating and finding a college place whilst managing a strained relationship with her well-intentioned mother.Saoirse Ronan is a great young talent (I loved the movie Brooklyn) but I found the lead character here hard to relate to. But then I'm not a teenage girl. I didn't find the drama particularly dramatic or emotive, and the script is largely uninspiring.Overall, too hard for me to relate to and get excited about. Nothing special. Without Ronan this film is nothing."
LADY BIRD,10 November 2019,9/10,"Gosh, this film made feel things.And also, it got me to like a Dave Mathews Band song. Now if that's not an achievement, I don't know what is."
LADY BIRD,31 March 2018,8/10,"I must admit that I was not exactly looking forward to this flick when my wife suggested it. But, there has to be some give and take, and I gave in. Thank God I did, because I was quite impressed by the smooth direction, the high quality acting by Ronan, Letts (her father), Rodrigues (her brother), Chalamet (who takes her virginity) and, above all, Laurie Metcalf, who is completely believable as her loving but always money-attentive mother.I also found the film extremely honest, without any of the schmaltzy touches that tend to go with this type of coming of age film. Ultimately, the message is one of love, and, look where you may, there is no greater love than between parents and children. Highly recommended."
LADY BIRD,13 April 2020,8/10,"Greta Gerwig, already established as a wonderful actor, makes her directorial debut in one of the best coming of age stories in years. Saoirse Ronan gives yet another Oscar-worthy performance as the title character in what will surely be one of her most memorable roles."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2018,7/10,"If you've been following my reviews, you'll know that one of my favourite films is the coming of age story. It always has a great mixture of comedy and drama while depicting relatable characters. Among my favourites are The Way Way Back, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, Dazed And Confused, anything by John Hughes and my all-time favourite film Almost Famous. One thing these films all have in common is they prominently feature the story of a boy growing up. Lady Bird along with 2016's Edge Of Seventeen, break that cycle featuring a female protagonist, coming out timely in the current social climate.Lady Bird centers around the brilliant Saoirse Ronan's character ""Lady Bird"" a name given to herself while growing up in her senior year of high school. A scene depicting a conversation between the titular character and Sister Sarah Joan - a nun at the Catholic school she attends - sums up the main theme of the film. After continuously declaring she hates Sacramento, but admitting she pays attention, Sister Sarah Joan asks her, what the difference is between paying attention and love; a strong theme throughout the film, overlapping her romantic relationships and her relationship with her Mother played by Laurie Metcalf.One aspect I really enjoyed about Lady Bird is how nostalgic I felt for my high school days. It is a reminder that no matter your gender, we all went through similar ups and downs growing up. Not everything is wrapped up in a nice bow, but left unsure just as all of us were when entering the real world. The film also doesn't follow the usual movie tropes of something being misunderstood and could easily be solved by speaking up. The characters are written intelligently with common sense that any person would show in those situations.One surprising aspect of this film is that this is Greta Gerwig's directorial debut and what a debut! I can't even imagine heading up your first film - one that you also wrote - only to later be nominated for an Academy Award. Let's hope the phrase ""nowhere to go but down from here,"" isn't true in her case. Among other nominees is Laurie Metcalf for Best Supporting Actress and Saoirse Ronan for Best Actress. If you've never seen one of Ronan's films, you will fall in love with the emotion and realism she brings to her roles.In the end I gave this an ""A"" because of its great writing, acting and story - plus mix in the fact I'm a sucker for these kinds of films. I highly recommend seeing one of the best films of 2017."
LADY BIRD,7 November 2017,7/10,"I always appreciate a film about the personal upheavals of reaching young adulthood. To be honest, I found this film mildly annoying at times. Maybe because it's a film that just doesn't hold back on the raw emotion of growing up. The characters are very real and therefore the taste it leaves is not always palatable. The story of a 17-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento and her personal travails with her parents, with school, with her friendships, with boys and with her hopes and dreams didn't exactly grab me initially.The good news is that it's so superbly acted that I was able to absorb it and enjoy the wonderful moments of truth in terms of one's relationships with those you've grown up around. In that regard, this film cuts very close to the bone. I just wish the narrative had been more brisk and not as deliberate. For a film with this short a running time, it feels long. Toward the end, it drags a bit. Perhaps Greta Gerwig in her directorial debut is still figuring how to end a film on the perfect note.But again, the performances here are tour de force, especially Saoirse Ronan who is exceptional as the teenage girl who spends most of the film coming to grips with a sense of self and an independent identity, something hard-earned in a difficult family. By the end of the film, we've come to know her completely. Recommended to those looking for a good character study."
LADY BIRD,8 May 2018,6/10,"Based on the trailers I just didn't think this film wasn't something I hadn't already seen multiple times, but given the raves about it I eventually buckled. It was as I expected, something I've seen numerous times with the exception that the main character is wholly unlikable. The word ""brat"" comes to mind. I realize we are in this stage of praising anti-heroes, but characters like Dexter, Breaking Bad guy, and Nurse Jackie have qualities you like about them and you understand why they're are in their situation which garners sympathy. Lady Bird has none of that going for her. She's just a brat and ungrateful to boot. I normally like Saoirse Ronan, so the fact she can convincingly play a teen I don't like at all is credit to her talent.So, this leaves you following, or more, meandering after a character whom is supposed to be the hero yet she does nothing redeemable, in fact, she is often hateful, she lies, she betrays her friends, betrays teachers she likes, smarts off at adults to impress unlikable people, and seems to be interested in any guy that is breathing and emotionally unavailable. What's not to like about this character? (sarcasm) Laurie Metcalfe does a great portrayal of her mother. That is the most redeemable part of the movie, her performance. I wouldn't say the film is worth watching for that, though. I would much rather see Pretty and Pink or Saved! again which are the two films this most reminded me of, but are much more enjoyable, even though PIP is flawed due to scenes that were edited from the film.It does have some good and touching moments. Of course, non of them are because of Lady Bird, except for when she finally slightly pulls it together at the end. I wasn't surprised to find out the script is semi-autobiographical. It drags like that. Like I'm watching some teen's GoPro of their life instead of a film. Not quite that bad, but about the same lacking energy level. And the great moment is that Lady Bird, after she was a brat to all, barely gets into the college she wants so she can escape her parents (the ones who've struggled to do everything for her) and her life. I did like the clever turn around that she makes it to the school and things end up a disaster instead of magical like she thought. But all I was left thinking at the end is her parents have sacrificed everything for her, even more so than for her brother that seems to deserve it more, and all Lady Bird will probably do is make more bad decisions like getting a liberal arts degree, rack up a hefty student loan debt, then graduate with little real world skills, then get a job as a waitress in NYC, living with 3 roommates in a tiny apartment. Good thing her parents sacrificed it all for her. (sarcasm, again)I actually know an immigrant family who, like Lady Bird's parents, struggle and sacrifice their own lives to make sure their daughters have the American dream, and like Lady Bird, one of their daughters also treats them with contempt and like she's embarrassed of them. I simply feel bad for the parents. Unlike Lady Bird, the daughter is very sweet and responsible and well-liked, even though she can be a brat to her parents.Maybe we should spend more time praising the hard workers than these supposedly out-of-the-box thinkers. There wasn't anything particularly out-of-the-box or exceptional about Lady Bird, she was simply quirky and mediocre. Right now we have an unusually large number of these types who think because they didn't make it into the top 1% of something (wealth, fame, wealth & fame), that they've been somehow jipped by someone, oppressed or persecuted. Being special, talented, smart, successful, liked, etc., is all work. Young people should start trying to fit with the world rather than expecting everyone and everything to fit them. Very few are the special few that's why it's called a 1%. Not many are willing to put in the actual work it takes. And even if Greta Gerwig is still an exception to the rule, she still is one of the few who made it into that tiny 1%."
LADY BIRD,6 June 2020,10/10,"This is a pretty good movie, the story is good about a lower Middle class girl from a small Town dreaming of going to College in New York. Saoirse carried the movie wonderfully in the title role, lots of Charisma and great Acting. It is a Human Interest type of a Movie, if you are into that then this is a Must See."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2020,9/10,"""Lady Bird"" (2017) written and directed by Greta Gerwig is a completely wonderful film about growing up and being true to oneself.Realised through brilliant writing and direction by Gerwig, the film not only is well-constructed, but packs wonderful characters portrayed by great actors, and is filled with such realism and authenticity, as well as great pacing and editing - it really comes together to create a phenomenal drama.Big shout-out to Saoirse Ronan and particularly Greta Gerwig for an excellent film - one of the best of 2017, in my opinion. Highly recommended."
LADY BIRD,12 April 2020,8/10,"This movie explores the issues of average students, their high school life and the close realtionships. The issues which we have mother-daughter strain, looking cool, getting in a college. It makes you ponder on various points and that serves the purpose of movie. The best momemts we think arent actually the best! All the bad decisions we make in our teen-age but later realising and then correcting/apologising, the most important step in our life, understanding our mistakes. This movie does it cleverly. The acting is good."
LADY BIRD,3 November 2017,8/10,"Greta Gerwig's directorial debut is a very funny and entertaining film about a rebellious young woman who is a senior at a Catholic high school in Sacramento. She wants to attend college on the East Coast, preferably in New York City. I have always been a fan of Gerwig and her work, and I can say that her filmmaking skills are incredibly strong here as far as directorial debuts go. The screenplay is full of wit and emotion. While the film is very light in tone, the characterizations present through the narrative as well as the film's juxtaposition of its main events pertaining to Lady Bird's (the nickname of the protagonist) final year in high school give the script considerable weight and power.Saorise Ronan gives a hearty and very authentic performance in the lead role, and the supporting cast is generally very strong. The film's tone feels playful but also enjoyably sassy and thoughtful. As a result, the film feels far more potent than just about anything in the teenage/coming-of-age genre. While the film's pacing in its final scene feels slightly awkward given its contrast of pace with the rest of the narrative, the film feels fully satisfying in its entirety despite running a lean 93 minutes. Additionally, some of the plot devices that help form the narrative and plot line of the film feel rather predictable. However, that ends up being only a minor complaint because the humor, heart and bite of the writing helps drown out any sense of clichés that a viewer might feel. Overall, I thought this was a great and very funny coming-of-age comedy that I had a lot of fun watching. I look forward to seeing what Greta Gerwig does next with her undeniable talent. Definitely recommended. 8.5/10"
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird is a film written and directed by Greta Gerwig. I just happen to watch the trailer my chance and decided to give a go for this film. After watching the film, I can say that I was quite satisfied watching this film.Plot: The film chronicles the life of Christine (Lady Bird) a student of a Catholic school in the years 2002-03.Story and direction: This film has most perfectly shown the way adolescents react to situations. The way the film has woven in the situations any adolescent faces is commendable. Lady Bird as a character has so many shades. We see her being naughty, stupid, funny and emotional. Then comes her friends. Jules is kind of that supporting friend you always have on your side no matter how wrong/right you are. Jenna is the kind of friend that you want to have because of her being so flamboyant. Then we have her so called boyfriends who were poles apart in their own different way. I being from a Catholic school could connect with the film more easily because I have been in that kind of environment. Even the teachers's characters were so beautifully woven into the story. I also liked the parents' character of Lady Bird. While the father who is mostly supportive in many of Lady Bird's ventures, the mother is the conscious one who is always sort of scared for her child. Even she reacting so rudely to Lady Bird, was a way of showing her love to her. And then the finale of the film, just put a good finish and a nice arc to Lady Bird. My only issue, and this could only be me, is that These kind of films are seen so often that one can predict as to what is going to happen.Performances: Sairose Ronan once again just delivered an applauding performance as Lady Bird. I loved her in Brooklyn (that came out 2 years ago), and still she proves that she is a force to be reckoned with. Laurie Metcalf was also great as the mother. Tracy Letts also delivers a good performance. Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalamet were also so distinct in the roles they played. Beanie Feldstein also provided some great support to Lady Bird's character.Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where the sister calls Lady Bird in her room for putting the 'Just Married with Jesus' signboard on her car and also explains her that isn't love and attention the very same thing. That dialogue resonated with me. It's because that we seek love, that we do things that bring people's attention to us. And this dialogue also applies in real life to any person who seeks to be loved.Verdict: This film is perfect for all adolescents who are going through this phase. It will very easily connect with them. Kudos to Greta Gerwig and team. I am going with a 9/10."
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,2/10,"I don´t get all the rave reviews. It fell flat for me. Unoriginal, unsurprising,.. I didn´t enjoyt it. Disappointing."
LADY BIRD,3 May 2018,10/10,"I loved this movie. Lady Bird is about realizing that you are blessed. It made me think, feel, reflect, laugh, cry. I am grateful for having watched it."
LADY BIRD,17 August 2021,7/10,"Good movie i love the score, the pictures was good and great choice of casts by Gerwig. The story is not new in any way and there's nothing really happens in the entire movie although the movie is well paced its still boring in a way and I feel like the universality of the experience was kind of the point. Its a good movie but its not as great as many people said, oh well to each his own."
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird is a movie with a lot of heart and emotion. It tells a story that is timeless and the actors all do it justice. The soundtrack was great, and I am very impressed by the directing in this film. It absolutely deserved to be nominated for the Oscars that it did, and I would recommend it to everyone."
LADY BIRD,7 December 2017,6/10,"Who can deny Saoirse Ronan is winsome? Who uses ""winsome"" to describe anyone anymore?Lady Bird is a fine film, replete with good acting and a paint-by- numbers, coming-of-age storyline every middle-class white person could find relatable, or at least relative. There's relative poverty, relative lies, relative places, and relative relatives.The biggest lesson learned is that if you pay attention to the world around you, someone else might interpret that as love for the world around you, or at least the aspects of the world around you to which you pay attention are ones which you love, because why else would you pay so much attention to them, regardless of whether or not you are paying attention to them consciously?Coming of age for Lady Bird includes a first weed, a first bone, and a first scratch-off. We get a prototypically gay young man, introduced as the strong singer who's afraid to touch mammaries. Perhaps greater screen time would have revealed he also enjoys architecture, queery theory, and feather boas.Having never lived in Sacramento, I nevertheless imagine I would also want to move to New York as a way to solve all of my problems. Change comes from within, unless you're full of wanderlust, without which we would wistfully remain stationary, only exploring inwardly who we are, who were were, and what will happen next."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,10/10,"I'm excited to see what else Greta Gerwig decides to do after this. Lady Bird is a movie that doesn't defy expectations or even does anything revolutionary. But it's a very well written movie, with pretty good performances. It's one of those few movies that when they end, you kind of hope to see more, bceause you care for these characters. Short review on LB here, but I thought it's a great movie. Not groundbreaking, but not every movie has to be. This one just does what it has to do. The dialogue flows incredibly well, it would be interesting to know how much of it was improv."
LADY BIRD,12 December 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird directed by Greta Gerwig ( liked her in Maggie's plan) is a simple story about a simple senior high school girl Christine known as 'Lady Bird' ( played very well by Saoirse Ronan ) who wants to get out of Sacramento and live somewhere on east coast. Lady Bird's mom Marion (superb acting by Laurie Metcalf known for playing sheldon's mom in Big Bang Theory) , dad Larry ( good acting by Tracy Letts), brother miguel(actor jordan rodrigues) are a supportive family for Lady Bird who wants more from life. Saoirse Ronan did very well as Lady Bird who has a head on her shoulders and is confident that east coast has everything that Sacramento lacks. She lives her senior year with enthusiasm and looks forward to fulfilling her dream. She understands her dad's depression and appreciates her mom who is hardworking, affectionate and loving. Greta Gerwig's direction is commendable . Oscarworthy acting by Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. Good screenplay."
LADY BIRD,28 March 2020,9/10,"This seemingly ordinary story tells about growing up. Young people always do not know complex interpersonal relationships , simple and rebellious. Like to challenge all authority, but slowly accept and be accepted, resulting in growth, can be regarded as a process of self-identity, from Lady bird to accept and like christine. I can always see in her that she is ignorant but fearless when she is young. She sees the difference between a true friend and a false friend. She also sees the good intentions of her parents and family, I put her in an understatement and like her."
LADY BIRD,27 July 2018,6/10,"Well done, well acted, good script, an enjoyment of entertainment."
LADY BIRD,4 January 2019,1/10,After seeing all the buzz I give it a try to this movie it's not even worth it to I should have just read synopsis and give hard pass this is obviously well acted movie but not for me
LADY BIRD,4 December 2019,9/10,"The movies I praise most excitedly are the ones that catch me by surprise. Ones that take a negative expectation and turn it completely around. There was nothing to convince me that a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in Sacramento California would be something I'd connect with. I've seen enough smart mouthed teenage movie heroines to know that Lady Bird was not my type. But watching Greta Gerwig's semi-autobiographical film, I was slowly moved to appreciation. For once, a teenage drama got things right.Lady Bird is an eighteen-year-old pseudo-cosmopolitan, played with charm by Saoirse Ronan, with dreams of moving to New York City and a future where her eccentric personality will be appreciated. The plot concerns her final days of high school, her last attempts to capture the popularity she craves, and her friends' and family's exasperation with her rebellious ways. Those pieces may bring to mind a slew of indie teenage dramedies. It compares interestingly to something like Juno, a movie highly praised for its clever, but insufferable protagonist. Instead of serving as a vehicle for #witty #quirky dialogue, Lady Bird revolves around an actual person. Gerwig has the confidence to write a character who isn't always funny, who wants but doesn't always have confidence, who becomes kind of a jerk and has to learn from that. Compare it to something like Boyhood. That character's arc ends with him becoming a pretentious douche bag. Lady Bird's ends with her becoming a better person. The point is, coming of age stories can so easily become frustrating. Lady Bird navigates around the traps. It comes out feeling smart, surprising, genuine, and heartfelt.Ronan is fabulous in the role in ways that Ellen Page and Ellar Coltrane were not. She dives further into her character, playing it as someone straining to be cool, not as cool herself. She embraces her inner jerk. Lady Bird wants to be liked by the right crowd, and she pushes others (including us) away to do so. It requires an actress who doesn't care what the audience thinks of her. Ronan doesn't play to the camera, she just plays. The other great performance is from Laurie Metcalf, an exhausted mother who struggles to keep up the bridge between them. She taps into a real dilemma, trying to encourage your daughter's dreams and caution her about them at the same time. She doesn't have the answers, she can barely maintain her composure around Lady Bird, and her internal boiling is the heart of the film.Lady Bird is also naturally observant of a specific time, place, and feeling. I can't vouch for what Sacramento was like around the turn of the millennium, but I can say that I knew people like Ronan's Lady Bird. Girls that thought themselves unique among the outcasts, and so utilized the little quirks that made them appear superficially special. Lady Bird, with her dyed hair and her choker necklace, was a specific kind of person circa 2002. I recognized her. I recognized the details in the Catholic school, portrayed here with shocking reverence (Get this. Some of the Catholics are actually nice people). I recognized the feeling in the air during the waning days of high school. Lady Birds feels like a glimpse into the recent past as it actually was.What encouraged me most about Lady Bird is its attitude toward its main character. Gerwig doesn't have an adolescent view of growing up. She has a mature, wise perspective. One that realizes Juno and Boyhood are the teenage fantasies of blossoming adulthood. Lady Bird is the reality. Where sometimes you think being rebellious grants you access to a higher plain of popularity, but eventually you learn that it only erodes those connections that are true. Where maybe, in her own frazzled way, your horrible mother was actually trying to help you all along.Lady Bird works like a critique on the entire coming-of-age genre, where a spunky teen rebels against the rigid plebs caught up in the system. Lady Bird wants to be a Juno-like character, she wants to be that kind of special, but she comes to know the painful realities of living your life that way for real. You lose friends, your family resents you, the people you look up to reject you. And because she's written smart, and not merely ""quirky"", the lesson actually registers. Gerwig acknowledges her lead character's flaws and allows her to grow because of them. Don't you wish more coming of age movies would do the same?90/100"
LADY BIRD,7 June 2019,1/10,"About a 1/3 into the movie, I was tempted to turn off the tv. The actors were great, but the movie plot was bland. Quite frankly, it was not worth all the hype."
LADY BIRD,3 December 2017,9/10,"Does this movie follow the same formula that every other coming-of- age film follows? Yes, it does. But what makes Lady Bird so special is the performances across-the-board, and the writing and direction by Greta Gerwig. Saoirse Ronan is a force to be reckoned with. She is only 23 years old, and is already a two-time Academy Award nominee. And I do think there is a strong chance that she'll gain a third nomination for her role in this film. Ronan brings such humanity and energy to this character. She's quirky and out there, but not just for the sake of being so. It works for the character, and Ronan plays it so well. I guarantee you; she is an actor who will be around for a very long time, and this movie reaffirms that for me. Laurie Metcalf is also fantastic as the mother. She has a great dynamic with Lady Bird that gives the movie so much of its conflict, as well as its heart..."
LADY BIRD,23 May 2020,8/10,"The whole film revolves around the main line of the high school student hostess who wants to leave the small town of California to go to school in New York, interspersed with the ups and downs of family and friendship on the road of growth. Societies, boyfriends, broken relationships, first taste of forbidden fruit, college entrance exams, and the oldest and best friends break up and make up, all have seen the plot too many times. But Lady Bird is refreshing because it captures the essence of youth, that is, struggle and run away.The struggle between the heroine and the mother is the core of the film. The film begins with the quarrel between the mother and daughter in the car, and ends with the daughter's weak settlement with the mother in the phone message. In terms of character, the mother and daughter are similar and opposite. First of all they are sentimental. At the beginning of the movie, the two of them listened to the recording of the story in the car and wiped their tears after listening. Secondly, they don't talk too much about their brains, they are unreasonable, and the harshness is startling. On the one hand, the two did not leave room to talk to each other during the quarrel; on the other hand, we saw that the hostess was hurting her friends, nuns in school, and even unrelated teachers. This can be understood as the influence of the family get along mode on how people treat people. But the heroine's brother and father are obviously docile. I am more inclined to believe that part of the heroine 's poisonous tongue is influenced by her mother, more because of her reckless character.Sentimentality and harshness also seem to reflect the advantages of mother and daughter. First, they are very gentle inside. As a nurse, the mother's compassion and care during the visit of her daughter's school priest (also a teacher), as well as her daughter's forgiveness and comfort to her ex-boyfriend, all show that they are actually knife-tofu hearts. The second advantage is the tenacious spirit brought by the tough character. After the father lost his job, the mother worked hard to support the family. Although she often tried to control her daughter's behavior on the grounds of economic pressure, she never stopped silently paying her family. In order to dream of a distant liberal arts university, her daughter applied for tuition subsidies and scholarships, begging her father for help, saving money by working in summer jobs, and never gave up her dream.
For most of the film, the hostess refused to accept herself. The most obvious manifestation is that she changed the name given by her parents (given name) and gave herself a quoted, nondescript name ""Lady Bird"". ""Lady Bird"" can be literally translated as Miss Flying Bird-when people want to escape, they seem to want to become birds and fly away to get a new life. Jenny in ""Forrest Gump"" pulled A-Gump in the rice field and prayed that God would turn himself into a bird so that he could fly far away and escape the abusive father. In addition to changing the name in this film, the hostess also refused to let her father drive the car into the school to cover up her own poverty, and by lying to gain the friendship of the rich girl. The contradiction between the heroine and her mother exemplifies her struggle with the second type of facts. The mother's body is the birthplace of man. The words mother tongue, alma mater, etc. come from this. The hostess's dissatisfaction with her hometown and her rebellion in school are reflected in her quarrel with her mother; her character, as mentioned above, is precisely the one most affected by her mother. The struggle between the hostess and her mother therefore covers her struggle against her hometown and origin. But this kind of struggle is ineffective and naive because of the immutability of its results. Victory by verbally refusing family origins is also often temporary and unreal, and Gatsby is the best example. But it is undeniable that the struggle has brought vigorous vitality to youth. The cuteness of the hostess is that she has not concealed her ambitions, and her constant trial and error. Her struggle was stubborn and naive, and the harm she suffered during the attempt was just as real as the harm she caused to others. Under the hard shell opposite her mother's tit-for-tat, she was also angry and injured because of her mother's meanness.The hostess longed for her mother's approval. This desire became more apparent in the second half of the film, until she tentatively asked her mother: What if my best looks like this now? In fact, she never doubted her love for her mother and her love for herself. As the nun teacher said, what is the difference between love and attention? Only by caring about a person will she be able to follow her every move in every detail, and will be outraged by fear and dissent. The constant friction between the hostess and her mother on small matters. She constantly complained to her mother about her friends, which actually reflected each other's meticulous attention and care. What she really couldn't relieve was that her mother was picky about herself, because she was afraid that her mother could not accept her true self. This worry is the most real problem about love-I love you and know that you love me, but can I like you, can you like me too?
The struggle provided the source of impetus for the escape, and the success of the escape meant the elimination of the struggle and the confusion that followed. When the hostess finally came to the dream of New York, she lost her long-term goal of leaving the town. After the first experience of college life, her side suddenly became empty in the lens-the free sky of the big city actually came from nobody's attention. Accepted the name, accepted the family, accepted the hometown, life has just begun. After all, the struggle against one's own inadequacies is a one-person play that runs through life, is difficult and lonely, and there is no audience or applause."
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,8/10,"I had the opportunity to watch this film during a day of seminars at my high school. We planned to watch this the first time we had the seminar, however not all of my classmates brought the permission slips. Now that everyone brought them, we truly kicked off the seminar with this film, and what be my thoughts?I really appreciated how realistic the acting turned out to be; the emotions, the situations and how the actors responded approach the struggles that plenty of high school seniors face in getting into college. The powerful implications behind the behavior of certain characters, especially Marion, bolstered this further by making the struggles even more believable. In some ways, it actually reminds me of my own problems when approaching college, specifically finding a school where I would fit well, do well, and be well but wouldn't financially strain my parents. The set designs aren't too special, again owing to the fact that they're attempting a realistic approach, but they are utilized nicely by the actors. I don't have much to say about the cinematography, since it covers the angles that would be used with one's eyes to view fascinating events, but doesn't do anything otherwise notable.Despite how much I enjoyed this movie, I feel like its messages and structure will appeal more to those who can immediately connect to it. I feel like the people who would most like this movie are ones like Christine, though I personally do not know many people who are in positions comparable to her own. I could recommend this to older families, but I do feel like a bit more caution should be taken with this film than with other films I rated 8. But should you consider seeing it anyway? Most absolutely."

LADY BIRD,14 November 2018,8/10,"Impressive that this is the Greta Grewig's debut since this is one of the best coming of age movies I have seen.Ronan plays Christine aka Ladybird who is a rebellious teenager inlove with the stage and in a turbulent relationship with her mother.The ingredients may sound trivial but Ladybird is delivered in a very raw way and not for a moment do you doubt this could be a real life story.Effectively, the background is Sacramento but it works as a representation of those who have a inate feeling that they can achieve much more than their life circumstances suggest.This is a great movie across any genre, but especially recommended for those who like movies about real world characters and their relationships - a go to coming of age movie overall."
LADY BIRD,3 February 2019,10/10,"""Hey, I'm like Keith Richards, I'm just happy to be anywhere,"" Larry McPhereson(Tracy Letts) says, sounding like a man who lost his mojo. ""I need a love to keep me happy,"" could just as well be playing in his head. Unemployment, an inevitability, looms, on account of advances in the high tech industry, and his age, sixty, give or take, adds insult to injury. Christine's dad remembers what it was like to have mojo, a man's primal legitimacy of being a household absolutist, the breadwinner. Now, reluctantly, he passes on the mantle and title of domiciliary enforcer to his harried wife, an obstetrician nurse pulling down double shifts, while Mr. Mom, the newly anointed ""good cop"", is relegated to thankless mundanities, such as driving his daughter to school. ""Baby, baby, keep me happy,"" goes the rejoinder to the chorus in ""Happy"", a 1972 Top 30 hit for The Rolling Stones, with Richards taking over lead vocal duties from Mick Jagger. These words, in isolation, and the lyrics that inhabit the song as a whole, are no longer cocksure and demanding words from a sexual dynamo who expects the same wanton intemperateness from his partner. It's a chick's line now. And the prompting has nothing to do with performance in bed. Marion(Laurie Metcalf) doesn't want her husband to get a prescription for Viagra, she wants him to find a job.""Ladybird"", a feminist reworking of ""Pretty in Pink"", does not practice the ""theater of cruelty"" that John Hughes inflicts on Andie Walsh(Molly Ringwald), a sweet seamstress from the wrong side of the tracks in love with yuppie scum. The hammer and nails that Hughes used in building his temples of teen heaven, filmic edifices for adolescent girls to live vicariously in, Greta Gerwig, a demolition artist with remodeling on her mind, razes to the ground, leaving the 1986 archetype in celluloidal ashes. She feminizes a patriarchal text; she exposes the systemic misogyny of men purporting to know the inner-workings of a young girl's heart and mind. The subtextual application of Kathleen Hanna's music, and also, its corresponding paraphernalia, conversely, a deliberate and visible object in the ""mis-en-scene"" , signifying the subliminal, is her method. Gerwig bought the Bikini Kill 7-inch single ""New Radio/""Rebel Girl"". It shows. She also bought Liz Phair's debut album. It would seem. As recounted ad infinitum, ""Exile in Guyville"", a third-generation feminist manifesto of sorts, is a song-by-song response to The Rolling Stones' ""Exile on Main Street"". To build a better ""Pretty in Pink"" from its foundation up, Gerwig goes over the blueprint laid down by Hughes with a fine tooth comb. Soon after the designs on Andie are unrolled from its cylinder, Gerwig shoots her hand up; she has a question, the same urgent question we've been asking for three decades: ""Why do the lyrics to ""Pretty in Pink"" not describe the girl in the film, not even in the remotest sense?"" That's not Andie, a strumpet. Hughes could have commissioned a new song, or at the very least, persist that Richard Butler, lead singer of The Psychedelic Furs, make a few lyrical adjustments. Off their third album, ""Forever Now"", Butler sings: ""All of her lovers all/Talk of her notes and the/Flowers that they never sent/And wasn't she easy/Isn't she pretty in pink?"" Something is off. The dissonance is deafening. ""Pretty in Pink"", if you're paying attention, stops making sense. Andie is a virgin. But what if the title track was meant to reflect the POV, not of the audience, but of Steff(James Spader), who propositions Andie in the school parking lot. Does the film have a secret? Whose side is Hughes on?As a corrective measure, while Larry drives his daughter to Immaculate Heart, an all-girls catholic high school, Alanis Morissette's ""Hand in My Pocket"" blares out from the car stereo. The filmmaker and its protagonist are in simpatico, at long last, joined to the hip by a proper song. ""I'm broke but I'm happy/I'm poor but I'm kind,"" Morissette's canned voice goes, while Larry answers, ""I believe it,"" when his daughter informs him that it took the radio-friendly angstress only five minutes to write. Christine may be broke and poor, but is she happy? Is she kind? The very idea of attending UC-Davis, her safety school and father's alma mater, mortifies Christine. When the notification of acceptance arrives via computer, she melts down, not caring that her father is in the room. Not happy, but ""Shattered"". And Julie(Beanie Feldstein), to her surprise, learns that she is just a friend of convenience, a placeholder until somebody better comes along; a sophisticate, somebody with a New York state of mind. At the film's outset, in a motel room, a stop-over from her college road trip with mom, Christine asks, ""Do I look like I'm from Sacramento?"" Julie does, Christine decides, but not her. The self-styled Ladybird is an urbanite at heart, so she thinks. Not kind, not kind at all. And yet, we like the young woman, warts and all. Her imperfections, and flaunting of these imperfections, give the NYC college-bound girl a veneer of illusory flesh and blood, whereas Andie is simulacrum, quintessentially, a cipher, a male fantasy of what a 17-year-old girl is like. Obsessed with a boy, and, and, and, and... When the prom comes to an end, so does she. Fade to black and fade away, trapped in an echo chamber of OMD new wave balladry. But Andie wasn't built to last. Sure, Christine attends the prom, too, but she has a life after the prom. She lives, even after the lights come up as we're heading towards the exit. That takes a woman's touch.Kathleen Hanna had to happen. She was, and still is, a badass, masculine and feminine in perfect balance, sexy and ferocious, like a grrl. The Goth(Ally Sheedy) needed ""Reject All-American"", Bikini Kill's third and final album, a weapon of self-esteem to ward off The Princess(Ringwald, again), the go-between for The Jock(Emilio Estevez), who totes a makeup bag, in ""The Breakfast Club"". Bikini Kill also needed to be hanged on Samantha Baker's walls, not The Stray Cats, in ""Sixteen Candles"". Although Christine bonds with Julie over The Dave Matthews Band, she harbors a secret musical life. What plays in Christine's room, stays in Christine's room. One of her greatest hits albums, the albums that a guy she meets in college ridicules, is ""Bikini Kill: The Complete Singles"". ""Hand in My Pocket"" is the starter song. She has both hands in her pocket. She is a ""riot grrl"".Just like Greta."
LADY BIRD,14 March 2019,8/10,"What a wonderful, yet very simple story of family, friends, and facing adulthood. The acting is delightfully understated, making the characters seem so real. You won't soon forget Lady Bird, or her quirky character. Thumbs up for this one."
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird: Written and directed by Greta GerwigThis coming of age story is sweeping the award nominations. It seems to be pretty favorably looked upon by critics across the lands. This is certainly a coming of age film. The lead character who designates herself Lady Bird in blatant defiance of her parents is struggling with who she is. She is struggling with acceptance and finding love in the town that she hates so much but informs her every being Sacramento. It's hard to sympathize and understand Lady Bird at first. She treats her parents and friends like crap. For me at least, I was standoffish to this when I encountered it in the movie. I wanted to hate her so much for this. I had to stop myself and think what she is going through. I had to remind myself the kinds of mistakes I made as a teenager. Once I had this understanding, the movie flowed along much better. It was a tender story between a daughter and a mother. They have a hard time communicating with each other about what the other wanted. Lady Bird wants to leave and experience the world. Her mother wants her close to home.This is a fine film. It shows a personal side to this filmmaker or at least it feels that way. I can recommend this movie safely. I give this movie a B."
LADY BIRD,26 September 2020,9/10,"A warm and enchanting movie about that awkward transition from adolescence to adulthood, comfortably packaged as a nostalgic love letter to the lives and places we grew up in. The cinematography was gorgeous and helped capture the hazy, sentimental vibes of sunny Sacramento. Saoirse Rohan's performance was bewildering and perfectly encapsulated the overly ambitious and opportunistic confidence that teenage girls carry as they wish to escape their old lives. The movie set up Lady bird's and her mothers relationship very early on, gifting us a clear sense of their different personalities and the significance they have on each other's lives. Their dynamic was heartwarming to watch, as the movie helped us understand their intentions with one another, and that there was really nothing but love between them. Lady birds character was presented perfectly, as the movie is self aware of her rather egotistic and selfish behaviour, so we never completely sympathise with her, just merely understand her. Her interactions and relationships with each of the characters felt authentic and heartfelt, most notably with her family and best friend. The movie boasts a warm and affectionate nature throughout, with a stellar cast, genuine interactions between characters, and beautiful cinematography. Highly recommend."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,8/10,Lady Bird is a story of a teenager girl that wants to go to the college in New York city with a backdrop of daughter & mother emotion. This film has 5 nominations for tomorrow's 90th Academy Award function. All the best to talented female director Greta Gerwig & team.
LADY BIRD,19 February 2018,8/10,"A truly remarkable coming-of-age comedy, above all for its sincere, credible nature and it is not at all easy to be honest and sincere with a film of this kind, for the simple reason that in most cases these ""coming- of-age ""are often filled with clichés, stereotypes and commonplace, and more often than not they base their foundations precisely on these things. In doing so they are not credible and absolutely forgettable.
Well this is not the case.
The merit of an extraordinary script that is impeccably written, it is a mature, intelligent, often ironic, sweet, credible, intense and also very emotional script. 
Greta Gerwig manages this script in a superb way, despite her little experience (this is her second film as a director but first soloist) is extremely aware of the intensity of her film. The interpretations are also particularly notable and not only that of the protagonist, played by the talented Saoirse Ronan that with this role, in which she identifies perfectly, reaches its 3 nominations at the Oscars at only 23 years, it could be called a new Meryl Streep; but also the interpretations of the rest of the cast: from the young and promising Beanie Feldstein, to the most mature, and in this movie is also very good (so much to receive a nomination, the first in her career), Laurie Metcalf, up to two young masculine promises Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet, both discovered only in these two years (the first in 2016 with his performance in ""Manchester by the Sea"" is the second this year with ""Call me by your Name"".
Unfortunately, however, from an extraordinary beginning, extremely ironic, fun, fresh, the film lost itself a little towards the middle, which is a little heavy, and then it recover itself in the final.
Watching it, it came back to me, given their similarity in terms of the theme and the rhythm, another coming-of-age of 2016, ""The Edge of Seventeen"", also an excellent film that unfortunately was relatively forgotten and ignored."
LADY BIRD,11 July 2019,7/10,"One day I'll find out what people think is so spectacular about this movie. History has nothing special. There are several movies about the girl who is ashamed of the origins and abandons everything to become friends with the popular girl and take a chance with the bad boy of the school! Laurie and Saoirse are great, but I really do not think this movie is anything special, not even the second time watching."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2021,8/10,"Yet another reminder, if any is really needed, that the best films tend to start with the best writing. The script for LADY BIRD is full of great dialogue and moments of surprising little character turns. The performers have been given a lot to work with and they take full advantage, almost without exception.There is really not much story...""Lady Bird"" is a high school senior (Saoirse Ronan) who is just generally rebellious. She's trying out different forms of rebelling or pushing back on norms because a) that's what teens often do, or feel they should do, b) she's smart and restless & c) she blames others for her own problems with rare moments of inward reflection (very believable). Lady Bird dreams of going to a big name East Coast college and getting out of Sacramento, a town she finds so dull that she's practically convinced IT is the reason for her malaise. That and the fact that her mother (Laurie Metcalf) is holding her back, doesn't love her and doesn't like her. In short, she's a favorite film type...the smart and smart-mouthed teen who needs to go on a journey of self discovery. Heck, Haillee Steinfeld just did a great job of this with EDGE OF SEVENTEEN. There is, arguably, no new ground covered in LADY BIRD. Yet what makes it so very enjoyable are the very specific, pointed and sharply observed moments that come one after another. Very few scenes are wasted. No significant character doesn't get to show both their best sides and their most ugly sides. Adults and teens alike. Everyone is confused, perplexed and angry at life to some degree. All are living with some form of disappointment. The film is sharply observed and utterly convincing.Because the script (by Greta Gerwig) is so sharp, and director Greta Gerwig stays out of her own way by keeping things simple and focused on her performers...the actors really get to shine. Everyone is big and well-thought out, but never over-the-top. Ronan, who is generally very, very good...really excels here. I need to go back and watch her in BROOKLYN...such contrasting characters, but both done so well. Another Oscar nomination for sure. She's really quite amazing, and her face is just great to watch. The wonderful Metcalf finally gets a great role in a movie, and she's terrific. As her husband, Tracy Letts is more understated (on purpose) and he builds a delightful character, missing some of the sharp edges Letts often brings to his roles. The rather amazing Lucas Hedges (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA) has another great part, and again hits a home run. It's just so delightful to see everyone clearly having a great time working together to have these interesting characters interact so convincingly (and often heartbreakingly) with each other.I didn't leave the film thinking I had learned lots of new things about the human condition. I wasn't suddenly moved to take action. But I was so thoroughly happy to have spent a couple of hours with these messed-up but so relatable people. Gerwig and her company have really made a small-sized masterpiece here, and I strongly encourage everyone to check out the film."
LADY BIRD,28 March 2020,1/10,"Great movie, touching (Great movie, touching, Great movie, touching)"
LADY BIRD,22 May 2020,3/10,"Very boring movie no story ,just girl live life doing forbidden stuff as she think now she is 18 and she can do whatever she want ,,lady bird was very silly character .and the movie overall not funny anytime there is zero funny scene ..teen stupid girl make 3 quick love story and all end by faliure ... the only thing was good is the actress is beautiful...no comedian in this movie at all"
LADY BIRD,21 March 2018,7/10,"Dear readers, now we can see images from Sacramanto areas as it becomes the filming location for this movie and Saoirse Ronan had tried to act like a normal high school girl, to find her true identity and to pass her hard daily poor family days. Ronan here called herself as Lady Bird as representative herself to be the best version of herself. The movie main idea I think looks like Hailee Steinfeld's Edge of Seventeen or Hairspray, yes it is about young teenager age, with all of the problems of age and how Ronan is trying to adapt of what she faces for the future by embracing her family and loving herself as she is. The brilliant idea of this movie is coming from the friendship and betrayal portrait, the meaning of the money, and the importance of having genuine identity. In the friendship and betrayal portrait, we can see best acting from all supporting actors, that shape the existence of Lady Bird and how this Lady Bird is somehow not afraid to speak of what she needs. This movie is also full of critic for the meaning of money, whose has plots set up inside the poor ordinary house and rich house, as well as office formal image, freelance jobs, and market jobs in some supermarket or supermall, included coffee shops. The other plot is about the genuine identity of Lady Bird, that is surprising, not-standard, and always having fun to do trial and error and never afraid to make mistakes. All those plots together are well played by all actors, especially Ronan as the leading actress in this movie. I could give 8 stars for this movie if there is more complex plots and more comedy that could make me laugh spontaneously. For me, this movie is a still a typical American slapstick drama. Many rude words, some nude scenes, smoking, drinking, and hard action that make this movie is for adult, even though the story is about 18 years old high school girl. I could understand this movie won many awards, because public praise the combination of main idea, drama, and great acting of Ronan. Moreover, this movie shows how the Catholic school system teach their pupil to always believe in God by appreciating the others and choosing the dream as far as they could. I think Lady Bird is becoming religious one when she is growing up and how she will miss Sacramento influence as I miss Ronan's influence to me to adore American drama."
LADY BIRD,14 December 2019,10/10,"Lady bird is a great film to spend the night watching. It's hilarious, accurate (kind of), well directed by Greta Gerwig and the script is amazing. There are a lot of references. Superb acted by Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Timothée Chalamet and the rest of the cast. Worth to watch and deserved the Oscar nominations."
LADY BIRD,18 February 2018,8/10,"The movie is about Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a senior who lives at the wrong side of the tracks as she says so herself, who wants to experience more than what life in Sacramento, California has to offer. She lives with her dysfunctional family, her brother Miguel (it wasn't really established but I think he's a foster kid) and his girlfriend Shelley; Larry, the depressed dad who's just happy to be anywhere and then there's the mom, Marion. I am telling you, if you want an idea what my mom is like, refer to her. I related to Lady Bird at least in that aspect, having someone constantly criticizing you and is always shouting at you even if you haven't done anything wrong. No wonder her father is depressed. Just kidding. But it's not all hate, they have mother and daughter moments like picking out a dress for prom which somehow makes up for all the craziness.What I liked about the movie is it's fast paced so there never is a dull moment. I'm surprised when I read that the initial working material was worth 6hrs long but the movie only runs for 94 minutes. While it has its funny moments, (think the Royal Tenenbaums, Napoleon Dynamite) the rest either you've already seen somewhere before and some are inside jokes you will only get if you're American, or specifically from California. Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch, as she was in 'Brooklyn' and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. She might not win an Oscar for this but she's certainly starting to make her mark in Hollywood.Favorite quote: Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention?"
LADY BIRD,1 December 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird Gets out of its Own Way to be a Great FilmLady Bird is a coming of age story of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, and it's a well done slice of life. Her mother is overbearing and abusive, a bit of a cliché', but because the character is in the hands of the adept Laurie Metcalf, it works. And Saoirse Ronan is nearly perfect in the starring role. In fact, all the acting is top notch. Moreover, the script works. Clearly, the author, Greta Gerwig , took the time to edit and craft dialogue carefully so that it is natural. At the beginning of the film, the animosity between Lady Bird and her mother was over the top. But as the film and the characters developed, the dialogue made more sense. Her mother was unhappy and overly critical, but it was real. The mother isn't a pleasant character, Lady Bird is a bit too dismissive and dad (great acting by Larry McPherson) is caught in the middle. Yes, mom is annoyingly cloying, and Lady Bird is inconsiderate. And that is the way mothers and daughters are toward each sometimes. The boys in the film are also developed enough to not be stereotypes. It's amazing how a woman can write such realistic male characters. I would never think a woman could do that! The music mainly stays out of the way, and while some scenes go over the top, overall, it succeeds. Rating: Pay Full Price Good acting makes up for a few trite moments."
LADY BIRD,29 May 2018,3/10,"I get to see films late, because I can't afford theatres anymore and nor do I have cable. So I literally just saw this wildly praised 2017 film -- the highest rated film ever on Rotten Tomatoes! good lord! You'd think it was a unique masterpiece of some kind. Instead it is a very ordinary coming of age film, very similar (not as good IMHO) as last year's ""Edge of Seventeen"" with Hailie Steinberg. It also resembles very much the old 90s series ""My So-Called Life"" with Claire Danes who resembles Saorise Ronan here a lot, down to the kool-aid red hair and jerky boyfriend. You can even go back to stuff like Molly Ringwald (also red hair...what's with that?) in ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Pretty in Pink"" in the 80s.If you've seen the clips from ""Lady Bird"" on TV -- where she throws herself out of a moving car (hello! and only breaks her arm? not a concussion or DEAD?) -- or where she & her mom (an excellent Laurie Metcalf) bond over finding a cool vintage dress at the local thrift store -- you've seen the funniest, cutest parts anyhow. The rest is filler.The strangest thing IMHO is that director/screenwriter Greta Gerwig INSISTS the story is NOT autobiographical....even though A. she grew up in Sacramento and B. is almost the exact age of Lady Bird AND went to Catholic high school and C. her mother is also a nurse and her father is also a computer programmer and D. she got into a pricey NYC college. If you want to write something that is NOT autobiographical, the for gosh sakes -- change a few things! make the mother a school teacher or a florist. Make the dad a barber. Send the protagonist to public school (there is nothing critical to the plot about Catholicism and Gerwig is not a Catholic, despite attending Catholic school). Set it in Fresno or Ojai or Oxnard. Or in Ohio or Michigan or Tennessee -- kids there also want to escape to ""the Big Apple"". (BTW: for folks who never lived in CA...Sacramento is a mere 90 minute drive from San Francisco, a large sophisticated city with many fine colleges including Berkeley next door. You could go on a Greyhound bus if you wanted!) Except for a ""montage"" at the end of various sights that are presumably popular Sacramento spots....there is not one thing in the story to place it there, except that characters refer to the city. It could have been set ANYWHERE. The point is a teenager who scorns her hometown. That is so common amongst teens everywhere! (and most do not grow out of it the second week of freshman year at college).As Lady Bird applies to and GETS INTO a selective NYC college -- despite her high school guidance counselor laughing her butt off at the very idea! as she has mediocre grades at best -- the cost of this is brushed off lightly and her parents are shown REMORTGAGING THEIR HOME! yeah, so her college debts of $200+ can destroy her poor parent's retirement -- or put Lady Bird into six figure NON DISCHARGEABLE lifetime debt -- to major in ""Theater Arts"" -- and then graduate 4 years later in 2007 just in time for the Great Recession! of course....99.99% of real ""Lady Birds"" do not end up as the muse of famous Noah Baumbach and with a fab Hollywood career and incredible industry contacts!"

(BTW: for folks who never lived in CA...Sacramento is a mere 90 minute drive from San Francisco, a large sophisticated city with many fine colleges including Berkeley next door. You could go on a Greyhound bus if you wanted!) Except for a ""montage"" at the end of various sights that are presumably popular Sacramento spots....there is not one thing in the story to place it there, except that characters refer to the city. It could have been set ANYWHERE. The point is a teenager who scorns her hometown. That is so common amongst teens everywhere! (and most do not grow out of it the second week of freshman year at college).As Lady Bird applies to and GETS INTO a selective NYC college -- despite her high school guidance counselor laughing her butt off at the very idea! as she has mediocre grades at best -- the cost of this is brushed off lightly and her parents are shown REMORTGAGING THEIR HOME! yeah, so her college debts of $200+ can destroy her poor parent's retirement -- or put Lady Bird into six figure NON DISCHARGEABLE lifetime debt -- to major in ""Theater Arts"" -- and then graduate 4 years later in 2007 just in time for the Great Recession! of course....99.99% of real ""Lady Birds"" do not end up as the muse of famous Noah Baumbach and with a fab Hollywood career and incredible industry contacts!"
LADY BIRD,21 April 2020,8/10,"This movie is incredibly well-realised. And because of that, it connects with most of the audience who come from small towns, who had changed to fit in in high school, who had suffered the best and worst of the ""firsts"" in life and especially those who had trouble connecting with their parents or even siblings.The movie is ""bittersweet"" because not everything goes well or wrong to the protagonist but rather it matures into a different status quo with shades of grey. Like in real life, the bad experiences become simply experiences we learn from and thus we mature from them and despite how this is the main theme of every coming of age teen movie, this one executes it brilliantly without gimmicks of any kind.Aside from the mesmerizing cinematography, interesting backdrop of the early 2000s and catholic schools and realistically portrayed characters; this movie shines for its very unique themes of strong-personality clashing amongst two very similar people who love each other very much, botched ""firsts"" experiences as a consequence of changing one's self to fit in and leave aside true friends; and a heartfelt coming of age story with no flashy situations but normal high school scenarios' experiences with a contemplative look at the prospect future of an artistically-inclined student who dreams big and fears not being able to make it.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is touching, it's sincere and it's real in every aspect. The incredibly well crafted story is only enhanced by the astounding performances of everyone in the cast with almost no exceptions. And despite some pacing issues and plot stalling after some scenarios played out, the movie concludes with an uplifting and bittersweet finality and a reflection over the experiences we have lived in life while we have barely just started to live it."
LADY BIRD,14 May 2020,5/10,Good movie but not great! This is an another teen movie out there but this one is more watchable than the others.
LADY BIRD,21 January 2019,7/10,"The girl protagonist of this movie comes from a town in California called Sacramento, her family is not rich but also not extremely poor and she has no special skills to be noticed by the other guys of the shool. Although she loves her family and her best friend, she is living an interior (and in some cases also exterior) fight against herself, her origins and the place in which she lives.
For this reason, she dreams to attend the college in New York City, escaping from her life, but it is not easy...
This is a funny and nice movie, an interesting story in which many of us can recognize themselves; furthermore, the characters are well laid out. I liked it!"
LADY BIRD,9 April 2020,7/10,"The opening sequence of ""Lady Bird"" is a terrific scene of a mother and daughter on a road trip to visit colleges. The strained relationship between these two is established in a remarkable way.
Lady Bird (whose real name is Christine) is a rebellious teen who is ready to escape her humdrum existence in favor of a better life on the East Coast. She wants to attend Columbia University, much to her mother's chagrin. She talks her father into helping her apply for financial aid.
College isn't the only thing on Lady Bird's kind. She falls for a boy in her drama class. Lady Bird's best friend is an equally socially awkward girl by the name of Julie. Lady Bird soon dumps her friend in favor of a popular girl and a cool boy (Timothee Chalamet) .
""Lady Bird"" is a good coming of age film that is obnoxious at times. Saoirse Ronan is one the best actresses we've seen in a long time and she is good as the titular character. Laurie Metcalf is also good as the mother."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,10/10,"I loved this film for so many reasons - mostly because it is real life. Mother/daughter conflicts and love, high school senior decisions about college and wanting out of the town you grew up in, falling in and out of love, best friend issues. father daughter love and support.
Lady Bird - played by Saoirse Ronan is so believable. Laurie Metcalf as the concerned and caring mom is real. Tracy Letts plays the loving father who is facing his own problems. Love this cast.
Many may consider this a low key and slow film - to me it is just right.
Kudos to Greta Gerwig for writing this and directing it with such care."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,8/10,"The Gerwig films of the last 5 years except for 20th C Women are films I can watch over and over and always enjoy tremendously. If you are a lover of dialogue and very unique characters you have to be a fan of Damsels, Mistress and others. However, the best two scenes of the film occur in the first 5 minutes. Mom and daughter have a great argument in the car and their characters could not grab anyone more effectively. Then the next scene caps it with an absolutely hysterical payoff (at least to me). But other than a truly rewarding ending, I did not find the other lines or plot twists as over the moon.
But I still loved it and have seen it twice in the theaters. I will of course, again.If I could communicate one thing to Greta it is this: I want to see every film you ever make for the rest of your life. Can you set yourself apart further by using real film to have that beautifully textured, rich, and exhilarating allure of 60's and 70's films like Hitchcock stunners? I do not mean to be rude but why the hell do you need to make these with video when you have no special effects to speak of? That glare and flatness is so damn ugly. Sure, real film costs more, and takes more time, but I feel your films deserve special treatment."
LADY BIRD,12 March 2018,7/10,"The teenage angst girl coming of age plot-less (and I don't mean plot-less as a negative in the slightest) movie. This has become a new genre of movies like westerns, dystopian future movies. etc., except in these the plot-lines don't deviate very much from one to the other. The teenage girl is misunderstood, has one friend. At some point she will have a falling out with her friend, typically because the protagonist starts to hang out with the cool kids, only to realize the cool kids suck, so she eats crow and apologizes to her former best friend and they're on good terms again. This time the teenage girl coming of age is done without the sarcasm (so at least that's original), which is usually heavy with the protagonist in these movies (which I don't mind one way or the other). I'm only scratching the surface.I walk away from these movies always the same. I liked the movie, but it's nothing I would watch again or recommend to most segments of the population, which isn't as harsh at it sounds. There are just much better movies that I would give my seal of approval to before this. The mother/daughter relationship in this movie is insanely common, so to those who that resonates with it may just make the movie worth watching over a movie that I would consider to be a better movie. This movie will also likely work better for you if you haven't seen the other half dozen or so of these that they've made and another dozen or so movies with similar components. This movie did an exceptional job with the various dialogings throughout, particularly between mother & daughter, but also several scenes between friends/teenagers. It did a good job portraying the high strung Type A personality mother with an underlying jealousy towards the daughter with the dilemma of loving her at the same time. The writer director (who I haven't looked up) I would imagine was giving an account of their personal experiences particularly pertaining to the relationship with the mother. The ending gives me mixed feelings. I'd imagine that this is the circumstance of so many mother daughter relationships. From the daughters perspective, they brink on the cusp of acceptance/forgiveness (letting the mothers negative behaviors, such as jealousy towards them slide) and acknowledging the positives, or is the negative behavior towards them to the degree that it's a relationship they need to cut loose? I can guarantee that this is the case with more than 50% of mother daughter relationships. In the end does the mother deserve the respect and love the daughter gives her? I don't know the answer to that."
LADY BIRD,23 January 2018,4/10,"Going into this film, I'd read some really good reviews, ""Lady Bird"" had me hooked before I'd even laid eyes on it, then I watched it, oh dear! A tale of a teenager becoming lost with the pressures of life and having to grow up, problem is she doesn't actually grow up, Saoirse Ronan's titular character is the epitome of a brat, a typical new-age teenager who feels that life owes her a living and is completely ignorant to what is going on around her, her deadbeat, depressed father, her stressed out mother constantly working double shifts at the hospital just to pay the bills and put food on the table, her older brother trying to get ahead in life and escape to something better, all of this goes over the stupidly named Lady Bird's head, and it's downright shameful!And that's another question, why in the heck has she named herself Lady Bird? Her given name is Christine but apparently that's not good enough for her so she's given herself a stupid, immature name instead, going as far as signing this name, Lady Bird, on all documents and well everything, pathetic.Sadly I have never been a fan of Saoirse Ronan, and ""Lady Bird"" has done nothing to change my opinion of her, a talentless actress, part of the new breed that just doesn't cut it to be honest; she just grieves me and I find it difficult to watch her perform.On a more positive note, the film was put together well, smoothly edited and well designed, sadly the pathetic story being told has dragged the quality of the filming process down considerably..., this is a very modern film, despite being set in 2002 and depicts the sad truth about a lot of teenage lives, if it's meant to annoy the living daylights out of you then it truly succeeds, otherwise it fails to achieve what it set's out to.""Lady Bird"" has received a rather bloated score and earned itself some rather exaggerated films, yet what these reviews are telling me I can honestly not see myself, what's so good about this film and why can no one seemingly see how annoying the 'protagonist' is?Mind boggling, but everyone's entitled to their opinion."
LADY BIRD,21 November 2018,1/10,More critically acclaimed rubbish nobody watches. So boring. I wanted to leave a lot early than i actually did byr only stayed because of the mother who plays Sheldon Coopers mum in The Big Bang Theory.
LADY BIRD,5 June 2020,9/10,Very deep story with great characters and performances that makes you want to question life and think about this movie all the time.
LADY BIRD,6 April 2019,10/10,"I love this movie!Lady Bird is the rare example of a small, seemingly inconsequential story perfectly executed by a masterful filmmaker.Gerwig's screenplay follows it's lead character through the end of high school through the eyes of the titular character. Anything that appears to be a big deal to lady Bird is treated like one by the script, this helps the audience relate to the character and her journey.Ronan brings the character to life with her fantastic performance nailing both the humour and more serious moments with a likeable charm.The sporting roles are also handled very well with notable performances from Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet who continue too add to their impressive filmographies.Greta Gerwig is certainly a filmmaker to watch, every shot feels internal and much of the emotional scenes are handled with a subtlety that allows the moment to breathe and doesn't detract from the overall charm of the film. Definitely check this one out if you haven't already."
LADY BIRD,4 April 2020,8/10,"It's a movie that resonates. Especially with the family good talk also can suddenly quarrel, this really sympathize.
Each character is very characteristic and very real, not just to serve the main character."
LADY BIRD,3 December 2017,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a character piece focused on a California high school senior and her coming of age leading up to college. With strong influences from ""Rushmore,"" (seemingly) this comedic and memorable drama is a standout for actress Saoirse Ronan and director Greta Gerwig and as one of the best films of the year. The film's brilliant balance of genuine emotional drama and laugh-out-loud humor is astonishingly smooth. This is easily one of the year's best written films with strong structure throughout. Practically everything in the writing works to the quirky dialogue, realistic back and forth between characters, and our heroin's progression and change throughout the story. Most will find the screenplay refreshingly original minus a few jokes that don't land well with the characters themselves and therefore, the audience.This is also an incredibly well acted film with standout performances from Saoirse Ronan, Lucas Hedges, and especially Laurie Metcalf. The magic behind their performances it that it feels like it's not a performance at all. Diving into realistic and genuine human emotions bring out the most humanistic side to these characters and each one goes above and beyond what was required of them.If there are any negatives to dish out, the surprising lack of external conflict could've hurt the story slightly in my opinion. Being more of a character study, ""Lady Bird"" focuses on the heroin's journey internally but if more external conflict was available to possibly push her further to grow even more, this could've strengthened the already good payoff for the character's climax. Sacrificing these plot devices for realism is a bold move and does have its upsides, but in the case of ""Lady Bird,"" it felt like some unused potential.Really this is a highly recommended film with lots to love about it. It's witty, funny, and compelling to watch from start to finish. Anyone could find something to thoroughly enjoy in this film, whether they're film buffs or casual moviegoers looking for a fun time. ""Lady Bird"" fortunately, has both."
LADY BIRD,18 December 2017,5/10,"Saoirse Ronan has an interesting aura, but that doesn't keep this from being a mediocre story about uninteresting teens (and an unlikable mother). We needed two apologies the audience never gets: Her first boyfriend never says he's sorry he was unfaithful, but instead asks Lady Bird to cover the fact he's gay.
And it should've been the mother to write or call Lady Bird to apologize for not seeing her off to college--instead we get Lady Bird saying thank you to her overly critical mother. The acting was fine--Tracy Letts was good as a sympathetic dad.
Sacramento looked great. But the story does not deserve all the great raves. So just a warning--you might be disappointed."
LADY BIRD,17 November 2017,6/10,"We each have nicknames given to us by loved ones. My dad always called my sister ""boop"" (for reasons unknown), and he called me ""TFF"" for ""Trevor-fo-fevor;"" one friend of mine went by his middle name ""Xavier,"" and another calls his daughter ""goose."" Nicknames always become so personal because they say practically everything about the bond between the name's owner and the name's caller.So what could be told about a girl who gave herself the nickname Lady Bird? One, she has high self-dependency. Two, she seeks image confidence. Three, she feels too distanced from mom and dad to accept their nicknames. Indeed, you learn even more about Lady Bird as her graduation impends- class of 2003.Lady Bird just wants to fly away from dull old Sacramento for college on the East Coast; her disrespect upon the confused adults seems understandable enough, since 9/11 still dawdles fresh in the nation's memory. However, Lady Bird only knows Sacramento's restrictive side. Director/writer Greta Gerwig, along with the small production crew, pays off their united vision in a humble, down to earth fashion similar to an early 2000's comedy. Gerwig's often slow/often fast approach documents Lady Bird's problems under the awkward pressure of growing up into the unknown: awareness about weight gain, knowing who her real friends are, uncertainty about sexuality, plus more you survived in your youth.Lady Bird's oppressive school adds but an extra layer of confusion. The familiar details of a religious institution restrict every teen's need for self-discovery: dancers keep ten inches apart for the Holy Spirit, skirts below knee level, etc. Lady Bird expresses her attitude about the rules by the way she casually eats the communion wafers as if they were goldfish crackers.Yet the girl's shaky maternal bond most allows the coming of age story's real heart to bloom. Right away the two argue in the car about college, a disagreement she ends by opening the door to the pavement. Now a pink cast on her forearm, a profanity written on toward the one she accuses as responsible, explains their whole relationship. Contrary to Lady Bird's assumptions, mother truly loves her, as expressed through a clear balance between disciplined silence and a compassionate ear to keep Lady Bird's head on straight. You may even notice a subtle role reversal, proving Lady Bird's invisible likenesses to her family. So I wholeheartedly recommend Lady Bird for any mother-daughter night out.While the script's more personal than usual, it still comes off one- sided, mainly against Lady Bird's overly oppressive Catholic school experience. Both inside and outside the school, Lady Bird's rebellious actions, such as shoplifting, play either for cheap laughs or to cast a stark shadow over religion. Her two older adoptive siblings also contribute little plot importance besides forgettable reactions about her attitude. These two piercing studded emos of ethnic color should have been more down-to-earth voices of reason, ones different from the parents or teachers, but this opportunity is missed.Gerwig's approach predominantly passed the opportunity of true love for Sacramento as a location. Remember that song about West Virginia? A love letter about the state's old life: older than the trees and younger than the mountains? No comparable love for the city of Sacramento resolves Lady Bird's matters in a satisfying fashion by the end.An added complaint goes to the crew's decision to cast 23-year-old Saoirse Ronan to play a teenager, even though she looks too old to play someone underaged. A couple of the other actors halt the enjoyment, particularly Lucas Hedges' (Manchester by the Sea), clumsy performance as Lady Bird's little turtle-dove.Although many other strong performances keep the production's awards thirst hydrated, especially Oscar-bound Laurie Metcalf, who vigorously plays Mrs. Lady Bird. Stephen Henderson, the underrated thespian from Fences, satisfies as well as the school's cheerful old drama coach.So, if I had a nickname for Lady Bird, it would still embrace the initials LB, for ""Loving Believability,"" as you believe the low points and love the high points. Everyone itches at some desire to leave home, so we each could use a comforting soul like Lady Bird by our side."
LADY BIRD,4 May 2020,9/10,"I loved this when I saw it for the first time recently. I feel like it was a little bit more 'realistic' than some of the other coming-of-age stories I've seen, and for that reason it was more relatable than many I've seen. It was also captivating with lovely cinematography.If you're looking for an action-packed story, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a beautiful work of art, then I'd recommend this one."
LADY BIRD,5 October 2020,9/10,"A portrait as personal as it is universal that Greta Gerwig gives to youth hurt by doubts, insecurity and decision-making. 'Lady Bird' is one of the most emotional and painful drawings that has been captured on the screen with enough intelligence not to fall into the melodrama or the hackneyed tale, even more, the intelligence to treat human relationships, adolescence and life herself in a realistic and poetic way."
LADY BIRD,13 January 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird is definitely one of the best coming of age films made recently. The Edge of Seventeen from 2016 could be put in the same category but this one is still better in my opinion. It will really hit close to home with everyone who live and grew up in a place where not much happens and can't wait to leave it and enter the world of excitement to try to live to the fullest someplace else.The thing that sets Lady Bird apart from most coming of age stories is that it feels much more realistic. The characters are wonderfully written, you really care for them, feel what they are feeling and you sympathise with them. The struggle of teenage years and how difficult these times are for the parents as well, falling in love and getting heartbroken for the first time, applying to colleges in a family that is struggling financially are all themes that Lady Bird covers with great authenticity. Saoirse Ronan shines in her role and is proving once again that she is one of the best young actresses working today. The supporting cast really deliver as well.If you love stories about young people growing up, you like films that make you feel something and are full of witty dialogue and real characters, you should not give this one a miss."
LADY BIRD,30 December 2017,5/10,"Aw, I admit it. I'll watch anything with Saoirse Ronan in it ... such a fine actress, possibly the best of our time. And while I love a coming of age story, the drama in this family setting seemed unrealistic and contrived. Sure dad lost a job and they never moved out of their house on the ""wrong side of the tracks"". But this young woman could go to college. Something of which millions of people can't even dream. Mother-daughter arguments over which college to attend fall a bit flat when we live in a reality where so many can't attend. It started to sound a bit like silly ""rich people's problems"" so I sort of didn't feel super attached to any of the characters (except maybe the mom).I liked the eccentricities of Ronan's character Lady Bird. But I feel the story line could have been much more compelling. Glad I streamed this film instead of pay for it in a theatre ;)"
LADY BIRD,8 February 2019,8/10,"Beautiful, both heartbreaking & heartwarming at the same time, what this movie lacks in originality, it more than makes up for in emotional heft.Both the mother and the daughter put in incredible acting work and build their complex relationship up so well that by the end you really feel their emotions and get where both of them are coming from. Every jab between the two packs a real emotional punch and you really understand the relationship they have clearly. The standout for mr here is the father, who gets little screen time but manages to communicate a complexity of human emotions using little words, using mostly facial expressions.The rest of the cast are more than adequate, with the standout performance coming from the sidekick, who is both funny and emotionally wholesome, looking a lot like a young Jonah Hill.The biggest problem is the originality of the script, since the subject matter is hardly original, relying on lots of tropes apparent in many previous coming of age films. It's hardly Greta Gerwig's fault that this has been done before and for sure she made it better than other movies are, and a very positive change was focusing on the friendship rather than the typical boyfriend problems typical of these films.Another problem is the fact that the movie really feels like Oscar bait, so you need a clear mind going in and to tolerate the fact that sometimes it feels like a vehicle for the 2 main actresses.A 7.5"
LADY BIRD,29 December 2019,2/10,"The only redeeming feature of this movie is the stellar performances by ""Ladybird's"" parents. Both show both empathy and a sense of disassociation that is clearly palpable. Part of the problem with this movie is the theme has just been done to death. Expecting something... anything to happen of note and you will just be left waiting. There was a point in the proceedings where one would have thought it could become something but then it just fizzles. The gay twist thing... yeah, mildly shocking but in this day and age where every other movie has a gay or two well now its the norm so no points there. It will fade into oblivion."
LADY BIRD,10 June 2020,2/10,This movie was boring and tried to be too artsy. A few of the characters were also very annoying. Don't waste your time with this movie.
LADY BIRD,19 March 2020,8/10,"Bird fell in love with Danny at first sight during an audition for the school musical and quickly fell in love. They started to stick together all day, but Danny didn't get any closer. Danny said it was just out of respect. However, the truth comes to light when Bird finds Danny kissing another boy. Danny wasn't trying to cheat, he was just confused and scared about his sexuality. He went to Bird's cafe and sobbed as he complained of his confusion. Soon, Bird met another boy, Kyle. He smoked, played the guitar, formed a band, liked to stay away from the crowd to play the game, treat feelings casually, always under the surface of the sanctimonious hidden a false heart. This is destined to be a section of doomed love. Young love looks naive and ridiculous, but the happiness is true, sad is true, but those who are engraved on the top of the wall, will be wiped away with the wall when you leave."
LADY BIRD,8 March 2018,5/10,This ain't no 'Miss Sunshine'! The musical score is poor. Acting is ok but nothing spectacular. I sleeper of a movie. Didn't pull me in at all. The plot and rhythm of the film seemed as though i've experienced it a billion times with nothing new.
LADY BIRD,28 December 2017,7/10,"This is a good movie but I wouldn't classify it as 10/10. There isn't anything exceptional about this movie or it doesn't add anything else from other teenager movies: clash with parents, being rich and poor, first boyfriends, virginity, prom, going to college....
It does really reflect the immaturity of the writer/director. The good points in this movies are the performances: Saoirse Roman and Laurie Metcalf. They shine throughout the film. The film seems a collection of small stories that the director put together in a rush.
I still would recommend tp any teens age 12-18"
LADY BIRD,8 December 2017,9/10,"Lady Bird is definitely deserving of the praise it is getting. This movie was emotional, smart, and relatable. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie at first because I thought I wouldn't be able to connect or relate to it, but I'm surprised to say that I connected to this movie a lot more than other coming of age movies I've seen. The best thing about this movie was Saoirse Ronan's incredible and realistic performance, and her eccentric but interesting character is one of the best of the year. Greta Gerwig has a bright future in Hollywood if she can keep making movies as great as this."
LADY BIRD,5 October 2019,7/10,"Ladybird is a surprisingly witty and heartfelt coming-of-age drama about an authentic mother-daughter relationship in a small town in the Caliphon. Except for a few lengths in the script
and a few characters that are not worked out it is a really good movie, which proves once again with a masterful Saoirse Ronan what a terrific actress is.7,5"
LADY BIRD,13 April 2018,8/10,"Sacramento, California, 2002. Seventeen-year-old Christine (Ronan), who prefers the artistic yet slightly pretentious 'Lady Bird' as her official title, is desperate to get away from home. Dreaming of leaving her mundane life and financially troubled family behind in favour of a 'city with culture', Christine fails to appreciate everything she already has right in front of her. Navigating her way through relationships, her turbulent relationship with her mother (Metcalf) and her school theatre program, Christine goes through all the trials and tribulations every young person endures throughout their late teens, discovering her true self along the way. Greta Gerwig makes a truly remarkable directorial debut here, working from her own excellent screenplay to craft an engaging coming of age story. Lady Birds strongest factor is without a doubt the terrific performances. Front and centre of the film is Ronan, who is superb as always. Portraying the aggravations and heartache of the titular character, Ronan presents us with someone painfully relatable, allowing us to fully invest in her journey. What works best in the film is the strenuous relationship with Christine and her mother, in which they are frequently clashing. Gerwig's dialogue is written in a way that is raw and human, and there isn't a single line that fails to resonate. Arguments aside, the bond between mother and daughter is one Gerwig reigns focus on the most. It is this bond that cleverly opens and closes the film, and by it's end, we feel like we know these characters intimately. Lady Bird is an impressive debut for Gerwig and another home run for Ronan. I'm glad to see low budget, indie films like this get recognition at awards shows, but in the end, it's not the awards that matter. Focused and sharply written, this is one of the finer coming of age tales in recent years, which will hopefully lead to further films with Gerwig behind the camera."
LADY BIRD,26 November 2017,9/10,"Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, she want's to escape from her home existence, and move somewhere where she can be free.Laurie Metcalf stars as 'Lady Bird' mother Marion McPherson, she wants her daughter to understand the reality of existence, but her struggle to understand her daughter usually ends with the two of them butting heads.I loved the relationship between Marion and 'Lady Bird', their scenes were the life and soul of the movie.The father (Larry McPherson) played by Tracy Letts was good, but there isn't much going on with him.The brother (Jordan Rodrigues) played Miguel McPherson, his scenes with 'Lady Bird' were funny, but he didn't have much to do as an overall character. Beanie Feldstein stars as 'Lady Bird' best friend Julie, all of her scenes with 'Lady Bird' were good, their friendship goes through the motions, and it's pretty entertaining.The various boyfriends of 'Lady Bird' come in and out, but that's usually how it is in high school, friends come and go.Overall, I enjoyed the movie Lady Bird. The relationship between Lady Bird and her mother was all great, the comedic stuff with Lady Bird and her brother was funny, the friendships and boyfriends that came and went did hold my interest, and I had fun and enjoyed the journey of Lady Bird.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaxCE6Tr_8"
LADY BIRD,16 February 2018,7/10,"Greta Gerwig had time to polish the script, it shows. It seems it was done by 2013, so she had time to asbsorb it as well. That´s the first noticeable thing. There isn´t a wasted moment in ""Lady Bird"" and the pace is relentless all the way, like a mainstream version of the first minutes of ""Frances Ha"". There´s confidence in the chosen scenes so it quickly goes from one thing to the next and the film feels like a ""greatest hits"" from a trimmed screenplay. Lady Bird gradually evolves from an odious brat in the hilarious first scene to a grown-up and we see her every step of the way.Saoirse Ronan is perfect for the role but I think it´s Laurie Metcalf who really dignifies the whole thing and takes it to another level. The mother-daughter relationship is the main focus although it´s well balanced with other aspects like first romances, friendships and school issues. Greta Gerwig takes advantage of her wide experience and the film is focused and doesn´t feel like a debut. It´s quick, pleasant to watch and confident about the semi auto-biographical material. She takes bits of Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach and Woody Allen (oh, the irony) and makes something else although it doesn´t really have a strong personal voice.""Lady Bird"" goes through the motions relying a bit too much on the script. It´s too frantic to let any moment breathe. It´s focused on not making any mistake and therefore feels like a safe effort without any stand-out scene. Without the mother character, it would be just another, slightly above average, feel-good comedy about a regular girl. Most of the originality comes from the uncommon setting in Sacramento. She insists on how bad she has it but still goes to college. She gets everything she sets her eyes on, so it´s a rather comfortable ride."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,2/10,I found the movie very slow and overall boring. Not sure why it got nominated for 5 Oscars.
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,5/10,I adore Greta Gerwig and so I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately it's all quirky white girl whimsy with very little substance. It needed much more heart and soul. Not even the brilliant Laurie Metcalf can save it.
LADY BIRD,28 November 2017,1/10,"I mean it has some good acting, but the story is trite, and seriously uninspired. There is nothing to see here that hasn't been done in about one million other Hollywood films exactly like this one. Its the typical Hollywood depiction of the 50's, complete with some conservative strawmen to bat around. Its got your typical ""brilliant forward thinking woman who doens't need any men"" sort of thing. I can't recall what was up with the father in the story, because I just don't remember him or why he wasn't there...or really anything else. I kept on falling asleep."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,10/10,"""You only have your life, your family and yourself so try to make the best of what you have, live authentically and stop wishing for what you're not."" It's something I learned as a young teenager just like ladybird and just like her, my biggest wish was to get out of my boring town and go to where the ""culture is"" where i would be understood. So this movie really touched me on a deep level. Some way or another we all identify to it not necessarily to ladybird but at least to one of the not so secondary characters, young or old this movie will move and warm you. It's a meditation on family ties, building Identity, middle-class struggle and loving what you have. We sail through the life of this girl as she goes through it and learns to be herself authentically and the one thing that impressed me the most is The relationship between her and her mother, the chemistry and the duality they had is so beautiful, two women, so similar and strong but very different and vulnerable (hats off for Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf) and the other characters aren't less important too as I got full of affection for her dad, her friend and **Danny (Lucas Hedges) who was attaching, very affecting and stirring. this movie must be your first choice if you want to have a vague of nostalgia for the young days, get all tear-jerky,sentimental and laugh at the same time, it's a total masterpiece. Thanks, Greta Gerwing!"
LADY BIRD,10 August 2021,6/10,"The performances on screen were excellent, I have to say that. I definitely felt like I was watching a real family and that doesn't happen often. The realism of the acting was very impressive.The movie itself... Pretty forgettable. I love coming of age, character drive stories, but a little more needed to happen to keep my attention and feel as though I really got the point of why I watched what I watched for the last 90 minutes. It just felt a bit too mundane for it to make an impact on me beyond the performances."
LADY BIRD,26 December 2019,3/10,"3rd of the way through, read the reviews... all say nice coming of age movie.Enough done so far to see it as a downtrodden beating overcome by sheer stubbornness."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2019,3/10,"Quirky but too pretentious & hard to watch, Steve Caarell did the- 'annoyed person stepping out of a moving car' 6 years earlier in- 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' & like him, she is fine (but for a cute pink cast), when in real life her imitators would probably be seriously injured. Ultimately I couldn't keep watching it despite the cuteness of Ronan."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,3/10,"The title character has a wonderfully privileged life. Her parents are generous, loving, attentive. Her parents have a loving relationship with each other and with her. Her father works full-time until he's laid off, and her mother works two jobs to send Lady Bird to the best private/parochial high school in Sacramento, Saint Mary's (Immaculate Heart in the movie), which sets her up to get into any university she could want based on her own studiousness, which sets her up for life-long success. They make her aware of the university opportunities available to her, help her apply to the UC system, pay for her higher education. They don't let people abuse her; they spend quality time with her, prepare her meals, shopping, visiting open houses, She had nice clothes, good teachers, and friends at school. Her mother went clothes shopping with her, bought her clothes of her choice, let her wear makeup and get her hair cut/styled/colored. Lady Bird is shallow, spoiled, self-absorbed, narcissistic, and consequently sometimes cruel. She's so lucky and so ungrateful. Sacramento is a great place to grow up. It's the center of state government, has beautiful parks and the American River running through it, is close to the Pacific Ocean, rivers, lakes, mountains, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, San Francisco. That she had so much and is so ungrateful makes me sad. I wish the movie hadn't been so hyped. I could have gone my whole life without seeing that movie and would have been better for it."
LADY BIRD,30 May 2021,2/10,"What's the point of this movie? Other than the main character being really annoying, nothing happens.It's very boring and I feels like a stranger starts talking to you while waiting for the bus about their boring childhood..."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2018,8/10,"This is a coming of age story about Lady Bird (Christine) McPherson, a final year high school student in Sacramento, California. The strength of the film is the depth of character and relationships between of Lady Bird, her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) and father Larry (Tracy Letts). There are lots of coming of age movies, and this is one of the few I've seen in recent times that really did seem to have something new and interesting to say and show. Maybe some of these related to 'first world problems' or perhaps more accurately 'poor people's problems when looking at rich people' but the complexity and reality I found in the issues raised and the way they were addressed did not detract. There are many commentaries about relationships, social settings and societal change relevant to the 2002 setting in this film, which I recall clearly as our elder daughter was in the transition from primary to high school around that time. At times, it isn't easy watching; at times it's really funny and mostly it's encouraging and uplifting. If you have been through that transition from high school to university, employment, or whatever came next for you, I think you'll find something that resonates in this fine film."
LADY BIRD,26 January 2019,7/10,"Director Greta Gerwig has given us a simple yet highly entertaining movie, of a headstrong girl who will stop at nothing to achieve her dreams."
LADY BIRD,6 October 2021,8/10,"To me, this movie isn't for current teenagers but for those who've made their journey to adulthood. This is a throwback, to relive how we weren't really that different from Lady Bird, no matter the era. To rediscover the confusing years, we lived through and believed were our worse, only to fight out that was just the beginning. It's melodramatic, warm, annoying, and bittersweet all at once.Saoirse Ronan (Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson) captures the essence of a stubborn, self-absorbed teenager trying to escape her roots and find her place in the world. The honesty of the characters and ordinariness reminded me so much of my relationship with my mother, we did have very similar conversations. Though I was surprised that the Catholic high school was shown in a positive light, maybe it's the reality in Sacramento. The well-acclaimed Lady Bird serves you drama, with an extra helping of reality."
LADY BIRD,1 April 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird was a surprisingly strong film. I didn't know what to expect with the movie, but what you get is a very funny, well written tale of a young girl from Sacramento entering her senior year of high school, figuring out how to escape to New York City.Christine McPherson is a 17-year-old teen who refers to be called ""Lady Bird."" She lives in a lower-middle class area of Sacramento, a city she loathes, with an adopted older brother who is attached to his girlfriend. She wants to move to New York City and applies to a bunch of universities in the city. However, her Mom, a firm, honest, but fair nurse, reminds Lady Bird of the unlikelihood of being able to afford such a school. She still applies to them, with help from her chronically depressed and unemployed but loving Dad. They keep it a secret between the two of them. To help assist her admittance, she gets involved in the Drama Club at her strict Catholic School. As her senior year unfolds (during 2002-2003), she befriends new people, tries new things and learns more about herself, her family and what she really wants from life. Great Gerwig writes a nice love letter about her hometown and her family. Sacramento frequently gets dismissed for the more glamorous Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego in California, but the wonderful cinematography paints a beautiful city, warts and all. Lady Bird is naive, rebellious, scared and frankly is a realistic teenager. She loves her parents, but they drive her nuts. She wants a boyfriend, but makes questionable decisions. She wants to be popular, but alienates her best friend in the process. She tries to charm the cool math teacher for a better grade. It's funny and it's also true. That's the underlying theme of the movie. In the end, when she finally moves to NYC, she realizes the scenery might have changed, but the true change will have to come from inside, and though it was time to move on from her past life, there was a lot to like about it and she gets a whole new appreciation of her life in Sacramento.Strong writing, brilliant acting, lots of humor and a touching story. Lady Bird was a strong movie and one of the best ones I've seen recently."
LADY BIRD,25 April 2018,9/10,"This movie was on my watchlist b/c it was a coming-of-age story that i thought was going to be good. I wasn't wrong in saying that this movie really has a storyline that is a photocopy of a lot of coming-of-age stories that i saw throughout the years. This movie in particular took that concept and made it into a whole new dimension of the risky and the deadly!Being a movie critic, i would say that this movie started off sluggish but then gradually picked up as the story keeps on rolling through the screen. It made me think and wonder about how the real adolescent is the heavy risk-taker and with ""Lady Bird"" being a catholic, that idea threw the movie into a whole-new concept of high-school drama!Fantastic movie overall, Wish it would have at least won maybe 2 Oscars. If it were to replace the Shape of Water by any dimension! Can't wait to show this movie to my future students! They love it for sure!!!!!!!!!"
LADY BIRD,31 December 2018,,"In what is one of the most overrated films of all time, Lady Bird is a simplistic coming-of-age story about a high school senior who wants to leave Sacramento and head to the east coast. This is my first rewatch of this film, after having a mediocre reaction to it when it first came out in 2017. However, after deciding watch it with the rest of my family (who were very eager to watch it), my opinions have changed. Of course, I still think the film is massively overrated, since it kind of steals from very coming-of-age film ever made. I mean, the fact that it is the highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes (even though that website is kind of inaccurate), kind of baffles me.Regardless, Lady Bird is a very good coming-of-age drama that hits a lot of the beats that I have experienced in my own life. I come from a very small city whose only attraction is a movie theater (not even kidding), and I have always wanted to venture out to the Los Angeles film scene, kind of similar to what Christine is trying to do in this film. It is very relatable to me in that sense. I also love the title character's mother, who is very strict and hard on the surface, but I think she is very loving on the inside. I think the mother was a much better actor than Lady Bird was, and I was honestly disappointed that she didn't win Best Supporting Actress.But my biggest complaint though is that I don't think Saoirse Ronan is the best actress in the world, like everyone says she is. She is good, maybe even pretty good, but she is not the godsend of female actors. I heavily dislike that she was nominated for Best Actress, because I could honestly pick any random white girl from my college, and stick them in the role of Lady Bird, and they could just as fine. Nothing was special about her performance, and that remains to be my biggest complaint.Back to the film itself though, I thought the story was genuine and sweet. The relationship between Lady Bird and her mother was very tough to watch, but it was heartfelt and sincere. The college process was relatable. Timothée Chalamet and Lucas Hedges were handsome as hell in this film. The comedy was great. But I thought the movie was just really good, but nothing exceptional. I make that point because I this film is one of the most buzz-worthy films in recent memory, but I don't think it deserves it.Regardless, Lady Bird is a film that we could all relate too, and everybody should give it a chance."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,7/10,"Admittedly, it's a long way to go to justify a headline that may be too cute by half but bare with me. Not unlike the earwig, Gerwig is scary in both appearance and reputation but not directly harmful to humans. A vibrant beauty with strong comic undertones who could easily have established herself in an industry that values and rewards obedience, regularity and conformity and instead strives for recognition for initiative, resourcefulness and creativity. All-American work values packaged in the All-American girl? Yes. But Gerwig wants you to see her as more than that. ""A science fiction pixie from a strange atomic place"" perhaps. Developing her career as an indie actress in the softer light of a host of delightful indie pics, most notably 'France Ha' ( 2012) and 'Mistress America' (2015), both of which she co-wrote, 'Greenberg' (2010) and 'Lola Versus' (2012), Gerwig is all raw emotion and naked neurosis. Unafraid to portray unnervingly fractured, hapless, fatigued, sexually clumsy characters. The creative offspriing of such indie legends like John Cassavettes and Shirley Clarke. In this, Gerwig is Hollywood's 'earwig', more beneficial then we know, acting as scavenger of decades of decaying movie industry matter and predator to the resident garden pests of old school Hollywoodland. Wew! Told you we'd get there! 'Ladybird' is a good movie deserving of it's present circumstances nestled within the short list of this year's best and critical celebration of actors Ronan and Metcalf. Unfortunately, because these are the times we live in, it is Gerwig's talents (and alas subsequent gender) as the writer and director of 'Ladybird' that are stealing the show. One wonders how tired she must be of telling reporters that 'Ladybird' is not a true story. As if a female writer must drink from the well of her own non-fiction. ""And when exactly did you run into this monster, Mrs Shelley?"""
LADY BIRD,16 February 2020,10/10,"This feeling really hits home for me. We always believe that something better is out there and that what we have now is what is stopping us to go there. Lady bird's resentment against her mum and hometown really speaks to me. They capture the feeling of a teenager so particularly well.One other scene that stands out for me was the one when she found out her boyfriend was gay. But despite how devastated she was, she still comforted him when she found out he was frightened. It shows the complexity of their relationship. There is so much more to it than just attraction, but their care for each other. That scene was moving and I think represents a lot of relationships."
LADY BIRD,19 November 2017,10/10,"I love Greta Gerwig. I admit it. As far as I can see, her movie roles are all a version of herself, which is utterly charming. So obviously I had to go see this.Yet ANOTHER coming of age film? Yes and no. Yes, the same subject matter. No, not the same approach. It's like saying Lord of the Rings was a movie about talking trees. Greta, who both wrote and directed the movie, sustained the high level throughout. How often do you see this? Usually the first 10-15 minutes are funny, then they run out of ideas. But Greta kept the ideas coming, and the result was (to me anyway) a completely new take on a high school girl coming of age.For one thing, I was laughing out loud every few minutes. I won't give away the best lines, but they were all fresh and unexpected. Let's just say that the football coach as director of the school play was inspired. But so was the mother. And the father. And the friends. And the boy friends. It was all just brilliant. Time and time again Greta was faced with yet another trite situation that she made fresh and funny. And the acting--except for the lead character, we had journeyman actors. But they all did a great job. Not too little, not over the top. Just right. And Saoirse not only made herself LOOK like Greta (same smile....) she SOUNDED like Greta. A friend we saw the movie with was convinced Greta was playing herself in the movie. We had to convince her it wasn't. Whether this was intentional or not I don't know, but in either case Saorirse did an outstanding job."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2020,7/10,"I watched Lady Bird several times in a row, and found that this is a film that doesn't feel tired at all. I like its color scheme, scenery, music, actors' wear and so on. On campus life, some people yearn for, some remember, some regret. I think many people who like this film should find the resonance in this film or the heroine like me. She experienced what you and I have experienced more or less, right? I used to be capricious, reckless, vanity, hurt people, not care about others, like to play with people who are rebellious like me, and see injustice and will not be fair, have dreams, big dreams, dreams that are too weak for the body When someone tries to destroy it, they will also raise their thorns and be ready to rush over. If a color is used to describe that period of youth, it should be red, hot, full-bodied, with the power to devour everything. The female host 's many emotional fluctuations in the drama can arouse my memories and really understand her mood. When she was still immersed in the excitement of love, her mother broke through and was forced to accept the news of her father 's unemployment. , The feeling of insisting on waking you up from a dream. And when she insisted on going to the favorite university and the constant quarrel with her mother, her mother blamed her for being selfish and greedy, never thinking about her people, and she was disappointed with her mother 's lack of support and understanding. Several conflicts and several conversations were about It's not like the ones you and I have had with parents. The ending of the movie starts a new campus life. In a brand new city, a city without best friends and favorite family, she realized how much she missed her family and loved them. The movie has given us a warm ending, but how many parents and children are still unable to get rid of conflicts and contradictions in reality, then look at ladybird together will it be better?"
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,7/10,"Greta Gerwig's pseudo indie film ""Lady Bird,"" is a very entertaining, relatable, and heart-warming surprise. The film has the look, budget and feel of an indie drama, but moves at the pace and quality of a mainstream film. Saoirse Ronan leads the cast of very talented young actors who all give stellar performances. Greta Gerwig, and company produce a not entirely original but effective dramedy about adolescence, finding one's place and the at times, tumultuous relationship between mothers and daughters. ""Lady Bird"" rises above the overcrowded teenage dramedy genre with enough vigor to give itself an identity, but can't reach the stars due to its genre limitations. 7.5/10"
LADY BIRD,13 October 2019,3/10,"I just don't know what I'm supposed to like in this film. I'm not American, so this had zero nostalgic value for me, which I think is a reason a lot of people like it. I had no 'ins' to relate to the unlikeable lead character (although I will say the actress did the best she could with the scant material she had to work with). I'm just baffled by it.Why was I watching a movie about this character? What was so compelling about this story that it managed to drum up a ten million dollar budget? None of that budget is on the screen, by the way. This is a very plainly shot movie with a muted colour pallete and takes a lot of inspiration from countless 'mumblecore' movies of which I'm not a fan.It needed some joy, tragedy, challenge, spice - anything. It's a proper bowl of unsalted porridge. No, I don't know what that means either.The three stars are in respect to the quality of the acting. I wouldn't recommend it. Should you watch it? Well, I'd say this is one book you absolutely can judge by the cover. Look at the movie's poster. Is that image of Lady Bird's profile utterly compelling to you? If so, you'll love it."
LADY BIRD,17 December 2017,5/10,"As a general rule, I don't care for coming-of-age movies. Having already done that myself, I find little reason to pay to do it again. However, led by the reviews of Lady Bird, the fine actresses Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan, and the charm of writer/director Greta Gerwig, I took a shot. I should have waited for it to play on cable. I've seen this film before. You've seen this film before. Pretty much anyone who saw Ghost World or Juno or Thirteen has seen this movie: rebellious daughter fights with her mom, Take 30. Ronan and Metcalf are fine. Gerwig handles her material and cast professionally, though with the actors she assembled that's hardly a surprise. The cinematography is dull and a little under-lit, though, which leaves the film with an overall bland, generic look. There are a few bright scenes scattered throughout the film, particularly towards the end. But overall, it's not a terribly interesting movie."
LADY BIRD,19 November 2017,6/10,"Greta Gerwig, usually disappoints me - as an actress and now in her writing and directorial debut, LADY BIRD, a coming-of-age film about a seventeen-year-old girl growing up in Sacramento ""the Midwest of California"" (the best line in the film,) and the love/hate relationship she has with her working-class family and peers. Social distinctions figure prominently in Gerwig's cinematic world of ""ironic class strivers."" I keep wondering why I am left cold by her words and her characters and eventually understood that LADY BIRD is too self-consciously trying to be inclusive - inclusive of every contemporary issue - touching upon a diversity of characters and situations with momentary episodic flashes.The touch is light, illustrating concerns rather than delving into them, giving us tokenism - glossing over deep pain and longing with a CliffsNotes diminution.Saoirse Ronan is excellent as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson - a nickname she gives herself to appear distinctive. I am sympathetic to the aspirations of a young, self- involved teenager searching for a path to glamour and excitement. Youth is an innocent time - one open to endless fantasies - reality has not yet penetrated the hermetic world of dreams. The ""firsts"" of the teen years - first kiss, first sexual experience leading to the loss of virginity, first self-awareness of one's own ethical and moral values, and the critical realization that the world is not always spinning for you alone - solely for your personal gratification.The film opens with Lady Bird and her mother - a wonderful performance by Laurie Metcalf - who is driving and listening to Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath on audio tape - both simultaneously weeping, moved by the beauty of the spoken words; their mirrored responses reflect their enduring affection. And suddenly the mood is shattered and we see the other side of their relationship - a mother who works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse to supplement the family income so that her daughter can go to a private Catholic school; the burden of monetary expenses weighs heavily on her shoulders. The ever-present resentment that comes with sacrifice is often unleashed on her oblivious daughter in a torrent of sarcasm, humiliation, and disparagement.Greta Gerwig is at her best in the scenes between mother/father and daughter. A lovely tenderness exists which is often choked and stifled by the exigencies of financial straits.The underpinnings are there for a truly fine movie, but in the rush to cast a wide net, Gerwig compromises her subjects' humanity, placing a veil of bromides over what could have been profound interactions. Maybe next time. I hope so."
LADY BIRD,26 January 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird in short: A coming of age story that takes place in 2002 Sacramento, California. The titular character is Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan-pronounced Ser-sha), but she prefers to be called by her nom de guerre, Lady Bird (I too would prefer that IRL, so much easier to remember). She has an emo brother, Miguel, a never-have-anything-nice-to-say mother, and a cool dad. This is a semi-autobiographical tale of director Greta Gerwig's own life.Is there another term to use that describes a movie where the protagonist is around ""that age""; you know, becoming more self-aware and transitioning from adolescence to adulthood, etcetera, other than ""coming of age""? I didn't think so. So, this coming of age story follows Lady Bird on her journey through senior year at a co-ed private catholic school. She's poor and hates it almost as much as she hates the name ""Christine"", Sacramento, being a virgin, and so on. 
She wants out of Sacramento and would rather go to college out east, preferably New York, and not Davis - that's way too close. Lady Bird's private school classmates are mostly the rich, snobby type and nearly her polar opposite. The only reason why Lady Bird goes to this school, as her mother, Marion (the awesome Laurie Metcalf) likes to point out, is because Miguel witnessed something awful in public school. Like any awkward girl in a new school she tries to fit in by being someone she's not. Unfortunately, Lady Bird's goals transcend her actual circumstances. Hilarity ensues.Two things you'll LIKE about ""Lady Bird"": 1) It's dry sense of humor. Example, ""Don't worry I'm not gonna snitch on you,"" says Kyle. ""I hope not, cause I'd kill your fuckin family,"" dead-pans Lady Bird. 2) Laurie Metcalf's version of your mother. She's Oscar nominated (2018) for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. Well earned.Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) Albeit witty and well-acted, the story is typical of most American coming of age films. Don't misunderstand, Ronan is brilliant in her role but avoid this movie if you're just sick of the genre. We've been there, done that. 2) Why the constant dissing of Sacramento?"
LADY BIRD,19 December 2020,8/10,"Lady Bird is an interesting movie in every way. Lady Bird is definitely not a masterpiece. It´s relatively simple and nothing extraordinary happens. However, sometimes movies manage to create a certain mood, Lady Bird is one of them. This movie has something, it has flair and charm.What´s the reason for that?You can identify with the main character Christine to a certain extent. Everyone has experienced similar things during the own school days or the own youth. It´s not even about concrete situations, it´s about actions, decisions or mistakes which you have committed yourself. It sounds simple, but that´s exactly what makes the movie special.It´s similar to Mid90s. Of course, it´s hard to compare these two movies, and Mid90s rides the nostalgia line heavily. Nevertheless, you automatically create a reference to your own youth.But the movie can do much more. Lady Bird shows how Christine develops and takes another step towards adulthood. The move to university represents a new beginning through which she has matured. However, it turns out that she is still inexperienced and makes other 'wrong' decisions. It´s like real life, you never stop learning.Overall, we have a mix of serious tone and funny inserts. This mixture, coupled with the personal reference to the own youth makes Lady Bird for me to a successful coming of age movie."
LADY BIRD,16 March 2018,7/10,"A very unique and fun experience, with beautiful cinematography. Saoirse Ronan is definitely the best part of the film. Most of the humour was sometimes subtle, and sometimes really surprisingly funny. All the actors were great and worked together extremely well. I liked how the teenager characters had flaws such as acne and extra weight, unlike most high school set films. The mother- daughter relationship is so unique, and is genuinely close to the reality. The ending was quite sad but could be improved. It really leaves the audience without the closure needed for this type of film. A very good watch, for most ages."
LADY BIRD,18 April 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird, the film about a misunderstood high school girl who wants more in life.
This film is an instant classic from director Greta Gerwig and a fabulous performance from actress Saoirse Ronan. Lady Bird is a true representation of each and every human being at different points in their lives. You have the highs and lows, the ups and the downs, and you never know how anything good could come out of it. The movie is a heartfelt comedy with family issues, new friendships, and new experiences that delivers the message of trying to be the greatest version of yourself possible.""Just because something looks ugly doesn't mean that it's morally wrong."" -Christine 'Lady Bird' McPherson, Ladybird"
LADY BIRD,7 January 2021,2/10,Everyone hyped up this film but i found it so boring. The storyline was terrible and people probably only watched it because 'Timothee Chalamet was so good looking in it' which i didn't find the case.
LADY BIRD,21 October 2019,6/10,"You could watch from minute 1 to minute 93 of this movie or you could watch from minute 20 to minute 50 (or any other arbitrary section), and the experience would be about the same, as this movie plays out as a montage of Lady Bird's senior year in high school: her loving yet very tempestuous relationship with her mom, her burning desire to get the hell out of Sacramento, her exploration of theater arts, friendship, and first romance.There are fun individual scenes and moments, but there's no story that's pulling you through with anticipation, unanswered questions, or a desire to find out what will happen. It reminds me of the indie festival darlings of the early 2000s when it was an original, unusual idea to create a story without much of a story and instead focus on moments realism. That's now been done a million times over, and I personally prefer a story rather than a montage of scenes (and sometimes it does feel like a montage in that it might go like this: 15 second scene, 40 second scene, 10 second scene, 10 second scene, 30 second scene, 20 second scene, 5 second scene, 5 second scene, and finally.... a longer, meatier scene.)This movie was nominated for a Best Movie Oscar and director Greta Gerwig got a ""Best Director"" nomination too. I feel like this was in large part due to Greta Gerwig being a somewhat well-known actress and a first-time female director. While I'm all for opening more doors for female writers and directors in Hollywood, there were plenty of other female-helmed movies in 2017 that surpassed this one."
LADY BIRD,21 August 2020,2/10,"Gosh, we both wish we could have the time spent watching this tripe rubbish movie back.AVOID"
LADY BIRD,13 January 2020,7/10,"Overall I liked the movie...Seemed pretty realistic story for a high schooler going through everything from image issues, family embarrassment, trying out new friend groups, going away to college, parental disagreements, etc.
I'm not exactly sure what the movie was about, but it was an interesting look at a family struggling financially and the choices they are forced to make. There were a few slow spots where I'll admit, I did fast forward. I kind of wished the ending had a little more substance to it."
LADY BIRD,23 August 2021,7/10,"Lady Bird demonstrates the director's ability to magnify a character's internal struggle in each person's self-identification, as well as the plight in relationships with family, love, friendship, and future. It's a work without much ambition, but simply narrating the story of a mediocre senior, trying to stay in the center and be a rebellious child. The last shot of the film reflects on her bewilderment even after the entire story, but what she gained in the year is resolution, love, and memories that will aside her for life. Religion also plays an interesting role in the work as it quietly adds on to the protagonist's mood and meditation. However, Ronan's performance just isn't my taste."
LADY BIRD,10 February 2021,8/10,"Watched this freshman year of college with a group of friends. it's hard to describe the collective experience but when we left the theater everyone was stunned with how deeply it resonated. the relationship between lady bird and her mom is very clearly fleshed out without being trope-y. at the same time, we'd all had the same conversations with our moms before."
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,8/10,"Funny, biting and never anything less than human, Lady Bird is an assured directorial debut for indie darling Greta Gerwig. Through her writing and directing, she seems to have absorbed the best qualities of frequent collaborator Noah Baumbach while infusing the film with a personality that feels decisively her own. The characters feel real, the dialogue is snappy and full of witty interplay and it's all neatly packaged into a brisk 93 minutes meaning Lady Bird never looses its edge.In the titular role, Saoirse Ronan stars as Christine McPherson, a rebellious seventeen year-old who dyes her hair pink, eats communion wafers like snacks and insists that everyone call her Lady Bird. Living in the anaemic suburbs of Sacramento, California (as characterised by an opening quote from Joan Didion), the film follows Christine as she navigates her last year at a Catholic high school from shifting friendships, first loves and, of course, prom.Despite containing all the requisite elements, calling Lady Bird a coming of age story feels reductive as the film ruminates on parenthood just as much as it does on adolescence. Christine's strained relationship with her mother is an integral part of the story and the depth afforded to her parents ensure they are not simply ancillaries to Christine's own personal growth.Her mother, Marion (Laurie Metcalf), struggles to accept Christine for who she is, juggling her responsibilities as a mother with her willingness to provide unconditional love. She tells her daughter, ""I want you to be the very best version of yourself that you can be"", to which Christine replies, ""What if this is the best version?"" On the other hand, Christine's relationship with her father, Larry (Tracy Letts), is less tempestuous but marked by a brewing sadness. Having recently lost his job and struggling with depression, Larry has to come to terms with the fact that his daughter will soon move out to go to college. The poignant scene the two share together on Christine's eighteenth birthday is pronounced by the mutual understanding that the transition into adulthood means letting go. The film is remarkably well balanced in its depictions of both sides of the coming-of age narrative. The trials and tribulations experienced by both
Christine and her parents' is why Lady Bird will likely feel relatable to audiences of all ages. Even so, Gerwig has stated that she wrote the character of Lady Bird as the opposite to how she was in high school. Perhaps then, Lady Bird feels relatable, as through Christine she has crafted a character for the rebellious, non-conformist streak within all of us."
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,4/10,"Maybe i'm too old for this movie (just turned 32) but the way i was raised, i would get bitch slapped the way lady bird behaves. I'm so fed up with films that glorify bratty behavior. (the same thing happened with 'birdman'. emma stone's character was the worst) if you relate to this movie, i'm glad i didn't know you in high school. (or ever) points for saoirse ronan cause i do love her as an actress, and the film had some funny parts, but it was so obnoxious, i couldn't finish it."
LADY BIRD,2 December 2017,6/10,"the main character jumping out of a moving car at the beginning of the movie set expectations too high for this nice beginner director movie. The mother/daughter relationship was okay, and there were things in the middle of the movie that started to really get my attention, such as the back stories of some of the characters. The family dynamics were good and you found out certain things subtly, such as the late motherhood, the obviously adopted brother, the kind but depressed father. The bathroom as a place of mother/daughter communication was cool but the idea that a middle class ranch house only having one bathroom in Sacramento is silly/unnecessary. Also, the disjunction between the mother's professional role as a psychiatric nurse and her vaguely crazed behavior at home doesn't make sense, it's too different, way past the ""wounded healer"" syndrome of most people in psychology/psychiatry, believe me, I know these fields, all to well. Otherwise, it's kind of a standard ""coming of age"" high school transition to college movie with nothing really much happening to a middle class, somewhat privileged white girl/woman. There is something done well with the idea of place memory and belonging, however, that did hit home, this is seen in the car scenes transposing mother and daughter, although most scenes were not well framed or imagined. The general sense is that the movie is almost there, but it's really not that great, you want it to be better, in the mode of ""Boyhood"" ""13"" ""The Last picture show"" Some good bits but just barely worth your time in a big screen movie theater. And much of the acting was good-ish almost better than it needed to be."
LADY BIRD,30 January 2018,6/10,"Really wanted to like this movie, but the best scene was put in the trailer where Lady Bird jumps out of the car. Otherwise, some good ""memory in the hazy sunlight"" scenes, anyplace can be home, even suburban Sacramento, but the mother-daughter strife didn't seem believable, it seemed way amped up and didn't square with how sensitive the mother was in her work. And little was really done with the tension between the obviously adopted brother until very late in the movie, as if it was tacked on. Also, how could such a crazed mother then allow the son to have his girlfriend live in, this flexibility and openness also argues against her single note passive aggressive behavior toward Lady Bird. Also, this is really just another coming-of-age movie that isn't particularly unique in the genre. So, a solid B effort here."
LADY BIRD,2 June 2018,10/10,"'Lady Bird' is a moving and entertaining portrait of adolescence, with thanks to writer and director Greta Gerwig and leading actress Saoirse Ronan.
Given its seemingly simple storyline, following a young girl as she comes of age, I was surprised at how unique I found this movie. The majority of coming of age films have a similar formula, following common tropes; being an outcast in high school, falling in love for the first time, experimenting with different substances and so on. Just your typical teenage storyline. While 'Lady Bird' may have these throughout the film, it manages to feel fresh and unique and an absolutely mesmerizing film experience. Having the perfect balance of humor and drama, the story of 'Lady Bird' is one not to be missed. Drawing from her own life experiences growing up, Gerwig articulates a loveable and realistic story, with a focus on a complex mother-and-daughter relationship that is engaging and heart-breaking. But it's really the character of Lady Bird herself that's the highlight. As the audience follows her day-to-day life, with her mishaps and experiences, it's difficult not to fall in love with the character, with all her quirks and mistakes and truly makes this film a gem.
Led out by Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, who both shine in their roles as mother and daughter, these actresses share an amazing chemistry that brings the story to life. They are supported by an all-around brilliant cast, with Lucas Hedges and Beanie Feldstein standing out. All of these actors work with the exceptionally well-written screenplay effortlessly and deliver their lines as if they're having a real conversation.
The cinematography in this film, by Sam Levy, is absolutely beautiful, with its warm tones and grainy aesthetic.
Overall, this film is definitely one of the best films of the year given the fact that it's perfect in every way possible and is certainly become an instant favourite of mine."
LADY BIRD,9 August 2018,3/10,"The viewer will have a look on the life of a girl ""lady bird"" in a town called ""Sacremento"".. a teenage view on what is considered of value and importance in her life.. it is very sweet coming out of age movie.. the plot is straight forward, unique, and presented fairly the rebellion phase of teenagers such ""lady bird"".. I kept thinking about ""lady bird"" and how common her actions to me.. it is a family love story.If you like boyhood movie then this movie is recommended!"
LADY BIRD,17 November 2017,7/10,"This is an entertaining, well-made film with comic elements. As a mother-daughter story, I thought it failed. The mother depicted is an abusive narcissist, and the movie seems to soft-pedal this.Lady Bird's mother is verbally abusive with occasionally frightening results. Yet ultimately the film does not really explore the effects of this on Lady Bird (Christine). The abuse is ultimately depicted as just typical human flaws and a conflictual mother-daughter relationship. At the end, I felt like I wasn't sure what would become of the main character and I don't think the filmmaker knew either.The film does have many memorable comic scenes of Lady Bird's high school life at a Catholic school. The film also addresses ageism and adoption, which is rare for a Hollywood film. It's worth seeing, but if you think this is an accurate depiction of normal mother-daughter conflict you are wrong. The mother is highly pathological and the depiction is more like an accurate portrayal of a pretentious narcissist."
LADY BIRD,23 November 2017,8/10,"I went into Lady Bird fully expecting to dislike the character of Lady Bird. From the trailers, she seemed like a self centered ungrateful brat. To some extent that holds true, it takes the self- named ""Lady Bird"" a while to consider the needs or feelings of others, but she experiences tremendous development over the course of the film. She really is an ordinary teenager, a confused girl who is simultaneously self-obsessed and tremendously empathetic.Saoirse Ronan brings a ton to the role of Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, a teenager trying to find her way in the world. She hates and loves her mother, brilliantly played by Laurie Metcalf, but she struggles to cope with those two conflicting feelings.Laurie Metcalf really elevates the role of Lady Bird's mother, she is perfectly described by one character as warm, but scary. She loves Lady Bird, but she doesn't really like her because she sees how much more she could be if she is able to get her head on straight. Metcalf should win an Oscar for this role as she is really what makes the whole thing work. The core of the entire film is the relationship between Lady Bird and her mother, and Ronan and Metcalf are perfect in how they play off each other here."
LADY BIRD,5 April 2018,8/10,"If you go in the film you'll find stroyline is very plan and simple. but what makes it a good movie is the characters played by the artists. Lady Bird has played its part very well that you'll stick in your seat till end. 
Thought not to watch 1st but after watching I said ""This lady bird can actually fly""I bet what you'll like in this is the acting. Don't miss to give it a look."
LADY BIRD,9 January 2018,2/10,"Feminism and anti-white male prejudice all wrapped up in the one movie. Reviews: ""Oh I am so into this - this is/was me and I love it (me)."" Except for the very talented bit - probably true for most.Ok - it is clear I am over all the ""young female breaks stereotype and saves the world/family' movies. But please - will they stop anytime soon?? When are we going to have another As Good As It Gets - or is this now as good as it gets? Either this drivel or CGI drivel about male superheroes - is that it?? Do they realise the total movie audiences are more than just female teenagers (and male teenagers willing to go along for the obvious reason). Come on Hollywood lets get back to real movies and real things.End of rant - feel better now :)"
LADY BIRD,6 February 2021,10/10,"What I love especially about this film, among many other things, is its calm tone. The film takes its time to credibly portray its protagonist. And in fact, at some point I forgot that I was watching a movie, not a documentary. I believed the mother-daughter relationship of Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf one hundred percent. And I believe that millions of young people can identify whith the rebellious Lady Bird and find a great role model in her."
LADY BIRD,20 May 2019,2/10,"This film fell short. As a true ca person who been there all her life I felt that this film did not really show what ca is really about.I fell that the director does not really know what makes ca special ever so she grew up in ca. The plot had so many gaps in that made the story not to flow really well, I felt that the acting was really bad.
One good part of this film is showing how hard it is for kid and parents to be on the same page on life."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2020,9/10,"I really liked this film, it was funny, relatable and good. it's just such a great film and i recommend it"
LADY BIRD,2 January 2020,9/10,"My first Gerwig film, it was amazing. I loved it for its unabridged honesty. I felt as if the curtain was drawn the gloves were off and I glimpsed into the lives of a family and a girl approaching adulthood with the fierceness and audacity common to nearly all of us. It's rawness was an invitation and ultimately the mo live is beautiful because I felt something. Really lovely, really hard and tremendous performances from Ronan and Metcalf. Watching this beckons me to view anything Gerwig puts out."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2018,9/10,"LADY BIRD- 88%
There are only two teenage dramas that really made me feel something. The first one is ""the perks of being a wallflower"" and now I have another favorite called ""Lady Bird"". I was very upset that the movie ended as I just wanted to see how the life of Lady Bird unravels. 
Despite this movie being about a teenage girls experiences, there is a much deeper story between Lady Bird and her mother, which you cant always see but definitely feel. 
I have always loved Saoirse Ronan way back when she was just a kid playing ""Salmon"" in The lovely bones, and ""Hannah"". I personally find her to be a phenomenal actress. 
I was very impressed with Laurie Metcalf who made my heart melt in certain scenes. 
Despite all this positive feedback, I must say that ""Lady Bird"" is NOT for everyone. I can see how this movie could be labelled as ""boring"" by the audience.

LADY BIRD,17 February 2020,9/10,"Revisiting ""Miss Bird"", the biggest feeling is that everyone, regardless of nationality or gender, will do something that they thought was cool at the time, for example, Christina is also our 'Lady Bird. Give yourself a cool name. Like my own medal because it symbolizes my new life. Also like mine (Oscar Stark) This contains infinite reveries about future life, maybe it's just cool. Youth is always accompanied by troubles, as shown in the second half of the film, but there are also those old things that we have been accustomed to thinking about now, which are indispensable for ourselves, whether it is those old friends or places that have been sick Ever wanted to leave here countless times. But when you reach the age of eighteen, you have to leave the hometown alone for the first time, only to find that this is probably the most familiar place and a lot of people and things that are the hardest part to give up (maybe more than 100) I will feel more when I leave today.) When I finally came to the place where I had long been imagining whether I was satisfied or not, until now I can't handle the relationship with my parents. I even have difficulty understanding 'love'. Maybe I have been tired of this life that I am not satisfied with. But when I leave this 'little place', when I pass by again, I 've passed countless times since I was a child, watching everything around me i love you all you!"
LADY BIRD,25 November 2019,7/10,"A lot of guys like me won't feel connected to this movie. The relationships, the touchstone moments, the humor are not things I can relate to. Miguel and his girlfriend were tacked on. The main character was dull. There were a lot of jokes or attempts at quirkiness that fell flat. the ending was abrupt and unremarkable. However, there were aspects i liked. Marion struggled to communicate with Lady Bird and her letter was a nice corollary to that. She could never be real because she was afraid if she showed herself she would be judged critically. The nun telling Lady Bird that ""attention is love"" had meaning because her mother was always there, and that was a reflection or measure of how much she actually cared. ""The attention is love"" quote will stick with me. There's that moment when Lady Bird starts seeing her father as a person not just a warm smile and comforting hand holder. He's depressed. Marion tells Lady Bird she directly has been hurting her father by asking him to let her out of the car a block from the school. Lady Bird was genuinely struck with guilt. I laughed one time. When she passed her drivers test and said"" thank you."" Was told this isn't a""thank you moment"" and she replied with an self conscious ""yay"" I hated just about all the characters except the mom. Lady Bird was like most kids her age - selfish, awkward, undeservingly self important. A good movie that I didn't have much fun watching"
LADY BIRD,23 February 2020,8/10,"Teenage rebel, mother-daughter struggles, first love, first sex, friendship, dreams.....all that you can find in these movie.
And maybe you can find yourself here !
Enjoy and watch!"
LADY BIRD,29 September 2018,7/10,"This film is a blissful piece of nostalgic joy. 
I was nowhere near Sacramento in 2002, but whilst watching I genuinely felt as if I was there. The relationship between Ladybird and her mother is the underlying thread throughout and they pull off a believable dynamic that's fun to see. There are also a bunch of other sub stories that are beautifully woven in. I highly recommend if you want a nice relaxing film that is not too long and makes you smile at the end."
LADY BIRD,14 December 2017,6/10,"I have come around to appreciating why Sacramento-native Greta Gerwig considers Lady Bird a ""love letter"" to her city. It's the best thing I can say for it. The movie is bookended very satisfactorily with an opening scene that sets just the right tone and the protagonist's change of heart regarding her hometown of Sacramento. The in-between parts are where I found the protagonist disappointingly uninteresting and the messaging ham-handed as it related to her. It has been heralded as a highly intelligent coming-of-age story, but I can't help but disagree. Saoirse Ronan plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson by making believe that she isn't absolutely gorgeous. She also insists on going to an East Coast liberal arts school despite apparently being divested of such aptitudes. Although she understandably yearns to escape her Central Valley life and does undergo a character arc that I cannot in good conscience mock, her eyebrow-raising indulgences breathe a little life into a story mired by her uninspiring, self-centered mentality. Had she been more principled and dignified, vowing to reimburse her parents the cost of raising her could have been more than erratic foolishness, however ill-advised it would still have been. The same goes for her bail out from the car (my favorite scene, nonetheless). Christine's eccentricities and the mother-daughter relationship strain credulity a little, but not too much. She is for me a character to be endured, not enjoyed, and ditto for her mother, and while I am at it, her adopted brother. Christine's friendship with the comparatively charming Julie has a ring of contrivance given the former's character flaws. The conceited Jenna is authentically disagreeable. Christine's even-keeled father is a refreshing opposite to her melodramatic, despairing mother. The first boyfriend (played by Lucas Hedges of the brilliant Manchester by the Sea) is indeed tolerable compared to boyfriend number two, a moron with a lot of screen time. The third guy only had to be an upfront atheist for our rebellious Catholic Schoolgirl (if he had to be anything). She tells him, ""People go by the names their parents give them, but they don't believe in God."" A banal remark, if you ask me. And she makes my point for me by later dropping ""Lady Bird"" for her parents' answering machine. It surely can be argued that a movie shouldn't be too aware of when it takes place, but the predictable indications--Iraq War coverage (watched by teenagers, no less) and talk of cell phones being ubiquitous in the near future--are easily forgiven and on some level wanted. I liked the crying game and the football coach turned theater director scene. The parent-child open house outing is something I can relate to from my own childhood. Writing this review elevated my opinion of Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird somewhat. That is to say, my mind is less boggled by the critical acclaim. It ultimately deals with interesting aspects of life, just not as I would like it to, and the lovable deviant vibe simply hasn't come over me."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,9/10,"This film shows excellent directing, writing and acting."
LADY BIRD,16 November 2017,10/10,"I have seen at least three of her films. In every case she is outstanding. Unlike Brooklyn where she turned from a modest duck into a stunning swan, Ronan stays awkward while giving a seamless performance. As a parent with adult children, there isn't anything about this movie that seems ridiculous or contrived. All of the performances are top shelf. While mostly set in a Catholic HS, the RC faith, the religious orders, and the attitudes of the laity are never ridiculed nor caricatured. There is some salty language and a few strongly suggestive scenes. But I wouldn't hesitate to take a mature teen to see it."
LADY BIRD,15 August 2020,9/10,"This might be my favorite coming of age movie! It has some great dialog, some amazing editing and amazing acting!"
LADY BIRD,6 June 2020,10/10,"The thoughts and thoughts of adolescent girls are deeply felt in the film and feel the same. The use of color in the film is very colorful, and it also fits the theme that youth is colorful. Through a girl's youthful rebellious growth process, she showed her relationship with her mother, girlfriend, boyfriend, and teacher. Although she desperately rebelled against rebellion, it is difficult for everyone to escape from their growing environment and family. Until you realize it, you will eventually return to your homeland. A film worth feeling with your heart."
LADY BIRD,10 December 2017,9/10,"Storytelling at it's best,this one just Isn't just a Slice of life, but a whole loaf!! Oscar worthy story about lessons in parenting, teen choices, and coming of age. For me Laurie Metcalf as the stubborn Mom steals the show. At times you thought the movie was coming to an end to only find out the amazing ride wasn't quite finished. This was a beautiful ride you need to take yourself on, one that you won't want to end!"
LADY BIRD,26 December 2017,10/10,"We're introduced to a mother and her daughter, both loving, laughing and enjoying each others company then suddenly turns into an argument, full of stubbornness and Why-can't-you-accept-this sort of situation, and the daughter (Christine ""Lady Bird"") jumps out of the car while it's still moving in full speed. Watching this was like taking a trip down memory lane, nostalgic music, looks, atmosphere etc. I can't really put a finger on what it is I like so much about it. I just felt the whole film was so relatable, and it was almost like it was a film about my life by not really at the same time. It's about seeking the identity, finding out who you are, exploring and finding your own way. I guess this was why I liked it so much, I could really relate to the character of Christine ""Lady Bird"", her doing everything to both stand out and fit in at the same time, learning everything the hard way. And I just loved the scene when she turns 18 and goes to the store to get a pack of camel cigarettes and a play girl magazine, waiting for the guy working the cashier to ask for her ID. Been there done that. And another scene where she pass her driving test and thanking the instructor or water you call that guy. Hilarious and yet again relatable. Actually everything in this film was relatable.
Writing this review made me realise that what they captured so good in this move was LIFE, all the up and downs, and with that found I'm ending this because that's what the film really is about LIFE and why it was so damn good!"
LADY BIRD,26 January 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird is one of the best indie films I've seen in a long while, balancing the suburban Rushmore-esque charm of high school with pertinent social issues. Saoirse Ronan is a magnetic and hilarious protagonist, alongside great performances from Metcalf and Chalamet. The cinematography is delightfully creative, the plot is tight yet realistic, and I look forward to Gerwig's next effort."
LADY BIRD,12 June 2018,8/10,"No, this movie is not about Lady Bird Johnson as my parents both assumed. I could say that it's about a high school senior named Christine who insists on being called Lady Bird as she navigates life and her identity in Sacramento, but there's a lot more to it than that and plenty to discuss. Even though her parents can barely afford to, they keep Christine out of the public school where there was a stabbing so she can attend a private Catholic school. And there are so many interesting dynamics at play: the primary having to be the tough love approach from the mom that works double shifts as a nurse. The whole family is interesting, however, with the softie good guy father, and the care-free kinda goth older brother that maybe isn't living up to full potential. And as with any good coming-of-age film, Lady Bird meets and interacts with many characters, each providing a new spin to the midst. Basically, what I'll probably be repeating constantly will be about the fully realized, pretty authentic characters throughout. Let's start with some positives. Lady Bird's adorable best friend Julie is a joy. Yes, I know, she fills the comic relief side character, but she's someone that rewards an audience for sticking with her for the whole journey. And really, unlike a typical journey filled with plenty of pit stops, the characters here-including Julie-may drop out of the picture temporarily, but they remain relevant all the way through. Another example is Lucas Hedges who plays the first love interest of Lady Bird. This may be a cast of young actors, but having been in films like The Grand Budapest Hotel, Moonrise Kingdom, and recently Manchester by the Sea, Hedges is picking unbelievable scripts to work in and holding his own. And as much as I want to include a minor spoiler, all I'll say is that one reason the characters in Lady Bird feel developed and real is the ability from writer/director Greta Gerwig to understand that characters can be conflicted internally and externally without having to be marked as good or bad, protagonist or antagonist. This is certainly a charming film, and that's proven by the almost historic score it received from Rotten Tomatoes. The thing is that every film there is either fresh or rotten, so critics can enjoy a film and call it fresh without loving it. I feel like that applies to Lady Bird. From the opening with Christine and her mom talking in the car, to the moments in drama class rehearsing the play, to countless hangouts with differing friend groups, the dialogue feels real. The cast is sharp and confident, and the story never lulls. But after that, you can probably start nitpicking. Both the score and soundtrack are unremarkable-with the soundtrack even borderline basic-and the cinematography starts off strong in an almost Wes Anderson inspired way, but that reasonably drops off in the middle when the characters truly start taking over. I was surprised by the opening and one moment with Hedges, but the story is slightly predictable beyond that. What this all amounts to is nitpicks. You won't exit the theater with any glaring mistake in mind. What should stick out are the stronger moments. The mother-daughter relationship is exceptional. Lady Bird is whining one moment, then defending her mom to a friend the next. The mom is spending valuable time with Christine in one scene, then (and more typically) she's nagging about Christine's laziness immediately afterward. Although hardly expressed verbally, the love is constantly apparent. And the subtleness of all the emotions in the film is really one of the best parts. Instead of Lady Bird proclaiming to Julie, ""Wow, Julie, I really can't stand that Kyle guy!"" they may make a snarky joke to each other and laugh over cheese plates. Even the most exaggerated characters like Kyle brings the right amount of comedic tone during some more serious scenes. After all, Kyle will forever be ""hella tight"" guy to me. When I think of coming-of-age films, I immediately think of American Graffiti and Boyhood. I can't necessarily say that Lady Bird will come to mind. I absolutely enjoyed watching the film, but it doesn't have any element I would describe as spectacular enough for me think that I'll remember this film down the road. Again, if given time, I'm sure I'd recommend this film to someone, but there isn't really anything in there to jog my memory in an instant. But if you're looking for strong acting, authentic and relatable stories, and strong themes that are never presented in an in-your-face manner, then this is a solid film to see. And besides, how can you not enjoy Saoirse Ronan?

LADY BIRD,23 February 2018,7/10,"First of all, all compliments go to Saoirse Ronan, who plays a teenager self-named as Lady Bird. She is an excellent actress, capable of playing any role, I believe. The atmosphere of a small hometown that is impossible to stay in, is excellent too. Interestingly, as the story is developing, we can see that actually the Lady Bird's catholic school is not so bad (the teachers are strict but good-natured), the Lady Bird has her best friend, she is easily getting boyfriends, and easily even gets into the higher society, when she wants to. However, her life is still pressured by some heavy weight, some misery, and she wants to escape to the East Coast, and live a fancy life. Very early in the movie, it becomes obvious that what causes her misery is actually upcoming poverty of her family. Her father loses job, and it will mean tough and modest life for all of them. Naturally, Lady Bird decides to try everything to carry on with her dreams and aim high, apply to expensive schools, without much chances to get even accepted at the first plays. However, magically, everything is happening for her much better than she expects: she manages to get in the school in NY, her father is supporting her, there is even some fellowship they are managing to fetch, etc, etc. Still even at the very end, she is somehow not happy, she has no chance to look forward to it, the life continues to be melancholic, even in NY. Why is that?Well the answer is: mother. Most of the people writing reviews describe their relationship as loving one, although complicated. I would not say so. Mother is all the time terribly passive agressive, reminding her constantly that they have no money, even about smallest and stupidest thing like a 3 dollar magazine, and killing every moment of joy in Lady Bird. Mother is actually kind with her only in the moments when she sees her daughter losing something, or not succeeding in something. On contrary, any time she sees her daughter happy, enthusiastic or satisfied with something, she is putting her down, killing any chance of her daughter to think high of herself. From diminishing the dress in which she looks good, from punishing her for having any moment of happiness, and even getting accepted to a prestigious school. Mother somehow manages to ruin every big moment in the life of her daughter and make her feel guilty for that, constantly reminding her that she cannot enjoy herself: first kiss with a boy, graduation lunch with her family, turning 18th birthday, leaving house for colege, etc. Every time Lady Bird should feel happy, the mother reminds her how much she ""costs her mother"". She can take her daughter only if she accepts to live an average, dull, unhappy life, like she lived herself.I believe Greta Gerwig here opened up a big topic of the parenthood. Raising a child which is not really planned, a child that parents cannot really afford, and then, parents who spend their life reminding the child to which extent their life was ruined by that child, just by existing, and being a live creature. The only ""sin"" of Lady Bird is that she wants to live a life of an exceptional person, person who goes to an interesting school, because she feels herself as someone who belongs there. That is "" the exceptionalism"" that her mother cannot accept. She is trying to kill her daughter's spirit, and the fact that she is miserable herself is not abolishing her from the responsibility for it. The girl is managing to leave and fulfill her dreams, but she is still not fully happy, because her mother's killing hand is still reaching her, because it is deeply internalized in her, even on the other side of the country. Simply, mother is curing her own frustration for not being financially successful in life by putting the blame on her daughter's shoulder. Since she cannot manage her daughter's life by giving or not giving her money, she will make her always feel sorry for having any needs or plans in life. If the movie is understood in that way, I think its important and worth seeing. However, if somebody takes it as a moving story about complicated mother/daughter relationship, forget it. I have no understanding for this mother. There is no excuse for blaming your child's existence and growing up for your own poverty and failure in life."
LADY BIRD,5 May 2020,10/10,I fell in love with Ronan after watching the movie. She is a gifted actress
LADY BIRD,21 July 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird is surprisingly set in a post-9/11 Sacramento in 2002 , which is an un-usual but refreshing era for a modern coming-of-age story. While coming of age stories can often fall in to their charming but conventional trappings, Lady Bird shines in that it doesn't shy away from showing the faults of the characters it follows throughout its run time, almost to the point that you want to see even more of their journeys through life.Lady Bird has excellent cinematography and believable characters with identifiable flaws and traits that really ground the movie. Lady Bird takes influence from the 'mumblecore' sub genre (a drama with emphasis on natural dialogue and personal character relationships over plot) and ties it nicely with a coming of age structure that doesn't over stay its welcome and definitely takes its own path you can relate to as a viewer. Saoirse Ronan is particularly charming as our main character and bounces well with Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts filling in as her parents. The movie addresses a few subjects that aren't touched upon in most conventional coming of age movies, which gives the film a mature feeling. Particularly the 15 certificate in the UK meant the film didn't have to pander towards a younger audience, which is exactly want you want as a viewer of this genre because teenagers swear, talk about sex and abuse alcohol/drugs.Some viewers may find its general pacing, structure and tone to be not particularly entertaining and up beat as many other coming of age movies but I found it enjoyable, funny and grounded. The soundtrack also wasn't particularly that memorable but does include some nods towards that era and adds some licensed tracks that some may appreciate. A decent coming of age movie that shakes genre conventions but nothing particularly groundbreaking."
LADY BIRD,20 May 2019,9/10,"I rarely give 9's on here. Movies I love have an 8, eh movies get a 7 or 6, terrible are 5 and below, but that's just me. I never give 10's because nothing is perfect, but 9's are the special ones. The movies I give a 9 to mean they are one of my favorite movies. This is my favorite coming of age film. It's hilarious, it made me ball my eyes out and it's very relatable as a teen. A must see, period!"

LADY BIRD,27 October 2017,7/10,"Lady bird is a movie about a young woman and her struggling mother. Saoirse Ronan has done the central role of the movie. She is very free flowing actress and has transformed herself in the character of a teenage girl having full of dreams , fluency and lot of life. Her activities and reactions everything has made the movie a good comedy drama. Director Greta Gerwig has directed the movie very well.Those who likes to see comedy drama will enjoy it. It has no hard actions but it is full of small emotional fights of mind. Good to see this type of movie in this high action packed era of films."
LADY BIRD,9 February 2020,10/10,"Finally watched this recently - wow what an amazing and moving film. Really resonated with me somehow. It grows and develops and not much happens but something about the growth of the character, the relationship she has with her family and how she copes with growing up and changes in where she lives just came together into something really moving. Not everything is spelled out - it evokes a feeling. One of the great films without really trying to be..."
LADY BIRD,10 November 2017,9/10,"Portraying a likable rebel is a hard thing to do on screen. You would have to set up why they are the way they are, and still be able to give them fleeting moments of empathy or just go all the way with no regrets. Lady Bird takes a stab at finding the balance from first time director Greta Gerwig in a relatively conservative scenery but does a lot to make her stand out in this hilarious coming of age story.Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) is Catherine McPherson's given alias when she becomes bored living her familiar life while in a Catholic High School in Sacramento. Her new persona makes her become more wandering and naturally gravitating to many different things around her like boys, new female friends and the dream of finding more like herself in a east coast college away from home.Saoirse Ronan does a great job as a rebellious yet empathetic teenager as her angst does feel like it comes from a genuine place. What I've always had issues in the past from coming of age films is they make the teenagers problems feel self inflicted, but instead her character is coming more from a place of needing to explore more in life. The director also gives a lot of great snappy dialogue with all the characters and having some truly hilarious moments (there's a scene where the kids are slow dancing to Bone Thugs n Harmony's The Crossroads that has me screaming).As for faults, there aren't too many, but are more so nitpicks within this films wings. While the film has a great first and third act, the second act has a couple of dragging moments. It's not often or super noticeable, but some of the films strongest points are around the outer shell.Lady Bird doesn't reinvent the wheel of coming of age stories, however it does move with a lot of charm. Saoirse is great in he lead role, a really strong script and has you on a ride with a character learning from their mistakes and understanding how their actions affect others. Rating: 9.3 / 10"
LADY BIRD,17 January 2018,8/10,"Honestly, ""Lady Bird"" caught my eye months before it even came out. As a fan of smaller, 'slice-of-life' indie films, this seemed to have just the right amount of quirkiness...and I have to say, I wasn't let down. Christine, AKA Lady Bird is a prolific 'half-outsider' living in Sacramento and (presumably) forced to go to Catholic school. That's really it - the movie tracks her life, her circle of friends, and simply her day-to-day thoughts and activities. Yes, she can be perceived as self-absorbed, but lovely Saoirse Ronan plays her with a sense of genuineness that is just impossible not to like. Lady Bird may be pricklier than other teen protagonists but she's real, and Ronan carries the film, alongside a wonderful performance from Laurie Metcalf who plays her mother. I did go into this movie expecting the understated, though certain scenes did strike me as 'too' understated. I also thought that Lady Bird's love interest storylines were a bit unrealistic, (ie: moving too fast) but all in all, it's fiction, and for what it's worth...it really had me feeling that movie magic. I don't think there's any higher praise than that.  Bravo, Lady Bird!"
LADY BIRD,15 March 2018,8/10,"TL;DRWriter-director Greta Gerwig impresses with directorial debutRefreshingly original and uniqueWitty, funny script with enjoyable subplots and lots of laughsGreat strong characters with career-best performancesLaurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan are fantastic, individually and together------------------------------------------------------On the face of it, Lady Bird is nothing new; we've seen coming-of-age/self-discovery teen films countless times before. Sometime's they're great, sometimes they're god awful. Somehow though Lady Bird manages to buck this trend and stand out as being refreshingly original and not quite like your average coming-of-age/self-discovery teen film - especially impressive for a directorial debut!It could be very easy for a story charting a year in the life of a narcissistic teenager to be annoying, childish or perhaps even patronising. Lady Bird is none of those, but rather as charming as its protagonist, mature and even understanding. While the main plot of the story is Lady Bird's determination to make it to East Coast colleges, there are so many subplots that emerge in her life that are a joy to be distracted by. We can all identify with these milestones, from first love to falling out with a friend, but these milestones are enjoyable to revisit with a character like Lady Bird and with such witty, quick writing that really captivates the voice of a frustrated teenager. Much of this is down to the excellent script by writer-director Greta Gerwig, in which strong characters are created and from which a plethora of funny, quotable lines come, making you question if it's more a drama or comedy. Gerwig also emphasises an interesting sense of nostalgia, setting the story in the recent past (2002). Not so far gone as to require frequent nods to the culture of the period, instead we feel as if we're transported back in time in a more subtle way, feeling younger just being able to see those beefy computer monitors.The film certainly belongs to its star, but Ronan isn't the only decent cast member. The supporting cast is great, from boyfriends to best friends, each is different and not just a cliched depiction of teenage archetypes, but rather come across as genuine. The real stars of the show though are Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan, with the relationship between their characters being the real crux of the whole film. Metcalf is probably best known as Sheldon's ultra-religious Texan mother in The Big Bang Theory, but that's likely to be overshadowed now. Really showing us what she can do, she may still play a mother with a strong personality, but instead Lady Bird allows Metcalf to give a more nuanced, understated performance, making her a much more realistic, complicated character with whom audiences can instantly engage and form various opinions. Saoirse Ronan has been around for ages, first breaking through as Briony in Atonement way back in 2007 at just 13 years old. She's been in lots since, impressing time and again, particularly in Brooklyn. It's as Lady Bird though that we really see Ronan at her best. Were those lines to be spoken by someone else, Christine could be a thoroughly unlikable character and the film might not have worked. Instead, with Christine played by Ronan, she's well-developed, delightfully complex and consistently likeable, despite her penchant for being frequently narcissistic and frustrating. She's a teenage character we can't help but love and enjoy discovering who she is at the same time she does, sharing in both joy and heartbreak from stat to finish.Sadly Lady Bird may not have won any Academy Awards, but it certainly deserved each of the five nominations. With a witty, funny script, Gerwig delivers on an impressive directorial debut with excellent performances from Metcalf and Ronan. A hilarious and touching coming-of-age film, ripe with nostalgia, laughs, self-discovery and great characters, Lady Bird flies high."
LADY BIRD,11 December 2019,8/10,"A good slice of life film, despite a few clichés here and there. The film kinda do these sorta characters oversimplification, which almost made it a mix of what Wes Anderson usually do in his movies. A simple story of a teen with raging hormones and rebellious attitude, something that we've all been there."

LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,6/10,"I thought this movie was promising, premise wise. It was refreshing in the sense that it didn't feel like your average Hollywood Blockbuster; it felt more or less like an Indie movie that is being streamed online or shown in smaller movie theaters. Which is charming actually, the cinematography is beautiful I loved it. To me this movie overdelivered on some points, and undelivered in others. Like I said I liked the directing style, I liked how unconventional the characters looked. Mostly in Hollywood films; teenagers are being physically portrayed as beauty pageant contestants or extremely good looking cheer leaders etc.. but over here they looked more realistic and believable as teenagers. I loved the way this movie represented the family unit, in that it wasn't too good to be true but wasn't too unreal either. Millions of Americans probably grew up in such families which seems more relatable to the viewer. I'm afraid that's where the good things end, and now I have to focus on the ways in which this film fell short for me at least. The plot was very cliche, it was the same in every other coming of age movie. Teen wants independent, teen fights with parents to gain her independence, parents resist teen's independence and then teen starts rebelling out of frustration and so on.. The plot was quite the cookie-cutter. It was predictable and we have seen it many times. The only difference is the setting & the characters really. I felt like the idea of the family going through ""financial difficulties"" was just thrown in for good measures. Christine ""LadyBird"" is still able to afford going to a private catholic school instead of a cheaper public one. I kinda wished they threw that out of the plot all together, it didn't seem to actually affect the plot in anyway other than dramatic effect. So yeah, overall not a bad film but I feel like it lacked on originality and it wasn't as ""deep"" as I had hoped it would be."
LADY BIRD,21 January 2018,4/10,"Saw this film in Sac at the Tower Theater. The hook for this film was twofold: 1) an opportunity to see Sac on the big screen, and 2) an opportunity to see Laurie Metcalf in a great performance.The film did not disappoint on either--it was very kewl to Sac sites on the big screen and it was fun to be the only one to laugh in the theater when the main character quibbed that Sac was the Midwest of California--SO TRUE!!! I said the exact same thing within days of moving here from the bay area.Also, Laurie Metcalf was great in the film. She is a gem so under utilized in hollow wood. 10 stars to her in this film--spot on all the way.So that was the good. The bad was rather simple---TMI. This film is in definite need of a good editor. Much too long and much of the content is the extraneous blow by blow recounting of the main character's senior year in high school. We see EVERYTHING--from thanksgiving, christmas, prom, drama club, math class, drivers ed, virginity maintained, virginity lost, the whole shebang blow by blow. If the strained relationship between the mother and daughter in this film was the main plot, it gets lost in the weeds of mundane day to day teen angst. Maybe I am too old to find such triviality interesting or deep. And its not something one can ignore because this movie tries really hard to make white american teen angst seem deep from the opening credits to the closing credits.Which brings us to the finale of the film, where we see a resolution in the main character on her perspective of her hometown and mother. It occurs within a few days after getting exactly what she wants and experiencing alcohol poisoning. If that scenario had some deep insight intertwined, I missed it.Some questions arise from the excessive details in the film--why was the film set in 2002? This seems just one of many pointless yet specific details in the film (a film that is adamantly claimed not to be autobiographical by the writer/director). Beyond being able to have the iraq war news playing in the background and attributing the father's joblessness and depression to an IT slump that coincided (but did it really--I don't recall that sector being significantly impacted in particular after 911), it seems a weird pointless detail in the film.Another pointless detail--Why did we see the drama coach's visit to the psych hospital? Adds more questions than answers to his ease with winning the crying exercise. It doesn't add to the Laurie character, as we already have seen her empathetic qualities at work with the gift to the coworker and banter with store clerks about baby pictures. And the Saoirse character NEVER would have known about this turn of events due to patient confidentiality. So...point?Yet another pointless detail---BFF (classic caricature) crush on the math teacher meeting his pregnant wife. Are we to think she believed she had a shot with this guy or something?There is so much in this film that could have been cut and left room for more detail to explore the tense relationship between the mother and daughter in this film. An opportunity lost.The film teases at being something that could have been great--like another Terms of Endearment. But it fails miserably. Also, if this film is to be held up as an example of the contribution of female film screenwriters and directors to the industry, then we need to keep looking. This is nothing more than navelgazing passed off as deep introspection. Three word review: Wait for Netflix."
LADY BIRD,2 September 2018,6/10,"If this genre interests you, watch Welcome to the Dollhouse, Napoleon Dynamite, Ghost World, Eighth Grade, or The House of Tomorrow instead. They are much more creative. This one is just purely derivative pseudo intellectualism."
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,8/10,"In Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig again gives us characters over plot. The plot jumps around, but the interaction among characters grows. There's deception and sweetness, weakness and strength, bouncing around just as in real life. The characters strike me as real people with one exception -- the one-dimensional Marion, Lady Bird's mom. OK, we know that she's overly critical because she wants the best for her daughter, but that's carried out bluntly, with no variation, and as a result becomes trite and unconvincing."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2021,1/10,"Once I decided to start reviewing movies, there were a few that I hated so much that I decided to put myself through the agony of watching again just to remind myself how much I hated them in the first place. This is definitely one of those movies. Interesting though, I have to say it's not so much hatred I felt the second time around as pure ambivalence. That's hardly a step up but it does make reviewing it a little harder. Maybe it ends up being a combo.Is Lady Bird still a self-entitled, self-absorbed little brat? Sure, but do I really care anymore? Not so much. I mean, I can't believe how episodic this movie is with such poorly developed characters, just a bunch of boring after school special scenes strung together. Usually a character study, but any movie really, should give you some sense of who the people are, not just in the present but who they were before and who they are on their way to becoming. I get none of that in this movie, as there is no chemistry between any of the characters, it's like they all got dropped in together the first day and got told, ok, this is how you're related, now go. The brother and sister feel like they're just there to say their lines, I mean, literally, they just stand there and say whatever, there's no other sense of who they are or that they have any type of existence in real life. Same with the father, yeah, he' supportive, I get it, it's like that was the entire description of his character, he supposedly loses his job, supposedly is depressed, but damned if I could tell the difference. Even the mother, and I like Laurie Metcalf, I always have, but her character is so one note, yes, disapproving mother, even her talent can't save it.Which of course leaves Lady Bird who while still annoying, now just don't care. As I said, the movie is so episodic, that maybe that's how it deserves to be reviewed. For instance I remember being angry when she destroyed the grade book, but now it's just one more scene where she acts like a self involved witch, oh well. She calls the sister a certain word, but I'm pretty sure the word applies to her. Goes to a dance, with what I assume had a western theme, goes to dinner at a fancy house, smokes some stuff, giggles, dates one guy, dates another guy, has bad sex with that guy, does a bad play, doesn't do another bad play, hangs out at a restaurant, works at a restaurant, goes grocery shopping with her mom, has a fight with her mom, goes shopping for a dress with her mom, has a fight with her mom, only they find a nice dress so they don't fight, goes shopping for a prom dress with her mom, has a fight with her mom because her mom doesn't like her dress, or her, or something, oh, isn't that just how life is? Suck it. Lies about where she lives and gets caught and learns a valuable lesson, just like that time on Three's Company when Jack lied about being rich, remember that one? One second she's friends with the fat girl, and she hates the popular girl, then she's friends with the popular girl and not with the fat girl and then she's not friends with the popular girl and she's friends with the fat girl again so she can learn an important lesson about friendship and everyone can cry. Guess what, I don't care who she's friends with.Still, there are a couple scenes that stand out. One is when she tells her mom to write down a number of how much she owes so she can pay her back. Yeah, that one I did react the second time around, as in I would have grabbed her by the neck and thrown her punk ass out the door and told her you owe me a million dollars and don't come back until you got it.Another is the scene with her first boyfriend where she promises not to tell his big secret, an ode to wokefulness if there ever was one. I won't say what the secret was because I know what I might get labelled even talking about this, but the fact is the only reason she keeps the secret is to show how woke, not her, but this movie must be. Oh, of course she would never tell the secret, just because he lied and humiliated her, of course not, because that would have been the one unforgivable act of the wokey woke people. Anything else fair game, lie, steal, cheat, sellout her best friend, but as of for the secret, oh no, she would forgive him in an instant so everyone can bask in the glow of woke.Speaking of the great god of woke, funny how she says that her brother got preferential treatment because of his name. Interesting what his name was and what his race was. Not that I care either way, but I wonder what the reaction would be if a slightly different name or more specifically race had been chosen. Now I won't say what other race might have been chosen because I'm sure all racism is bad, but if she had implied it about another race in particular, I wonder if this movie would have gotten such rave reviews. After all, the woke are nothing if not a bunch of lying, self serving pieces of garbage. Too bad if they would have to demand that this movie be cancelled and Lady Bird get strung up for even suggesting such a racist thing. Good thing his name was what it was I guess.Finally the ending, gets on a plane, mommy suddenly feels bad, too late though, she's off to college, reads a letter, gets drunk, pukes, and then says luv you, thanks. Just more scenes. Parting is sweet sorrow, yet I felt nothing about her leaving, absolutely nothing, again even Laurie Metcalf's brilliance couldn't sell it. And do I find it believable that a week in suddenly Lady is full of gratitude? Not a chance, maybe ten years later with a spoiled brat of her own, and even then, barely. As I said, part of a story is where you think the character is headed in the future. In the case of Lady Bird, don't have a clue, and more importantly don't give a damn. As the saying goes, you can take the girl out of Sacramento, but in her case, I'm sure she'll make everyone else miserable wherever she is."
LADY BIRD,10 November 2018,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" is an almost-basic coming of age story set in 2002, about a girl moving through her last year of high school and on to college. It hits all the standard coming of age elements, but the filmmakers zoom in on ordinary details of teen life, and then add tiny bits of dialogue that turn the film into something really special. That's not to detract from the underlying story of a mother-daughter conflict, which is engaging all by itself, but Lady Bird becomes special because the filmmakers lovingly teased that specialness out of the ordinary. I usually enjoy coming of age stories, but there aren't many good ones about girls. Lady Bird fills that void really well."
LADY BIRD,15 June 2020,7/10,"The best film of the same type in recent years, Ronan contributed the best acting in his career. The script is very clever, there is no over-unfolding story that should not be unfolded, and the points you want to cover are just right. In the place where I thought I was going to end, there was another story of more than ten minutes. Some people may feel redundant, and some people may feel the finishing touch"
LADY BIRD,30 August 2018,7/10,"A great coming of age dramedy full of character, characters, energy and laughs. Lady Bird has a nearly flawless opening and holds strong for a good portion of the film. However it starts to show cracks when it lands in its cliched middle portion. In the end it gains back some of its steam but the cliched, dragged out portion with the ""cool kids"" is honestly a let down and hurt what otherwise is a fantastic look at a strained mother-daughter relationship.Personal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 7/10
Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 8/10"
LADY BIRD,10 June 2020,9/10,I love Greta Gehrig and think she's wonderfully talented. She's our homegirl as well. That shot of our Tower Bridge in Sacramento was stunning. This was such a great movie - I loved everything about it!
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,10/10,"Truly Greta Gerwig's directorial debut was so topnotch that justifies a proof that female directors had the capabilities of what male directors can accomplished. With an excellent writing and directing as well a wonderful performances of the ensemble cast but most importantly the highlighted performances of Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf, it truly brings a wonderful charm, heart and sensibilities of a great storytelling and even blends in comedy, drama and romance.In addition, Lady Bird is also a film fit for every family facing of the life's struggles and the harsh open reality, an inspiring film for teenagers and young adults as well a great feminist film. This is definitely an inspiring masterpiece of all the ages."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,2/10,"Gerwig tries so hard to appear not to be trying. She polishes and polishes to get that unpolished, unvarnished look. This is the heart of literary mumblecore, Gerwig's roots, her core identity. Quirky, high-school outsider is, by now, a well worn cliché, no different here. Despite pseudohip trappings, sentimental treacle is still sentimental treacle: Character loses her way, kisses up to the rich, popular kids, only to return to her chubby, frumpy real friend. Final revelation of how much she loves Sacramento and her irritating mother is a pat ending, replete with a swelling church choir. Gerwig's schtick is to serve up the same old hash and make it seem new, even hip. But it's the same old hash, safe and bankable. As with her mentor, Baumbach, a blur of words disguises tiny, barely funny, nervous jokes. And this movie wears ideology like a straight jacket: Every note of identity politics is unerringly hit. (PS. ""Lady Bird"" was LBJ's wife's nickname, a mere coincidence.)"
LADY BIRD,18 February 2018,8/10,A disarmingly honest coming-of-age film about a young girl's fraught relationship with her mother. A must-watch film about those troubled teenage years... of angst and disappointment and expectations gone awry. I could see myself in a lot of the characters.
LADY BIRD,7 March 2018,8/10,"So, I cried throughout the second half of this film and I'm not even sure why.I mean, I kinda know why: in Lady Bird I could see myself as a teenager, being equally confused, miserable, enthusiastic, ambitious, scared, angry, angsty, all at the same time...wanting to pick a fight with my mum every other second and run to her for a hug right afterwards. It's all very common and very natural, so the success of this film doesn't come from its story, it comes from the way in which it is told.Everything in this film feels so real and it hits all the right notes. The creative choice was ""make it natural"" and that's what they did: the dialogue, the acting, the photography is all spot-on and flawlessly contributes to the overall vision.The title of my review is a reference to Linklater's film ""Boyhood"", another recent coming-of-age story with very similar goals and similar aspirations of realism. Although not comparable in terms of scope and ambition (Lady Bird didn't quite take 12 years to shoot nor did it aim to cover such a long period in the story, merely covering a year's worth of events in the protagonist's life) I think this film is a worthy and probably superior counterpart to ""Boyhood""."
LADY BIRD,30 April 2020,7/10,"This is a well done coming-of-age movie. It doesn't bring much new to the genre, but the acting is fine. I'd probably add another star if I was from Sacramento, a city that looms over the story and helps give it some weight regarding the feeling of being stuck in the town you grew up in. I'm older now and I wonder if I would have found more depth of feeling for this film had I seen it when I was in my twenties. Special mention should be made of Greta Gerwig's writing and directing. She acquits herself well. I long for the day when I won't even have to say that we need more women writing and directing films in America and elsewhere."
LADY BIRD,1 February 2020,10/10,"It is an absolute joy to watch Greta's work, her movies are full of life and It is really hard not to connect with the characters. The writting is great, specially the conversations between the girl and her parents.Having said that, I feel like she gave a step forward with her next movie, with a more complex structure and personality in the directing."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2020,6/10,"Spoilers PresentI found this movie to be so incredibly sad...every choice this one makes is not a wonderful one. For all her wishes for more, she just becomes more and more mundane and average...which is sadly so very common in true life. Then her family circumstances: Again, this is a very sad movie.The disappointment I feel is not only for the character and her choices/outcomes but also: I do not understand the hype. At all. Now, I am NOT trashing the movie. I enjoyed it so much so that I genuinely care about the people in it, and am almost hoping for a sequel to see if things get better.Sometimes, I am in the mood for a happy ending and thought (because of the hype and comedic clips in trailers) this might be a good flick to watch for that elixir. Nope. Poor kid is ""just another"" sad and pathetic creature."
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,9/10,"This movie this one movie was a movie that I was so hyped for, literraly wanted to see it since the start of December, a week ago it drops in my local theater, I was so hyped and was looking so forward to the movie, that my hype kind of killed the movie for me..... it wasn't as good as I thougt it would be. Okay yet I still rated it 9/10 which is a really big note. So why did I rate it 9/10? Why, well because the movie itslef is beautiful, cute, real, funny and tells an interesting somehow awesome story of a girl going through adulthood. The cast is amazing, mostly the two leading Saoirse Ronan as Lady Bird and Laurie Metcaf as Marion McPherson. First Saoirse plays with just such heart, she is incredible, loved, adored, I adored her performances, she is a perfect casting and as how badly I thougt and wanted the best actress Oscar to be in Frances McDormand for Billboards or Margot Robbie in I,Tonya to win that Oscar, I have to say that the best actress, who delivered the best performance of the year, was indeed Saoirse Ronan. Laurie Metcaf in the other way played a hard role, which needed a really good prestation, and Metcaf delivered that good prestation she was really good. The story, Lady Bird story is mostly a story that we pretty much see a lot, a young girl going to highschool who as to deal with all her highschool problems and what she is going to do in the future, it's a concept we see a lot these days, yet Lady Bird was somehow original in the end, it was a trully fun and beautiful story with strong characters and great direction ! Which comes to my point about why I thougt this movie was not as good as I imagined it to be. Main problem is the runtime, 1h 34min really? It's not long enough, I wanted more I was attached to the movie itself, yet it was too short so I could of not fully live the experience I wanted to live with Lady Bird. The runtime, makes the ending bad too, since it's predictable, it's not much of an end, we were waiting for it, but it arrived and boom the credits were scrooling. So yeah the trailer really tells a lot about the story, a little bit too much and makes you too much into it, and you should not be too hyped because the results is exaclty what is in the trailer yet not much more. It's not suprising, the trailer told too much and the hyped kind of kills this masterpiece. Still it's a great piece of film, it's hilarious and should be seen without being to hyped about it, since in my opinion kind of killed my enjoyment !"
LADY BIRD,14 July 2020,7/10,"A ""coming of age"" story about a quirky teenage girl within a dysfunctional family suffering from financial issues. There were many scenes I greatly enjoyed, particularly in the beginning and end of the film. For me, the middle part of the film seemed a bit aimless, mostly composed of seemingly random antics from the main character. Writing this review now, I wonder if this was the intention of the writer / director to demonstrate the unpredictability and lack of clarity that is often present in adolescence. For me, however, this didn't help in creating a cohesive film that I enjoyed watching from beginning to end as much as I would have wanted. Having said that, the actors playing the main character, Lady Bird, as well as her mother and father do an incredible job and were great to watch."
LADY BIRD,10 September 2021,5/10,"Cinematography is good, cast is good, actings are good, but there's literally nothing special. In fact, the story is soooooo dull, the ending is empty and meaningless. Such a 10/5 movie."
LADY BIRD,10 January 2018,3/10,"I watched this movie because of all the fuss that was being made on Youtube reviews and word of mouth. I had a problem with a 23 year old woman playing a 17 year old high school student. I have enjoyed her work in some of her other movies, Hanna, The Host, and Byzantium. I guess knowing her work and how old she is, didn't allow me to accept her as a 17 year old high school student. The story was very basic about a teenage girl and her mother not getting along, which seems normal enough. These two just seemed to do everything wrong. Despite all that she did wrong, somehow she still ended up in a New York college. I think you should watch it and form your own opinion. I was barely able to get through it. I was watching it in my living room, so I couldn't walk out on it. I was able to make dinner and hit the restroom a couple of times without hitting the pause button."
LADY BIRD,10 December 2017,9/10,"Great, engaging story, but the mother is such an overcritical stereotype that she is not credible as a character, and everyone's tolerance of her is not credible either. In normal life, someone would kill that bi-ch. Still Saorise Ronan is plugging again for her second Oscar, and could get it here. I can see her winning two or three in her lifetime.I felt connected to the movie, but not enveloped by it as I expected after seeing its unanimous rating as excellent. Somehow, I think its not headed for best picture.But, it certainly doesn't have to be. It's probably the best picture I've seen so far in this lackluster Christmas season (Dec 9, 2017.) I'm still looking for one that ""makes my year."""
LADY BIRD,26 February 2018,8/10,"Story: the story focus on the relationship between a mother and a daughter who both have different look to life , and a strong characters which lead them to a lot of arguments.Although the story isn't new and a lot of films brought this subject to the big screen , this movie maybe the first one who brought it in a very new and attractive way : mixing dram with religious beliefs and covering both of them with comedy, which brings a unique outcome that u can't stop watching and learning from it.
Saoirse Ronan who plays the leading role amazed me by her brilliant performance which was mixed of drama, comedy (she really was on fire almost in every scene). She gave us a totally different character than her previous two times Oscar nominations, which I both enjoyed but not like this one because it was really a magical one, and a lot of people will remember Saoirse Ronan in this movie like people still remembering Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall. (Lady Bird) character will be an Iconic character in the movie history.Laurie Metcalf who played the mother role which was for me also a leading role ( although they gave her a supporting nomination) was also amazing, she plays a mom with a strong character because she was forced to be like that, Lady Bird's father is the sweets guy of the house but sweetness isn't enough to built a house so, the mom had to take care of everything in order to save the house.There were three essential scenes that both the mother and the daughter gave us an Oscar performance that no one should miss.
In general both of the two leading characters have rights and wrongs, each one of them have her point of view and a lot of this come most of the time due to the gap between there generation, it's really the story of each one of us with his parents and eventually will be with his children.Final rate :8.5 out of 10"
LADY BIRD,16 March 2019,5/10,"More anti Catholic drivel.
""Don't become a republican "" ?
Not engaging. But Ronan as usual is good Understated."
LADY BIRD,8 August 2019,9/10,"I didn't initially have an interest in seeing this film (I don't think the trailers I saw represented it well) and ten minutes in I wasn't sure I was going to like it, but I can't resist a coming-of-age tale and this one woke up a lot of feelings inside me. I'm sure a lot of us can bond on a similar teenage experience and the fact that it took place in the mid-2000s in America brought on a lot of nostalgia, but I also connected to a lot of stories that I didn't directly relate to through brilliant storytelling.
A truly beautiful film."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,1/10,"Some people might feel that they relate to a character in this film, and that can be fun. I respect that. I don't think I was in the demographic for this, as I like a plot in my movie. This was more a character-study/coming of age film. To be the highest rated movie in the history of Rotten Tomatoes, I thought we'd be seeing a top 10 movie on the likes of the Godfather with that kind of word of mouth. Instead what we have is a TVMA version of something you'd see on the WB. It was just....it was nothing. There was nothing to it."
LADY BIRD,20 February 2021,2/10,"A well-acted movie is ruined by the selfish ""Lady Bird"" main character. She does not appreciate or respect anyone or anything."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2018,9/10,"Everything seems so cliche but flows so naturally and profoundly. Character development, sisters and brothers, moms and dads, friends and lovers.. This movie sucks you into a well forgotten past, full of memories of youth. Story very well told, mission accomplished."
LADY BIRD,8 April 2018,9/10,"""Lady Bird"" (Saoirse Ronan), real name Christine, argues with her mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) about applying to out-of-state colleges. Once the altercation dwindles, Lady Bird jumps out of car and breaks her arm. This catalyst begins an important transformation from adolescence into maturation.Extremely relatable, this film rewards its' audience with honest observations about life and I couldn't help but reminisce. From minor to necessary (such as friendship, sex, and popularity), the material allows me to connect with the story and root for the character to change. Ronan's performance rings true, Metcalf is genuine, Lady Bird's father (Tracy Letts) and Beanie Feldstein as Julie provide great supporting talent. In fact, every character provides a necessary role. Everyone involved, especially Greta Gerwig, deserves to take a bow.For the entire movie, Lady Bird is mostly impulsive, narcissistic, and demands constant approval from her parents. Her change is methodical and slow making the progression sporadically bitter. But this independent gem takes its time to flesh out Lady Bird's personae, and makes bold decisions that leave a lasting impression."
LADY BIRD,16 April 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird (2017) is directed by Greta Gerwig and stars Saorise Ronan, Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts in Sacramento, 2002 as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson runs through the trials and tribulations of a high school student in her senior year.The shining moments from Lady Bird have to come from the compelling dynamic and chemistry between Lady Bird (Saorise Ronan) and her mother Mario McPherson (Laurie Metcalf). The fashion in which they play off each other in different sort of emotional scenarios makes the film incredibly relatable and paints with a broad enough brush that a large audience will be able to see bits of themselves in Lady Bird while still remaining an immensely personal story.All of the scenes are wonderfully acted and do an outstanding job extracting whichever emotions it pleases from the audience, whether it's laughing with the characters or tearing up because of a conflict taking place. Another thing this film does remarkably well is make Sacramento, a city which is foreign to a large amount of the audience, feel like the town or city in which we grew up in. There is a strong familiarity with the setting that I was caught off guard by, given that the film takes place in California which I am not from. If there was a complaint I can muster from this great film, it would be that there is just a scene or two towards the end which start making the story drag on a bit. Other than that however, I strongly recommend this one."
LADY BIRD,5 February 2020,8/10,"Honestly a nice movie, but some things don't add up, it just abruptly stops. Like Kyle (Horrible name but not the point), what happens to him, Danny, is he gay? do they remain friends? The theatre teacher. The crush from Julie, the teacher, they added a bit too much detail and didn't have the time to work everything out, plus it would be super boring, to address all of them. Timothée was fenomial obviously. Saoirse Ronan did a fine job. And omg the mom, Marion, what a [...], sometimes she did have a point but most of the time i just want to slap her in the face. But overall, really well made movie, really gives me 70/80/90 vibes (because i never know the difference) the shots are really beautiful and the slight grain filter on the entire movie really gives it an amazing finish. Amen!"
LADY BIRD,27 January 2018,3/10,"Absolutely disappointed with this film.
Ridiculous dialogues, absurd characters that are only stuffed in the history.
In fact, all the characters are unfriendly and we never connect with them. 
Mad and dumb mothers, silly daughters with artistic pretensions that we never got to know...
Cheap sexism on the script of her director, which only includes men who are weepy, shallow, who use women for his sexual pleasure, or are depressed.and do not contribute anything to the story. (What's wrong with the father? And with the gay boyfriend?)The soundtrack appears and disappears, the plot advances in fits and starts and the pretensions of her director bore when half an hour has passed, and they sadly feel like two.
This movie would have been gold in the hands of Jim Jarmusch, Jason Reitman or Denis Villeneuve...
incomprehensible his presence at the Oscars."
LADY BIRD,18 December 2018,9/10,"I loved it!!!!! One of my faves too ahahha
Kdkxmskzk"
LADY BIRD,19 June 2020,8/10,"I am not sure of this movie is filled with messages or no message at all with a story just flowing by. Because I feel both at a time (although it's contradictory). Well, those who aren't happy about Christmas in Sacramento, haven't spent their days in Bangladesh, for sure. Anyway, the movie, left me with some thoughts I am still confused about. The ending didn't feel like it's an appropriate one, there could have been more. But all that's shown, is a glimpse into the mental struggle of teenagers, whether it's Sacramento, or San Francisco, you'd be missing something until you figure the greater thing lying by and to consume it."
LADY BIRD,18 September 2018,10/10,I really enjoyed this movie! It's definitely a coming of age movie. Quite refreshing and hilarious. Reminds me a little of my mom and me a bit too growing up. Totally recommend any mother and daughter to watch.
LADY BIRD,15 January 2020,5/10,I thought this was a good film with nothing special about it to generate all of the Oscar buzz. The acting was good with nothing special to generate Oscar nominations. The film Wonder Woman and its director Patty Jenkins deserved Oscar nominations as well as The Beguiled directed by Sophia Coppola. Of course the Academy always screws up and Greta Gerwig should have been nominated for Little Women.
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,10/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a great coming-of-age story that we're gonna be talking about for a very long time.Whatever weak points that may have occurred through a couple of minor actors, are deeply overshadowed by the majority of the main cast and the great plot.""Lady Bird"" is primarily about Christine McPhearson, a girl that insists on everbody calling her ""Lady Bird."" (Hence the title).But the film is almost just as much about Lady Bird's mother, as it is about her. Their relationship is the quintessential mother-daughter relationship, where they bicker and argue at each other all the time, while also having touching moments about the important things in life.The other major part that I enjoyed about this film, is how funny it is. The comedy never felt forced and I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occasions.If you haven't seen ""Lady Bird,"" I highly recommend it.Hear me talk more about ""Lady Bird"" here: youtu.be/HfSouIJXGhw"
LADY BIRD,22 November 2018,7/10,"17-year-old ""Lady Bird"" McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) is going through her senior year at a Catholic high school in Sacramento in 2002. She dreams of getting into a good arts college on the east coast, so she can achieve something, as she says ""I wish I could live through something,"". The film's sole focus is to bring out the nostalgia in the audience, making us all re-live our adolescence and really relate to the character's everyday struggles and feats.Having a run time of 94 minutes the film does not drag too much, even though the begin does begin quite slowly, picking up the pace further in the film. The notion of being a rebellious teenager and then becoming an adult, finally accepting the world as it is, realising that your parents were always right and only wanted the best is what is so relatable about this film and its' only purpose. It is very realistic and shows how paranoid most teens are at the tender age of 17, when all the questions about life start to creep in from behind and the reality hits us.With good acting performance, the film does appear to be a coming-of-age drama and it does succeed at creating a rich, emotional world, particularly for young women, as you can see, feel and hear her in every breath and beat of this film, Greta Gerwig's first solo-credit feature that she's described as a love letter to her hometown.Follow us on Instagram for more!

LADY BIRD,11 September 2018,5/10,"I was disappointed in this movie, it evoked very little emotion in me and only made me laugh once. The story is stale, with Christine aka ""lady bird"" coming across as a total brat pretty much the whole movie. Timothee Chalamet was vastly underutilized (an opportunity missed). He really is the best up and coming actor in film at the minute and even in this small role managed to show that.I really do wonder what the academy were looking at when choosing this for the awards. I suspect it was because of the tale of the relationship between a working class mother and daughter. The camera work was average at best, the soundtrack was non existent, the acting was mediocre (apart from Chalamet, the mother and the father) and the story really wasn't the strongest.To try to be as fair as I can be I'm probably not in this movies demographic. Although I did like the relationship between lady bird and her father. He did everything to help her and keep the family together. 
The glory shots of Sacramento at the end were awesome.
Lastly Timothee Chalamet was excellent.I gave it 5 out of 10 and this is the max I would give it, a 90 minute movie that felt like 2 and a half hours. Give it a pass unless you really like the cast!"
LADY BIRD,14 February 2020,1/10,"Once again IMDB has a sterling review for a crap of a film. Stopped watching after 25 minutes as it was just completely bland and unenthusiastic with plastic acting. Do yourself a favour and missed this abomination that is that bad, I wouldn't even recommend it to my enemies"
LADY BIRD,15 December 2019,8/10,It's good. the final scene is wonderful but it just isn't particularly moving considering most of christine's faults are never addressed.
LADY BIRD,17 September 2018,9/10,"This film is triumphant in numerous ways. The performance, directing and writing were something to be applauded. To begin with, the relatability of the title character is something I and many others can appreciate. She lacks self-confidence and part of her wants more out of life which is something me and a clear majority of today's society can relate to. The way Saoirse Ronan portrays the character is beautiful. She offers a timid and innocent yet strong and powerful performance that really personifies the key components of the character she's playing. Laurie Metcalf is also stunning, and the two are amazing together. It's a partnership worthy of appreciation. The narrative is also quite lovely and thrives off character development rather than heavy plotlines which is a refreshing change in this day and age. Although sometimes it can feel slightly slow, all together it becomes an enthralling story with characters you cannot help but care for. It also does manage to act as an inspiration; it inspires the viewer to want more, to try and push themselves to new places and appreciate what they have. All in all, this is a lovely film to watch whether you're alone or with someone you love and I highly recommend."
LADY BIRD,6 June 2019,8/10,"Greta Gerwig explores the personal journey of Lady Bird through meaningful points in her life that define the complexity of becoming an adult. The strong relationship between mother and daughter only strengthen the overarching themes of wanting to be something more, and needing change, when things just seem too familiar."
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,10/10,"2017's Lady Bird is Greta Gerwig's masterpiece that will be remember and talked about for years coming. With its strong acting, fantastic directing, and flawless writing; this film is a grippingly hilarious 90 minute rom-com. With the script of Lady Bird taking multiple years and countless rewrites to finally get to its final product, it was well worth the struggle and well satisfying to watch. Every line of dialogue in this film feels so real and doesn't once feel pushed or forced for the story to progress. That is thanks to the fantastic casting of the whole cast and crew. But mainly from the fantastic writing from Gerwig herself. Directing wise this film looks beautiful with its variety of long uncut takes to its various montoges of what Christine 'Lady Bird' does with her friends and family just feels so real and makes the whole film feel like it was shot back in 2002. And even though this isn't Gerwig's first time behind the camera, it feels like she grew up there her entire life. Not a single shot feels out of place, not a single scene feels 'filler', not a single sound is not needed. This movie has the bare bones of what a very fast paced comedy drama needs to be just amazing. All the cast in this film is amazing. Saoirse Ronan is beautiful in this film with her various mood changes and sporadic attitudes brought out by various characters and settings. Especially with her going from yelling at the top of her lungs to breaking down crying to screaming with just hate shooting from her eyes. Both Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalamet are also amazing in this film with their polar opposite characters in it that also have confusing and mixed emotions throughout too. And probably my favorite performance in the whole film is Lady Bird's mom in the film played by the amazing Laurie Metcalf, her love-hate relationship with her daughter in the film makes her relatable but lovable but also hateable all at the same, which I've never seen ever in a film. This movie is a flawless teen drama, not a single part of this film has a 'teen drama cliche' in it and every time I thought it was going that way it would take a turn away from that. Lady bird is one of the most satisfying movies of the year and it deserves to be talked about highly by everyone who gets a chance to see it. Lady Bird gets a 10/10"
LADY BIRD,24 December 2017,6/10,"I thought saoirse ronan was wonderful. but many elements of the film just seem way off. 
first, it seems derivative of ""20th century women,"" and annette bening was much better as the mom than laurie metcalf. 
major points in the film were told rather than shown: the nun says that lady bird is a good writer, but we have no direct experience of her writing talent; the yellow lined papers say that the mom is insecure underneath her anger, but we have no direct evidence of that. the dad is depressed? we are told that, but he doesn't look depressed at all - just an amiable, kind-hearted loser. compare to sam elliott in ""off the grid."" lady bird says, ""i know i'm a liar""; but there is little if any footage of her mastering her lying and cheating.
what's with the name, ""lady bird?"" it evokes lady bird johnson, who would seem to have nothing in common with our protagonist. 
why does she want to go to an east coast artsy school? we never see her reading, watching art films, writing poetry, etc. 
she is arrogant (to apply to columbia), she lies, she cheats in class. shouldn't these be problems to overcome? 
if the film is an homage to sacramento, why no freeways? sacramento is dominated by highways 5, 99, 80 & 50. compare to la la land, in which the freeway does have a role. 
what's with the hispanic brother? not explained or used as a plot device, so it just seems random. also, i thought i read in the yellow, lined sheets, ""after i had your brother at age 40"" - though i may have misread as the sheets were visible for about 3 seconds. but shouldn't the brother be adopted or be explained to have a different father?
why does kyle say, unprovoked, ""you're not the first girl i had sex with; i've slept with 5 girls before you?"" i get why it hurts her, but, come on, who says that?!? he is presented as a musician and quiet reader whose dad has cancer. is that motivation to be a total jerk?
perhaps i went into the film expecting too much, but this is no ""juno."""
LADY BIRD,1 February 2018,8/10,"Twas quite good. Yes. Quite good.I feel like I don't need to elaborate much more than that but I'll give it a shot.This film reminds me of the good John Hughes. Not the Flubber and Home Alone 3 John Hughes. The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles John Hughes. The John Hughes that spoke to a generation of young people with heartfelt, funny and (mostly) authentic representations of what it meant to grow up and discover yourself. While not quite as comedic as say Sixteen Candles, Lady Bird balances itself against the likes of those films by being even more grounded and real. And the result is an exceptionally well-told look into growing up. The sexual awakening, the drive for love and social acceptance, parental resentment and household imperfection, the desire to carve out the future you want for yourself while being constantly opposed by outside forces, achieving your goals only to realize it's not what it was cracked out to be. It's all here and I can't imagine it not relating to every person to some degree.This movie's greatest strength is that it keeps it simple and takes it's time. It doesn't reach beyond it's means and try to tell years worth of story. It is a couple months of life, but it gives you so much detail and so much authenticity in those few months. The result is a 90 minute movie that told everything that needed to be told. It's shocking how hard of a time most films have trying to pull that off. Flawless pacing, short and sweet.I appreciate that the protagonist of this film isn't a socially paralyzed introvert by the way, which is usually what you get when a middle aged man tries to make a relatable film for teenagers. It's such a trope at this point that it was cool that the protagonist was a girl who was comfortable around people, had experiences with guys, went to parties, had a lust for performance and generally didn't have trouble speaking up or making friends with popular kids, her selfish motivations for doing so notwithstanding. She had her moments of social dissonance, sure. We all have those. Everyone growing up in my school had a crush on Hermoine Granger. I was a Ginny Weasley guy. None of us are the same. What you get when you show us someone that experiences BOTH social butterfly qualities and social awkwardness qualities while also humanizing the oft-demonized ""popular"" people is someone that's more universally relatable. Of course there is always the risk of trying to please everyone and instead pleasing no one but this film is so deftly written and directed that instead you get a character that everyone can connect with. It's very impressive.While I said that the film isn't quite as funny as Sixteen Candles, this film has comedy in spades. It just also has tears, and the comedy stems more from the relatability of everyone involved and less from setups and punchlines. The best compliment I can give the film is this: the laughs come from the feeling of ""lol that is so me"" and the tears come from a feeling of ""wow... that is so me."" It's kinda remarkable.Some might find themselves disappointed with what feels like an unsatisfactory cliffhanger ending, but I quite liked that bit too. This is an authentic representation of life, and the only ending to life is death. Since the main character doesn't die, it would be almost disingenuous for the film to treat the story told like it has an ending. Life goes on, as does this story after the screen goes black, likely for decades.The movie isn't Earth-shattering and time will tell if it will stick with me or enter ""t-minus one day"" territory. But, for now I am very impressed with just how well-told and well-paced this movie is. It wasn't forced or contrived like I personally found similar films like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and ""Juno""; instead it comes off as effortlessly real, emotional and funny, although I'm sure a heck of a lot of effort went in to making it so.It was quite good. Yes. Quite."
LADY BIRD,9 April 2018,7/10,"I had very high hopes for Lady Bird. Before I started watching this year's Oscar movies, I really though it had a good chance of being my favorite picture of the year. I happen to like female actresses (ok, that might be a bit sexist, but its true anyway); I had seen and really liked Saoirse Ronan in Brooklyn (a role that also got her another leading actress nomination); and I like 'coming of age' stories because of all the awkward drama surrounding sex, love, and figuring out what to do with the rest of your life. So this movie had a lot going for it and expectations were high.Unfortunately, it fell short - it was a good movie but not a great one. The movie seemed clumsy at a few points and needed more polish. Compared to another 'coming of age' movie from this year, Call Me by Your Name, its comedy was just not quite as funny and its drama not as compelling.Lady Bird was also a major disappointment at the Oscars. Although it received five nominations, including Best Picture, and only five other movies received more, it failed to win a single Oscar. Even more significant was that all five nominations were 'above the line' - meaning in the acting, directing, and writing categories - which was more than any other picture except the Best Picture winner, Shape of Water. Clearly this was a movie that was expected to do a lot better than it actually did.I suspect the reason lies in the politics surrounding the Academy and the motion picture industry this year. Harvey Weinstein's casting couch has been permanently cast aside, generating the #MeToo movement to highlight the gender inequities in the industry. While female actresses have always been around, albeit with characters generally less developed, the percentage of writers and directors that are women remains abysmally small. That this movie would come along, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, instantly propelled it into the spotlight and the nomination roster. It was the right movie to illustrate that the academy was making strong efforts to change its sexist foundations. It was a movie about women, made by women and so received multiple and significant nominations.Unfortunately, this is Ms. Gerwig's freshman effort. Yes, she has a long list of acting credits, and she has co-written lines and screenplays in over a dozen movies and television shows. She has even co-directed before (Nights and Weekends), but this is her first movie ever where she is solo writer and director. And like anyone's first efforts at something, her sensitivities are a little tentative and her convictions uncertain. Some of the plot points remain underexplained, especially the motivations of the parents. That Ms. Gerwig has talent is obvious, but she needs time and practice to refine her craft - we'll see her in the Oscar program again, I'm sure.Much the same argument can be made for why Ms. Ronan did not win in the Leading Actress category. She gave a convincing performance, but she is still very young (23 years old at the time the movie was made) so she can still benefit from more acting experience. I loved her performance in Brooklyn (from a couple years ago). In that movie, as well as this one, she captures the innocence of a young woman without being naive. But, like Ms. Gerwig, she needs seasoning. She is rising fast - this is her third Oscar nomination - but she is not yet a Meryl Streep. Laurie Metcalf plays Marion, Lady Bird's mother. Metcalf is better known as Jackie, Roseanne's sister in the recently rebooted TV comedy series. Marion loves her daughter, but is also under huge stress as she tries to keep a family together suffering from serious external and internal pressures. As a result, she is unable to give her daughter the full support her large ambitions require. Metcalf was nominated for Supporting Actress for her role in this movie and it is well earned - her performance is credible, if not Oscar-worthy.Lady Bird is a 'coming of age' movie with all of the pros and cons of that genre. Set in Sacramento, California around 2002 (the same place and time that Ms. Gerwig graduated from high school), the movie recounts Lady Bird's senior year - prom, sex, the senior play, cliques and friendships, and college admissions. She has great ambitions that her family has trouble supporting, but ends up fulfilling at least part of her dreams and grows up substantially in the process. Ronan's performance stirs our laughter and our tears.I had great expectations for this movie. I enjoy watching movies from and about strong women. Given that this movie received five Oscar nominations, all 'above-the-line', I was expecting a powerful dramatic experience. In the end, though, the movie was smaller than I had hoped for. It promises a certain high-level of emotional experience, but just doesn't quite make it. Maybe that is part of riding along with people as they grow; maybe another movie with the same cast and crew but a few more years experience, might deliver a bit more punch"
LADY BIRD,10 December 2020,2/10,"This movie is a fine slice of life film, but did it really need to be made?Clint Redwine from 92.9 FM explained it better. (BTW, I totally agree with him that The Lone Ranger was a really good film that critics attacked too harshly. ) Here are Clint's thoughts:About two times a year I find myself on my lonely little movie critic island all by myself. Everyone else in the world is raving about some fantastic work of art that I'm mostly sure is a big pile of steaming crap. Other times, all of the other critics are sure that we have just witnessed the worst movie to ever have the audacity to show its hideous self in a darkened theater, while I find it to be quite enjoyable. This is one of those times.And this time I'm sure LADY BIRD is a big pile of steaming crap. (Shout out to all of my critic buddies standing at the other side of the candy counter and laughing at me!)I will say that the acting in this movie is outstanding. There may even be some award-worthy roles. But the plot is so plain, so boring, so generic store-brand vanilla that the acting gets swallowed up by the meh.Seriously, the plot of this movie, (based on the life and horrific first-world, white-girl, middle-class-family tragedies of Greta Gerwig), is about a girl who doesn't quite fit in at school even though she has friends, has arguments with her parents, wants to move away to go to college, has a couple of relationships that end in breakups, and finally realizes her family is pretty okay.What the actual #$%@!? This is a movie? Ummm, no. It's basically the life story of almost every single American teen ever.Truly, there is nothing in this movie that made me say, oh, now I get why we are doing this. It is simply a slice of a boring life.There is no way I could ever recommend anyone ever seeing this movie, but it has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing, so what the heck do I know. Go enjoy it while I bask in the sun on my lonely island watching THE LONE RANGER again."
LADY BIRD,20 January 2018,9/10,"I was absolutely enthralled by this film. ""Lady Bird"" is a great look at the life of a teenage girl, with an earnest approach to storytelling that I appreciate greatly. The performances are what really sell this film- particularly that of the family unit. Saorise Ronan and Laurie Metcalf have such great chemistry in this film, and the reality in their performances are the basis for the film. Most coming of age stories that focus on a girl are about romance- about romantic relationships during the adolescence of the protagonist shaping her view of life and love in some way. And while there are elements of this in the film, that's not the focus. The love story is that of the mother and daughter, and is incredibly well done. Lady Bird's relationships with each member of her family (father, brother, and her brother's girlfriend) lend great shape to her background, so when we observe her outside of this setting, we understand so much more. The way this script is written is also so natural- scenes just kind of start or just kind of end, like we're being dropped in and out of the middle of things, and it feels so incredibly natural. It's shot pretty well, rather standardly, but there's still an interesting approach here and there, and it is very well directed.The way this film addresses all it's themes is so well done, it never comes across as preachy or moralistic- it's just life. Elements like Marion's work as a mental health professional, Lady Bird's first relationship (and how it ends, that scene at the coffee shop really sold me on this film), and especially the element of the catholic church really inform all of the influences on Lady Bird. The catholic school that Lady Bird attends isn't some harsh, unforgiving place, it's a realistic portrayal of the setting. The faculty at the school, particularly Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith) and Father Leviatch (Stephen Henderson) are friendly, kind, understanding people, and are complex characters, even though their roles are minor. The way that the drama club is utilized is so true of a high school drama club (as an actor, I can tell you that that audition scene was spot on), and is just another element that fills out the world of the film so well. As far as misgivings, I only have two main issues with the film. I think that the character's are played a little too young for the high school seniors they're meant to represent. This often happens when you have older people playing high schoolers, but I genuinely think that some of the attitudes and ways of thinking of these characters is closer to a high school sophomore or junior than a senior, but that's honestly a nitpick. The biggest issue is the use of a cliche we've seen in every high school movie- the ""leaves best friend for the popular kids, only to realize that they aren't great friends after all, only to reunite with the best friend a short time later."" This really could have been handled better in some way. Although it really doesn't bring it down too much for me. I really adored this film and can't wait to see it again, and I highly, highly recommend it. 9.5/10"
LADY BIRD,2 January 2019,10/10,"Greta Gerwig's solo directorial debut is an ode of sorts both to her own upbringing in Sacramento and to the prickly experiences of all teenagers just trying to fit in. It may have received no love at the Oscars (albeit with several nominations), but Lady Bird is a masterpiece of a film, deliciously amusing and, above all, heartfelt.
Lady Bird may be semi-autobiographical (it gives a sense of being deeply personal to its creator throughout), but it is not a young Greta Gerwig whose story we follow, rather Christine MacPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a Sacramento teen who prefers to be referred to by her ""given name"", Lady Bird (""I gave it to myself, it's given to me by me""). We watch as Lady Bird makes that daunting transition from adolescence to adulthood, battling the struggles of friendships, love and a more than uneasy relationship with her mother Marion (a phenomenal Laurie Metcalf).
What is perhaps most incredible about Lady Bird is the way it takes one of the most cliched, safe genres in cinema, the coming-of-age, and manages to bring a freshness and spark to it with such ease. Lady Bird breaks no ground with its plot, but it proves that a film doesn't have to do so to instil a real feeling in its audience and be something special. Greta Gerwig's direction is utterly flawless; her understanding of character and canny eye for period detail lend the film a profound sincerity and a slick appearance, thoughtful and detailed down to a tee. Lady Bird feels like a love letter from Gerwig, a classic example of a film that is evidently special to its director and translates its emotional impact perfectly to its audience. This movie made me laugh and cry, often from one to the other, like a game of ping pong, yet never feeling unnatural or forced.
In truth, the success of Lady Bird relies on one person; Saoirse Ronan is faultless as the eponymous lead, bringing a youthful spunkiness to the role, coupled with a gorgeous vulnerability. Gerwig is not afraid to depict ultimately flawed characters; no truer is this seen than in Ronan's performance, the young star carrying the film on her shoulders with an envious ease. Lady Bird finds its greatest performer, however, in Laurie Metcalf, playing Christine's exasperated, yet bullishly strong-willed mother. Metcalf's performance is simply astounding, her final scene enough to bring anyone to tears and rivalling Patricia Arquette's Oscar-winning matriarch in Boyhood. Scenes between Ronan and Metcalf are some of the best in the film, sharply written and sometimes painfully relatable. The movie is backed up by a talented supporting cast, including a gentle father in Tracy Letts and Beanie Feldstein showing great comedic timing as Lady Bird's insecure best friend, Julie.
There is something very beautiful about Lady Bird; it's a very understated film yet has an unparalleled effect in entirely immersing its audience within the lives of its characters. It's wonderfully funny, intelligently constructed and has an emotional core that is never loudly exclaimed but is always deeply affecting. A stunning film, Lady Bird leaves me hungry for more from Greta Gerwig."
LADY BIRD,21 July 2018,2/10,"I first learned about this film from a cinema booklet. It was advertised as though it would be focused solely on the dysfunctional relationship between mother and daughter, which would have a sprinkling of nuanced tragi-comic humour.Instead it is another ""coming of age"" story. This means that you get the same tired old formulas: a male friend who turns out to be struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality, an obnoxious boyfriend and a ""Ladybird"" (the vainglorious main character) who is a typical misfit that tries desperately to appear important by having sex and almost going to house parties. However, she realises that pretending to be cool is just not cool and the mother-daughter bond faces some kind of reconciliation towards the end through a teary and cliché note. As with all coming of age stories the scenes often give a self-indulgent nudge and a wink to the audience that what has happened is so relatable and witty because ""we've all been through it"", which often feels forced. The only thing that was funny was the PE teacher, who appears very briefly when he takes over drama class.Ultimately, I think that there are too many characters and an over realiance on witticisms which meant that there was a lack of emotional depth that I was looking for. It was a depressing watch."
LADY BIRD,26 September 2021,4/10,"It's on generation gap
A mom n girl story.In this girl enjoy life as own way."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,8/10,"'Lady Bird' is written and directed by Greta Gerwig and stars Saoirse Ronan as Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson. ""Lady Bird"" is name she gave herself as a rebellious act against her mother Marion played wonderfully by Laurie Metcalf. Lady Bird even remarks near the end film that 'some people won't believe in God but they'll just accept a name given to them by their parents'. Ronan's title character is one of the most rebellious and defiant lead characters of the year topped only by Frances McDormand's Mildred Hayes in 'Three Billboards'. It's very entertaining and at times poignant to watch her verbally spar with her mother over something as tedious as straightening a bed cover in a hotel room. This is testament to both the cast and Gerwig's script which keeps things feeling fresh and new in every scene. Although I do like this film I don't quite love it like most people do and all the enormous praise it has received over the past few months as lead to being considered one of if not the best film of the year. For me it's not quite up there although it was very pleasant and entertaining to watch. There is a great sense of place present in the movie and it's clear that Gerwig and her title character really do actually love Sacramento as the latter begins to realize when speaking with a nun (Lois Smith) at her school towards the end of the film. The movie has a great ensemble cast including Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges and Timothee Chalamet who all give decent turns as their respective vital characters. However, it really is carried by Ronan and Metcalf and the best moments are when they are sharing scenes together. It is crazy to think that Ronan who is good in literally everything is on her third Oscar nomination with this film. But then again considering the talent she has maybe it's not crazy at all but expected. So all in all, 'Lady Bird' is a sweet, heartwarming coming-of-age tale that pulls you in with its intriguing script and keeps you their with its magnetic performances."
LADY BIRD,10 September 2019,7/10,"Lady bird finds a way to relate with a feeling or experience growing up as a teenager, Maybe not in the way of a heartbreaker drama or a climax changing movie, but it will deliver with a pleasant acting and a slow pace."
LADY BIRD,14 February 2018,7/10,"The movie is about young woman in her last year before she goes to college. She is aware of her wants and potentials and is set on to making a better future away from home. The movie is good in a way that it lets you feel every scene is realistic and free-flowing as possible. Credit should be given to the writing and the acting aspects of the film. It may not have jaw-dropping effects or even art-house visuals but it is the genuineness of the characters and their interactions with one another that is the real spectacle here. It is highly relatable all through out (even for males), I laughed and I teared-up. If you like realistic dramas with good acting and dialogues, and that make you feel both high and low. Lady Bird is a must see."
LADY BIRD,25 June 2018,8/10,"""Lady Bird"" is a sensitive autobiographical account of growing up in Sacramento, California.Her recounting of the way she tested her boundaries with both her family and her parochial school is pleasing in some respects but teeth-grating in a couple of others.As a result, some of its content, particularly a sexual encounter in which the title character is a bit shy of her 18th birthday, necessitates a restrictive classification. The scene is not lurid, but that's the point Gerwig is making: Nothing this girl does as she explores her limits as a daughter and student, however misguided, is capable of shocking anyone except herself.This is particularly true at the all-girls parochial school Christine McPherson -- who insists that everyone call her Lady Bird -- attends. It's headed by the compassionate, good-humoured Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), who tries to help Christine identify her talents.When Sister Sarah Joan suggests Lady Bird has ""a performative streak,"" she lands a part in the school musical and thinks she's found a caring boyfriend in fellow actor Danny O'Neill (Lucas Hedges). But their relationship ends abruptly when, in another uncomfortable passage of the film, she sees him kissing another boy at the cast party.She then pursues Kyle Scheible all the way to a discreetly handled carnal moment that does not conclude the way Christine was expecting it to.Lady Bird is eager to get out of her dull hometown, which she compares to ""the Midwest of California."" And she hasn't set her sights on the kind of state-subsidized university her cash-strapped family can afford, aiming instead at somewhere she imagines will be more cultured.Even then, Sister Sarah Joan is onto her, though. Reading one of her college-application essays, she remarks, ""It's clear how much you love Sacramento.""
""I guess I pay attention,"" Lady Bird responds.
To this, the nun asks, ""Don't you think they're the same thing?""Lady Bird isn't rebellious enough to roll her skirt, but she enjoys exploring taboos. She nonchalantly snacks on Communion wafers, for instance, while gossiping with a friend in the back room of a chapel. When another student expresses understandable shock, Lady Bird assures her that the hosts are unconsecrated.But Immaculate Heart High School does have a nonnegotiable code of deportment. So when Lady Bird interrupts a pro-life lecture with ""Just because something is ugly doesn't mean it's morally wrong,"" she earns a brief suspension. The point isn't explored further. This is depicted as just another expression of Lady Bird's adolescent -- and, so the script's tone suggests, largely unjustified -- discontent.Gerwig herself is not Catholic but attended a Catholic high school, and Lady Bird, although it's not made explicit, is in the same situation. She's not rebelling against church teachings, though, as much as life in general and her place in it.Lady Bird's mother, the perpetually stressed Marion , with whom she bickers, works double shifts as a psychiatric nurse because husband Larry is out of work.Gerwig takes care to show that Lady Bird is capable of rapid emotional shifts while willing to accept her mother's point of view. She ends one argument with Marion early in the film by hurling herself out the of the car they're driving in. Later, she stops another by cooing over a prom dress at a thrift store.It's no spoiler to point out that the movie's conclusion, during which Lady Bird has finally achieved her dream of college in New York, shows a very strong old-school moral compass at work. It's a redeeming wrap-up. But the problematic material that precedes it requires thoughtful discernment by grown viewers well-grounded in their faith.cc K.Jensen"
LADY BIRD,20 June 2018,9/10,"More closer to life than anything in recent memory. Complemented by great performances. Not groundbreaking but truly heartfelt, from all levels. So subtle yet ultimately so affecting."
LADY BIRD,13 May 2018,1/10,Absolutely no ending. No resolution to the story whatsoever.
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,6/10,"This may be the most poorly marketed movie. Awful trailer. Awful poster.And so, I thank both the academy and golden globes (Something I've always wanted to say) for forcing me to watch this movie due to its accolades because i wouldn't have otherwise.I would definitely recommend this movie. Quietly funny, emotional and very relatable."
LADY BIRD,23 March 2018,8/10,"This slow paced film which depicts the realities surrounding the life of a teenager is so genuinely crafted that you almost start feeling relatable to how the character is portrayed and makes you reevaluate your own life that u passed as a teenager.
This film is enriched by strong and convincing performances by Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf which would leave you touched at the heartstrings."
LADY BIRD,8 June 2020,9/10,"This is one of those teen films that isn't superficial drama but instead is very artistic. Greta Gerwig grabs my heart on this one. I feel like as a young adult, this reflected so well everything I was as a teenager, I feel bad for not watching this few years ago when I was 16. It is like all the events here did not really happen to me, but did at the same time, I'm sure Greta feels the same. It's comedic realism, but the realism comes first"
LADY BIRD,10 July 2020,7/10,"Its a coming of a age story that is very relatable as the main character goes through her teen years. She's finding herself and who she truly is throughout this incredible journey. I wouldn't describe this movie as cliche though, as it has a somewhat unique storyline."
LADY BIRD,18 June 2018,2/10,"I wanted to like this movie and after reading that it was nominated for an Oscar, I decided to give it a try, what a mistake, The movie is boring and very annoying, I have no idea why this was nominated. I didn't like the actors and the story is just bad written. Sorry but nothing in it made me think of a good part."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2019,5/10,"I have to start out by saying I usually like movies with Saoirse Ronan. And the acting of all the main characters is not to be faulted. Great work!
Nevertheless, there was not enough of a story to keep me interested. I like to watch a movie that has a plot or a storyline I do not know everything about. Here I felt that I was watching reality happening. All the mistakes one makes in puberty, the fights one has with ones parents in spite of loving them, ...
All there, but I just didn't want to watch it."
LADY BIRD,3 February 2018,4/10,"I was not expecting a lot from this film but it still manages to disappoint. There are sooooo many topics and threads that this film could have explored in interesting and thoughtful ways...from the Father's depression and lack of financial success to teenage angst and insecurities to sibling relationships to homosexuality and religion. I could go on and on...yet Lady Bird chooses to merely scratch the surface of every single opportunity that presents itself! Even the ending is completely underwhelming. While it does have its moments, in the end this is one film that is not even worth the price of a discounted admission."
LADY BIRD,7 July 2018,1/10,"Saoirse Ronan must have some powerful friends determined to get her an Oscar. No offense to the young woman who is beautiful and talented but first the lightweight ""Brooklyn"" was thrust upon the masses and now the vapid ""Lady Bird"". I cannot be the only one who sees this. Seriously she is a privileged actress who is gifted roles other superior actors deserve."
LADY BIRD,26 July 2020,,"What I appreciated most about this film is the it's confident sense of place and the intimate, nuanced family dynamic. The setting - in Sacramento, from our protagonists small home to the Catholic all girls high school she attends, comes alive. The director has a sharp eye for detail, and gives a warmth and tenderness to a place which astutely observes that polarity between comfort, family, and home, with shame, a striving for independence, a striving for experiencing love and life beyond a familiar small world. This setting is rendered with a lot of love and a lot of care. So too did I appreciate the family dynamic. Particularly, I thought the father's character, and the relationship between Lady Bird and her father, was subtle, believable, and beautifully told. Tracy Letts deserves much credit for a small and memorable performance. As of course does Gretta Gerwig, for her restrained writing and directing. The mother, Laurie Metcalf, too is an excellent character playing a central role in the story, and the more commanding figure in the household. (Which, on a second thought, I also very much appreciated - having experienced a similar household dynamic) I only thought the film was somewhat limited by Lady Bird herself. Saoirse Ronan gives a generally excellent performance, but the writing and character development is somewhat limited, or at least pales in comparison to the supporting cast (including her best friend played by Beanie Feldstein, who just commands the camera's attention) We don't get as much insight as I would have liked into why she is the way that she is - which is to say, a teenager, striving for independence, looking for love, navigating a transition from childhood to adulthood. Don't get me wrong, the detail is there for you to put the story together, but I would have appreciated maybe a scene or two that really let us see her vulnerability in a different way. The other overall nitpick of the film is that some of the comedy feels a little tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie. For example, Timothée Chalamet's character, a love interest for Lady Bird, is this broody and hilariously over the top angsty and arrogant kid. He's a pure caricature of ""the cool kid"", in a film that otherwise toes a deft line between sharp wit and realism. Lady Bird's first love interest, Lucas Hedges, is much more believable and interesting. Both serve a purpose in Lady Bird's character development, but one feels more in-line with the film's tone. A last thing I will say about the movie - I couldn't help but feel it followed a fairly traditional beat-by-beat teenage story. There is a promise that it will transcend genre cliche's, but it often hits the same expected story beats. The difference being, within a fairly unsurprising plot, there is a lot of detail and tenderness to grasp on to."
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,5/10,"It was an OK movie. The acting was solid, but the pacing was so slow. I felt like the whole movie was a series of unconnected vignettes created for the purpose of showing that that writer had a couple of minutes of good dialogue. But when strung together, these scenes (or vignettes) didn't really deliver much of a story. Glad I saw it on Netflix and didn't spend $14 bucks in the theater on this."
LADY BIRD,6 April 2020,8/10,"A frank and honest story about the life of a teenager who is about to come of age: 18 years old, with all the fears, concerns, expectations, and illusions, typical of that moment.
It is actually a film about a very intense relationship between 2 women of character and well-defined personalities, LadyBird and her mother, who know each other, face each other, need each other and love each other deeply.
The film that was produced in 2017 is also an autobiographical story, set in 2002 in Sacramento, California, written and directed by Greta Gerwig who opens her heart and shares with us her memories of that time, her friends, her conquests, her school, her parents: her life; when she was then a teenager.
The strength of the film lies in the naturalness of its narrative, its truthfulness, the joy with which she remembers her encounters and her misunderstandings, her struggle to get ahead despite setbacks and difficulties, in order to finally achieve her aspirations.
Lady Bird is the debut of Greta Gerwig as director, she had co-directed with Joe Swanberg the movie Nights and Weekends in 2008.
Undoubtedly, a talented artist and a great woman of our time, Greta Gerwig actress, writer and director.
Film crediting various nominations and awards, with great performances by: Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf accompanied by: Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timothée Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Lois Smith"
LADY BIRD,4 February 2020,8/10,Very good story. Directing and editing excellent. ( What happened to Little Women?). Writing (especially dialogue excellent. A few scenes cliche' but overall very good movie.
LADY BIRD,25 January 2019,6/10,"I felt that Lady Bird accurately depicted a teenage coming of age story, Ronan plays an angsty teen trying to find herself particularly well. I've never been to Sacramento but the story is so universal that it's relatable regardless, which, I think, comes from realistic writing and acting. Visually the movie is quite beautiful and is shot well. Lady Bird's relationship with her best friend and first boyfriend are some of my favourites, along with her dad.Everyone talks about the mother-daughter relationship in this film as ""complicated"" or ""too real"" or how ""accurate"" it is. Personally, I didn't see that in the film. I saw a mother who was not supportive, not nurturing, not empathetic, this does not make their relationship complicated, it makes it neglectful and abusive. The mother is constantly being passive aggressive towards Lady Bird, she is cutting and often shows contempt towards her daughter saying that she won't amount to anything, she shouldn't have ambitions or follow her dreams. She can't even communicate with her effectively, instead choosing to ignore her and give her the silent treatment. She then offers a little bit of love in forms of shopping with her daughter or viewing expensive houses, a favourite activity of them both. Only she takes that love right back again when Lady Bird says something or acts in a way that she doesn't like. Again, this is not complicated, this is abuse.I'm really surprised that prior to watching this movie in 2019, I had not heard this take on the mother-daughter relationship. I had to look up if others felt the same way, which is quite sad because abuse needs to be recognised and called out. No, the mother does not hit her daughter, the abuse seen in the film is not physical but emotional and mental, this kind of abuse can be very traumatic and last a very long time.I understand that the mother works very hard and she may be upset with her daughter for not appreciating all that she and both parents do for their children but that does not excuse the behaviour that she exhibits at all. She is a teenager after all, self-absorption is one of the top traits. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities or storyline for the mother, however, Lady Bird goes through many character developments and redeems herself on not all but many aspects."
LADY BIRD,26 June 2021,8/10,"This was my comfort movie for the longest time, it's truly very great, the acting, the theme of the show, it is very slow paced and realistic, that's what makes it great, there is not much tension or thrill in this show, but you get to see what the main character goes through and her daily life, at times it even feels like you are the main character, or are living in the same reality as her."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,8/10,"This is a coming of age tale. A Good film. Not great, like Linklater or Baumbach, but very good. I like the steadiness of this film. Gerwig resists being melodramatic or tacky and reaps rewards for her focus. Metcalf is excellent as always and the young actress is quite wonderful."
LADY BIRD,14 April 2020,9/10,"As a youth film that reflects the growth process, Lady Bird's plot is familiar and trivial.The film is interspersed with the ups and downs of family and friendship on the road of growth. Societies, boyfriends, broken relationships, college entrance exams, and best friends break and reconcile, all have been seen too many times. But Lady Bird is refreshing because it captures the essence of youth, that is, fighting and running away.The description of the mother-daughter relationship in the movie caused me a lot of resonance, and the scene of driving at the end left a deep impression on me."
LADY BIRD,19 May 2018,1/10,"If you want to watch a bunch of 10 second shallow scenes juxtaposed to make a 1.5 hour movie, go for it. The character development is NILL in this movie. The only person that gives this movie any substance is Laurie Metcalf. This movie was a total let-down and JUNK. All copies of it should be destroyed."
LADY BIRD,29 April 2021,,"This is a fantastic film. I thought much of it was so funny, while other parts were dramatic and heartfelt. The attention it has received is well-deserved."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2018,9/10,Http://nickkaminskysblogspot.blogspot.com/2017/11/review-lady-bird.html
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,9/10,I was sucked into this movie immediately. Saoirse Ronan was excellent. I found myself cheering for her and cringing for her almost simultaneously. Laurie Metcalf was perfect. I have nothing but good things to say.
LADY BIRD,5 February 2019,8/10,It's a coming of age story. I don't think it was fabulous - but the acting was for sure great.
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,10/10,"Bet if this story was about a girl from LA, New York or Chicago it would of swept the whole Oscars. The movie wasn't snubbed, Sacramento was."
LADY BIRD,12 March 2018,10/10,"C'mon people. Its the freakin"" capital of California. Can you at least spell the name right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
LADY BIRD,21 December 2017,9/10,"Up for multiple awards and sporting an impressively high 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, Gerwig's directorial debut is an extremely confident and poignant tale of a teenage girl as she navigates through one year of her life as a Catholic school student in Sacramento, California.Stylistically this independent feature is very reminiscent of the understated documentary vibe of Richard Linklator's Boyhood with it's impressionistic editing and willingness to just.....well...show a life (Ex. teenagers hanging out, practicing for a lame school play, first dates, being away from home at college).So I guess an alternative title for this would be Girlhood?Actually, I think LB manages to surpass Boyhood because it makes it's points regarding life and growing pains in a more efficient and energetic way in it's ninety minute runtime than Boyhood in nearly three hours thanks to it's disciplined editing and sharp dialogue.But by far the highlight of the film is the tumultuous dynamic between Christine and her mother (Metcalf), especially one particularly uncomfortable but funny sequence involving something as timeless as shopping for a prom dress. The acting by both Ronan and Metcalf is more than deserving of the accolades. Anybody who has ever had a difficult relationship with their mother will find a lot of moments in this movie that will hit close to home.Even though there is plenty of drama to go around, there are also a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, especially between Christine and her friend Julie (Beanie Feldstein). Probably my favorite little moment was a scene in which Christine and Julie are goofing around in a church that exhibits some very cute bonding moments presented in a hilariously unconventional manner. It all feels very down-to-earth, personal and...well....real.That is almost the key word here: real.Everything about this movie feels true to life. There are no big moral speeches, no over-the-top melodrama, no sense of self-importance, or calculated soundtrack inserts.If I had any complaint about this film it's regarding Father Leviatch, Christine's theater instructor played by Stephen McKinley Henderson. There is a certain reveal regarding his character about halfway through that never really ends up having a pay-off. I know the movie is called LB, so in the end it is about Christine journey but I wouldn't be surprised if something significant got left in the editing room because Leviatch just kinda disappears after a while."
LADY BIRD,22 May 2020,4/10,"Very boring, drawn out supposed comedy. From the advertisements, it appears to be a female version of Superbad, but it comes off as being super bad. Horrible. Very few laughs, if any. I kept waiting for something funny to happen. But it never materializes. Do not waste you time with this movie."
LADY BIRD,21 August 2018,7/10,"I am struggling a bit to rate this film. 
I enjoyed watching it; very absorbing. It kept my attention. I feel that it captured real life fairly accurately. I did not like the main titular character, but she was super well acted/ portrayed. She was a bit obnoxious, BUT her character growth was very natural and realistic. Her relationship with her parents seemed so realistic. I could delve in deep and write an analytical essay on the parent-child relationships.
***Small Spoiler****
I especially liked the prom scene! The best-friend friendship was so sweet and honest.
Early on in the movie, I found myself mouthing ""he's gay!"" at the screen. Pro tip: if you are interested in a guy you meet in drama class who is especially interested in curling his hair...again very realistic. He was my favourite character. What a sweetheart. I was afraid that Ladybird would react in a homophobic manner, or there would be drama with the Catholic school staff, but the film didn't go in that direction. I would love to see a film based on his life. But how do I rate this movie? 7? Yeah, I'll give it a 7 I guess."
LADY BIRD,9 February 2019,5/10,"Finally watched this movie after hearing the endless hype for it.
After the credits rolled in, just like when I finished watching Moonrise Kingdom (same coming-of-age genre), I was.... confused. Didn't understand how it got so hyped--at least Moonrise Kingdom has a beautiful, surrealistic cinematography.Lady Bird has the same formula of every indie CoA movies: rebellious teenager tired of their uncool/boring life dying to find excitement, while trying out sex and cigarettes, ditching their uncool best friend for the popular guys, only to realize that their best friend is betterThough, the relationship between Lady Bird and her mom feels really authentic and quite relatable. They're so passive-aggressive to the point I got irritated as well, but that also means what the movie is trying to portray is working.Maybe i'm just boring so I never got the point of coming-of-age films; even though i'm only in my early twenties.. Or maybe because I'm not familiar with Sacramento nor I live in the US; because I can see how nostalgic the movie could feel with ""noise"" filter edited and the snippets of landscapes and sceneriesSide note; I like how they portray the Catholic Schools. Most movies would paint them as this traditional, extremely conservative environment with judgy nuns/fathers/teachers. But here, it felt realistic. The nuns are so sweet and funny"
LADY BIRD,28 July 2018,7/10,"Lady bird is a coming of age film it focus on lady bird and her mother and how there so different, the acting is good the actors know how to be funny and serious, the cinematography isn't good and the lighting is off, one of the plotlines is cliche and wasn't needed, overall go watch it you'll have fun"
LADY BIRD,17 November 2017,7/10,"I went to see Lady Bird with moderately high hopes after reading some reviews. I enjoyed it and it was well done but I found the story and dialog to not be original enough or clever enough to give it equally high praise as some reviews have. It's good for a few chuckles but 'best comedy of 2017' it is not, or at least I hope there is something funnier."
LADY BIRD,13 December 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird, like many movies on high school kids, awkward relationships and coming-of-age tales, is a hilarious look on life and the wonders of the world that we all face. Female-driven and downright funny, Lady Bird stands alone because it does not try to own the idea that the film is solely about women and women only. Sure, there are mother/daughter scenes that my girlfriend related with more but the dialogue is so well written, that it forced me to transport back to my own high school days and conversations with my mother during that time period of my life. The film does an amazing job of presenting the world from Christine's, aka Lady Bird's point-of-view, while showing the real memories, hardships, lessons and choices made during these strange years of our lives. I had a friend in high school whose mother might as well have played Lady Bird's in the film. The passive-aggressiveness and hard love from Christine's mom was so believable that it often made me cringe. It was almost too real.As you watch the film unfold, you'll say to yourself ""I've seen this story before"" and you probably have. But there is still something different about Lady Bird with its hilariously written raunchy language, Lady Bird's amazing friend Julie, and the way in which it weaves in and out of Lady Bird's life and those surrounding her. There is a certain scene where Lady Bird's mother talks about her dad's battle with depression for years and Lady Bird telling her that no one ever informed her about it. Later in the film, Lady Bird's mom scolds her for not sharing more information with their family, proving the fact that there are moments in both the adult and children's world that do not always cross paths. Since Ronan is so strong in the lead role, we often forget that she is just a teenager that hasn't been through some of the really hard things in life just yet. She hasn't gotten too drunk, lost a job, kept a family and children happy, found or lost out on success, paid bills, been late on a credit card payment, had a really rough day at work, and so much more. Lady Bird's mom, however, has been. She may come off as scary to others, but in all fairness, her own mother was an abusive drunk, and she's been through a little more in life then many of these high school kids. It's not always as easy as some people make it out to be. I think we also see that Lady Bird can be a little intimidating as well with her confidence and free-spirit attitude roaming the halls of school and her home. She is kind and loving, yet up front and blunt. In my family, my brother is a spitting image of my dad in every way. They bash heads the most because my dad sees his own flaws in my brother, and I believe that's hard for any parent to accept. As we grow older, we find things about our parents we genuinely do not like as well, but we know they are just humans like the rest of us. They make mistakes, they have flaws and often, many of these flaws are passed down generation-to-generation. We also start to see our own flaws and I think Lady Bird absolutely nails this concepts and creates some genuinely funny, sad, and real-life scenes that hit home with the audience and make us fall in love with the characters. At one point in the film, Christine says that she just wants to live through something, and what she fails to realize, is that she is living through something. We all are. She's living through lots of things. It just never feels that way when you're the one living through it."
LADY BIRD,1 June 2020,7/10,"Angus1 - A good film but oh I do despise these bloody arty-farty endings. On her arrival in NY she goes a bit mad and drinks herself into a stupor ending up in hospital (silly things we do when we're young eh!). Next day, probably with a thumping hangover, she goes into a church, has some kind of epiphany (about who she realy is?), walks out and the film ends. Go figure it out yourself.. Oh f... off!
And what next, did she go to college? how did she get on? does it matter?
There has been talk of a sequel... maybe!"
LADY BIRD,3 January 2019,8/10,"This film is every bit as funny as the trailer promises. Lady Bird is such an amazing, strong, quirky character and this drives the film, even when the storyline doesn't."
LADY BIRD,7 March 2018,6/10,"I adore Saoirse Ronan. I heard the critical praise. I expected to be awed or at least super-charmed. I was not. 
Imo, covers essentially same territory as the superior 'Ghost World.' With the exception of a more complex daughter-Mom conflict. Best performance in film, I think, was by Laurie Metcalf. 
Saoirse did a fine job (though appeared about 8-10yrs too old to be a HS student.) Timothée Chalamet was charming but Casey-Affleck-in-'Manchester' void of emotion. 
It was.. fine. Just.. fine."
LADY BIRD,22 September 2020,9/10,The emotions in this film are probably the strongest points of this movie. The performances are all well played and find a great balance in the dramedy of this. Probably my favourite film in 2017.
LADY BIRD,20 October 2018,10/10,The best song placed into the best part of the film. You look to be inspired by films. You look for those moments that define life. This film gives you just that. It's about who you are and when you become you.
LADY BIRD,28 November 2017,9/10,"Lady Bird is an excellent coming of age story. It's full of love, realistic, yet vibrant characters, and attention to detail that makes every scene colorful. Greta Gerwig's film goes by at a rapid pace. The editing is stylish; scenes jump from a moment's climax to the middle of the fallout in the next, giving the audience more than enough to understand the weight of the situation while not bogging down the movie with rehashed platitudes present in the genre. The dialogue is witty and funny without being too cheesy, realistic without edging on dull. These are characters that feel familiar, but never become caricatures. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Matcalf are simply outstanding in their roles as daughter and mother. While the writing is top-notch, the performances are equally astute.Lady Bird doesn't hit on a singular theme, or build up to a specific moment, but it's like a collection of vignettes in the life of our main character. Many situations are ones we've come to expect in a film like this: the first boyfriend/love, applying to and getting accepted into college, losing one's virginity, senior prom. None of these singular moments gets as much plot time in Lady Bird as they might in other high school films, but we feel the weight of how they affect the main character all the same. Much of Lady Bird's beauty is presented without the need to be explained or put into words. Discovering the love of a place, of family, of experiences, are human themes that, when done well, will never get old. A small montage of mother and daughter enjoying a day visiting various open houses packs an emotional punch that can only be felt in the context of their relationship and situation. Marion (Metcalf) breaking down in the car after dropping Christine (Ronan) off at the airport is so simple, yet one of the most powerful performances of the year. It happens organically, and is deserved because of how much tenderness and care is put into the character development up until that point. Lady Bird tells an honest story about different forms of love. It's one of the better movies of 2017."
LADY BIRD,6 April 2018,5/10,"LADY BIRD
Drama/Comedy - No spoilers - Somewhat bored artistically inclined teen comes of age, kinda, in Sacramento. Screenplay - Only mediocre, characters are kept pretty much as one-dimensional foils for the lead throughout the film. Thought it difficult to like or relate to the self absorbed, selfish, adolescent Lady Bird character much. What you see in the first 10 minutes pretty much sets up the entire story. The drama is mostly of Lady Bird's own doing. There is some character arc by the final credits but by then I've long since lost interest and don't care. 
Overall an ok effort but cannot comprehend the multiple Oscar nominations and other assorted accolades associated with this film. It's just not anywhere near that good."
LADY BIRD,18 February 2018,8/10,"This film is a rich story, perfectly told. I'm not sure this is an important film, it doesn't represents a new direction in the art or engage with issues that haven't received sufficient attention in cinema, but it is a wonderful movie nevertheless.The wonder of it is that Lady Bird herself is ordinary: energetic, ambitious in her way, but not exceptionally so. She comes from a family that's not wealthy, but nor are they desperately poor. They're just an ordinary middle class family with young adult children. With humour, perfect plotting, excellent characterisation and brilliant acting, every ounce of beauty, profundity and entertainment is wrung out of this ordinary story of an ordinary girl.So maybe, in the context of its creation, this film does represent a new direction. There has been a growing movement to produce more films about women, by women, starring women. Of course there have been women auteurs before, but Lady Bird might just be the first slip in an avalanche of films by women telling women's stories on women's terms. If so, it's a tremendously exciting and rewarding start."
LADY BIRD,21 June 2020,5/10,"Lady Bird is starred and directed by some of the most promising Hollywood stars. The director portray the end of adolescence and the beginning of the adult life stresses very naturally, almost perfectly. The main actress Saoirse Ronan currently with 26 years old already have four oscars nominations, and how expected delivers an amazing acting with this movie."
LADY BIRD,21 July 2021,9/10,"As an avid Saorise Ronan AND Greta Gerwig fan, this film did not disappoint. The relationship the two women have created organically through working together really proves to their advantage in this movie.This film along with Greta Gerwig's Little Women shows how much potential women have to conquer this industry.As a 2nd year film student, it is kind of weird to see such a stereotype in real life, where the majority of my peers are men. There is an unspoken superiority in the classroom, where the men believe they just simply know more than the women. Ladybird has a personality that likes to prove that wrong, and so does this movie.I love this film because of its honesty, organic feel and raw story. The journey Ladybird goes through to find her self and her true identity is relatable to any teenager around the world. We struggle to find what makes us, us. And what makes us unique from the 9 billion other people in this world.Ladybird is not just a silly name that Christine uses as a mask, but its the representation of individuality and the struggle it is to be individualistic.Everyone is different but everyone is the same.We are who we are, human."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2020,6/10,"I think I can see the apeal of this movie for some people, which is why I rate it 6 stars rather than 5, but I personally felt to detatched from the subject matter. I've not been a part of most of the ""teenage"" stuff that happens, and I've never had such a rocky relationship with my parent, or an identity-crisis, nor do I really know anyone who has, at least openly so that I could see it or were confided in, so I couldn't relate to anything that happened on screen. it didn't help that, as a Swede, the american School/College system is complete and utter gibberish to me."
LADY BIRD,26 June 2018,9/10,Lady Bird is a coming-of-age drama/comedy which is so personal it immerses you to the character's frame of mind from minute one until the credits roll.
LADY BIRD,1 February 2018,,"A disgruntled teenager who cheats, lies and disrespects her parents and has mostly selfish friends and I paid to watch them? Guess I wasn't in the hip demographic at which this was aimed. Some good acting, nice directorial debut and some humorous moments, but these don't save the whole picture."
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,8/10,"This is a story almost every girl can relate to. A story about growing up, love, mum-dramas and friendships. And putting it all together, it made a film of finding yourself and lessons life teaches.With this delicate touch of humour and very likeable characters it is a dreamy piece of cinema, performed by very young director who proudly represents women in this year's directing category. Crossed fingers for Greta although my heart belongs to del Toro (The Shape of Water in next part). She is also responsible for the screenplay, which is based on her own adolescence, according to what I've read somewhere.Anyway, Lady Bird is a smartass, who is brave enough to dream outside her small world of Sacramento. She fights for her future even when the whole world doesn't believe she could win. This is a film of finding values in life and searching for a place. Furthermore, it is not so heavy like other Best Pictures. It is fun to watch, to breath a little and maybe just remind yourself about your own high school. The humour here is situational and very subtle.What brings a lot to this film are also actors. Saoirse Ronan is expectional, which is a great compliment from me (The Host was lame). However this category is very strong this year, she did deserved her nomination. The background is very strong, too, though. Laurie Metcalf is a mom having all these mother values and flaws. She is a strong woman who fights her best for her children. It is a year for mums, right?Some good small characters played by Timothee Chalamet (nominated for Call Me By Your Name) or Lucas Hedges (also in Three Billboards) are also noticeable. Everyone has a personality, everyone has a meaning. It is not just empty background to fill up the film. Sacramento is living on its own.My sort of favourite is Beanie Feldstein (picture below). She didn't have such glamorous acting past but I enjoyed Julie very much. I wish her luck and more good roles in the future."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2018,8/10,"Good acting, entertaining, and with a riskier message in today's Hollywood. That is: that the Catholic church/school may not be all that bad and family & home can be a good thing.I didn't give it a 9 since the producer/director decided there needed to be more sacrilegious and sexual content to appease those that would oppose the ""risky"" message.Seems like a good opportunity for a female director to land the ""Best Director"" Oscar."
LADY BIRD,9 January 2018,8/10,"Lady Bird isn't the typical 'coming-of-age movie' that you would expect upon hearing that term. It tells the story of a teenager who struggles to find her place in her surroundings and questions omnipresent themes such as wealth or sexuality. Nothing special, right?Indeed, what the movie tells of isn't too much of a revelation. Nothing we haven't seen before in other movies of that type.
What makes Lady Bird better is the acting, first and foremost. There are absolutely no flaws to notice in the cast's performance on screen. Everybody, from Saoirse Ronan as the protagonist to every little side character, delivers an astoundingly perfect performance. Some of the most impressive acting i've seen in a while. Especially the fact that these people master the roles of completely ""normal"", real-life people so well impresses me. Nice work, really.Another good thing about the movie is that (partly because of the acting) the characters are very likeable, each on their own. Combined with Greta Gerwig's very real, yet still witty and never boring script, it makes for a very endearing movie overall. You can instantly relate to characters as soon as they come on screen and throughout the film, you start to care about them, moreso than in other movies.Now comes the part that made me vote a 7 and not a 10, and I do know that it's very subjective and maybe not perfectly righteous. Anyways:
As the film progresses, I felt (especially in the last third) an increasing feeling of confusion or irritation when I was trying to understand or rationalise the characters' actions. Now, I know that the protagonist is a teenager and the state of confusion or the sometimes random-seeming decisions and feelings are probably intentionally portrayed that way, but I still think one could have gotten across that particular point of uncertainty in a less boring and more understandable way - even while visually remaining with the confusing theme. The way it was eventually done almost got me bored at certain points where I really lost track of what's going on for a few minutes. One good thing, though, is that after these minutes, there was often a line or a shot that pulled me back into the action, which made me finish the movie on a decently positive note.Lastly, camera, sound and visuals are appropriate for this kind of movie. It's quiet, no huge effects or crazy camera movement, in other words just perfectly suited for the genre.So to conclude this review:
I loved the acting, I liked the screenplay and how relatable and loveable the characters are.
Despite it perhaps being intentional, I didn't like the state of confusion that creeps upon the screen and the dialogues towards the end of the movie. Also, the fact that Lady Bird starts, runs and ends without context or some sort of epilogue, adds to that confusion as we don't have any background to justify certain decisions in the movie."
LADY BIRD,12 July 2018,10/10,"Greta Gerwig's profound understanding of human subtleties and relationships results in a masterfully crafted script filled with people and experiences that we feel we know intimately, but none of which that feel cliché. Her direction with tone and pacing creates a unique constant teetering between snarky and sincere, laughs and tears, which amounts to a truly satisfying cinematic experience that hits all the right notes.Lady Bird is about a girl growing up, but it is just as much about a mom letting go, and that dual perspective tug-of-war tension is what hoists it above traditional coming-of-age genre stories. It takes place in a specific time, but there is a timeless quality to the dialogue that relies on situational and observational humor above cheap pop culture references or one-liners that you definitely see in other millennial comedies. All signs point to this movie aging as well as any from 2017, and very well could be remembered as one of this generation's defining classics in 50+ years."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird is a film that manages to deliver what it wants, it is not a movie out of the line or incredible, it is a simple and well done film. Greta Gerwig did very well in both the script and the direction (which for the first time is magnificent). She managed to portray the life of a pre-adult very well, problems, loves, difficulties and sadness. The relationship between mother and daughter is so funny, so well executed by the actresses that it has a chemistry so timely and so difficult to find. Direction of the actors is also very good, every feeling of the characters is well past.
In the end, it's a very beautiful and exciting film, congratulations to Greta Gerwig."
LADY BIRD,29 April 2018,10/10,"I was completely owed all along, i loved every dialogue, the characters are so very well pictured, every nuanced sense of humour spoke to me clearly, like if it was my own life in the movie. it's another girl-coming-of-age movie, like girl interrupted or also and Ghost World- which was equally absolutely great. I was thrown in a kaleidoscope of memories, moments i lived, situations, things i wish i had done differently. CHristine/lady bird is definitely a lot more smart than i was at that age, and to my children i will teach to always be outspoken, to always say what you think, never to be ashamed of your own thoughts. I will never forget this film, it will always stay with me."
LADY BIRD,28 July 2019,9/10,"This is hands down,one of the most best movies of this decade.This coming of age story is simply a blast to watch.The acting in this movie is just stellar.The direction is also excellent.The main Protagonist of this movie,Lady Bird is very well written and her evolution from a girl trying to came to age,to a young indipented woman is just amazing.Also her mother,and her relationship with Lady Bird is one of the best things in this movie.Everyone have perfect chemistry with each other,and it is such a blast watching this characters inderact.This movie has flaws,yes,but I don't really won't to find them."
LADY BIRD,14 January 2021,2/10,"Lady Bird is an absolutely overrated movie. This is the kind of film that has been made a dozen times in Europe (especially in Germany) and way better. There are two good scenes only, the first is a meeting about abortion the second is a clash between mother and daughter where the latter asks her to write down the expenses of her childhood so that as an adult she can pay her back. That's about it, all the other stuff is just the usual Hollywood nonsense with the usual awful music, the stereotype fat girlfriend, the musician boyfriend (by the way only an idiot could think that he is a virgin), the ""very"" believable bra-on sex scene and endless copying of Woody Allen (see Frances Ha, a shameless Manhattan rip-off). Nothing new, nothing original but lucky for Greta, she is the new favourite of the Academy. Itwould be time for her to write something original."
LADY BIRD,22 January 2018,10/10,At some point the portrayal of the Mother Daughter relationship was so real that I saw my own mother and sister fight their fight like yesterday. The portrayals of a teen growing up and getting to terms with the world are done so well that you feel for every character from start to finish. The story grips you and shakes you around with some strange emotions you kinda wished you didn't have. Saoirse Ronan is excellent and gripping. Her emotions flows so smoothly that even Lady Birds sexual experience and acceptance of it is so realistic and almost under-dramatized. This is exactly what makes the film so great.
LADY BIRD,12 April 2019,9/10,"Perfect acting and lively script which captured the real-life tensions between age and class, surrounded by an offbeat teenage comedy. The lead is entirely lovable and so is everyone in the end. It's a hella tight Boyhood for girls that is to say I related to it because deals with the American adolescence in the Bush-era."
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,8/10,"Absolutely loved it, this is exactly the kind of movie that I enjoy.You can feel the creative spirit, that everyone was passionate and cared about this project, such a rare thing these days. ""Lady Bird"" is unique, quirky, funny, moving. If you like movies for being art and for being human and real. If you want a movie that isn't about brainless explosions and action. If you want a movie that makes you think and question and reflect. If all of those things sound good, then this movie is for you. There's something so special about the rare art of mid-budget indie films. It's the 1 in a 1000 movies that I always want/try to find. It has that magic that I feel when watching a Wes Anderson film for example or Amèlie, etc. I can't quite describe it in words. Just different. Good different.Really curious what's next in store for Greta Gerwing (director/writer). Would love to see her land some huge project, as a result, perhaps something like Captain Marvel? She'd be perfect. 
It makes me really happy seeing this movie get all the praise and set/break all the records for female directors and writers!!! I wish this film wasn't in a limited release because more people need to go see it!Finally, my suggestion would be: don't read anything about it (ironic), don't watch the trailer, just go in blind as I did (or knowing as little as possible). That's truly the best way to experience movies like this."
LADY BIRD,15 February 2018,8/10,"The tremendous work and artistic ability of Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird tells a story that feels like you have either lived this story or know someone that has. Lady Bird has such a relatable story, where you are observing the life of a young teenage girl traversing the struggles of life both at home and at school. Gerwig's story is something that can be considered funny, enlightening, dramatic, sad, crazy, but overall it's relatable. Telling a story about life is as much of a human story as you can get, something that touches us so closely to our hearts. Any teenager, young adult, or even grown adult can see something in this story that feels real to us or have/can happen to just about anyone."
LADY BIRD,12 April 2021,8/10,"Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird, although having a very obvious issue with tone and the over-reliance of beats, manages to craft an almost fully original teen comedy that focuses on some ideas that are foreign to this particular sub-genre. It took about half an hour until the film really grasped onto a specific tone that it was so desperately trying to have. However, once it found its footing, Lady Bird took off with awkward humor in a hilarious manner. Besides a few occurrences of Gerwig granting characters random moments of flair that lacked any sort of set-up, the film's usage of its Catholic high school setting avoided being fully cliche through its absurd and blatant awkwardness that was 100% played for comedy. Still though, it often attempted to provide commentary on the setting that unfortunately fell flat and ended up embracing the cliches altogether. It's a good thing that this wasn't a problem for the entirety of the film. Anyways, ignoring the movie's inevitable cliches, the only other miniscule mistakes that I found within the narrative were found in its aforementioned reliance on introducing character aspects that are only explored once. How is Lady Bird a senior and doesn't know that her school has a theater department? Why was Miguel so upset when she insulted his piercings? Would he not have already thought of the possibility that they would hinder him from getting certain jobs? Miguel seemed like a fairly intelligent guy, so if you're going to establish his ignorance of this fact, set it up instead of introducing it out of nowhere. You're telling me that Lady Bird went EIGHTEEN YEARS without knowing that her father suffered from depression? Finally, what was the point in her getting a random nosebleed when she lost her virginity? Anyways, give the film a watch. There are a few mistakes. However, it has enough originality that ends up spinning the teen comedy sub-genre onto its head to provide commentary on its cliches.81% or 8.1/10."
LADY BIRD,26 November 2017,9/10,"Much has been said about this movie being a story of a mother (played by Laurie Metcalf) and her daughter ""Lady Bird"" (played by Saoirse Ronan). It's true that their relationship is a central theme in this ""dramedy"" but it is also a story of a father and his daughter. Lady Bird's father (played by Tracy Letts) is loving, gentle, sympathetic and sensitive to the changes in Lady Birds life. Even though he is going through some very tough times himself (depression & unemployment), his support for his daughter never waivers and we see him providing the emotional stability that Lady Bird desperately needs during her curious, awkward and turbulent high school years. Just as it seems her life is seeing some sunshine, unexpected events knock her back down again. However, Lady Birds incredibly positive spirit picks her up and puts her right back in the game. She refuses to let embarrassment or hard times rob her of the best years of her life and I think the audience is right their on the sidelines cheering her on. Greta Gerwig's script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is superb. Lady Birds story does not demand as much of Saoirse Ronan as her incredible role in Brooklyn (robbed of the many awards it truly deserved). But Saoirse nailed this role leaving no stone unturned with her great American accent, and wonderful sense of comedic timing."
LADY BIRD,18 December 2017,5/10,"OK, folks. If you're going to read one review of this film. Read mine. Why? Cause I tell it like it is and I don't heap praise on anything unless it's truly justified. Reviewers like to say that Gerwig's take on ""coming of age"" is somehow fresh, with a steady stream of humor, heart, and honesty. Well, it's not fresh. Hardly. Yes, there is humor, heart, and honesty. But it doesn't merit the stupendous accolades this film is getting. I saw this picture with my wife who definitely had her issues with her mother growing up in a rural town and while she could relate with Lady Bird, it was like, so what? In the end, do I ultimately care so much about Lady Bird? No, I don't. She's amusing. She's smart. She's funny. And in the end, I'll forget about her weeks and months down the road because she's like many other rebels who have come before her and who will come after her. Contrivances about in this movie. The fat girlfriend, the closet gay boyfriend, the get drunk let's have sex moment..I mean, come on. Talk about cliche!The acting is uniformly excellent. I actually liked the father who got some of the least screen time of all. He was an excellent counterpoint to the bitchiness of Lady Bird's mother. The movie DRAGS towards the end, where there are a number of moments where the movie could have and should have ended. There was ZERO need to show Lady Bird calling home from college after getting drunk and throwing up. It adds NOTHING to the movie or Lady Bird's character. A more appropriate ending would have been Lady Bird finishing off her time at high school. I don't think Gerwig knew exactly when and how to end this film because she had to stretch it to get to 90 minutes and I think she shot some of these ending scenes to help her get to the finish line. Every movie needs that opening inciting incident within the first 20 minutes. Greta has done enough films to know that and she smartly has Lady Bird jump out of a moving car to create a heightened sense of drama between her and her mother who were both arguing about what college she should attend. It sets the tone early about the tempestuous relationship between the two. Gerwig knows what she's doing in constructing a screenplay but this story doesn't have a lot going for it. Sacramento is WHO CAREsville. This could have been filmed in any other WHO CARESville town. A relationship between a mother and daughter - it's just not enough to make you care. In the end, this is a so-so picture and does not merit all of the praise it's been getting. This movie is not different from other coming of age movies with the exception of the writing and I give credit to Gerwig for her skill when it comes to crafting dialogue. But it's not enough to save this movie. When I watch a movie that I love, I can't wait to purchase the DVD. I will not be purchasing Lady Bird as part of my movie DVD collection. Does not merit repeat reviewing."
LADY BIRD,19 March 2020,3/10,"This was a well written, well acted, indie-esk movie in which every plot point has been done a thousand times and is exactly what you expect. Even so, it was pretty good and a fun watch. Until the ending.
If people could stop making movies about how your abusive parents probably love you, that would be great. The final scenes legitimized abuse in a stockholm-esk way. I think the way Christine says ""I'm sorry for wanting more, for wanting to better myself"" sums it up nicely. And then the ending obliterated every good point it had made previously by interjecting a ""moral message"" and ""old time value"" that equates to victim shaming."
LADY BIRD,12 March 2020,8/10,"I loved almost every aspect of it, all the performances, were great I loved the main characters and I never wanted it to end I loved the relationship between mother and daughter. This movie probably affected me more then most due to the fact I watched it while waiting to here back from NYU."
LADY BIRD,11 June 2020,7/10,Good story. Coming of age story. Would recommend. Would watch multiple times.
LADY BIRD,29 August 2018,1/10,"Your usual teenage daily life. Good acting by the mother, but otherwise nothing to see that you haven't already lived through. Fighting with parents, ditching plain best friend for popular girl to get the popular boy, can't even remember the rest. Yawn."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,6/10,Not a great addition to the 'coming of age'/'touching comedy' genre which has so many great movies e.g The Perks of being a Wallflower. Ronan is miscast in a role that would have better suited an American. Gerwig herself would have been perfect had she been younger. Lady Bird is not on the same level as the gender and sexual opposite - though similarly themed Call me by Your name or even 2016's 20th Century Women which Gerwig was delightful in. You'll be struggling to recall this movie next year.
LADY BIRD,8 August 2018,9/10,I can't give Lady Bird a 10. The acting and script is excellent and I love the setting. The Catholic school is quirky and fun and the year 2002-2003 is a great year for the conversations they have about 9/11 and the war. But the film sometimes feels artificial and don't make me explain why I feel that way. It's also dream-like and fast moving when I feel it could have slowed down and gotten a less quirky tone. Overall the best parts are when the daughter and mom are talking and the scenes of Lady Bird hanging out with her theater friends it's breathtaking how well those scenes are portrayed. 9/10 has some slow moments that could have been trimmed and some short moments that could have been lengthened.
LADY BIRD,5 October 2018,8/10,"This was such a good film. The main actress, is so captivating. I love the dynamics between each character and the relationship between the mother and daughter it was really realistic ad on point. I high recommend this movie."
LADY BIRD,19 February 2019,9/10,"You have to really appreciate this movie in order to realize that it is a masterpiece. A coming of age film that is portrayed perfectly in every single way. It is incredibly unique, funny, and memorable, and will move you once you immerse yourself into it. Give it a chance."
LADY BIRD,16 February 2019,8/10,I love coming of age films and this is up there with the best. What truly makes this film brilliant is Saoirse Ronan in the titular role. I've been watching Ronan ever since Atonement way back in 2007 and thought the Lovely Bones was and still is her best role but she is phenomenal in this film. She truly shines through and makes you feel as if you are watching a 17 year old Ronan herself. Even better when you consider she wanted to portray the role with acne because she was playing a teenager. Laurie Metcalf was also brilliant and was shocked to find out she didn't win any awards for Best Supporting Actress.100% recommend.
LADY BIRD,4 April 2021,1/10,"On my pay per view summary of published hollywood critics the collective wisdom of these working professionals puts this film at 99%This is the best example of the ideological sound bubble that these people live in. While some of the performances were good, this film is by far the most over rated film in the last few years.Looking a bit deeper into the themes that they appreciated like a gay kid that comes out and religious conformity....these are not brave anymore, it's cliche and lazy.Producers that want to continue to appease these critics need to decide if they want to return to the entertainment industry or continue to dumb us down with curated info-tainment which always drops the quality of the content at large.4/10."
LADY BIRD,23 September 2021,7/10,"Acting was great and the story will definitely resonate with some people. I don't find it relatable personally, but I still really like this story."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2018,5/10,"Please somebody tell me why I should like three lauded films from the last four years, namely, Boyhood, Moonlight, and Lady Bird.Regarding the latter: At second favourite to land the Oscar I watched 40 minutes of it and was going to go to bed early - at least it wasn't the three hours that I wasted waiting for Boyhood to spring into life.The thing is, there are so many alternatives. Saoirse Ronan? Watch Brooklyn, Wrong side of the tracks in the US? Watch the blisteringly funny, informative, and engaging I Tonya (and go Alison Janney for Best Supporting Actress). Fantasy? Watch Wonderwoman, as good a DC/Marvel film as has been yet released, absolutely repairing and polishing the dull flaws of Batman v Superman (And please don't tell me that Lady Bird is not complete utter and total fantasy). Love? Their Finest, The Shape Of Water. Comedy? The Disaster Artist. Cinematography (The Shape Of Water again - what a film). I have not even watched Dunkirk, The Post or a number of new films yet. Three Billboards OEM is deservedly hot favourite to win the Oscar, it is just everything you would expect from Martin McDonagh v The Coen brothers featuring Micky Knox broke good, Tyrion Lannister, Marge Gunderson's alternate self and the truly watchable Sam Rockwell doing what he does best even better, but please (back to Lady Bird), whoever it is that cannot recognise an appeal to some idealised sassy existence that you will never have and nobody ever had, stop fobbing us off with these imaginary bildungsromans, especially ones which try to engender some pity for Yanks who live in houses bigger than mine and have never walked to the shop.I'm sorry if this seems harsh, I have tried to offer positive alternatives. It is by no means uneasy on the eye, but we live in an age when we are saturated with great media to rise above, and, just like David Copperfield, it just seems a little self indulgent as a self-penned hagiography."
LADY BIRD,18 February 2018,4/10,"There is no story! only teen cliches . I wanted to see this movie due to the all the nominations and the talking , but it was a waste of time.
If you still want to see it , wait for the blue ray release, such a boring"
LADY BIRD,15 January 2020,2/10,"The only reason this movie got 2 stars was because the actors were all great. I can't fault the acting. Other than that it's a 0 star story. It's mind numbingly boring, and the main is a terrible person who I felt zero empathy for and resented that I was supposed to."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,3/10,"I always wondered if there are companies out there that movie producers pay to post many good reviews. this movie proves they exist. the most boring movie ever, and yet has 8+ rating? makes no sense. maybe it is just a woman movie made by a woman for women? But even my wife couldn't sit through after 40 min and said it is unwatchable. So it can't be that. Lots of gratuitous vulgarity doesn't make a movie better by the way. someone should tell that to the directory. the movie just keeps going from one scene to another with no rhyme or reason as if just trying to fill blank space. I would give it less than 3 stars, but i suppose there are 1 and 2 star movies out there."
LADY BIRD,17 February 2018,6/10,So i just saw lady bird and i thought for the most part it was pretty good if i had to give it a score out of 10 i would give it a 7 all out while the film did do some things pretty good there were other things that bothered me but let me say what this film did well for one it had pretty good cinematography the acting was well done especially our main lead and everyone else held their own quite nicely and if anything the film did have heart and the characters were likeable now for the not so good parts for one there were some characters who didn't really have much going for them and yea i get it's about the main character but it seems weird to me that some characters were 1 dimensional also some of the scenes seemed weirdly paced i don't know if it was just me but some scenes just seemed off to me also when it comes to the story it does come across a bit predictable at times but at the same time i found myself just not really worrying about but the last thing i feel the need to criticize this film for is something that isn't really the films fault but i felt like mentioning and that being the fact that this film is nominated for best picture while this film is pretty good i find it weird that blade runner 2049 wasn't nominated for best picture at all and it's weird to me because i feel blade runner 2049 is a much better film in story pacing characters directing and cinematography and when you see the media praising lady bird it's mainly for the fact that it's directed and written by a women more than it's story and characters and i get that the topic is quite touchy but i felt it should be mentioned doesn't affect my opinion on the film but something i find interesting. Now that being said i still think the film is worth recommending if you think you will like it i am sure you will like it if you think you won't like it then you might not if you want to try then give it a go lady bird 7/10
LADY BIRD,11 October 2018,10/10,I don't feel I need to write too much here except to say you must watch this movie. I am a middle-aged man and yet I still felt I knew exactly how Lady Bird felt. It's so well written and crafted that everyone I was with imagined themselves back in their childhood. Exquisite filmmaking and absolutely well worth a watch.
LADY BIRD,7 April 2018,9/10,"This was perfect to watch with my spouse, who prefers low-stress movies. It's a conventional coming-of-age story, but with awesome writing and a charming protagonist. The story focuses on Lady Bird's social and romantic experimentation, as well as her relationship with her mother. The social dynamics are familiar: (1) abandon dorky friend for new popular friend; (2) become disenchanted with popular friend; and (3) reunite with dorky friend. Her love life is more captivating, particularly the scenes with Lucas Hedges who is excellent. When his character is discovered in a homosexual infidelity, the film both recognizes Lady Bird's pain while also showing compassion to Hedges' character. This culminates in a beautiful moment when Lady Bird forgives and comforts her ex-boyfriend.The dynamic between Lady Bird and her mother is the most unconventional aspect of the story. Often, coming-of-age stories seem designed to remind us how unfair we were to our parents during our adolescence. But Lady Bird's mother is truly horrible. Practically admitting that you don't like your child? Not speaking to your child over trivial nonsense? Not getting out of your car to say goodbye as your child flies away to college? That's inexcusable. In the end, she does nothing to deserve forgiveness, and Lady Bird grants it anyway. In this way, the film provides a unique validation to currently suffering teenagers and adults who are often made to question whether their parents' awfulness during adolescence was real or imagined."
LADY BIRD,18 May 2018,9/10,"This coming of age movie is finely written and directed by Greta Gerwig. She loosely bases the story on her own experiences growing up in Sacramento. The main character, Christine, is 17 years old and calls herself « Lady Bird ». I like her free spirit. Saoirse Ronan fully embodies the role, bringing her energy and her sense of humor. She gives a great performance, as does Laurie Metcalf. Both actresses perfectly capture the complex relationship between a mother and her daughter. The rest of the cast is also good, especially Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet who play the boyfriends. The scenes with them are indeed funny and colorful. This bittersweet comedy deserves to be seen. It's a refreshing portrayal of teenage life."
LADY BIRD,4 June 2018,10/10,This movie was very relatable in so many ways. It is emotional and inspiring but also manages to have some humor. In my opinion Lady Bird should have stayed with her mother. She was not ready to be alone in the city. Also she was very mean to her friends and is an attention hog. Lady Bird needs to spend her time in the city fixing her attitude.
LADY BIRD,14 December 2018,7/10,"It was truly good. It's a nice break from all the Hollywood bull**** that's constantly been thrown in my face. This was a nice coming-of-age story. I did however, feel a little underwhelmed. More than once I glanced at the time to see when it would be ending.So it's good but I don't think I'll ever watch it again."
LADY BIRD,3 June 2019,7/10,"Irritatingly angsty. I would not describe this movie as fresh or relatable. Unfortunately this movie is layered with bland, unlikeable characters. As much as I wanted to like it, it just never hit the mark."
LADY BIRD,29 August 2020,7/10,"Greta Gerwig's portrayal of young semi-hip, unique white people is always just ok in substance, but a better in flavor. Following the loves and letdowns of a teenage Catholic school girl trying to get into college in NYC. It's packed with suburban teen angst, through a warm and fuzzy Andersonian lens. The characters feel real, and more nuanced than others, and it overall does a good job of capturing the feeling of being young and misunderstood, yet misunderstanding everything around you. The acting is great, the cinematography is great, it's a nice movie, albeit not something that makes you feel any depth of emotion."
LADY BIRD,18 February 2021,7/10,"I love this movie but i got a little bored. i think it has to do more with my attention span then the movie so yk.
also Saoirse Ronan is gorgeous and im in love with her"
LADY BIRD,2 September 2020,6/10,"I dont understand all the hype around Lady Bird. It's a movie but not that good. It has a good acting a directing but in my opinion it is not different from many other similar movies out there.
It's just a good movie of a girl finishing highschool and dreaming on moving away from her city....
Sorry but I can't recommend it to anyone. It's just a movie, another movie."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,8/10,"When i read Anne Frank's memoirs, there were so many comparisons I could draw from a jew girl during second world war and Indian youth who's been imposed with many restrictions. Lady Bird evoked similar feelings.Lady Bird centers around a teenager, Christine Mcpherson, named christine by her parents hut prefers to be addressed as Lady Bird. Her father working in a company which is constantly laying off many employees, her mother is working rigorously to make her ends meet. Her brother is working in a mall and lives with her girlfriend. Lady bird constantly feels that she is superior than most, feels ashamed of financial status of her family. Her mother constantly keeps telling her that she's ungrateful and ignorant about plight of her family. She constantly feels she's destined for bigger things and her background, surroundings keep pulling her down.She finds a cute boy who happens to be very rich, he turns out to be gay who hasn't come out of closet yet. She then starts hanging out with a popular girl, distancing her best friend in process. She meets kyle who talks about utopian concepts of having no money, having exotic dreams etc. She ends up losing her virginity to him, which is obviously a big deal for her, however her first time is quite underwhelming, she also finds out that kyle lied about being virgin. She quickly realizes that life which she always found intriguing isn't all what it seems, all that glittered wasn't gold. And she realizes who're really important for her, who'll stand by her in the real tough times, why she should embrace her family.As it goes in hindi, Khaya piya aish kiya!However above line could not be farther from the truth, just because of sheer treatment of the film, because every character looks like people you know, you can see Mrs Mcpherson in nagging mother of your friend, you can see a kyle in your newsfeed having a DSLR camera, not once this film gets melodramatic, you can believe that this things are said/done by real people, some of the scenes, moments stay with you even after a week and you ponder over it. (I watched it 10-12 days back)This film does leaves you yearning why does not hindi cinema make such films, why does a person need to relate with a girl in sacramento, why does a person needs to draw parallels between middle class in third world country and white trash in USA?India have had some attempts but most compromise on genuineness in exchange of melodrama!"
LADY BIRD,26 August 2020,2/10,"This meandering mess of a feelgood coming of age movie is a waste of good acting talent and decent cinematography. The girl is from the ""wrong side of the tracks"". Upper middle class professional parents, nice house, private school, private psychotherapy to deal with your non-existent problems. Wished I lived on those side of the tracks. I feel sorry for American teenagers having to put up with films like this. Those teenagers like my relatives, living in normal houses with parents with normal jobs. 60% of Americans earn less than $40k before stoppages, and could never afford the lifestyle of this spoilt brat. I read somewhere that teenage audiences cheered every time Freddy Krueger finished off one of the spoilt teenagers in ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", as the audience couldn't identify with teenagers with their own cars, going to decent schools, supported through college etc.
I was praying for a Freddy to put paid to ""Lady Bird"". That would have livened up this nauseating pile of sentimental garbage. How did it get such a good rating here?"
LADY BIRD,29 December 2017,9/10,"Movies affect us in different ways.
I've met people who didn't like Lady Bird and people who loved it, I could come up with a thousand excuses as to why I gave this movie a 9/10 but the truth is, I relate to it on a very personal level.
In fact, I was certain some parts of this movie were taken straight from my life story. Going to a religious school, having a sister and a mother that are exactly like the characters on this movie, seeing their arguments, it all took me back, having a very caring and sweet father who does not like to admit when he's feeling sad, all of that. I don't remember the last time I was sad because a movie ended. 
Honestly this movie could have been 4 hours long and I would still watch it. I did not want it to end. I was sad and happy at the same time when it did. When a movie makes you feel like that, when a movie makes you feel for the characters, when a movie touches you like this movie did, that's a sign of great cinema. It all felt very nostalgic and all I'm left with is the wish to go back in time.
The actors are of course amazing, they feel very real and the dialogue just flows like water.
Having a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes or a 20%, I feel like I would love this movie no matter what, that's the beauty of it all. It doesn't matter if it sucks for everyone else, what matters is how you feel while watching it, so watch it. Give it a try, it might awaken some memories from your past."
LADY BIRD,17 June 2018,3/10,"Lady Bird is an awful movie. If you think Juno has contrived dialogue, imagine the opposite: it seems that while Juno put too much thought into the writing, the writer/director of Ladybird put too little. It's so pointless and there's no hearty nostalgia to back it up. Everyone feels one dimensional, even when they change their minds. Everything feels flat and you see coming a mile away. There's nothing I can think of that makes the eventful moments of high school feel so uneventful, so I suppose that's an accomplishment. Saoirse Ronan's accent feels deliberately imitative of Lindsay Lohan, which isn't bad but isn't in any way natural. It feels contrived and like she's trying to be petulant when she doesn't have to be; even the character's flatlining doesn't make it worth her portrayal's brattiness. The bizarre, one-note reference to the Bay area slang ""hella"" is so off that it feels like no one, including the director/writer, is from the area, even though it seems she is. The father, portrayed by Tracy Letts, is so lovable, and probably the most well-rounded character of all. I feel Laurie Metcalf was underutilized here, and could have delivered so much more than a struggling, emotionally repressed and still aggressive character. The scene in which she ""emerges"" as being emotional is so contrived you want to roll your eyes.There's only so much to stomach, and I can say that within 30 minutes I thought it was almost over; it drags that much. As I said, where Juno is contrived, Lady Bird is lazy, and droning, and drowns out the growth and aging of adolescence."
LADY BIRD,6 June 2020,4/10,Boring movie. The female who plays Lady Bird is attractive in real life. Why did they make her look ugly and very unappealing in this movie?
LADY BIRD,28 March 2019,9/10,"I can't tell you exactly why I love this movie so much. I liked it when I saw it for the first time in the cinema a few weeks after the award season hype but it took some more time (and a rewatch) to realise how great this movie actually is.The character Lady Bird wants to stand out, she's eccentric and also very stubborn. Despite that she's very likeable and in many ways just like other girls at her age.
The movie itself is pretty much the opposite (in a very nice way):
Pleasant, modest and nothing seems to be very special or innovative, but somehow Lady Bird manages it to be an extraordinary Coming-Of-Age movie. It's authentic and it feels so real even if I'm not that familiar with the society in Sacramento/ the USA.We just can hope that this will be only the first of many great films directed by Greta Gerwig's directing. I'm really excited to see more from her and also from all the promising young actors in the movie like Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chamalet, Lucas Hedges and Beanie Feldstein. They're all amazing and I'm pretty sure that there are at least one or two future Oscar winners in this cast.If Lady Bird will be remembered as a film classic of this generation someday, I would be totally happy about it and (hopefully) still enjoy a 501st rewatch of this wonderful movie with this great atmosphere, all these sympathetic characters and the beautifully captured moments of a young womans life."
LADY BIRD,14 September 2019,9/10,"The movie is about a high school girl, who calls herself Lady Bird, who's about to turn eighteen, and how she wants to have a more exciting life. The movie takes several different directions throughout it's short runtime, but none of them feel out of place, each scene has value and something more to give to the story.
It's a hilarious, short, brilliant movie, and you'll find yourself laughing even during the more saddening scenes, while still feeling the emotional impact that the filmmakers wanted you to feel.The acting is superb, Saoirse Ronan delivers an extremely realistic performance, just like the rest of the cast members, and Greta Gerwig did a fantastic job with the script, which makes the conversations feels super natural. I'm glad that both women got nominated for Oscars that year.It's a great movie that might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'd recommend it to young people and some adults, especially parents, too."
LADY BIRD,13 May 2020,5/10,I don't know why this movie has so high rating. It was just okay. It didn't have something special
LADY BIRD,2 February 2018,5/10,"I wanted to love this movie after seeing such great reviews but it was just too slow, not very much happened, and was one of those movies that when it ended you were like ""it's over""?"
LADY BIRD,9 September 2021,9/10,"It's easy to see why this 2018 film received so many nominations at the Academy Awards, with the stellar Saoirse Ronan becoming a nominee for ""Best Actress"". Ronan's acting throughout the movie is believable, despite being a high school student the entire film. The character's traits, personality, and persona feel tailored to her, and the audience will be able to recognize characteristic features of themselves through her, no matter what age.This may be due to director Greta Gerwig's stellar skills, and application of her personal life into the film and it's premise. One thing this film does best is establishing fully dimensional characters in its short run time of an hour and 35 minutes. Each character feels relatable in one way or another, and the added humor in this film brings out a real joy and childlike quality that puts a twist on the classic coming of age film genre. The characters in this film are, most importantly, real. The feel less like molds of people and feel realistically based, encapturing all stages of the high school experience, good or bad.Is this film worth watching? Yes. Many times, yes. Greta Gerwig's directing through character storytelling, cinematography, and the added effects of humor, all work together in a blend to make this film feel as original as it's plot is."
LADY BIRD,13 November 2018,6/10,"I had a decent expectation for this film, considering the casting and overall reaction from it. I was underwhelmed.
I enjoyed the characters individually, and they had a roundness to their personalities that were well presented on screen. The mother-daughter dynamic is something we rarely see on screen and I'm glad it is emphasized in this movie. The colors of this movie was constant, and engaging in that sense. But, the thing is, all of these plots have been done before. I found nothing unique about this coming-of-age film, And maybe that is the whole point. To tell our story, instead of enlongating the truth to the point when it's inrelatable.
I am the age of Lady Bird, and I just found it rather.. boring overwall.
I recommend feeding your curiousity and still watching the film if you're intrigued with mixed reviews and Oscar nominations.
If you don't have 2 hours to spare out of your life to watch, dont."
LADY BIRD,31 March 2020,6/10,Ordinary story. Cinema must be impressive. Cinema you should lock you on the screen.
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,4/10,"Nothing to see here. A coming of age drama with nothing spectacular or distinguishing at all. It's mildly amusing and entertaining in part, but ultimately very forgettable. So many people seem to rate films based on script and acting. For me, this are a prerequisite and not a substitute to a good plot and something I have not seen over and over again. I guess you might say there are not so many girl coming of age dramas, perhaps this is why?"
LADY BIRD,24 February 2018,7/10,I enjoyed this movie... I wasn't sure what exactly to expect.The only thing I disliked was the final scene... I didn't feel it wasn't a worthy conclusion and didn't quite fit in my opinion.
LADY BIRD,20 December 2017,5/10,"After seeing and hearing so many rave reviews on this movie, my husband and I decided to use passes to go see it. Maybe our expectations were just set way too high going in after seeing this rated so highly by many friends and on here too, but it was not the caliber of movie we hoped it would be and definitely not worthy of a 10 in our opinions. It wasn't terrible, but it was severely lacking in a cohesive story line and realism, which I was not expecting to think given all the reviews of how ""relate-able"" and ""real"" the movie was. Maybe because it touched on teen sexuality from a female perspective is the reason it got so many great ""realistic!"" reviews? The acting was definitely where it shined. The tiny one or two bits of wisdom/learning moments and tiny tidbits of humor thrown in were great too. But other than that, it felt very forced and rushed, not ""real"" at all. The ending felt very out of place and rushed as well.We went in understanding it was a coming of age story about a girl in catholic school, but the plot line was just not cohesive enough IMO. It was overly dramatic at times (which sure, is some teen girl experiences, but at times it was too over the top to be believable because of other details the plot included). The overworked mom being a jerk to her got taken way too far to be believable given the other details in their story. The way they ended it did not make sense with the rest of the events and details. The best and most realistic characters for me were actually her adopted brother and his girlfriend. They would've made a more interesting ""coming of age"" movie in my opinion with lady bird playing an overly dramatic, whiny side sibling role."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,9/10,I considered stopping watching the film several times because I was waiting for a moment when everything lights up and it takes boredom out of the process of watching a film. It happened at the 34:11 minute mark. After that it was like watching another film. It brought tears to my eyes several times after that moment.
LADY BIRD,23 January 2018,9/10,"Why did I like it? cause its the right kind of girly. yes theres lots of cliches in it but so are our lives ...clichesfull. its just adorable. reminds me of a scene from the young pople.... the most simple of truths are the ones that make sense. 
why watch it? cause it feels good to.
 Saoirse Ronan is a mix between Lee Pace and Jenna Marbles!:)"
LADY BIRD,14 February 2018,,"The ""adventures"" of a teenager who doesn't get along with her name, her mother neither with the place where she lives. The film lasts an hour and a half that seemed like days. It's slow, tedious and boring. Without a doubt, an over-hyped movie that falls flat on its intent to realize a social commentary. Don't get carried away by paid reviews."
LADY BIRD,29 November 2020,1/10,"This movie is extremely overrated, anyone who says other wise is on the take or is extremely biased. This movie fells like the WNBA, a movement that nobody cares about rather than a sport. It's the same thing with this movie, there is nothing new in this movie, the acting is alright, the script is awful and the photography is really mediocre, critics only praised this movie because it was ""woke"". We should stop judging things by the gender of the director and characters and we should go back to the good old fashion method of judging a movie on its own merits"
LADY BIRD,15 April 2018,1/10,"Why so many people liked Lady Bird is beyond me. It's simply a movie about a spoiled brat applying for college fighting with her mom every five minutes.What critics saw as daring, I saw as pretentious.What some people call inventive I call it BORING.This person doesn't represent the millennial generation, she's a spoiled brat who needs a serious SPANKING that's all!Overall, I would rate Lady Bird as one of the most OVERRATED films I have ever seen!Definitely a 1 on a scale of 1-1'0."
LADY BIRD,26 February 2020,3/10,"I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to see it for a while. However, it didn't really work for me. There is no real conflict, just the usual coming out of age stuff plus a strict hard working mother and a goofy father. Heck, at least they are still together! And own a house, albeit on the wrong side of the tracks but like hello? After initial set-up, everything starts happening like a train going certain direction and sropping at certain stations. Things get kinda predictable very quickly (you'll see ;) ) and not in very engaging way. I like Saoirse's acting but in this case it was disappointing to see her underact, no real emotion actually, just playing her role. With her character's determination she could have given us so much more. Now, these things aside, the setting was more late 90's than early 00's. Without giving too much away, let's just say that I happened to be there at that time and I can't agree that it was depicted correctly. It's in the details but they do have to be believable for the story. Although some side characters are likable, the whole movie sets a question of 'why was it even made in the first place?' Dealing with the teenage topic, every adult should probably relate to this experience, therefore the movie should evoke some kind of emotion but sadly, it fails to do so profoundly. Seriously, there is not much that would make it interesting."
LADY BIRD,26 November 2020,10/10,"I remember the innocent and suspicious actor's innocent expression in atonement. At that time, I thought that the girl would be infatuated with the Hollywood audience in the future. It has been proved that she is a very studious and conscientious young actor."
LADY BIRD,15 August 2018,7/10,"I just finished watching Lady Bird. I saw the trailer and started watching it straight afterwards. This movie is unique, it has some unusual vibe to it.
The actors are amazing and the characters are interesting. 
But, this movie lacks something. I was trying to figure out what and I don't quite know what it is. maybe the plotline, maybe the pace. 
I do recommend it, but if you are expecting a HAHA comedy, don't watch it. it is more drama then comedy."
LADY BIRD,4 August 2020,9/10,"The movie had a great feel to it and being someone who is a huge fan of these types of movie, I can definitely say this is a must-see. The aesthetics are very pleasant and the way each character are made fit perfectly. It reminded me of my childhood."
LADY BIRD,28 January 2018,4/10,"I had high hopes for this one, but as in many cases, the trailer presents all the highlights and that's it...
The main character is a plain one, a typical teenager with typical teenage problems, nothing new there, better characters depicted elsewhere...
The mother character a bit interesting though, she had a single interesting mother-daughter conversation in the entire movie (the dress scene). Great, could been worse like zero interesting conversations in the whole movie.
After the end you stand and wonder...that's been it? really? Why all the promoting and marketing for an ordinary TV-type movie (more like a TV-pilot).
Seen better! Max disappointment unfortunately..."
LADY BIRD,18 December 2017,9/10,"How refreshing and invigorating to meet new people. Familiar and new all at the same time. Familiar because the extraordinary Saorise Ronan connected me to her soul, as soon as she appeared on the screen. Remarkable. She is, without question, one of the best actresses of her generation. She has exceptional support here, Laurie Metcalf as the mother determined to keep her feelings at bay, Lucas Hedges, providing one of the most moving, truthful moments in the film and allowing Saorise Ronan to give us a masterful class in empathy. Timothee Chalamet proves in a very short space of time that he is here to stay. His Elio in Call Me By your Name will be considered one of the great breakthrough performances in film history. Tracy Letts plays the father with irresistible humanity and then, of course, a heartfelt congratulations to the writer, director Greta Gerwing -"
LADY BIRD,12 February 2018,2/10,"I don't know why people loved this film. The acting is great but the message seems to be no matter how your mom treats you, she loves you or you should assume she loves you. I wanted something to hang onto at the end and left feeling like I wish I hadn't watched it."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,1/10,This movie sucked something awful. It was only an hour an a half. But felt like over 2 hours. I didn't even pay for it and I want my money back.
LADY BIRD,17 November 2019,5/10,"I do not understand all the praise. In most parts the story and characters feel shoe-horned, un-developed and shallow. Lady Bird's irrational teenage behavior is without any consequences and it all turns into some sort of feel-good movie. My own teenage kids were unconvinced."
LADY BIRD,15 March 2018,5/10,"I wanted this film to be brilliant. My expectations were admittedly high as I went into it but I don't think it ever elevated to feeling like a ""pretty good"" movie, even. I'm not quite sure why it got so much acclaim because outside of some touching moments and some cleverly directed scenes, the film fell rather flat. I think if anything the editing was the most impressive part as it did cover a lot of ground and presented it in a very concise way. There were quite a few times where I felt a lot of information was conveyed in just a small moment or shot and that was one of the strengths of the film. The other strength was certainly the performances but the writing kept the film a bit bogged down as a typical coming-of-age story I would expect to see at a mid-grade film festival. Unfortunately the positive aspects of the film were not enough to save it and it's not a film I think I'd even want to see again."
LADY BIRD,22 January 2019,9/10,"Lady Bird understands what makes a ""coming of age"" film work; realism. The character of Lady Bird is so wonderfully realised that her story is completely captivating and sincere. Wonderful morals to be found here and a fantastic soundtrack, not to mention a brilliant script with some memorable lines. Really wasn't expecting much and it took me by surprise."
LADY BIRD,10 January 2018,8/10,"This beautiful movie shows us that some things that are supposed to be great do not always turn out to be great but exactly the opposite (first time, relationships, friendships). Greta Gerwig managed to show all of the natural elements of a young girl and her dreams and thoughts in simple, light, nice and comedic way. A drama/comedy masterpiece!"
LADY BIRD,27 December 2019,8/10,"A film that shows you as a person who rejected all his origin and home, ends up loving and missing him.
With an excellent direction and an impeccable script along with the performances make it a sad, dramatic and beautiful coming of age at the same time."
LADY BIRD,1 January 2018,4/10,"This movie is average at best. The story is full of cliches and the characters are not very interesting; they try very hard to make them pass as quirky but it feels fake (the ""emo"" brother with piercing that never smile, the ""tortured"" musician, c'mon). This is a normal man idea of an indie movie.The production is alright and the acting is good, but that doesn't save the movie from mediocrity."
LADY BIRD,25 July 2021,10/10,"Hugely relatable to the mass audience, Lady Bird separates itself from similar coming of age stories by being tunnel focused on how messy growing up is. It is both hopeful and realistic at tackling the plentiful difficulties of growing up, while I find other coming of age films lack the realism.Because the script is so true to life it makes the story so relatable, and it makes the actors job so natural. Speaking of the actors their performances are fantastic, and the story has great pace to it. The ending also subverts the expected cheesy overly-neat Hollywood ending which earns it a bonus point. I'm going to give Lady Bird a 10 because it is exceptional, and rather than a 9/10 film, I don't think there's anything that could be improved about it.The most poignant part of the story for me, was for how all of her personality, there really is nothing special about Lady Bird as a person. She seems like the most average person, going through the most average things in life, yet it is still very beautiful to watch because of the attention to details.I honestly find it terrifying that I see so much of my own life in lady bird because it undermines what I have thought as making me unique. I'm still trying to process that but if a film can get you thinking, to me, it's a sign of how good it is."
LADY BIRD,27 October 2021,9/10,"Ladybird is an excellent film. It carries out some kind of happy emotion throughout the film which we experience during our summer vacation. And to say this movie feels like summer. Never got bored while watching this. But I got a little bit disappointed at the ending as the ladybird didn't find a boyfriend who matches her. But after all, she's just 18 😂 so I think it would be no problem because she will be having plenty of time to find who matches her. So if you are into movies that travel with a specific character, ladybird is that of a kind."
LADY BIRD,10 October 2021,9/10,"Flawless movie. This movie feels so real, I can relate with my experiences in high school.I really liked the way this movie doesnt have too much dramatic scenes like the typical of high school movies.Saoirse Ronan's action was amazing."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,5/10,"Still haven't quite picked up what all the fuzz about this movie is. The formula is a bit overused as of lately: semi-dysfunctional middle-class suburban family with spineless good guy buddy dad, hard working tough-on-the-outside but creamy-on-the-inside responsible mom, weird emo empty brother character with weird emo girlfriend, first love that turns out gay, chubby girlfriend, pretentious self-centered laid back jock love interest, rich gum-chewing cheerleader type bitchy fake girlfriend and of course the quirky insecure proud-to-be nerd going through puberty and bursting her childhood bubble main character who, I asume, nowadays would be an Uber-hipster in her early thirties. We've seen it again and again it seems: Juno, Perks of being a wallflawer, Boyhood, etc. Any of those examples had more content script-wise, character-wise and/or plot-wise. Here nothing really happens; it's just a still of the last 6 months of high school. She falls in love, the guy is gay; she want's to join the cool kids for the guy, they're phony baloney so she goes back to being the proud nerd and take her plump best friend to prom; she hates her mom, she loves her mom; she desperately wants to go to college as far a possible from home, then she realizes she actually loved home; etc, etc, etc. (eyes rolling) The acting is alright but not as memorable as they're building it up to be in the ""authorized"" reviews. No distinguishable soundtrack whatsoever so I guess that makes it really ""indie"". Another example of how scarce original ideas are nowadays in Hollywood. If you're a 30-odd year old woman who used to be a quirky teenager with mommy issues you'll love it. I seriously hope the academy doesn't pull an ""Eddie Redmayne"" on Frances McDormand because this one would be really uncalled for."
LADY BIRD,23 August 2020,5/10,"The character is self obsessed and selfish from start to finish and has no redeeming qualities. There are no rites of passage and I felt no empathy with her.
The mother was the best actress and star of the show."
LADY BIRD,4 October 2018,6/10,"When watching the trailer of this movie and going through the interviews, you get a certain ""vibe"" from the feature. Then you watch it and it's like sex you were hype for that only disappoints you. The main actress is a great actress. This is one of her worst movies."
LADY BIRD,20 May 2019,10/10,"Really liked it, worth watching than reading reviews to decide."
LADY BIRD,9 April 2020,6/10,"This movie received a lot of buzz, why I do not know. It received a rating of 6 only due to the acting, Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf acted well in spite of a monotonous script. There is nothing else in this tedious movie worth mentioning. A high school girl that dreams of leaving her small town to move to a more cultured, open and artistically expressive town (or as she thinks it maybe). She does everything she can to get accepted at University in New York, cheating her grades, placing her family in further and further financial debt just so that she can get a step in the East Coast. She's expressive but we don't know if she has any talent, we are not shown that she has any talent. The movie was highly clichéd, the cinematography was disappointing, there's scenes with a somewhat appealing background and jazz melodies........The music and wardrobe were not 2002, in fact they could have used any other year as a setting"
LADY BIRD,1 January 2018,4/10,"If someone were to tell me to, 'name one of life's bitter disappointments', I'd have to say watching, based on its reviews, a much-lauded film - one with a Metacritic score in the 90's - for it to turn out to be really very average. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often, but when it does, ooh, it smarts! That just happened with me and this film.Don't believe the hype."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2020,3/10,This started out strong but once she starting dating the second guy it become clear how unlikeable lady bird is and no matter what she did she faced no major consequences
LADY BIRD,11 March 2018,4/10,"The critics and a few sites have been pushing hard this film-Ronan is a good actress with a great track record. I thought the story and dialogue more than a little pedestrian, and I consider it fair to say that the slot for this film would be any american cable tv daytime filler.I left the cinema after one hour-surely if you throw millions of dollars at a film, it would amount to more than this?"
LADY BIRD,24 August 2019,10/10,"I was raised by my mum only and I mean... this movie is about us.
All the fights, the love and everything, wow it is really touching, but also really funny in the best, sophisticated way.
To be honest, it made me tear up and think about all the efforts my mum made to raise me to be a good human, the moments I was fighting her for my rights as a teenager with confused self-esteem and full of life, and the lot of fun and everything we still go through together.
This is about us. I am really really thankful for this movie. <3"
LADY BIRD,8 July 2018,10/10,"Well, we can't all be Rory and Lorelai. Nor should we? I love this movie. I watched it with my mom (which I recommend you do too if possible) and we had a couple knowing moments where it was like we were watching ourselves. The teachers at Lady Bird's school were almost replicas of one's I had. This is what was so amazing about this film: relatable! I laughed, I cried, and I cringed. It's a fantastic movie that I recommend to everyone."
LADY BIRD,17 February 2018,8/10,I actually really enjoyed it. It got a lot of hype so that always has me skeptical. It isn't anything groundbreaking but the acting and script are super good and fun. It will probably resonate with your women a little more than with you but there are enough quirky spots that had us laughing. The entire movie is like the trailers. It didn't blow my mind but I will definitely watch it again. The mom is phenomenal: she really convinces you of her character. It is a mixture of Napoleon dynamite meets wallflower. I'd say wallflower is more powerful but LB is simply enjoyable and quirky. It really thrives off of its awkwardness haha. Just your typical coming of age movie with a strong mother-daughter aspect but has refreshing moments.
LADY BIRD,10 June 2018,4/10,"This wasn't necessarily a bad title but the longer the movie went on, the more some actions seemed ridiculous/unbelievable. The acting itself was good but the longer development of relations between the characters seemed all over the place, it felt shallow. If anything, most of the characters were toxic to each other and selfish. There was too many things happening at once and the protagonist didn't seem to reflect much to learn from things.Why is the protagonist mentioned as ""artistically inclined""? She had no passion for art except once participating in some sort of a musical. Then she didn't bother turning up anymore having no remorse about it because her personal dating life was just so much more important.The ending left in me a weird ""what the..."" feeling as I found her having a closure while getting totally wasted a bit... too dramatic? Hell, I'm not even sure how exactly she felt because there was no more dialog. I don't know if it was the way the character was written but I wasn't able to relate or understand to most of her actions at all.Also, what exactly was the point of the adopted kids in her family? They were usually silent. I can't see a purpose beside it adding into race diversity for the sake of it."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2018,1/10,"I would see the movie, but I don't patronize movies made by anti-semites (Gerwig)"
LADY BIRD,12 September 2018,1/10,"...one of the characters equated Republicans to terrorists. The scene occurred early in the movie. That ended any chance of me enjoying the movie. If a joke, then it's not funny. Why Hollywood do you continue to alienate half your audience?"
LADY BIRD,11 January 2021,3/10,"The plot is boring, there is no conflict or anything of that sort. It just flows and you slowly lose interest in it. The characters are chaotic. There's no conclusion at the end, it just ended abruptly.The acting is good, but since the story is so... Off, it just didn't pull you in, and it doesn't make you sympathise with them. This is like the movie 'Eighth Grade'. Relaxing, yes, but pointless.Not really recommended."
LADY BIRD,6 March 2018,6/10,"I mainly wanted to watch this moving because timottee chalamet was in it, however I generally enjoyed the money as a whole."
LADY BIRD,7 January 2019,8/10,"I must confess that I never had much faith on this production. For being a strong contender for the 2017 Academy Awards, I was a bit curious, but that's it. Unlike films like Get Out, which seemed radically different from what I had seen before, Lady Bird seemed more like a dramatic film, visibly transgressive and hanging on a social cause to be considered when voting for prizes. Today I can say that, although it was not a revelation of a lifetime, I was pleasantly surprised.To begin with, Lady Bird does not tell an innovative story at all. The issue of teenagers discovering themselves in the darkness of taboos and repression is a topic that has been shown before. However, this production manages with on a very decent script, to turn this story into something extraordinary and surprising. The plot adapts to the passing of the minutes in a genuine way, turning each scene into a moving and special moment. Even with the simplicity of the story, it manages to be even intriguing, captivating me at least. And, among all these achievements and showing off, it dares to be even hilarious. Very good story. Very good plot.The development of the characters is very interesting, revealing a very intelligent and dedicated film direction. The main character evolves in a very positive way, in a production that is clearly oriented to her liberation. Even the title suggests a theme of freedom seeking. In this case, a girl who by experiencing new things and meeting new people, tirelessly seeking to move to the other side of her country, craves a sense of freedom and independence. The chemistry that Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf have on screen is amazing, especially in the situations where they discuss and fight, even if I consider that this merit is more of the script than the actresses. The characters are very good, going beyond the common teenager that American cinema and television has already managed as a cliché. Each one presents a new situation to the spectator: Rebelliousness, sexual orientation, identity, self-esteem, etc. And, as a whole, the consequences of growing.It's obvious that the film seeks to go beyond any established story cliché, and break as many paradigms as possible. To begin with, the fact that Christine ""Lady Bird"" studies in a Catholic school is clearly a suggestion of how damaging is to impose a conservative idea on a teenager that does not understand the origin of those limitations. It seems that each of the teenage characters challenges the imposed system in its own way. The most notorious example of this is the character of Lucas Hedges, who fights against himself and his sexual orientation. The standards of feminine beauty are completely bashed, making a harsh social criticism against them. However, it is brilliant that, when separated from that environment that at the beginning of the film is so repressive, Christine uses it to evoke her childhood and value her family. Good details of symbolism.As I mentioned, the script is excellent. It is noted that the story was created by someone who fell madly in love with their own creations and characters. Without trying to be sweet, everybody can tell that there is dedication and even affection between Greta Gerwig and her work. And, even if Get Out got the award for best original script, I can not deny how fascinating Lady Bird is, and more for the final product, since the original script had 350 pages long. The Oscar-nominated performances didn't had much chance to win the prize, especially in the case of Ronan, competing against Frances McDormand. I mentioned it before: I think the great merit of the characters is more scriptwriting than anything. Good performances, but not brilliant. The direction of Gerwig, even if it didn't had enough to beat Guillermo del Toro in 2017, is worth mentioning and cheering. In short, it is an excellent film, but in the case of this year, it can be beaten by others in every aspect. Bad luck? Perhaps.Summing it up, Greta Gerwig offers us a film of absolute quality and cinematographic merit. Still, it shows that it is one of those movies that use only the script to be what they are. Personally, and issuing a purely subjective and personal judgment, I feel that an important gap was left in the department of the soundtrack. The story deserved an incredible musical sequence, worthy of nomination. That, to our misfortune, did not happen. However, the film seems to be heading to be a cult film. It is a moving and authentic film, with all its nominations more than well deserved. The only thing I can say is that I look forward to the next project of this emerging director."
LADY BIRD,14 June 2020,8/10,"Greta Gerwig has a talent to reach people's heart through her movies by Lady Bird or Little women, she makes you relate to the character and to understand her. As a 17 year old girl, my character is not quite similar to Lady Bird but i still could relate to her, to her rebel, to her confusion and to her choices. I loved that throughout the movie i could see her change, becoming a different person without changing herself. I love Greta Gerwig and her choices of locations, cinematography, actors....etc. I'd love everyone to see it and interact with it with their hearts."
LADY BIRD,31 May 2019,8/10,"Lady Bird doesn't necessarily have a specific plot. Lady Bird is trying to get to college, but it's more in the background in a film that's mainly just about life in general. Some of these events don't even matter in the long run. But what makes Lady Bird (the film) special is that we're following these investing characters in events that DON'T matter."
LADY BIRD,29 March 2020,5/10,"I don't understand the hype. I mean the acting is pretty convincing and it's a good movie, but it's not earth-shattering. What really made me give it only 5 stars is the ending. It was predictable, I knew in the first 5 minutes that she was eventually going to drop that made up name by the end of it, and it was kind of short. Her realizing that New York was not all rainbows and sunshine should have been half an hour, not 5 minutes. And even though she realized she was being a spoiled brat in the end, and her hometown really is beautiful compared to other hell-holes on Earth, her grand redemptive gesture is a phone-call to her mother, saying thank you. Her mother wasn't even there! She left a message! I mean really? That's it? Your mother went through so much to try and raise you, working late, dealing with a depressed husband, rationing money, and put up with your complaining, and all she gets is thank you? On voice-mail? Wow... well, I guess you really do have to love your children unconditionally, because you're not going to get much in return.
And Lady Bird? I mean if you chose a name for yourself, at least make it cool, not Lady Bird... How pretentious is that? Like she wanted everyone to know that it's a metaphor for the fact that she wants to fly away and be free. Way to obvious, if you ask me."
LADY BIRD,26 November 2020,10/10,"Teared up more than once, laughed out loud more than once, relatable, what else do we need from a film ?"
LADY BIRD,28 October 2017,10/10,"And definitely one of the best films of 2017, period. As a matter of fact, the entire film is wonderfully acted, written and directed. (If Laurie Metcalf doesn't at least get a supporting actress nomination there is simply no justice in this world.) The characters are refreshingly real, multi-dimensional, nuanced and fascinating, and the female characters, especially, are blessed with legit real dialogue and not the usual bogus generic tropes. One of the cinematic delights of the year."
LADY BIRD,22 January 2018,9/10,"Really liked it. Coming of age film, that largely focuses on Lady Bird's relationship with her mother .
Loved the mood of the film. It brought back memories,it was somewhat relatable to my teenage struggles, even though its set in a completely different eviroment to mine.
Acting felt very natural. Saoirse Ronan is great, one of my favourite young actresses after this film, great performance. Recommend"
LADY BIRD,23 July 2019,7/10,"Lady bird is a nostalgic film that captures the feelings and relationships of teenage life in America through the telling of a classic coming of age story. It not only touches on growing pains of high school and transitioning to college, but it also provides a raw look into the emotional strain of friends and family derived from this stage of life. It commentates on mother-daughter, and father-daughter relationships in a non-condescending, dynamic style. What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in pure, natural emotion. It's a story that's been told many times before with a quirky and unashamed confidence applied to it."
LADY BIRD,27 November 2017,6/10,"We went into Lady Bird without overly high expectations despite the critical acclaim, so we weren't disappointed. The film is well put together and the acting is excellent. The issue we have is with the plot, or rather lack thereof. We couldn't get invested in the story. Whatever happened to a beginning, middle, and end?"
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,5/10,"It was ok but extremel disappointing from all the hype that it got. It's a poor mans version of Juno that was less funny and wow did they just call a quits in the end and say wrap up production cause we are out of here. Any college freshman taking a 101 writing class could have come up with that. Sorry guys, spoiler, she goes to college and kinda misses home. The end. The main character lead was just average, not memorable. This was not a best picture worthy nominee."
LADY BIRD,10 May 2018,6/10,"I should have known better when the critic rating on rotten tomatoes was 99, and the audience rating was 72. I give this a 70 at best. I can watch teenagers working at walmart doing the same thing. Way, way, way overrated, not funny at all, mom was an uncaring bitch, dad was a loser, and the story was totally boring."
LADY BIRD,1 January 2018,2/10,"Young Ronan is a promissing actress and that's probably the only good thing about this movie. It's ratings are overinflated. Imdb ratings are becoming less and less relevant, sadly."
LADY BIRD,9 February 2019,5/10,An average movie. To watch when you have nothing else to do.
LADY BIRD,28 January 2018,9/10,"I started watching this film with the knowledge that it is nominated for an oscar. So I had high expectations but unfortunately this had a negative effect on my experience. In the first half I was a bit underwhelmed and I thought this was just a bit of a generic teen/high school drama. But when I kept on watching, I found out that it is not. And that's one of the reasons that it is a great film. Most high school drama's revolve around boyfriends and bff's. In this film you get all of that but they seem not that important because they are part of a bigger picture. The fact that they are able to show this whole picture makes this film feel very realistic.
I also liked the mother/daughter theme a lot. It made me think about how love can be shown in many different ways but they are not always in the ways you want them to be. 
The acting was great and this made the film come across very well. I love Saoirse Ronan."
LADY BIRD,20 February 2020,8/10,"Greta Gerwig made an incredibly relatable coming of age story full of faulty people in less than ideal situations. Christine's homesickness at the end and her appreciation of her upbringing felt deeply personal. In the end, Christine and her mother were finally brought together. It is clear that they are not too different and that their love for each other rises over their incurable temperaments."
LADY BIRD,10 February 2018,6/10,"Intelligent actors and good acting. good directing of a good script. no more, no less. average good movie with an overrated score of adolescence and relationships of a talent teenager..."
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,10/10,"Lady Bird is one of those film's that sucked me in, where i just stopped looking for things that were wrong with the movie, because the truth is there is nothing wrong with it. While it doesn't really offer anything original, everything about the movie is so good that any of the faults of the movie, if there are any, are insignificant compared to all its strength's. While i was apprehensive at the thought of Ronan playing the main character because of how old she is, my doubts were quickly swept away. Not only does Ronan give a phenomenal performance here, but everyone in the movie gives it their all, and it is just a spectacle to watch. The fact that this is the first movie Greta Gerwig directed really shows how talented she is, and i will definitely keep my eye out for her next work. But i think what i love most about this movie is its visuals and style. It reminds me of the works of Wes Anderson and French cinematography. The natural lighting, and highlight of character over story, yet the use of bright colors and backdrops, and characters that are unique, charming, and quirky in their own way. It all blends together to create a wonderfully beautiful film.Saoirse Ronan plays the titular ""Lady Bird"", a girl who yearns to be seen as smart, cultured, and beautiful. And as she grows, and learns, and becomes a woman, she loses things, and gains things as we all do as we grow up. I might normally find such a character annoying in a film, but she is just so well written that i love Ronan's portrayal. It's sweet, its endearing, it's sad, it's cringy, it's everything that makes being a teenager, a teenager. The whiny, self obsessed teenager that hates the world and everybody is just a delight here.Her relationship with her family is really the central plot of the movie, and normally while i hate the feel good, family themed movies i was joyed when the scenes cut to Lady Bird in her house. Her mother is the typical ""i don't understand my ungrateful daughter"" character, but it doesn't get to bad. While i think they may over overplayed the part just a little bit, the scenes of Lady Bird and her mom connecting and understanding each others view points and very heartwarming. And her dad is a great character who gets just the right amount of screen time. While Lady Bird's ambitions stretch beyond her families wealth, her dad takes it all in stride as a father that anyone would be lucky to have growing up.This is a film i will definitely watch again some day. It's a very heartwarming movie that touches you deep down and lifts up your spirits. It makes you smile, and appreciate your own family, and everything you have in life."
LADY BIRD,26 February 2018,10/10,"I have been typing, deleting and re-typing text for ten minutes, trying to start this review, and honestly, I do not know where to begin. Perhaps, I should start where ""Lady Bird"" itself begins, which is in a cheap car with a mother and daughter driving along a road outside Sacramento, California, talking about the future. The daughter, who is the titular ""Lady Bird"" (played brilliantly by Saoirse Ronan), is talking about getting into collage, and how ""she wants to live through culture"". The Mum retaliates and begins to become hateful towards Lady Bird, which then persuades Lady Bird to jump out of the moving car.After this little incident, the film fully begins, setting in motion for various events to happen to Lady Bird and her friends: in the 95 minutes of running-time, Lady Bird falls in and out of love, has sex and gains+loses friends. All of these events just pull together the main theme of the movie: a mum and daughter relationship.As a mum and daughter they laugh, they cry, they fight and they smile, but at the end of the day they truly love each other, and deep down they both know it. Also, the town of Sacramento (and in-particular Lady Birds ""hate"" for it) is a big part of the story.On the whole, the film is superb with superb performances, a superb script, some superb (solo-debut) directing from Greta Gerwig and most importantly a beautiful message, which will not only relate with audiences and movie-goers alike, but also make them feel a certain way.The film manages to pull of everything a masterpiece should have and does it effortlessly. It (mostly) deserves all the awards it gets."
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,4/10,"Spoon-fed Hollywood ""alternative"" movie. They built a familiar plot & characters so the audience gets all identified & emotional but it turns out unoriginal and boring, its attempted quirkiness boils down to having pink hair and shouting randomly a couple of times. 
The movie touches some deeper topics like mental health or homosexuality to try & differenciate it from any other teenage chick flick but they do it in an incredibly superficial, unproductive way and more for entretaining than to say anything about it or at least trigger some thought. Even the differences in socioeconomic status that is a major topic, they fail to say anything relevant or somewhat interesting about it.
The dialogue is mediocre & a bit repetitive, the characters & their interactions have some complexity but have no dynamism or development.
The basic elements/concepts in the movie are okay, but the watered-down, Hollywood-approved way of dealing with them to exploit them for commercial use is very disappointing & unsatisfying."
LADY BIRD,1 March 2018,6/10,"The movie itself is decent, average, not really keeping you at the edge of your seat. Basically can be summed up by the following: ""a teen girl is going through her senior year of a Catholic high school, not seeing eye to eye with her mother she wants to study at a lib arts college in NYC. She ditches her friend for the popular kids, then reunites with said friend. In the end she graduates high school, gets into college in NY and moves there."" and that is more or less it. Very unsophisticated story. Boring at times. Actually made me wonder how is this movie different from half of the stuff they show on Lifetime or Hallmark. The film is funny from time to time, but also makes me wonder about the reality of what is presented. The family of the protagonist is struggling financially despite her mother working double shifts and the father having an MBA from UC Davis. Granted it's not Harvard or Stanford, but an MBA typically does make your career prospects increase. Her brother, a math graduate from Berkeley, can't seem to find a job, and it's because of the piercings in his face. Is that a big surprise? Has no one told him beforehand? Maybe the parents should have shed some light on the fact that you must look presentable whilst going to a job interview. Completely unrealistic. The acting itself was enjoyable. We can see in Ronan a rising star, although I actually preferred her performance in Brooklyn. It's a movie possibly worth seeing if you have nothing to do in the evening and feel like going to the cinema."
LADY BIRD,1 September 2019,7/10,Very easy for to get liked by a viewer with its feel-good aspects of the story which invokes our inner feelings and make us look back.
LADY BIRD,26 March 2020,8/10,"Ady Bird. Superbly acted coming of age film about a stroppy 17/18 year old girl and her relationships with boys, friends, family and especially her mother. Told in a series of vignettes which could've been exasperating/dull in less safe hands than first time (I think) director Greta Gerwig. We saw it on Mother's Day and was nice to see lots of mums and daughters watching together. Well worth a watch 8/10"
LADY BIRD,6 May 2019,9/10,"Lady Bird is perfect. This film entertains from beginning to end with smart writing, moving performances and an upbeat tempo. This film delivers on every level and everyone is bound to love it. Yes yes yes!!!!"
LADY BIRD,1 December 2017,6/10,"I base my assessment of a movie's 'greatness' on the story, acting, photography, and music. The acting was excellent. Saoirse Ronan's acting is captivating. The story is well, it's been done before so many times. It was entertaining at times. Maybe I have watched too many movies for over 70 years. The photography was average and the sound was at times very amateurish. The music - well, it didn't add to the experience. I would never compare this movie to a Woody Allen movie, never."
LADY BIRD,21 April 2021,10/10,"Lady Bird captures the whole range of feelings and concerns that I remember from my late high school and early college years. One of my absolute favorite movies, undoubtedly finest in its genre. You just watch and think how remarkably wise it is."
LADY BIRD,18 August 2019,10/10,"The only thing I want it to do after i finished lady bird is to watch it again, I've actually watched it in the beginning of 2018, and one day I just wanted for some reason to watch it again, so i did, now I've seen it four times in 2 days, and believe me I will watch a few other times, Saoirse ronan acting was absolutely Oscar worthy, the script was so beautiful, the colors are even more beautiful.
The only thing I hate, is the fact that it did not win on Oscar for the original script.!!"
LADY BIRD,22 May 2019,8/10,Just a well done film. The acting is superb as well. There was a moment where it lagged a bit but that is forgiven as it keeps you watching all the way though. Every teenager (especially girl) should watch this. 8 out of 10.
LADY BIRD,31 May 2019,8/10,"As good a coming of age film as has ever been made, and truer than most. The opening and closing scenes are perfection, the latter working like a great piece of music."
LADY BIRD,13 April 2020,8/10,"Movie, plot are quite solid. Well structured, funny and it does have a great message but the ending is so... ""That's it"".
I rather use the same dialogue but using a different camera take or another tipe of scene. IDK
That ending was so anticlimactic
Still, it's a great movie."
LADY BIRD,5 September 2018,9/10,I just love this I am going to watch it over and over again. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful.
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,1/10,I don't get the hype and why people love this film so much. Is this because the writer/director is a female? I felt that the acting was terrible and awkward. Lots of the camera angles were unimpressive and downright amateurish. Shame on Hollywood for nominating this film as a Best Picture contender. :-(
LADY BIRD,14 December 2017,3/10,"I wish I could agree with the high-scoring reviews, but I cannot. This movie seemed flat, monotone, mildly entertaining. The lead was perfunctory...another disgruntled teen who desperately wants to get out of her home town and fly to the East Coast ""where there is culture"". New Hampshire and culture? Hmmm... 
Lady Bird clashes with her mom (Laurie Metcalf...who deserves 10 stars by herself). So, a teen clashes with her mom...wow...news flash. 
Dad loses his job...and seems to be just fine with that, even though they are running out of money. Weird. 
The supporting cast seems to be chosen to complete a requisite menu of characters: the overweight but beautiful-inside best friend, the gorgeous and wealthy but shallow new friend, the handsome but...surprise...gay boy. Somehow this lack of originality does not drive a strong story line.
The crash and burn ending is, well, the only twist in this story...so, back home she goes, and realizes she really does love Sacramento. Perhaps Sacramento is a metaphor for almost every town in America, but the story never hints at that. So, sorry, this one just did not resonate with me."
LADY BIRD,27 June 2019,4/10,"Lady Bird has to be one of the most overrated films in recent history. Of course, movies with limited ""art house"" releases usually gain at least a star or two (either because of critics' pomposity or because they mistake ""boring"" for some deeper meaning). This one is about an immature teenager who engages in obnoxious, erratic conduct-I guess because of teen angst or hormones or some other ""coming of age"" cliché. Yes, teenagers really are frequently obnoxious and erratic; that doesn't make it profound or cute. Some funny lines and decent character actors partially make up for a dreary-to-meaningless story."
LADY BIRD,28 December 2017,5/10,"I do like Saoirse Ronan a lot,... so i opted to sit through this. but what a slow and boring story. i'm sure anyone can dig up some teenage memories and beat this by a mile. in a film where Ronan had to carry most of the load on her own she did just ok, portraying quite an average (by all means) character trying to break free of her Catholic Sacramento background. on odds with her mother, regrets and predictable ending. why the hype about this film, - i really don't know. personally, i think she looked just great in How I Live now in a more compelling and moving story. this was average"
LADY BIRD,11 November 2018,10/10,"I always appreciate independent film and admire when it is done so well. Everything about this film was spot on - the story, the acting, the beats, the nostalgia. When a film can transport me into the world of its story and I can feel what's it's like to live there, to ask questions, to lock into the relationships, then that film has attained mastery from my perspective. Great film, enough said!"
LADY BIRD,30 December 2017,1/10,"I don't understand the rave reviews. This movie had no real story line and the ending left us saying ""that's it"". It was not put together well. The story felt forced. It was typical ""Hollywood"" with high school sex, booze and weed as the story line mixed in with negativity, entitlement and strife. There was no climax to the story. It was not a 10, IMO. It wasn't even a 1."
LADY BIRD,23 August 2018,6/10,"Now a film I have heard nothing but a buzz of greatness about. I can't help but to sit here after watching said film and understand what the fuss was about. Yes it's a well acted and a well rounded story with conflict and nourishment. Greta Gerwig gives a wonderful performance along with her movie mother Laurie Metcalf also gives a wonderful performance filled with a sense that's she's had a long past, and her emotions are brought onto screen with such prowess. Lady bird is a film that will deliver on some fronts. But on others it's just another coming of age film that others have done better. It's one you will watch once and be good. All in all - not a bad movie, but not one that I will gladly go back to anytime soon"
LADY BIRD,30 April 2020,8/10,We always tend to discard what we have and try to find something else. It is only later that we realise how much it meant what we had. But this whole process is inevitable. Lady Bird beautifully captures this transition.
LADY BIRD,8 May 2019,3/10,"With this movie being nominated for 5 oscars, I was extremely excited to watch it. However, now that I have seen this movie, I am very confused as to why. I can't relate to anything about this movie. But maybe that has to do with my upbringing. I am not American nor went to a catholic school. Prom really isn't a big thing, and wanting to be friends a popular girl/boy is not special. There weren't any theater clubs in my education system. So I can't relate to the main character and it's struggles and successes. As a movie, I thought it was fine, nothing too special. The actors were good, the cinematography was decent. But the story didn't strike me positively at all. So maybe I just don't get the whole movie because I just can't relate to anything about it. I hope I'm not the only one"
LADY BIRD,15 June 2018,10/10,This movie is almost a documentary on growing up. Ronan excels as a teenager stuck in a small town with normal teenage problems. I love the dynamic between her and Metcalf. As a mother myself I can totally feel the mothers pain of having to let go of her blossoming daughter. Great movie and should win a few Oscars I expect!
LADY BIRD,23 November 2017,10/10,"I really enjoyed LADY BIRD. One of the *best* films of the year! I totally related to the story especially the protagonist relationship with her mother and friends, and the dream of moving away to college! I watched LADY BIRD in a packed theatre with people of all ages which was fantastic to see because I've rarely seen a packed theatre for an 'independent' film! There were laughter and tears throughout. I think Gerwig has made a film for the ages. Her script is really strong and her direction too. The acting is remarkable especially Saoirse Ronan (never puts a foot wrong) and Laurie Metcalf who plays the mother so darn well! The supporting call are really great too-Beanie Feldstein, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges & Timothee Chalamet. This film *deserves* lots of awards love for sure! 10/10"
LADY BIRD,20 April 2018,5/10,"I've seen some movies about this topic before and I gotta say there was everything in it that can or needs to be in these types of stories.
The acting was real good, the filming, directing, everything... and I wanted to watch it because lots of reviews say it's just that good. It was good, but nothing special...
So I felt really bored during the whole movie. But why?
At the beginning of the movie Lady Bird says something like ""she wants to have a life, to do something memorable"" and I was like, OK I get it, this will be fun, but instead she goes on and does some really ordinary stuff. I really get it why it's like this, but for me a movie should be about something more than the average. Hell, I even had some pretty funny moments happen to me when I was 17/18! Now that would make a good movie. (but who really want's to see a movie about my life? let me tell you --> no one)And at the end I tought to myself: Why didn't I just wach 'The Edge of Seventeen' again? Now that was a coming-of-age moive I really loved."
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,10/10,"The omnipresent efervecence in the senior year is perfectly portraited in a simple, smart and dinamic coming-of-age story. The emotion transmitted in this movies isn't quite something you can put in words, if you've been through your teenage years you'll understand it, if you haven't, you will someday. The discoveries, the choices, the arguments, the parties, all the experiences that happen in that short period of time, culminate in completely exuberating (or desperating) days when they're brought toghether with an emancipating mind. Lady Bird, Christine's self-given name expresses exactly how her mind works, she wants her own life, simple as that. The reference to a flying bird may represent her desire into moving to New York, studying art and principally, getting out of her hometown, Sacramento, California. Saoirse Ronan gives probably the best work she's ever given, all of the anger and self-assurance is perfectly visible, quite violent sometimes, of course as teenage is in it's true form, brutal. It is really admirable that Greta Gerwig was able to put so much brutality in a delicate indie movie. This is not a film made to visually impress, it's just a story, told with a camera, with the humility necessary to make a movie like this. I dare to say we'll hear a lot from Greta in these next years, about stories that have the emotional appeal that is necessary to make us appreciate the days we are given, beacause as we're pretty well shown, they will change, and we will need to adapt to a new life. This movie proves that a decided woman can do whatever she wants, because after all, this movie is about the transformation of a girl into a woman, in it's true meaning."
LADY BIRD,17 February 2018,7/10,"The film is an above average one for me. It is actually one of those few films which made me smile after seeing it. I like the story because it managed to creatively and concisely depict life through the confusing stage of being a teenager and managed to effectively portray it all within just 90 minutes. I also liked the fact that all characters who played important roles in the life of the protagonist were given the chance to show their selves --that they're not just a somebody in the protagonist's life. In addition, the story's twists and turns are well-delivered making the audience caught off guard.Going to be a recommendation to my friends? Yes, not because of the hype or the Oscars but because it is worth the watch."
LADY BIRD,17 January 2019,10/10,"I loved it. I was hesitant to watch it, fearing it would be a typical coming of age teen movie. I was wrong. It gives insight to the mind of an outsider who doesn't believe in the outside. I love Lady Bird's weird personality that makes you wanna fly your freak flag. 10/10 would recommend and watch again"
LADY BIRD,3 May 2019,9/10,"Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird is an adoring ode to youth and a tender love letter to the writer-director's hometown of Sacremento, California. But it's also so much more than that. Gerwig captures the sadness, uncertainity, hopefulness and joy of growing up and leaving home with a warmth that few other filmmakers working in the genre have acheived."
LADY BIRD,13 June 2018,4/10,"As a father, the scenes between Tracy Letts and Saoirse Ronan were very heartwarming and genuine. There were solid performances by those two, in addition to Laurie Metcalf - who was brilliant as always. The big surprise for me came from Beanie Feldstein, who did amazing in her role as well.As a Sacramentan, I loved the images of the Sacramento area and the often visited places. It is rare that movies are filmed here, let alone are actually about Sacramento.However, neither the location nor the performances were enough to save this movie for me. It was truly lacking in plot, and the story of teenage angst has been told too many times before. It really is too bad, because I really wanted to like this film."
LADY BIRD,14 January 2018,4/10,"I came into this movie expected something to wow me noting the great reviews it received. To be honest, I thought it was a little flat. Someone who every year sees and blogs about the Oscar contenders, I just don't this one was in the same ball park as others. Don't get me wrong, I do reward Greta Gerwhig for a job well done in her debut--but I simply don't see the film in the same light as others. I love Laurie Metcalf in this film and think she should definitely get praise for her performance. Ronan's performance was take it or leave it for me. Just cannot relate to the film, did not leave me wanting more."
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,7/10,"This is a relatively safe version of the coming of age story. I give props to the writer for the relationship between the lead and the mother as there's an honesty there that a lot of films don't have. Unfortunately, a lot of the other relationships fall into the generic zone. Even so, this was funny enough at times and it was refreshing to get the female perspective on the high school experience."
LADY BIRD,10 September 2020,10/10,"Everything about this movie is perfect. As a former teenager, I relate so much but now as an adult with children of my own, I find myself relating to the parents as well. This is in my rotation of ""movies I can watch over and over again and it always makes me feel better"". And that's a pretty short list."
LADY BIRD,9 June 2019,9/10,"Greta Gerwig achieved a communion between independent film and adolescent drama. As a result, the film provides a hard but also poetic perspective of the crucial moment in life when teenagers desire to find themselves and parents fear that the result exposes their raising failures."
LADY BIRD,9 June 2019,6/10,"To be honest, this film is so overrated. For the Academy Awards themselves, this film doesn't even get one award. But, I honestly like this film, especially trying to get out of the cliche. In short, it's a relatable movie. As a teenager, you may have experienced everything in this film. Even though it's not all right, the context is exactly the same. Lady Bird is a genuine and a film that feels so personal but natural. Some of the actings were so real it even looks like improvisation. It's such a raw movie but not as perfect. But, let's be real for this time."
LADY BIRD,23 July 2019,7/10,"A new coming of age story with redeeming qualities. Her going back to church, going back to her real name, breaths life to whole movie. It was a success."
LADY BIRD,5 April 2020,7/10,"Lady Bird is a coming-of-age tale of a teenage girl named Christine by her parents but refuses to be called anything other than ""Lady Bird"". The wonderful Saiorse Ronan plays our young hero who is stuck in a Catholic school and dreams of leaving her hometown for the east coast. Laurie Metcalf plays Lady Bird's mother and through most of the movie there is conflict between mother and daughter.Lady Bird joins her school's theater group and meets a boy she begins to have a crush on. She is best friends with the equally isolated and unpopular Julie. After Lady Bird finds that her boyfriend isn't quite as he seems she soon lusts after the cool boy in a rock band named Kyle (Timothée Chalamet). Soon Lady Bird stops hanging out with her best friend and begins a friendship with the cool girl at school.Lady Bird clashes with her mother over which college she should attend and talks her recently laid off father to go behind her mother's back to help Lady Bird apply for financial aid so she could attend Columbia University. When she finds she is on the waiting list to get into Columbia, the relationship between mother and daughter is further strained.Once Lady Bird moves to New York, she begins to realize that the mother she thought hated her really just wanted the best for her daughter.This film is good but often times is also obnoxious. It's not quite as obnoxious as a film like Juno, but there are still moments that annoyed me. Overall, this is a decent look at the awkward period in life when one is trying to figure out what they want out of life and what they should do after high school."
LADY BIRD,8 March 2018,6/10,"The film was watchable but just trundled along. The romance was not intense, the comedy was a wry smile. 
Never picked up take off speed and then it was please disembark with no real end, write your own!"
LADY BIRD,21 October 2020,7/10,"Never thought I would watch this video before. Taste lacking, plot trifle. However, life story of this middle school girl brings me back to my school days more or less. She's unlucky to have a mother like that, so do I. Maybe I should stop blaming the unwanted parent, and be like her bro making a change."
LADY BIRD,27 August 2020,6/10,"Meh. Maybe it was they hype surrounding the film, but I found it disappointing. It was nice, and entertaining, funny, my fanily enjoyed it, but it fell into the bucket alongside the other comng of age stories. Did I miss something?"
LADY BIRD,16 November 2017,8/10,"Ladybird is a movie directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a comedy about a young girl played Saoirse Ronan who moved to Sacramento with her family to live a new life. However she is struggling to adapt to strict Catholic school she is in and her family's financial difficulties. She is trying to establish healthy relationship with people around her, especially her mother. This is the first film that I have seen in a long time, where I didn't see a single trailer or a poster other than knowing Saoirse Ronan is in the film and apparently the film was very good. That's why in the plot summary I didn't say much because to say anything more would be to describe every single little details happened in the film. I always loved Saoirse Ronan and I think she is a very talented young actress with great potential. She was in Hanna, one of the most underrated actions in the decade and I loved her performance in Brooklyn and Grand Budapest Hotel. After the failure of the Host, she went to back indie root and played in more arty film. This is a pleasantly surprising good movie. When the film starts, you have the impression that it is a coming of age story, which it is, but as the film went on it goes deeper and even darker. It dealt with subjects like anxiety, depression and even sexual identification. However doesn't play off in a serious tone, after all it is a comedy, it felt normal and lighthearted. And that is something missing in our mainstream movies. We don't see a lot of movies that felt like we are watching something as if it was unfold to us in real life. It is mostly thanks to the amazing acting the cast offers. I would say this is the best performance Saoirse Ronan has to offer. Also the mother played by Laurie Metcalf was very good and even though she constantly conflicting with her daughter, you understand why she is frustrated and you can tell that deep inside she loves her more than anything else. And that is the biggest strength of the film: because it felt so real and lighthearted, you felt every emotion the characters felt; joy, anger and pain. You understand how and why everyone do the things they do. I am surprised how dark some of the subject matters got, well at least for me personally. Last but not least, I have to mention the clever editing used in the film and its beautiful cinematography. I don't have too much complaint with the film, but there are a few nick picks. One of them was the pacing. The film is only 1 hr 33 mins long. There some scenes felt a bit rushed. I wish the film could slow down at times. The biggest flaw in the film I felt is with the ending. I won't spoil it but I felt it could be executed better and I thought it dragged a bit. What is more, some of the characters arcs are not resolved, but it doesn't bother me that much. Lady Bird is a very surprisingly good movie. I had a great time with it and made me feel hopeful. It is one of the best coming of age comedy I have seen. Even with its minor flaws I would highly recommend it to people. And if you are a teenage experiencing hardship, go watch it, it will make you feel better. 8.5/10"
LADY BIRD,19 April 2018,,"I found nothing enlightening or entertaining about this film. It's as if Gerwig set out to produce a movie in which a teenage girl is a Dostoevskian anti-hero. Her parents make every sacrifice for her. No thanks, no appreciation, constant laziness, sloth, and disrespect. Her goal is to go to college in NYC somewhere. Study...? ... No. Earn money ...? maybe a little. To get to her lifetime goal, she eventually drives her family further into debt, then immediately winds up in a drunk ward in NYC. Mission accomplished! Maybe we were supposed to view this as a victory for the human spirit. On what planet?We leave our heroine wandering the streets of New York hung over. We have no idea if she wised up, or just added drunkard to her resume."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2018,6/10,"A journey through teenage years, with which we easily identify with multiple situations portrayed, a couple of good performances and a movie that can be seen from beginning to end in a satisfactory way.
The film may be able to pull off one or another smile, there are a few dispensable scenes, but it turns out to be reasonable."
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,7/10,"Liked this, but wasn't in love with it. Perhaps part of the problem was trying to ""hear"" all the dialogue--some of which seemed mumbled and some of which seemed lost in young actors' lack of clarity. I very much liked Laurie Metcalfe as the mother--she portrayed so well the overbearing mother who herself is misunderstood. We know enough about her own formative years of abuse to counter her ""toughness"" --along with another character's testimony that she had a ""good heart.""The love-hate relationship rang very true and was painful at times, but still very real and not overdone. I think the audience found her a little unforgivable but I felt more for her than for the teenaged daughter. Saoirise Ronan certainly captures the highs and lows, the moments of deceit and triumph, of a young person. She filled the role well. I missed two thirds of what Timothy Chalamet needs to learn to enunciate--I truly was disappointed in losing so much of what he said. On the other hand Lucas Hedges was outstanding in all respects. The contrast could not have been more clear--and his moment of ""confession"" and ""apology"" to Lady Bird was a true moment of teenage anguish. I'd like to watch it on my own tv with closed caption on--I think I just missed too much."
LADY BIRD,15 March 2018,5/10,"It's alright. Nothing new or special, teenage girl who doesn't fit into her life and wants to move away from her family because they are not as quirky as she is. Been done before will be done again.. think any Natalie Portman film or Ghost World or American Beauty or anything along those lines and that's Lady Bird. Hollywood has no new ideas anymore and everything is a rehash or a superhero movie. The shape of water was the best movie of this year? Come on man, It was just Amelie written by Ed Wood!"
LADY BIRD,15 January 2018,9/10,"Greta Gerwig ..! I think she is one of the most brilliant writers of the 21th century. Frances Ha was the very first surprising experience, then Mistress America was a stunning movie to be the next.. and now this; Lady Bird. She has such a unique, authentic way of her own that you can recognise the characters she create even not knowing that the story belongs to her. These are girls who are experiencing ""finding oneself"" in different periods of life and in different ways. Yet, these are not simply lost girl stories, what makes them different is that these characters are not scattered by the wind, they are fully aware of the need of getting lost and they are the ones choosing how to, they lead the ""getting lost"". Lady Bird, in particular, is a stunning story of a young girl so vulnerable yet so strong. There are ups and downs, comes and goes, yet you can always feel that lead. Moreover it is a impressing mother-daughter story. Although there are no big tragedies one can always sense that strong sense of breakdown.besides the perfect story, the actors and actresses are also amazing, and Saorise Ronan is simply fascinating! It was a true breakthrough performance!"
LADY BIRD,17 July 2021,10/10,"I have seen Lady Bird a few times now and I think it's safe to say that this my favorite movie. There isn't a single flaw that comes to mind about this movie. It is so rich with detail and incredibly well-crafted and immaculate in its writing and storytelling.Saoirse Ronan plays Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson, the titular protagonist with the most realistic and relatable character arc I have ever seen. Lady Bird starts off as a self-centered brat who wants to move far away from her nest. Though her relationship with her mother, Marion (portrayed by Laurie Metcalf) looks constantly argumentative on the edges, the inner core shows their true love for each other. This aspect seems to be what the film's thesis demonstrates, that arguing is some weird way how we show our love.Over the course of the film, Lady Bird grows into a more self-aware female character. She deals with boys, knowing who her true friends are, and love for her hometown of Sacramento. These themes all culminate to the real meaning of her coming-of-age.The characters are relatable and convincingly flawed. The cinematography is artistically beautiful, making each frame look like a painting. The score is nostalgically melancholy. Everything about this film is perfect, it's hard to hate it. With its impressively deep meaning and darkly comic humor, it's no wonder the film had received a Certified Fresh 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes at one point."
LADY BIRD,15 September 2018,6/10,"A bit disappointed in this film - some of the actors were garbling their lines, speaking too fast, so that it was hard to follow at times - this is up to the director to stamp on and I hope she does so as she directs 'Little Women' !"
LADY BIRD,3 September 2018,3/10,"A dull character study of a lost and self centered ungrateful daughter trying to find her way. She mopes around expecting something great to come her way, when she offers little in return to everyone around her. I felt bad for the parents and wish I could get my 90 minutes back."
LADY BIRD,16 June 2020,9/10,"A sweet, charming movie from start to finish. While this is a story about the complicated, yet unbelievably real love between a mother and daughter, the spotlight is shared through snapshots of life as we watch Lady Bird go through her senior year of high school. During this journey, we get glimpses of the different emotions and adventures that remind us of our own coming of age moments. Strong performances all around have me wanting to watch more movies with not only the Lady Bird actress, but also the mother, as well as Danny. The best thing about this movie is how it's shared in quick glimpses, with each scene not overstaying its welcome or holding too much weight, emphasizing an appreciation for the little moments. While these snapshots built a touching and raw story of a girl going through her senior year on the surface, the homely simplicity of it all is what makes me want to watch it again. Strong 9."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,6/10,I enjoyed the film and I am a big fan of Saoirse Ronan but it is nowhere as excellent as everyone says. It is only ok. The film thinks it is smarter that i really is and it is only saved by the great performances both in lead and supporting roles. I always enjoy a good intelligent coming-of-age story especially with quirky characters and witty dialogue so this should be ticking all my boxes but ultimately it falls flat. I will maybe upset some viewers but this film doesn't in slightest reach the quality of these years Oscar nominees. Interestingly enough I have not met a single person in my immediate surroundings who would like the movie so I am being still positive comparing to them but still very critical compared to the raving reviews. My conclusion is that is not a waste of time or money to see it I would recommend it as a Sunday afternoon Netflix movie watch. 6/10
LADY BIRD,23 November 2017,3/10,"Although this movie was only about an hour and a half it felt like over two hours. I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end. The acting was good, but the plot felt like the writer took everything that could affect a teenager and threw it into a movie. I generally like thought evoking movies, but this one was just not compelling. Of the three people I went with, only one would recommend it and then only to a limited viewing audience. A lot of people really liked this movie, at least in the reviews, but there no one in the audience was saying how much they loved the movie as they exited the theater."
LADY BIRD,8 June 2020,3/10,"I made it to the halfway point before I had to turn it off. The main chatacter is completely unlikeable. I'm sure she starts to ""learn her lesson"" at some point in the film but it was too late for me."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2018,10/10,"I knew about Lady Bird for a long time, but no more than the name. Yesterday I heard it was directed by Greta Gerwig and just ran to watch it. Because Greta never disappoints (and it's not that I'm biased, she just does a very great job writing and acting). Everything she does feels so real and relatable.
Many movies capture period of teen angst, trying to be important and to fit in. Rarely we see those teens grow up and go forth. 
I don't really want to talk about everything - cast is amazing, music is amazing, photography is beautiful, you get the 2000's vibe and pretty much feel how it was. Again, so many things you can relate to. I just don't feel like I have much to say besides praising everything. 
It's a remarkable movie, and I think at some point everyone should watch it. Just to feel touched and not alone. And to remind oneself how much they love their family and all those little detailes of their life. 
Thanks to everyone who worked on it!"
LADY BIRD,24 October 2020,7/10,"THE GOODThe story is an adolescence told from within, which brings out an identifiable and relatable realism, in addition to encompassing global issues (something that always happens in cinema so stagnant in experience), examples: the search for identity that leads to decisions egotistical, the constant pseudo-justification of the stubborn adolescent and the person in relation to a context that oppresses him / her.Saoirse Ronan is one of the greatest promises of the 2010s and this film shows us why, stands out above all for her rudeness on stage and her body language that increase the internal logic of her character, even in scenes that contradict herself or he's acting foolish, it's clear he's part of his character, and without Ronan's performance the character might have just seemed annoying.The story has to tell two and a half years of a person's life both externally and internally and thanks to the rhythm everything is condensed very well in just an hour and a half, human interactions take their time to be created and they again take time to be finalized while the script intersperses scenarios and situations in a way that passes lightly through the viewer's eyes.THE BAD
In the first 15 minutes I felt that Lady Bird was not well planned, the interactions were unnatural and the script was extremely unsubtle, but after the protagonist entered the theater everything began to flow much better and in the technical aspect also saw an improvement, but that does not mean that the beginning does not do justice to the development or the end.CONCLUSIONLady Bird is a very respectable good film for narrating from experiences and for knowing how to dilute its story."
LADY BIRD,31 May 2020,5/10,"My wife wanted to see this movie, so i looked up the rating on imdb and was pleasently surprised. This is standard procedure in our home. I made it almost untill the end before i had to do something else. I was simply bored out of my mind. This is the first time i havent been able to watch a movie untill the end. The acting is spot on, but the plot is just a realistic movie about a teenagers life where nothing really happens.. my wife seemed to enjoy it and said she could relate to the character. Maybe it is a gender thing? Anyway, not for me even though i can enjoy the genre. This time i have to disagree with the ratings."
LADY BIRD,26 April 2020,9/10,"This movie (compared to other netflix teenager movies) is the best i've saw the last couple of years, i had a lot of fun watching it mostly because of the personality every character has, whom are kinda interesting at the same time, not too much but kinda. Theres a lot of good things i could say about this movie, it's just awesome. The only weak points are the pointless plot, i mean is just a movie about a girl's life and that 'bout it, there is not too much i can learn about it but still an amazing film that is definitely worth watching, also is a movie that i would watch a couple of times more.(this movie is not a ""typical teenager movie"" as i said on the title srry lol)"
LADY BIRD,21 April 2020,4/10,"There's literally nothing new to offer in this movie, over hyped. We can happily skip this one."
LADY BIRD,27 January 2018,9/10,"Ladybird film portraits a teenage girl problems while transition from adolescents to adulthood it's a sweet but showcase's serious issues shows a complex relationship between mother and daughter it's realistic There's a pleasant dose of nostalgia for those who survived a Catholic education.refreshing, entertaining and wonderful movie !! brilliant performance by saoirse Ronan as Christine 'lady bird' a lively girl who wants to move to different place , be independent and study in a fancy college but her parents can't afford it .this movie tells us the highs and lows of teenage life. 
If you are looking for great movie worth your time this won't be a wrong choice.Starring: Andy Buckley, Beanie Feldstein, Danielle Macdonald, Jake McDorman, Jordan Rodrigues, Kathryn Newton, Kristen Cloke, Laura Marano, Laurie Metcalf, Lois Smith, Lucas Hedges, Odeya Rush, Saoirse Ronan, Stephen Henderson, Timoth, Tracy Letts

Genre(s): Drama, Comedy
Runtime: 94 min"
LADY BIRD,28 February 2018,10/10,"This excellent coming of age film has a perfect balance between humor and drama. Saiorse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, and Timothee Chalamet lead an ensemble cast that is breathtaking. The plot is not original, featuring a Catholic school girl rising above the stifling environment in which she is emerging as an adult. But, the dialogue is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Set in Director and Writer Greta Gerwig's hometown of Sacramento, California, the setting is like an extra character in the film. The camera captures friendship, first love, mother-daughter tension and the everyday lives of multiple people just living their lives. It is so simple in its goals but it hits a home run! Lady Bird deserves all of the hype that it has received."
LADY BIRD,13 May 2018,9/10,"This film had all the typical aspects of a coming of age teen film; family, school, romance, college etc. However, it all came together in a much more realistic and relatable way, and you can sympathise and get involved with the characters in a way that is rare for most films of this genre. I loved that this film doesn't have one single plot and doesn't prioritise one part of lady bird's life over the other. It merely lets you in on her life and truly what it is like to be a 17/18 year old girl. The acting is of such a high standard and Ronan's performance is outstanding! It is funny, emotional and entertaining. It is a normal, relatively small film, and I think it is great a film like this just about a girl and her family and her life has got such recognition. Most of all, how refreshing it is to see a film where neither of her love interests are 'the one' and it isn't centred around the main character seeking validation through finding a man."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,5/10,"We've seen a lot of these kinds of movies before: coming of age stories with confused/troubled teens finding their way, like Juno, Boyhood, Virgin Suicides or any number of John Hughes movies. I'm not sure how Lady Bird distinguishes it from those, other than that the 'protagonist' is more irritating than the most. This might speak to a specific demographic of people who are that age or came from that type of place, but not for me. Some good performances, but overall, meh."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,5/10,"I've heard only good reviews about this film and I have to admit, I was excited to see what was it all about. After watching it though I have to say it was a bit disappointing. The plot is supposed to be this coming of age story, about a young high school student who's coming into terms with who she is and what she wants to do. Yet, I didn't find it interesting for the main fact that it is hoarded to death! How many times have we seen this concept in movies? The sidetracked high school teen wanting to get with the ""in"" crowd, going through phases of ""rebellions"", trying to be oh so ""edgy"" and ""cool"" just to realize that she was doing more harm to those who actually cared about her towards the end. We have seen this more than once already, so Lady bird offers nothing original or creative. The financial issues are meant to be centre stage in this movie, and I have to say they do play a bigger role than just people talking about them but even that is quite minor and does nothing but serve as a dramatic/plot device that is just easily discarded as the movie rolls. I mean her family is supposed to be struggling financially since the setting is that of the early 2000s, yet LadyBird still manages to afford and go to a ""private"" catholic school that is filled with rich students, she can still get a new dress to go to prom, her family lives in Sacramento, CA not exactly the cheapest state out there and they seem to be pulling off just nicely. Yes, they might not be as well off as the rest of the crowd living around them but they're doing just fine! To me the financial issues just seemed surreal and unrealistic. They're more Middle class than poor. The ending is just anti-climatic. She finally gets what she wants, LadyBird never struggles to get what she wants. She never have to study hard or pull off hardships to make her dreams come true, aside from being suspended for being a jerk at school, dating a few jocks and throwing fits at her mom. She has it pretty easy. Her character is bratty and it's very hard for anyone to sympathize or relate to her as a person. I know I didn't. Would I recommend this film to anybody? Not really. There are many other movies with a similar theme so it is very likely that you have come across one of these films before. LadyBird just draws the same elements from most high school/teen dramas and repackage them into a different setting with different characters and that is it. The plot is rehashed and recycled, it makes the film quite forgettable."
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,9/10,"'Lady Bird' is a honest and truly clever coming of age story. a substantial story arc is missing, however this film doesn't need it. and Saoirse Ronan, again fails to disappoint. why cant more films be like this, 9 stars"
LADY BIRD,15 April 2018,9/10,"A beautiful story that's more than coming-of-age. Lady Bird embodies what family means. The plot is about Lady Bird's mom just as much as it is about her. Watching Christine grow up learning from her mother, despite how often they butted heads, reminds us how our parents play one of the biggest roles in our young lives. It was heartfelt and thought provoking. I recommend it so that we can all be reminded of how much we need to appreciate our loved one."
LADY BIRD,14 October 2018,8/10,"I found Lady Bird to be a beautifully written and acted film which is let down only by a couple of old tropes.One is the ""fat best friend"" trope and the other is a variation on the ""all the good men are gay"" trope.Apart from these flaws, this is a moving and entertaining look at coming of age as a non-conformist on the west coast in a Catholic School."
LADY BIRD,15 October 2018,6/10,"I finally saw Lady Bird and... I was not happy to discover that it is not Oscar worthy. The movie is nice, but it is no match to other movies competing in the Oscar race."
LADY BIRD,17 February 2021,9/10,"The protagonist's desperation to transcend her lot in life is undoubtably driven by a troubled mother who wildly vacillates between martyr and monster. This deeply unhappy and disappointed woman appears to find relief in making an emotional punching bag out of her strong, whimsical teenage daughter. Her relentless and demeaning ""who do you think you are"" criticisms and put downs almost seem to come from a place of jealously. These demoralising hurts are confusingly cushioned with the occasional gesture of kindness; gestures likely motivated by feelings of guilt and a momentary need for contrition. One gets the sense that Mother's letter writing at the end is more an exercise to absolve herself, rather than a genuine gesture of appreciation for Lady Bird herself.One of the hardest things for a child to reconcile is being unappreciated and unliked by a parent. In such situations, there is nothing a child can do, or accomplish in life for to win that love; although some may spend a lifetime futilely trying. Fortunately, our Lady Bird seems to have a strong survival instinct.
While she may not yet fully understand or accept the strange dynamics that have shaped her, she intuitively knows to get herself out, far and away, whatever the cost. Father seems to understand this too. Only then can our brilliant and capable Lady Bird begin the difficult work of rising above."
LADY BIRD,24 October 2018,3/10,"This was one of the most overrated, overhyped, overacted movies I've seen in a long time. I've heard all the arguments against my view of this movie, and none of them really made sense. Don't waste your time on this film."
LADY BIRD,15 June 2019,7/10,"I'm a guy. Didn't enjoy it. Fast forwarded. It's probably not aimed at me, but when movies get such 'good' reviews by the critics (who I'm beginning to think these so called critics more and more full of s*%t) you have to take a look."
LADY BIRD,7 June 2018,3/10,"I love indie movies, especially those about human relationships. When I heard about Lady Bird, I was so looking forward to seeing it. What a disappointment! All of Lady Bird's experiences seem so superficial. I didn't find humor in anything. Lori Metcalf is one dimensional. I just ... don't get it. I'm glad she came to appreciate her mom and hometown, but just because she heard a choir after getting alcohol poisoning? I found nothing charming about Lady Bird."
LADY BIRD,9 June 2019,9/10,"Truly great movie that I would describe as not just a psychoanalysis of a typical California teenage girl but also an anthropology of the modern american society in a capitalist system that really puts people's livelihoods, their daily lives, their interactions with one another, their attitudes to each other, their overall mental state into big turmoil. This movie helped me explore so much of the chaos that people in America go through as they grow up and how this society shapes them. As you can see in the movie they all seem to be all so different and ""unique"" individuals yet they are all very much alike because they are all participating in this social experiment called the modern American Life. I call that experiment a chaos. I don't know if the director or the makers of this movie had the intention to or understand themselves one truly beautiful gem about this movie which is the fact that it shows how every single character in the movie is mentally sick yet they do not realize it. For example: - take the mother who has passive aggressive disorder and is obsessed with getting into a better financial situation. - take that rich kid who's gay and has many complexes associated with it, not to mention the fact that a homosexuality is a sickness of its own, both mental and physical ((if you think I'm a homophobe after you read this, it's ok you are sick too - your diagnosis is called idiotism!) - take the father who seems to be a truly great man yet has depression problems because of the circumstances a capitalist system can put anyone in (and by anyone I mean anyone, even those with an MBA from UC Davis). - or the old priest who runs the theater, he too has psychological problems - or even that kid Kyle who at first seems legit since he's always reading books and contemplating on things with supposedly critical mind, he too, very soon disappoints with his pretentiousness and shallowness. Apart from the characters the movie also does a great job pointing out the stupidity and the sickness of the popular, progressive ""liberal"" approach to what has always been known as the identity crisis. For example, the main character's insistence that her name is Lady Bird. It's good that they show at the end of the movie how the character finally matures in that aspect and understands she really is Christine. I wonder when the ""liberal"" and progressive America will mature and understand that mental, psychological and other disorders should be treated and in order to be treated it should be first correctly identified, diagnosed. This movie is ""the catcher in the rye"" of the millennial America and an unintentionally critical glimpse of its egocentric society."
LADY BIRD,14 November 2019,9/10,"I mean, what's wrong with you people? I have seen ""the perks of being a wallflower"" with an 8, and it's totally overrated and full of clichés. Lady Bird is an original, true, and a little bit of painful story about teenagers. The action takes place in 2002 and it's about a girl that tries to find herself, she wants to make her way through life and in her señor year she gets to experience some things and also gets a taste of the real world, out of her box, where boys lie and rich girls are just beautiful and mean. She just wants to escape out of her city and go to college far away from home, she wants to be understood but she also wants space. Her mother is next to her all the way, and Christine aka Lady Bird, just wants to grow up, by her own. In the end she appreciates all the things that have been done for her, she loves her mother, but she just wants to live. Throughout the entire film, she just wants to be called Lady Bird, and by the end of it, by painting her walls that used to be filled with a lot of her old thoughts and the fact that with the moving to another city, she finally accepts her name, Christine, the name her parents gave to her, she becomes a grown up, more than she ever thought, she is finally able to express her feelings, and now for the first time, for the people who actually cared about her. I think these are the problems every teenager struggles with, nowadays. Pretty awful, but pretty true. And about the performances? Brilliant. Saoirse Ronan is quite a wonderful actress."
LADY BIRD,25 April 2020,1/10,This movie was extremely boring and really weird. Not even worth the watch and thought it would be more interesting. It was a disappointment and I really had high hopes. Don't understand how this got a average 7 and Charlie's angel got a 4.6. I'm truly flabbergasted.
LADY BIRD,13 March 2020,10/10,"Lady Bird is my favourite film, and it being Greta Gerwig's directorial debut makes it that much more fantastic. On the surface it may be just a coming of age story but there's so much more to it. The lack of clichés, realism, and understated nature makes it relatable, but the characters and setting offsets that and gives it that indie film niche charm.As well as this, the cinematography is beautiful, but just as understated as everything else. The beautiful location, and pastel colour palette makes it absolutely gorgeous to look at, which is quite contrasted with the unlike-ability of so many of the characters. Gerwig doesn't shy away from the toxic behaviours expressed by teenagers, but unlike so many other coming of age films she doesn't try to justify their actions due to unpopularity or other dumb teen politics.(without giving spoilers) the closing moments definitely make this film for me. With a different ending I don't think this film would be nearly as wonderful or emotional. This is the type of film that has to be watched in one go in order to really take it all in.Overall, it will undoubtedly age into a classic due to it being a coming of age film without being a teen one. While I might currently relate to Christine, the care taken into all of the characters allows for viewers to find resonance with all the characters, without it being a stretch. Because of that it can be watched and loved by individuals at all stages of life and can grow with the audience."
LADY BIRD,23 June 2021,10/10,"For a director's debut film, Lady Bird does everything I like in a movie. The cinematography is very clean and I enjoy every moment of it, it completely brings the story together subconsciously. The usage of negative space in a decent amount of the shots is something I particularly love, along with the placing of the actor that brings out emotion. The handheld sort of shaky shots used to bring nostalgia in Christine when driving through Sacramento, I appreciate that. The fast cuts as well make this film one of my favorites due to the cinematography alone.I don't wanna like a movie just because of the cinematography, but the cinematography is what made me fall in love with the movie. I think the topic of the movie even hits close to home to me as I am entering my senior year of high school and college is something to think about. I appreciate how the director captures the feelings behind college and family life. The movie overall is very good and something fun that I will return to again- even though this is my 3rd time watching it. Its very enjoyable and something I don't need to pick apart."
LADY BIRD,16 April 2020,7/10,"Youth is so rebellious and reckless, in fact, this one doesn't know what the rebellion and resistance exactly mean. Once we wanted to be cool, and finally accepted that I was not cool and not good enough.
Charming youth is to lose all that can be lost, the last left isall about love."
LADY BIRD,27 April 2020,4/10,"I think that labyrinth was a excellent movie and I like the idea of a younger woman falling for a older man,in todays society most women go for younger guys but older guys are more mature,know how to be better fathers,and usually are the marrying kind and are romantic.I am sorry that the story had a sad ending.I would do a remake with rob Lowe as jareth and brittany spears as Sarah where they adopt toby and get married at the end and create a new world with vampires that are romantic and all the goblins get adopted by Sarah and become beautiful.Then I would have Sarah act like a Angelina Jolie type meets xena warrior princess who can kick his ass and he acts like Christian Grey from 50 shades of Grey but dresses like a GQ version of gene Simmons meets Eric Draven with sharp suits like Grey.He charms her with gifts and shes not impressed so he wins he heart by becoming her best friend and gets the goblins to help him.He does a Billy Idol phantom of the opera beauty and the beast with a twist.They get married on Halloween at a underground nightclub."
LADY BIRD,28 April 2020,4/10,No you do not know it all and your acting is no goods.sorry but nobody cares.
LADY BIRD,28 April 2020,4/10,"This ain't no secret here.her crush sounds like the typical guy play hard to get,act interested.then boom.taken.oops.next number.sorry you thought I liked you,oh I thought you knew I was dating someone.oh well.poor girl,I felt so sorry for her.if the jerk knew she liked him and had a gf then leave her alone quit getting her hopes up.guys like this are the reason for zyprexa and prozac."
LADY BIRD,19 May 2020,8/10,"Watched this first on a plane and very happy I did, smart dialogue, strong acting, incredible lead-director collaboration."
LADY BIRD,28 August 2020,6/10,"The story was very predictable and has been done to death. The characters were one sided and not written very well. The film also wasn't shot very well. I did find it funny and relatable, but that's about it. If you're a teenage girl, im sure you'll enjoy it."
LADY BIRD,8 January 2018,4/10,"I'm officially starting a petition to ask for a TED with Mia Hansen-Løve and Richard Linklater, both to talk about how to make great coming-of-age films, and I want Greta Gerwig to sit on the front row so maybe she could learn something from them instead of Noah Baumbach, from whom she seemed to get all the wrong things about the subject: a completely naive understanding of generations gap; characters are written as goofy caricatures (are you all serious that none of you got bothered with that ""uglier-fatter-loser-best friend"" trope? At least in Super Bad Jonah Hill got Emma Stone), a script that struggles to deliver lines that feel truthful; and it constantly confuses honesty with superficiality. Nothing really resonate, nothing really cuts deep. It ends up feeling generic and the same old cute-indie-vibe wannabe we've seen so many times before (and got so annoying these days).Saoirse Ronan is definitely destined to greatness. I don't think it's the case for Greta Gerwig behind the cameras.The hypes of award season are such a strange thing."
LADY BIRD,3 October 2021,8/10,"A beautifully written, unique coming-of-age story and an intimate look into a complicated mother-daughter relationship. Flawless in my eyes! Greta can do no wrong!"
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,4/10,"Why didn't I like this? I like quirky movies but this just didn't do anything for me. I gave it 4 out of 10, because of it's few heart warming moments, but overall it felt empty in the end. Just a bunch of stereotypical scenes strung together to make a movie that is so beloved by a lot."
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,8/10,"Lady Bird is a good indie movie. The cast is great, especially the lead.
Thank you Greta, for making a ninety minute movie! I give it eight coz it is excellent. I take away two stars because of cliched identity politics and because of Lady Bird's Mom who keeps referring to hers and others social status."
LADY BIRD,22 January 2018,4/10,"Ok, maybe I'm a guy that can't understand the inter dynamics of a young teenage girl coming to age in Sacramento. The acting was good, but the story was pretty flat and routine. I wasn't surprised, I wasn't laughing, I wasn't crying, I wasn't really engaged in the story. I will say that the actors will very good, but the story line really left me scratching my head why the entire country has this consensus that this is some ground breaking, must see piece of art and I didn't see it. Jonah hill's sister in this movie was actually my favorite character. I didn't dislike this movie, I just would have no interest of watching it again like one reviewer, ""I've watched it three times already!""........... Why? Watch it once and consider yourself engaged in the avant garde process that is film making."
LADY BIRD,4 June 2018,5/10,"Excellent performances, but a bit like watching the film, ""Anywhere But Here"" which was made in 1999 with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. The same mother, daughter angst. Basically the same story. That was a bit of a disappointment and a bit too slow-moving."
LADY BIRD,16 September 2018,5/10,"I watched this film because it came highly recommended by friends, it seemed to be a darling of critics, and I was intrigued that a filmmaker would try to represent that really odd social existence that is working middle class. There are gobs of films about absolute poverty and dazzling wealth, but very few try to convey the banal mundane quiet suffering that takes place in middle America. You're not starving, you're not being shot at or going to jail, but you're not making it either, and you live a type of hand-to-mouth existence, cold in the winter wearing clothes that don't fit because you can't afford new ones. This is the type of reality I lived when I was Ladybird's age and wanted desperately to be able to connect with her and reconnect with myself. But the basic economic logic pushing the film is flawed and unrealisitc, the representation simply unrelatable (The family struggles to buy groceries one minute and the next they're refinancing their house? A refinance is ridiculously expensive.), and the performances dull. The cinematography is equally dull, with little to capture the eye or imagination. The soundtrack is unmemorable. Overall, this film is incredibly mediocre, with trite teenage-talking-back scenes and unearned moments of ""redemption.""Watch The Slums of Beverly Hills instead."
LADY BIRD,16 February 2018,2/10,Sadly I was expecting so much more. There are three things: 1) I really need to give mom a call to tell her I love her; and 2) so glad I have no daughters; and 3) The hype was just unwarranted (can one hire that many fake reviewers?
LADY BIRD,3 April 2018,10/10,"Usually I dislike dramas because they often merely reflect reality. I love other genres because they are surreal, telling a story about something you most likely won´t find in daily life. However, this movie surprised me! Although ""Lady Bird"" shows the struggles and obstacles of growing up as a teenager, it is not a dry story but rather sarcastically comments on life. In many instances it reminded me of my own relationship to my mother and although I was never as witty as Lady Bird, I indeed experienced love and frustration as a daughter who is just trying to find her place in the world. Definitely recommend 10/10"
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,9/10,"I finally got the chance to see this movie after hearing all of the accolades and buzz. I really enjoyed ""Lady Bird."" Watching some of the scenes between Lady Bird and her mother made me think of my own relationship with my mother (and I'm a guy). I can see why a lot of people can relate to this movie and why it hits so close to home for them as well.I liked the earlier scenes especially and how they basically set the tone for a coming-of-age story about a Catholic high school teenager and her senior year of high school in 2002-2003 Sacramento.I thought the acting in ""Lady Bird"" was really good. I enjoy watching Saoirse Ronan act and with her performances in ""Brooklyn"" (2015) and now ""Lady Bird"" (2017), she proves to be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.There were too many memorable scenes from this movie such as:I loved the scene when the football coach takes over the theatre department, controlling the rehearsal like it is one of his own football matches. That part was too hilarious.I also enjoyed the scene with the pro-life speaker and how Lady Bird bashes her presentation in front of the whole female section of girls. That part was so outrageous.Laurie Metcalf, who played Ronan's mother, gave an excellent performance. I loved how Metcalf portrayed her as tough and realistic but also gave her some heart especially during the second half of the movie when she picks up her daughter following Lady Bird's disappointed sexual encounter. It is nice to see a mother onscreen who, ultimately, understands what her daughter is going through at her age.Like mentioned in the title, ""Lady Bird"" sure makes for a nice late Friday evening movie."
LADY BIRD,4 February 2019,4/10,"This isn't that good of a movie. It's wandering, and unclear much of the time. I have no issue with cerebral or sad movies, but this tries too hard,
Characters are incomplete and uneven. The best part was the Football coach taking over the drama department...but even that explanation fell short. I wish better movies would be made these days"
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird advertises that it isn't just a movie about a girl coming of age. But it is actually just that. And there's nothing wrong with that. Especially when it's a pretty good movie.
Saoirse Ronan is an absolute pleasure to watch, and her Oscar nomination is more than deserved. It is quite interesting and entertaining to see how her character handles the relationships with the people around her, which, I think, is the key element of this movie. Mostly the love-hate relationship between her and her mother is both heartwarming and breaking at the same time.
All in all, it is just a movie about a teenage girl's struggles, but is a pretty good one!"
LADY BIRD,25 June 2020,5/10,Totally unrealistic. LB does not look at all like a school girl - and this spoils the entire movie.
LADY BIRD,6 October 2021,7/10,"I think this is a better coming of age movie than a lot of coming of age movies, because it's real and it's always awkward.All the conversations between Ladybird and her mom is unbeatable, you fight and next minute you just want to tell everything to your mom, it's a very daughter thing. You tried to hang out with cool kids in school but eventually the kids who act their age are the ones who support you no matter what. It happened to a lot of kids, it happened to me. Teenagers who eager to grow up, only to find out you still want to be the kid who complain to your parents, and only your parents are willing to accept you no matter how messed up you are.Ladybird gives people no lecture, it just lets you see ""this's what it's like to grow up"", it's a toast to all the uncool kids who struggle with too many questions, and please don't forget to call your parents if you feel something."
LADY BIRD,30 August 2018,1/10,A bratty girl that thinks she knows it all. You have to feel for her more than anyone else with problems in the movie. It's an awful movie. If I want to watch a 2000's teen movie I'll stick with Juno.
LADY BIRD,6 April 2020,2/10,"I had to fast forward to the end , a waste of time.,"
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,7/10,"I love Saoirse Ronan in this movie. She is hilarious,almost crazy. 
I loved how she portrayed her character ,Christine ""Ladybird"". She is different from everybody in the school,kinda like a nerd,except she is not a nerd. She portrays a girl that is not so popular in high school,and is a bit quirky.
 Her relationship with her mother is another story this movie tells. On the surface,she and her mother despise one another and can't agree to almost anything,but that is not true. They always fight because they are similar,and they have really strong independent personalities that just can't be contained. For me,their relationship was beautifully portrayed,with so many layers and so much depth. This movie is very heart warming and I enjoyed in it,probably because I am in my twenties and struggle with same problems as Ladybird. It's a very nice movie,fun and easy to watch. Totally recommend it."
LADY BIRD,24 November 2017,5/10,"I hated it. It was like watching an episode of Blossom. The only good part of the movie was Lucas Hedges, and he's barely in it. I thought I was going to see a cool, funny indie movie after seeing the trailer. But it was just a poor teenage girl in catholic school movie. I'm not a poor teenage girl in catholic school, so I could not relate."
LADY BIRD,4 December 2017,6/10,"I left the theatre after watching Lady Bird basically feeling nothing - not moved, saddened, hopeful, annoyed, just...nothing. I really like coming of age movies or books so had high hopes for this one, but I felt like it skimmed the surface of some interesting themes or ideas rather than actually exploring them and making something out of it. I would have liked to know more about the main character's mother, father, brother - all hinted at interesting hidden feelings or secrets, but the movie never actually went there to explain or add context to anyone's actions or reactions. It was also hard not to feel like Ronan was not just doing a Greta Gerwig ""omg I'm so awkward and I have no idea that people find this charming"" impression. I found a variety of scenes in the movie confusing (in the sense that I guessed the director was trying to evoke emotion or create a plot but it didn't really achieve it IMO):-why was the mother so weirdly mean to the daughter? that didn't make a lot of sense to me. If the mother had some deep issues buried, the one sentence about her mother being an ""aggressive alcoholic"" didn't really make me care enough about it to warrant her controlling behaviour -Christine (sorry can't bring myself to actually call her LB) expresses an interest in moving to NY for the ""culture"", but what about her life or behaviour suggests that she is at all interested in anything other than boys or getting out of her town? what is she hoping to achieve there? what DOES she want to see or do? -the director doesn't handle the whole ""I'm going to ignore my best friend and try to be friends with this popular girl instead who is inevitably going to be nasty to me and so I'll return to the original friend"" plot line very well - again, it's an interesting idea to explore, but there didn't seem to be a lot of reasoning as to why Christine went in that direction. She didn't seem at all interested in being popular/regular and so why the random action? -she also didn't seem to especially care about having money or not, and no one was really mean to her about it, so it also didn't make a lot of sense to me that her and her mother would want to go and check out the open houses of really expensive houses - if they had a deep shame of not having a lot of money, they didn't make me care enough about it, and it didn't seem to make sense for either characterI did like some parts, the best friend was funny and a good actress, and there were some comedic elements, but nothing that made me really laugh. I felt that the director tried to cover too many themes and ideas and didn't really hit home with any of them.Overall, a 'meh' experience for me, and seemed more style over substance."
LADY BIRD,18 March 2020,3/10,"I really can't understand how so many people think this movie is free of cliches. Every character from the aloof, pretentious rock and roll boyfriend, to the overbearing mom, to the unattractive best friend who gets left behind by the protagonist for a newer, hotter friend, the meek, fun dad, and of course the misunderstood artistic teenager who can't spread her wings in the drab suburban town she lives in.Lady Bird has just about the most middle of the road coming of age plot you could ever write, aside from a few moments of serious abuse that are not dealt with with any kind of gravity.The movie dragged on in a series of tired cliches with no humour or particularly interesting character or plot arcs, and I was thrilled when it ended. Really can't understand the hype."
LADY BIRD,3 September 2019,8/10,"I loved it. This is one of those movies that are not so much about the plot and the action itself rather than the bittersweet feeling it leaves in you. It is truly touching and depicts perfectly the life of a teenager - I am pretty sure that everybody can relate to Lady Bird on one level or another, I certainly did."
LADY BIRD,28 January 2018,1/10,"I really do not see what all the critical fuss and academy attention this bloated and overrated film is getting
 it's no better than the far superior Thumbsucker from a couple of years ago.Spoiled teen brat who attends catholic school in CA is mad because her parents can't afford to send her to Yale How about she get a job and instead of whining about it she pay her own way through college instead. No one owes her a college education.The main character is nothing more than a selfish and bratty teen who needs a good spanking.Overall I HATED Lady Bird and is my pick for the most overrated film of 2017."
LADY BIRD,28 March 2018,10/10,"I have seen Lady Bird twice now and I can truly say that I love this movie. I think it really captures the phrase ""coming of age"" perfectly as the struggles that Lady Bird goes through in the film are very relatable. I think everyone can at least relate to one aspect to this film whether it is the mother daughter relationship, Lady Bird's relationships, or her wanting to get out of her town. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf both give amazing performances and Greta Gerwig does an excellent job for her first directorial debut."
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,9/10,"I saw this with my wife and teenage children, we loved it. The characterisation was completely believable at the same time as being tender, intimate and funny."
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,6/10,Very good movie. I would recommend to a friend. 10/10.
LADY BIRD,3 January 2018,10/10,"I found this film to be incredibly relatable and touching.
The entire cast was superb, specifically Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalfe, who I hope to see take home oscars!
Definitely would recommend this, especially for film-lovers."
LADY BIRD,6 April 2018,7/10,"I'd like if my three years old daughter would be as smart and brilliant and simply as Lady Bird, also if she has to pass throught the inevitable conflicts with parents"
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,3/10,"Don't get me wrong i was really excited about this movie!So i sat down and i said to myself ""Let's just give this movie a chance, maybe it will be a hidden gem"". 
Inb4 i'm sitting there watching a re-run of every other teen high school/will you go to the prom with me- type of movie. No offence, but it was really underwhelming.The only actual funny scene in this movie was when she jumped out of her mothers car (which is also surprisingly in the trailer on Youtube) and nothing else. There was also a one liner-racist joke that she pulled on her brother and that was it. Oh and yeah let's make it even more anti-climatic and make her boyfriend gay because that hasn't been done before.""My name is ""Lady Bird"" not Christine....in the words of Jenna Walton (Odeya Rush)....""weird"".""But it's a coming of age movie""--No ma'am, it's not! If you do want to watch a coming of age movie, go watch ""The Breakfast Club"" or something.I don't get the ratings on this movie.Watch an hour long version of the movie trailer, it's wayyyy better, trust me."
LADY BIRD,7 May 2018,10/10,"Probably the best film I've ever seen - Sairose Ronan is great as Christine, and her relationship with her mum and friends is so relatable! Literally brilliant, me and my friend wanted to see it again!"
LADY BIRD,7 December 2017,7/10,"Lady Bird was pretty great and I definitely felt sucked into the movie the whole time. There really weren't too many things that really distracted from the experience aside from one thing I'll mention below. The pace was very fast paced but it felt earned and purposeful. Greta Gerwig wrote Frances Ha and Mistress America and I really liked Frances Ha, but Mistress America left me cold due to the final act and horrible direction. I'd pretty much call Lady Bird a Noah Baumbach movie with a much better sense of what it wanted to accomplish and how to do it. But one line felt weird to me.I'm a big fan of looking at a movie's world through a character's perspective. It sucks you into the world of the movie and definitely enhances the experience. But one scene I felt went against the regular boundary between audience and character. There's a scene where Lady Bird talks to her mom and it goes like this (I don't remember it TOO well).""Didn't you ever have a mom that didn't make you have everything be perfect?"" ""My mother was an abusive alcoholic.""I don't understand the purpose of that line. Lady Bird must've already known that and even if not, that's be a pretty awkward way to say it. I don't remember it cutting back to her reaction either. It's just meant to be a sort of ""Hey, you weren't expecting this were you?"" To the audience. I would've had it so her mom would've left the room, maybe about to cry. There was really a lot of room to put you in the character's heads here. They could've slowly revealed it, and soon had it dawn on you that her mother traumatized her. It's not a bad scene, just one that felt as it wasn't utilized to its full potential for me. Pretty great movie overall, though."
LADY BIRD,3 July 2018,10/10,"This film is an amazing movie. It explores the troubles of growing up and all the challenges along the way. The acting, directing, and writing were spectacular. Saoirse Ronan should've won the Oscar. The this amazing coming-of-age film. It's funny, sad, and heartbreaking."
LADY BIRD,9 January 2018,8/10,"The movie is very good,i highly recommend.It is very funny at times and i laughed out loud.I also loved the performance of Saoirse Ronan,her acting was on point,one of my favorite actresses!Anyway do watch this movie it is very good."
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,10/10,"'Lady Bird' by Greta Gerwig really resonated with me, probably because I find myself in a similar situation to the main character. 'Lady Bird' is built on its down-to-earth characters, and thanks to the impressive acting from Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf it was able to craft a realistic look at the life of a seventeen-year-old and the relationship with her mother.
The script, which Gerwing also wrote herself, managed to include great dialogue with outstanding lines without sounding staged, and it combined smart comedy with heartfelt drama in a sincere and genuine way."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,4/10,"I thought it would be more funny regarding the trailer and the scene in the car. 
It was not..."
LADY BIRD,6 April 2018,9/10,"I wasn't expecting much when I first heard of this movie if I'm honest but I thought I'd give it a go seeing as it was gaining a lot of Oscar talk and was nominated in a few categories. Well, I was so wrong to judge this movie before watching it because it was beautiful. I was especially impressed with the direction and screenplay. It was funny, sad, and everything in between. Even the very first scene sucks you into Lady Bird's world and from then on has your full attention throughout the whole film. The storyline does not progress quickly and is bound to disappoint many people. Overall Greta Gerwig's directing and writing makes this a winner and she executed it all perfectly. A deserving Oscar winner in my eyes, unfortunately it was overlooked."
LADY BIRD,28 March 2018,9/10,"This film was so true that it was almost hard to watch. This is not because it was hurtful. There is a resistance in watching something that has so much of you in it. I write this not just relating to the main character. Lady Bird has a bit of everyone in it- thus truly mimicking life. It is this philosophy that brings the higher level intelligence to the simple concept of the film. Breathtaking cinematography and editing add a praise worthy polish and appreciation for the film in and of itself. This is a much watch for all who invest much in movies and highly recommend for those whom may not be familiar with the more indy aspects of movies. Much to be gained, much was taken away."
LADY BIRD,23 May 2020,8/10,Beautiful and simple history about growing up that makes you remember your times in school and the problems with relationship with your family when you were teenager.
LADY BIRD,2 July 2018,10/10,I feel like female lead movies are more intelligent when they are actually written by females. Love this movie so much.
LADY BIRD,18 August 2018,10/10,"This film is a gem, the character and her growing up process is so well depicted in a comedy drama style that is so safe and beautiful. That kind of films that mark a generation. It could've only been told by a female director. Delicate and fun."
LADY BIRD,17 February 2019,5/10,"It was ok, it was very slow and I guess it was somewhat relatable specifically the buying of the prom dress scene. Though I didn't end up with my overly pink dress and ended up looking like I was wearing my wedding dress.. Now that I have reached the end of this film I think 1 the hype got me I expected it to be amazing it wasn't and 2 Due to the hype I expected to really relate to especially since I was in a Catholic HS the same year this took place. But, I think it maybe is more people from small town that might find it relatable because I grew up in NYC, so those few random mentions of terrorism felt weird, and I never had this urge like I need to be somewhere else to experience things, so maybe I didn't love it because of me and maybe I didn't love it because of the hype, or maybe it just really wasn't that good, which is why I am landing at 5 stars because I didn't enjoy it but it may have been my fault."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2019,9/10,"Lady Bird is a film about a teenage girl's search for identity, in the Greta Gerwig's perspective. The film where I first came to know about Greta Gerwig is Frances Ha. Generally she portrays life in a pretty realistic manner with a sprinkle of comedy. Lady Bird is no exception. It has nothing to surprise. Perhaps we don't need to be surprised constantly by something. The highlight for me is the story and the brilliant acting performances by the cast. Saoirse Ronan is in tune as always. I think Lady Bird is a must watch."
LADY BIRD,26 August 2019,3/10,"If this is the life of teens these days, our world is in sad shape. I hurt for these kids having to portray teens this way.
They are so much better than this. This movie was awful. Best thing I can say is the acting was fair. But, the story line, the editing, the scripting? Terrible. I wish I could have those 90 minutes back...not to mention my $4 rental fee. If this is Best Picture material, I'm giving up on movies forever."
LADY BIRD,11 June 2018,3/10,"The best part of this movie is the acting of some of characters. I looked at my watch because this film was not very interesting. It never got better. The main character was a cheater, lier, selfish and definitely not a ""Lady"". They got themselves into trouble with out consequences. I just did not care about her. The mom had no idea how to deal with her. The is a bland movie which goes nowhere. Nobody seems to grow from their experiences. What is the payoff for this ""Lady"" she gets her dream and puts the parents into financial difficulty. She gets drunk and winds up in a drunk ward of a hospital. Realistic? Sorry, this is an example of how not to raise a child."
LADY BIRD,5 May 2020,10/10,Waooo superb movie.... literally the best...I had watched it twice or thrice during this quarantine... seriously the best I watched till now...
LADY BIRD,10 May 2020,9/10,"One of the best coming of age movies. Saoirse Ronan plays the titular role naming herself as such, as an escape mechanism so as to being a bird, flying outside Sacramento when the time comes. She does this also to have a new identity and she asserts her new name given every chance she got. The relationship with her mother is really relatable, as most teenagers do it. Love the cinematography and pacing all throughout."
LADY BIRD,15 July 2020,9/10,"Funny and wise at the same time. The approach to the age transition is admirable; it is super relatable without being overwhelmingly realistic. The story is simple and beautiful but what makes Ladybird an amazing movie is the characters;Apart from being well-played, every character in the movie is unique and representative. Each one of them reflects a type of teenager growing up(which is what makes the film so relatable).''The good'' and ''the bad'' is not a thing in Ladybird. Every student of that Catholic school is going through his own problems and teen viewers will understand that. However, the performances are powerful enough to make parents sympathize with the heroes as well.
Overall, Ladybird is pleasant story recommended to everyone,especially to those who are sick of cliche teen dramas."
LADY BIRD,8 June 2021,2/10,"I seriously do not get why this movie received such positive reviews.The character is unlikable and un-relatable. Is this what American teens are like? Spoiled, self entitled, completely self centred and unrealistic? Life in the Big Apple should teach her a lesson.Why did I spend two hours of my precious life to watch some spoiled teen girl's struggle and hurtful behaviour?!Grow up. We don't care about your struggles."
LADY BIRD,5 January 2021,7/10,"Actually this movie is a 'yeah ok!' movieThis movie is based on a girl named Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson. Who lives in a town called Sacramento and she wanted to see her life where she belongs to high society, livung in a beautiful good looking house and achieve high social status. So, this story is based on her journey how she get through her high school, ups and down in her love life and relations with her family (mainly with her mom) and how she realise her trueself.The message of this film is that (just my own thought) urban lifestyle, modern consumerism and excessive romanticism is ruining our mental healthiness and making us so ego maniac and shaping ourselves more a ""wannbe"" person. If you wanted to be happy then you can be happy anywhere in the world. You don't need to go the capital or pursue urban life style to be happy and be successful in your life. You just need to change your thoughts and start looking from a different angel which isn't pleasurable to you. Successful don't mean you can be happy or to be happy you need to be successful. Just be a realistic person(accepting your current situations) and be lovable and humble to your love ones. A person can be successful and happy in any part in the world where he/she live."
LADY BIRD,16 March 2021,6/10,"Lady Bird is a film that was released in theaters in 2017 of which stars Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet as two of the main characters. Right from the start the audience is taken into the film as we do not know what is going to happens or really given any detail about the film whatsoever although we can assume that this girl is with her mother and may have some sort of mental problem. Then the audience only gets hit with details that her and her mother are on a road trip to move to her new college of which she clearly is not happy about and an input as to the family troubles of being able to afford college for her or her brother. This makes me wonder what exactly is in store for the rest of the film.
Now we are immersed into the fact that the main character, Christine calls herself Lady Bird hence the film title. Oh my goodness and then she literally drops out of the moving car that she is in, I wonder what else could possibly happen. Then we are introduced to the world of 'Lady Bird"" where we discover that with her family financial troubles for her going to college she ends up in a Catholic high school. We now know that she pretty much has no life and no friends - oh wait she has one friend. But, for some reason Lady Bird does something to the audience that makes you want to know more about her.
We then learn that her family certainly has a lot of financial troubles as her father lost his job and she tries to get in to a college that is not Catholic. It is strange the way the film is depicted so far, but whilst somewhat entertaining it has its points of realism as well.
This film is so odd that I truly cannot put it into so many words. It is an experience that I believe any person watching can truly not get their time back after having watched the film. Yes, at the beginning you are immersed to find out what is going on, but overall I do not believe that there is anything really special about this film, and that being said I do not see why the film deserved any recognition other than for Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet's roles in the film. This was not a film I would recommend to anyone unless you have absolutely nothing else going on as it drags seriously and drives ultimate boredom."
LADY BIRD,26 March 2021,10/10,"One of the best films i have ever watched, the movie feels so real and enjoyable."
LADY BIRD,4 January 2018,6/10,"Maybe the issue is that there's nothing technically ""wrong"" with Lady Bird. It plays it safe, the story is relatable enough to any average Joe/Jane, so it's hard to hate. 
However, there's nothing special about the film. There are countless other similar indie films with far more engaging scripts and stories to be told. Lady Bird is rather full of already-done cliches from already-played characters. Laurie Metcalf is the only form of entertainment to be found, and even she isn't given a heap of content to work with... Much of the characters' stories and challenges were underdeveloped, and the dialogue was mostly cute nothingness. You've got a dad that the writer placess the ""he's struggling!"" tag on... but we don't really see it. You've got a mom that the writer places the ""she's really hard on her kid"" tag on... but we don't really see it. You've got a teen that she places the ""she hates her hometown... wait. No she doesn't... for some reason unknown... yes she does... nope. She loves it. Who knows!"" tag on... and we try to figure that mess out. There are some funny lines in there delivered well by the actors. But for the most part? It ends where it starts. There's no arch. No development. A lot of unexplained (though the lack of depth doesn't call for much). No climax. No challenges. No real reason to not get up and take a bathroom break while it's playing (you wont miss anything- promise). Average film. In every sense. It's worth a 7, but the sheep following the hype of this film and contributing to it gets it a 6."
LADY BIRD,18 July 2018,7/10,"Please allow me to explain my rating system. If it is an independent film I give it five stars to start. If it is directed by a woman I add a star. If it is directed by a woman of color or written by women of color I add a star. If it is directed by a woman I add a star. If it Is directed by or by a written by a woman of color I add another star. Content matters. Anything concerning class,race, gender discrimination, trans gender discrimination , class discrimination, social issues discussed in a meaningful way, anything that passes the Bechtel test I give another star or two. Unfortunately this film was disappointing to me but I can see its appeal to others who have never seen a movie or a film that addresses anything meaningful. I have been watching independent films for decades. So this is a generous seven. Unfortunately in the previews I saw the funniest scene, talk about a spoiler, given away in the first two minutes of the film. The rest was a snooze fest. Still, congrats to everyone. No insults intended to anyone."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2020,7/10,"Ladybird
Greta Gerwig is an amazing writer her first movie Frances Ha is one of my favorite movies. It's really relatable for millennial's trying to work their hit out and it is really heartwarming. Frances is a likeable character inherently redeemable and you ultimately want her to succeed. Ladybird I did not find to be a likeable character this is where this movie falls down, Ladybird is younger than Frances so you would expect her to be less mature, she is also unlikable and I found myself on many occasions hating her. She is incurious mean and ultimately not redeemable the other characters her parents her long suffering friend Beanie who is as usual brilliant are the one's that make this character good in anyway. It is a great coming of age story that fails in making the viewer root for the protagonist."
LADY BIRD,10 January 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird has become my favorite ""coming of age"" film ever. Actually, it is much more than an ordinary coming of age film. Great storytelling, great acting, great cinematography...
The thing that affected the most about the movie is how successfully convey the feeling.. I did not go to a catholic school, I've never been in Sacramento, I've never hoped to go to an art school in New York.. But yet its feelings are so relatable, so close to heart.
Also, we cannot ignore the incredible acting. Saoirse Ronan is definitely one of the best actors of her generation. Actually since the Atonement, we know how successful she can be. And I'm sure she will get much more credit for her brilliant work. And the other actors of the film; Laurie Metcalf was amazing as the mother. And Timothee Chamalet; he is definitely the shining star of 2017! Extraordinary performances in the best movies of the year..
And lastly Greta Gerwig. What an amazing film making for a debut. We really need film makers like her. We need such refreshing approaches in the film industry. I'm looking forward to see her next projects..
All in all, great film. Congratulations to all who are involved."
LADY BIRD,15 May 2018,7/10,"The girl gets more radical.
But hope at the end.
Typical American expectations."
LADY BIRD,3 August 2018,6/10,"Sorry, i am 20 right now, but I still can't get the emotion in it. Maybe few years after I become a parent, I might feel the special kind of feel in this film."
LADY BIRD,29 December 2017,5/10,"Well made, well acted, well written, believable, real, etc, etc, but slow and boring.
 I would love to have been able to rate this higher, but quite frankly i couldn't wait for it to end (also absolutely not a comedy as listed)."
LADY BIRD,6 January 2018,4/10,"My apologies to the director of this movie because I am very supportive of fellow ladies that make films, but this review is not going to be very heartwarming. ""Lady Bird"" follows a teenage girl in Sacramento, CA, on her journey into adulthood. This is the premise of the movie and as though it sounds like many coming-of-age log lines you've already heard, this movie is nothing like them - because it doesn't follow up to the expectations it rises.A coming-of-age movie has to do at least one of the following things - firstly, be ""relatable"". The demographic audience of this genre watches these kind of movies because they want to relate to the anti-hero, the underdog. It's very hard to do that when the main character is an entitled, bratty girl who lives in S a c r a m e n t o. This fact was supposed to get watered down by financial issues of the family or the fact that she is ""weird"" and unpopular - but it just wasn't convincing enough.This brings me to my next point, which is acting. I'm sure that the director saw something of herself in Saoirse Ronan but Saoirse is just not this character - she doesn't look 18, she doesn't look OR act quirky/weird, she is simply too good looking and put together to play this role. If we don't believe all these things in the first place, we're never gonna buy the acting...Oh, the acting. I don't want to stay on this subject for too long - the cliché dialogue itself is enough to make the viewer roll their eyes but a good actor can even make this fly if they just say the words... but no, every and each sentence about a small-town girl with big dreams you've all already heard a million times before had to be super-emphasized. The story is clear. A girl doesn't feel like she belongs. She tries to be something that she's not. Some big grown-up things happen in her life that make her realize who she really is and she accepts that.
However, this has just been seen too many times before. Just last year, The Edge Of Seventeen succeeded in transferring the charm of a high-school weirdo to the big screen. But, this movie just doesn't do it - it's just not believable, at moments awkward to watch (not an emotion you want the viewer to feel), unrelatable, not even pretentious - it's just basic and nothing, it's nothing, it didn't make me feel anything, it wasn't even so bad that I would turn it off. So, again, if the director ever reads this - don't worry, you still did a better job than me and yes, I'm sure that making your first feature is hella hard, but this is just my honest opinion that I hope you can take something out of it..."
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,9/10,"I thought this was just another coming-of-age drama, but it was much more than that. Lady Bird is funny, it's romantic, it's heartbreaking, and it's beautiful. Every character is well developed, not one is left behind. The writing is so perfect, and the performances are even better. Saorsie Ronan give an incredible performance and my boy Timothee Chalamet shows up, but I hate his character in this movie because he's a little punk. Please watch this movie. This movie will make you smile and it'll make you cry, everything about it is just so perfect!"
LADY BIRD,4 February 2018,10/10,This really was one of the best films I saw last year. Worth the price of admission. Would rewatch some day.
LADY BIRD,12 August 2018,1/10,Movie was terrible. Why too many people liked and get high score. Unbelievable.
LADY BIRD,26 May 2020,9/10,"Lady bird wasn't a story of a teenager allegedly terrible life, it also wasn't only about emotional relationships as most movies that fit in the same genre do. It was a story about love, for oneself and for one's roots.
She is definitely a well-crafted character, she was alive even after credits!"
LADY BIRD,29 March 2018,10/10,"I went into seeing this movie without any idea what this movie was about. I knew that it was a coming of age tale but that was about it. As I walked away, I knew I had just seen something great.Firstly, the script was amazing. The dialogue between the characters was very flowing and felt very real. I felt invested in the characters and the situations they were going through because the script showed them as honest human beings. When a film does that, you know its good. Secondly, the acting. The acting was so honest and down to earth that the characters became even more developed and towards the end I began to feel for them. They really sold the comic moments and the felling of growing up and discovering yourself. Finally, the cinematography. While I was watching this I didn't pay too much the the cinematography, partly because I was more invested in the story, but upon thinking about it, it was beautiful. I was shot in a way that kept the audience interested for its whole run time and at no point was I thinking about anything else. Overall, this film will go down as one of my favourites for being real, heart felt and beautiful."
LADY BIRD,27 April 2020,1/10,It's the story of a f* spoiled girl who does not give a damn about the hard work her parents do to raise her and to provide to the family
LADY BIRD,8 April 2018,5/10,"Not sure what all the fuss is about. This movie was quite an ordinary teen movie. Well enough acted, but boring story. Predictable show of a totally ordinary puberty phase. Being relateable is not a good trait in it self. Good acting, boring story."
LADY BIRD,9 April 2018,10/10,"Ladybird is bright, fresh and unique. I loved it so much. Measured and funny and endlessly watchable. Greta Gerwig has always been a wonderful actor but I think, if possible she shines even more brightly through the screen as director and writer. Saiorse Ronan is indescribably perfect too. What a lovely film"
LADY BIRD,26 April 2018,9/10,"Lady Bird had me make one of the most important decision in my hole life, to write a review.
 At the beggining, I could swear for the movie's God, I started, scene by scene, to hate so much the attitude and the way Christine throws away everything her parents do and feel for she. It could be for the main reason that i felt that she was just a poor child with mental issues and no rage control. But suddenly, and by the moview move into a more complex theme, I started to appreciate the powerful and completely magnificency of the Saoirse Ronan's play. Lady Bird turns into the story of, almost, the life of middle and low class jr school teenegers from America, and for me,was enough to say that this is one of the most important films in the year, and everyone need to see it. No for the wonderful acting, or the beautiful assembly, even the great work with the photography or the funny music... This needs to be seen for the message that give to us ""Grow up,and understand that, no matters how the life sucks, there's always a reason (your familly, church, friends, art, love...) to do, and give your best""..."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,9/10,"The point that Lady Bird could touch audience's heart is its realistic scenes that we can all relate to while we are in our teenage. Lady Bird hopes she could be a bird and fly away, but she never imagine how the true world is, she is naive, immature, impulsive, but fearless. When Lady Bird realized it and decided to grow up, she started naming herself Christine, the name given by parents----which could be considered as a come-back to home or parenting-----that's the time Lady Bird grows up. Being mature isn't mean that we are independent from parents or home, it's rather a childish act for proving oneself's ability to deal with everything by his/her own. Being truly grown up is, we started to cherish what we have, what we always neglected, being confident, brave, and still have beautiful belief in life. I wish every Lady Bird could be grown up into a better adult Bird, don't lose our pureness and faith, still we can fly to wherever we want, as far and long as we can."
LADY BIRD,25 March 2018,9/10,"I saw Lady Bird the very day it came out on itunes, because no theatre near me was play it (I'd have to go to a different country to catch it at a movie) and I was absolutely enamoured by it. 
I am at a similar point in my life right now, as Lady bird is at the start of the film, and I could see little bit of her in almost all my classmates and myself even. Not only her, I saw Gerwig's characters and I see them in people around me. I felt this weird sense of being understood wash over me, in a way very few YA films (or maybe none at all) ever did. Lady Bird's flaws were so well defined and that made her so relatable. She is not the perfect hard-working protagonist, who is always the good girl, falling in love with the cute guy that walks into the school one day. She is messy and she is real and that's the beauty of her. I also love how the film didn't make you feel extremely hopeful for Lady Bird, and did not sugarcoat certain experiences, such as Lady Bird losing her virginity. It just ends at a point that's just perfect, even though it might not seem that way to most of the usual moviegoers. Life goes on, it's messy, the cute guy you have a crush on is lying to you, no one loves you more than your mother, you may pretend to hate where you grew up but you know you will miss it when you move away, your best friend may not be the most popular person but DUDE THEY'RE YOUR BEST FRIEND, you don't have to like the music everyone else does, Greta Gerwig touches on it all, in just 93 minutes. I've seen a lot of people complain about this film, but for me Lady Bird is the 2nd best film to come out in 2017, right after Call Me By Your Name. 
Oh and did I mention Laurie Metcalf and Saorsie Ronan? What beautiful talents!"
LADY BIRD,25 August 2018,4/10,"The coming attractions for 'Lady Bird' seemed promising - teasing the funny, witty, intelligent and genuine story of a teenage girl's coming-of-age in Northern California. In part I was expecting this film to be a sort of female-driven, Americanised variation of Richard Ayoade's terrific 'Submarine'; an oddball adolescent struggling with school, love, sex, family and identity in the most charming, depressing and authentic way possible. Sadly, these expectations were left unmet. The main problem with 'Lady Bird' lies in the fact that it is bland. At its core, the film lacks sincerity or any semblance of teenage truth. Unlike some of the better films in this genre, it lacks the essential punches and quirks that ultimately colour the heart and believability of the story. Largely, 'Lady Bird' falls nothing short of predictable. Failing on both the humour front and on the guise of it being 'relatable', so much of the film was so embarrassing and contrived I found myself writhing and wincing at it in the theatre. Perhaps the film's utmost disappointment is the protagonist herself. Our titular 'Lady Bird' is so deeply unlikeable, so entitled, so manipulative that I genuinely found myself unable to sympathise or resonate with her in any way whatsoever. Refreshingly, though, Laurie Metcalf and Saoirse Ronan have wonderful chemistry and the delivery of their onscreen mother-daughter relationship was the film's great success. Admittedly a very thoughtful and interesting feature of the story, I feel it did not save the film.While this film is very cleverly marketed as Indie and unconventional, it meets just about every Hollywood teen drama trope there is. Protagonist wants to hang out with the popular kids so she ditches her best friend. Protagonist wants to date musician who is very obviously pretentious and unkind. Protagonist lies to popular kids about her home life for no reason other than to create artificial tension. Boring. Boring. Boring.When viewing 'Lady Bird', expect a film passable but not at all provocative, funny, new or insightful."
LADY BIRD,18 November 2017,10/10,"Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" is a captivating tale of love, life and coming of age. Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a 17 year old self proclaimed 'lady bird' feels caged in her small community hometown of Sacramento, California.New York City street lights, glossy magazine inspired beauty, the illusive enchantment of fairy tale love and an irrepressible penchant for sophisticated affluence beckon Lady Bird to spread her wings and soar into horizons of no dreams deferred and the undisguised voyage of life.A beautiful, kaleidoscopic journey of chasing personal passions, conquering defeat and rising to the challenge, ""Lady Bird"" is a must see.#ILoveLadyBird"
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,4/10,"Since I am not a woman or a teenage girl from Sacramento, I just could not relate to this movie at all.Really Greta, what on earth made you think the masses of movie watchers of the world would or could care about your supposedly unique upbringing in the tiny demographic of Sacto, CA?You most certainly did not have amazing and unique experiences as a teenager. In fact, most all of us have had similar and probably more interesting experiences when we were teens.The acting and cinematography were very good but those two things do not make a movie great. It needs an interesting story, one that appeals to more than just teenage girls. Sorry to say, but you might want to stick to other scripts -- avoid writing your own."
LADY BIRD,31 December 2017,1/10,"This film can be made by anyone.
The story is lame, the characters are just ordinary people,
Watching this movie is the most depressing thing I have ever done during 2017, and a worthless one, too. 
If I can get a refund of the movie based of the experience, I will."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,1/10,"I've watched a lot of coming-of-age movies in my time and when I saw the trailer, I was excited for something new and different.Sadly, this is nothing new, in a nutshell: a teenage girl is so ashamed of her life that she lies about where she's from, ditches her chubby/dorky best friend for the 'it' crowd, loses her virginity to someone she later hates, hates her mom, and can't wait to move away from her depressing town...There are so many clichés in this film, I honestly don't understand what the hype is about because it's the same story being told for the umpteenth time, only less interesting. There really was nothing to make it stand out."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,9/10,"The mother and daughter dynamic in this film is something I related to deeply in the context to the relationship I have with my father, this may have lead to me being a little bias in the affect the film goes for.
Regardless, I must say, this is the best coming of age film I have seen in a long time. It has both as humbling scenes as it does tear shedding ones and throughout many of the situations and themes highlighted create this idea of being content with what you're given in life.
You could argue that this is the ""rich-people's problems"" of melodramas, however, I would argue that as someone living in a border-line middle class family, that this reflects many people out there. The film highlights themes of, being outdated and replaced as well as, coming to terms with growing and accepting those who care for you. 
The one major detractor I would say the film has is a sub-plot whereby Lady-Bird tries to be part of the 'cool kid' group and has it come to spite her in the end.
Overall though, I would say that as this film had such a personal effect on me I would highly recommend it to anyone. And like I said, you might possibly feel like you're living in the dull town of Sacremento too."
LADY BIRD,12 February 2018,8/10,"Memorable. But I thought the characterization of the Catholic school was extremely inaccurate, not believable. Priests do not act like that. The popular girl at the Catholic school did not exist at the one I went to but did and even looked like her at the public school to which I transferred. Same with Kyle, not Catholic. Many many nuances existed at the public school, not the Catholic, and I don't think the character would have said or done many of the things she did even not being Catholic because it's not the Nazi environment I saw portrayed here, but that's just my experience. Unfortunately that stayed with me and left a bit of a bitter taste.Having said that I just loved this movie and its lead."
LADY BIRD,10 March 2018,2/10,I am so surprised about people who give a high rate to such kind of boring movies .In my opinion it was a boring and ridiculous film that is the long and the short of it I was so angry bc it is the second time I am got misled by the ratings of IMDB ; the first time was when watching : the shape of water which was the most ridiculous movie I have seen since months and I don't know how this one received an Oscar and the same thing is applicable to Lady Bird .
LADY BIRD,21 February 2018,2/10,"This was the most boring, uninteresting movie I've ever had to sit through. It was almost endless compilation of seemingly pointless rising action scenes, making you think it is building up to something but never actually getting to any real story. Instead it shoehorns in tons of different story lines and tropes, none of which are address in an interesting way or even in way that makes them feel resolved. For example, when the Ladybird finds her boyfriend kissing another boy in the bathroom, they instantly jump to her and friend crying in a car (I'm not sure who's car it is, because at this point in the story neither of them can drive.) and then... 
Nothing. The fact she caught her boyfriend kissing someone else is not addressed for feels like another 20 minutes and when it is brought back up it's just for him coming crying on her shoulder and her to say ""Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."" after which he disappears too never to be seen again in the film. 
And don't get me started on the pacing. No scene seemed to last to more 20 seconds, it was constantly rushing through and jumping from scenes to scene with almost no transition. (My guess, so that they could fit in more pointless scenes and unresolved story lines) if any thing of interest did happen (which, were few and far between) it was over in seconds and they were moving on to the next thing. And yet even with its crazy, fast, scene pacing it still manages to drag out FOREVER. managing to make it's hour and a half run-time feel like five. I got so bored that I actually sneaked off to the bathroom to look up the run time in hopes that it was almost over. 
On a positive note though, I thought the all the actors and actresses did an amazing job, with all of them being extremely believable.
P.S. Can I just mention, The writers made such a big deal about Danny wanting to curl his hair for the performance, to the point that Ladybird buying him a hair curler is who they start talking but then when he is actually performing in the play his hair is just as straight as been the entire movie. (I don't know I just thought that was a little lazy,)"
LADY BIRD,3 March 2018,1/10,"We watched this only because of its Oscar nominations.
You would think there would be something extraordinary about this movie due to the lever of attention its getting but no. 
Its extremely ordinary to the point of boring. 
A set of family squabbles and inane teenage babbling that can be seen in any episode of the many standard run of the mill soap operas that never end on TV.The most exciting thing in the movie is when Saoirse Ronan throws herself from a moving car at the start of the movie , it should have stopped there , it never gets any better and the following 80 minutes or so are wasted on this rambling drudge of a movie."
LADY BIRD,12 April 2018,10/10,"So wrong, yet so right. So simple, yet so charming. Would definitely recommend!"
LADY BIRD,22 June 2018,8/10,Una historia dé iniciación bien contada. Cine intimista sin pretensiones.
LADY BIRD,8 July 2021,5/10,"This is an interesting moviethats the only thought i had throughout the entire filmwhy? I dont watch many coming of age films- but i do know how characters are often written. The cliche main character who has no personality, makes a few mistakes and then goes on a sudden redemption arc to prove they are a good person. Lady bird has personality (a little too much if ya ask me), makes so many mistakes and tries to redeem herself. Many say that she is a cliche archtype of a teenager with drama, an edge and self absorbed tendencies. I say- while she does have those characteristics- she also has the positives which is what makes her such a well rounded character. Examples include: humorous, bold, extroverted and determined. Do i like her? No. But i really do appreciate a well written character- especially teenage characters as you don't get those a lot. Some characters aren't made to be liked- but to be observed. Just like joe goldberg in ""YOU"". Many actions and words were absolutely uncalled for- and the biggest one to point out is how she pushes her mother to get into a pricey college. Last time I checked- your family isn't rich so drop the subject. Other times, reactions towards her mother's ANNOYING nagging and victimizing is definitely needed.Of course there are the cliches that i spotted miles away which defintely dumbs the story down. For example, the gay boy and of course the cool hot kid- both love interests where i could immediately see the very obvious intentions/motivations behind each character. Or lady bird's embark on joining the popular group and finally growing up leaving that all behind. I will say that i really enjoyed the chemistry between her and her best friend julie- a lot of those scenes were really sweet and nostalgic. If anything- lady bird shouldve been written to be in love with her best friend instead. Is that too much? Whateves- with that dyed hair it wouldve been good ok?!Anyways, i am neutral about this film. It absolutely doesnt deserve all the rave. But i consider myself lucky- i came in with low expectations and im coming out with results that are higher and im surprised with that. But do not think that means i thought it was a great movie- because there are a lot of flaws. To name more, i would say the biggest one is a redemption arc. While i previously said that teenage redemption arcs are rushed and unbelievable, the writer had a chance to create a bigger and more emotional moment.. but of course- instead there had to be a weird phone call to her DAD and wait- he didnt pick up so it actually had to be a voicemail with an apology to mom for sneakily applying for a college in new york. The notes were also pivotal, and if lady bird and mom had a heart to heart conversation- it could've been brought up. The ending is what really subtracted the stars away unfortunately. On the other hand, i can imagine this happening in real life. I mean this is supposed to be realistic- so i can understand this choice. But with an ending that also felt rushed, I could see that there was too little character growth in lady bird and that was disappointing.Thanks a lot bird lady. It may have cost your mom and dad a lot to raise you- but it cost ME my time to watch this movie."
LADY BIRD,28 November 2018,8/10,"It's well put together, sweet, heartbreaking and simple. The performances are excellent from everyone, specially Saoirse Ronan & Laurie Metcalf (who are the heart of the movie). I don't see how anyone can not enjoy the movie. Definitively relatable. I can't see what Greta Gerwig does next."
LADY BIRD,31 May 2019,9/10,"Lady Bird is trying to get to college, but it's more in the background in a film that's mainly just about life in general. Some of these events don't even matter in the long run. But what makes Lady Bird (the film) special is that we're following these investing characters in events that DON'T matter."
LADY BIRD,28 February 2019,9/10,"It is very much an effort to portray the situations teenagers go through these days. Well, there have always been issues with their schooling, peers, parents, academic pressure, uncertainty of future etcetera. This one here is sharp enough to point some of these in lady birds life."
LADY BIRD,25 March 2019,9/10,"The film flows with a persuasive naturalness. Despite very many characters and sort of messy happenings, the film successfully sticks to reflecting things as they are."
LADY BIRD,5 April 2019,10/10,"It is a beautiful story about how the love of parents is enough to shape the future of their children, it is about growing up, discovering the world and wanting to return home with those who will always love it. But it is also about facing adultes by carrying our decisions as our parents taught us to do. It's about loving the life we have."
LADY BIRD,24 April 2019,10/10,"Because the script (by Greta Gerwig) is so sharp, and director Greta Gerwig stays out of her own way by keeping things simple and focused on her performers...the actors really get to shine. Everyone is big and well-thought out, but never over-the-top. Ronan, who is generally very, very good...really excels here."
LADY BIRD,14 May 2019,8/10,"Where many movies about teenagers and high school fail, Ladybird is able to succeed...
This 2017, Oscar nominated movie, made by female director Greta Gerwig, is a coming-of-age tale that follows Christine McPherson, ""Ladybird,"" in her final year of high school.
Ladybird manages to be a realistic and nostalgic take on the experiences of a teenage girl, all while being hilarious to the audience. This is something most high school movies fail at and it can make any actual high school student feel patronized. Ladybird is never patronizing and even celebrates what it's like to be a teenage girl.
Saoirse Ronan, Christine, and Laurie Metcalf, Marion, are an amazing duo as Mother and daughter and the chemistry between them is visible. They manage to capture the highs and lows of a mother-daughter relationship at that point in life. The point between childhood and adulthood, where a teenage girl needs her mother, but needs a taste of independence just as much.
Relatable and tender, Ladybird is perfect for any small-town teenager who has ever dreamt of something more from life. Christine's drive to get into the college of her choice is both relatable and inspiring. Christine's two romantic relationships throughout the movie, while being funny, can feel all two familiar to any teenage girl.
The sudden ending of the movie may leave some viewers unsatisfied, I would argue that it is the perfect ending. Although that chapter of Christine's life is over and the movie is done, it doesn't mean Christine's story is done altogether."
LADY BIRD,19 June 2019,8/10,"I'm kind of sad while writing this because I am very late to watch. First of all this story is way too realistic to be a teen movie, it reminds me of the movie called ""Submarine"". They are both realistic and good. Outfits and soundtracks on point and I liked the color of the movie. Christine is the girl who I never want to be, she ashamed of her real self and telling lies most of the times. Also Kyle is the most annoying person I have ever seen. We all love reading books but ""at party while smoking"" is weird and meaningless. I love Christine's best friend and her attitude. We see all the clichés in this movie but they are well built, I can say that I like this kind of clichés. Finally I can say that I like acting. They are so young and so talented. I like Saoirse Ronan. And I'm pretty glad that I have seen Timothée Chalamet before this movie. I adored his character in Call Me By Your Name but I don't like him in this movie because of the Kyle's personality. And I can say that he is really talented even just because of that. I can say that I'm pretty excited for Little Women."
LADY BIRD,12 June 2019,8/10,"Lady bird is an interesting coming of age story, although the movie doesn't revolutionize the genre , it still is a great work and a great depiction of life as a teenager.The film is well structured, and doesn't fall in the usual hollywood clichés of being a teenager, and rather give a more serious/untimate look on the life of this young woman as she's having her first experiences of adulthood.I really appreciate the chemistry between the actors, and i truly find some moments to be extremely touching and handled in a brilliant way.Finally i really liked this movie, and i recommend it to anyone who's looking for a light drama about life !"
LADY BIRD,21 May 2020,,A rebellious teenage girl living a senior year full of cliches.
LADY BIRD,11 February 2020,8/10,"Let me explain the title:
This film captures the main character, Lady Bird's, coming of age spectacularly. The tempo of the film was seemingly perfect, cutting quickly through the boring parts and focusing on the most life changing experiences Lady Bird faces. The acting was brilliantly realistic and the writing was emotional and funny without being cliche.With that having been said, I rated this film a 8/10 because at the end of the film, I was left wanting more. Perhaps because the storytelling was so good that I didn't want to snap back into reality, but I think it was more so that I was expecting something else. I was expecting the film to be building up to something or have an exciting twist, but as the screen faded to black and the credits rolled, I asked myself ""is that it? That's the end?"""
LADY BIRD,11 September 2019,7/10,I really enjoyed this movie playing in the background while I prepared dinner.
LADY BIRD,22 March 2021,7/10,"Lady Bird was a good film. It reminded me of a network television show about a teen growing up, but better and with higher production quality. It was short simple and little heartwarming.The pacing of the film was good, it didn't feel too long and I sat through it with full attention. The film was a little funny at times as it made me chuckle.Saoirse Ronan played a good part and she fit the roll nicely as the main protagonists. All of the other cast members were good too. They weren't groundbreaking but still good.Since this film didn't really have much of a complex story, it doesn't have that much to talk about. I did like the setting and music of the film though.Overall, nice and short film. A24 films give me a certain vibe that no other company can, I can't explain the feeling. Nonetheless, it was one of the better A24 films. I'll probably watch Lady Bird again just for fun."
LADY BIRD,6 October 2020,10/10,Everything in this movie has passion love and heart. Greta Gerwigs first solo writing and directing job is amazing. She is very passionate about the work and clearly loves what she is doing. Saoirse Ronan is increible adn clearly should have won best actress at the oscars. This movie has gotten me through tough times and just it is very relatible highly reconmended
LADY BIRD,3 April 2020,9/10,"This movie gut punched me twice, in a way no recent movie has. I found myself sobbing, able to relate so closely to the mother and daughter experience. I am now a mother and have lost my mother, and am just now beginning to understand what my own mother was going through. This movie isn't for everyone, but if you had a complicated overly honest mother who didn't know how to tell you she loved you but you know she truly did... well... this movie is for you. Great acting, like able characters, never strays too far to the dark side."
LADY BIRD,22 April 2020,8/10,"Love bird was Greta Gerwig's debut film that had good opinions, it's a comedy and drama movie that is about a seventeen years old girl ""Lady Bird"" in her senior year of high school and the problems, situations and experiences that she has.
I like this movie because is so realistic and show points like economics problems, relations between parents and children, and random "" teenagers problems"" that we could have
I think the plot is really good because Lady bird experince things that teenagers live in this age in a real way like her first boyfriend or experiences wiith her best friend, beside she has discussions with her mother. In the other side the economic problems somehow affect her dream of being accepted in the college that she wants to go.
It was a good performance since it has great scripts and really good actors."
LADY BIRD,30 April 2020,10/10,"Offering great performances, steady humor, and emotional resonance with It's characters; Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird is a fantastic portrayal of high school adolescents and growing up. Just about as fantastic as It's complex moral bounds!"

LADY BIRD,16 June 2020,1/10,"As of today the quality of American movie industry is in a huge uncertainty point. This movie this is so overrated . It was boring, with no story , not a single funny scene as its a comedy drama movie. Silly and unattractive characters . Grass growing is more attractive than this movie. You would expect something to happen but it never does till the end of the movie."

LADY BIRD,4 December 2020,5/10,"Came from Gerwig's Little Women which I absolutely adored but was dissapointed by this one. Just an average coming of age story, I seriously don't get the hype. An outsider tries to find herself, yeah, a lot of us can relate but we've seen that countless of times. And the movie doesn't even introduce the topic in an interesting manner. It literally uses all the clichés from the fat insecure friend to trying to make friends with the cool kids who turn out to be not so cool by the end. I like how they included the character of Kyle, these so called artistic men who will masplain everything to you and gaslight the **** of you are so common yet they're rarely in these kind of movies. And idk if that was the intention of the director or not but Lady Bird definitely deserved better. She was verbally a****d by her mother, constantly reminded that she's not enough and that she's a burden to the family ( while being at a sensitive age and under a lot of pressure). ""Do you know how much it cost to raise you ?"", excuse me ma'am, should've thought bout that before you had her. That's why I hated when she got rid of the self given name at the end. The name represented her resistance against her mother which was very much valid. Her mother a****d her so she tried to take away the identity her mother created for her ... in the end she gave up cause of nostalgia or whatever. We do all we can to feel safe again. Saoirse was amazing, the movie was nice, just average to me."

LADY BIRD,24 October 2021,6/10,"It was a okay movie nothing much happens in it though. The relationship between Christine ( lady bird ) and her mother is so relatable that I can see why people liked it . In my opinion booksmart was a little bit better, I would recommend it if you liked lady bird. Overall lady bird has a good cinematography and a beautiful vibe all around. The relationship between Christine an her mother is what makes this movie good."
LADY BIRD,28 January 2018,10/10,"I'm from Sacramento so I enjoyed this fabulous film all the more. It was surreal to see it at the Tower Theater which, itself, is featured in the film. It opens with the kind of gang-busting that you wouldn't think could possibly keep pace with itself. But then it miraculously does...not a boring scene in the lot. No chase scenes, no special effects, just a raw, edgy, authentic, and beautiful piece of work.Of course, how can you go wrong with the lovely and talented Saoirse Ronan so fully and complete nailing the title role? The frankness of this film was refreshing and interesting to watch and all of the supporting roles were outstanding. A fun tribute to Sacramento!"
LADY BIRD,26 December 2017,1/10,This movie is very boring with poor character development such that I never care about any of the characters or their issues. This is the archetype for the overrated circle jerk indie film that is not worth watching.
LADY BIRD,13 December 2017,9/10,"A movie like Lady Bird falls in the same line as 'American Beauty' or other such films which depict the life of a common American. Here it is tracing the journey of a high schooler through her admission to college and everything in between; falling for singing band guys, first time sex, an overly protective mother, pressure of being judged, life at Catholic school ..to name a few.
The various aspects of the movie are depicted in an extremely natural way which would form an instant connect with the audience. Whether you are an adult who has faced similar issues in high school, or a father who cares for her daughter enough, one finds glimpses of everyday characters we encounter.
The movie starts erratically but finds semblance , pace and emotions guzzling towards the later half.
A must watch and kudos to Greta Gerwig and all actors in the movie for playing their part so well."
LADY BIRD,17 April 2020,1/10,One of those movies that the critics and amateur film snobs eulogize over. Complete waste of time. Boring and uninspiring cliche of a film. Avoid.
LADY BIRD,10 May 2021,3/10,"At first I thought perhaps I had become too old for the adolescent coming of age story and that's why I didn't like the film. Upon further thought I realized the film just isn't good. It suffers from cliche and poor writing. I realized this because I remembered how I love many coming of age films, like Richard Ayoade's ""Submarine"", or perhaps the more recent ""8th Grade"" by Bo Burnham. The film not only offers nothing new, but is simply poorly directed. This film is mediocre at best and I believe that is the case simply because Greta Gerwig waited long enough into her acting career to make a name for herself which thereby enabled her to hire good actors and crew. You would hope some of Noah Baumbach's talent would have rubbed off but clearly it didn't. Lady Bird is a vanilla cookie cutter ""indie"" film that adds nothing unique or original to the coming of age genre. Maybe she should stick to acting."
LADY BIRD,9 March 2018,3/10,"A big pile of garbage! 
So sorry for all of you who think this is heartwarming brilliant movie.. don't waste your time on this."
LADY BIRD,14 March 2018,3/10,One of the most boring movies I have ever watched.
LADY BIRD,15 June 2018,9/10,As far as coming of age movies go. I most certainly feel like this is a complete and total winner. The acting and story line are fantastic! I Just had to give it the kudos it deserves. Thanks to the people who made this possible. It was so real and so satisfying to see. Emotional and silly. Loved it! Thanks again to the creators.
LADY BIRD,18 August 2018,7/10,I remembered my school days and I really thank my mum and my family members. Difficult to solve family issues but the director expressed the complicated feelings of teens with sense of humour. I like this movie.
LADY BIRD,23 January 2018,7/10,"Lady Bird is a message for all the thirty something Millennial generation and serve good for that very narrow target. It's a coming of age film and mainly the story of girl a her mom. Laurie Metcalf performs a good acting for the severe mother role (just like she is being doing for years on The Big Bang Theory) and Saoirse Ronan is convincing in her role for this mediocre teen that she feel so special for Sacramento and need to be in a special place like New York or New Hampshire, although she's not talented at all. There's a good moments, but really just a few. All the charachters are very cliché, nothing special, even the music of a wonderful artist like Jon Brion sounds just fine (and I say that with a little dissapoinment).It's really difficult understand such excitment for a movie that is just a fine little movie, and I think it's really because it resonates in a generation who feel so special despite of the reality. Christine ""Lady Bird"" is not even an anarchist or an atheist in a catholic school, she believes in god and she's not questioning anything, nor the world outside nor her inner world or thoughts, It's just a teenager who writes her boyfriends names on a pink bedroom wall, it's just a little girl, and that's fine but far away from special, different, brilliant. It's respectable but not worth any award. Is it a warm & sweet story? No. There's real struggles in this movie? No at all. Is it a inspiring film? Hmm, I don't think so. And it's so weird the Best Original Screenplay nomination with so little... 7/10"
LADY BIRD,12 March 2018,10/10,"Massive applause for Miss Ronan playing 'ladybird' a name she gave to herself, a great coming of age film, and the struggles of finding yourself through your late teens, family life, personal and school. Absolutely, riveting dynamics between cast, echoes back to my childhood and even made me shed a tear on my drive home from the cinema as I pondered the subject matter and put on the playlist of songs from the film. Would of loved to see this win an Oscar as would or been much deserved. If you get the chance just go and see it!!"
LADY BIRD,13 March 2018,2/10,"Saoirsen ronan looks out of place as if she came out from a different movie , is a bit too tall and accent is annoying"
LADY BIRD,14 January 2018,8/10,"Ladybird's personality is the perfect mix of quirky, emotional teen and honesty. I'm surprised the a story that is centered on a relationship between mother and daughter resonated with me. Add another classic to the list of classic coming of age movies."
LADY BIRD,27 May 2018,1/10,"I like powerful movies but this was not one. The vibe was that of napoleon dynamite, extremely slow with little wit.
Not a film for atheists. Wish I'd have watched something else."
LADY BIRD,20 July 2019,3/10,"If you really want to know how this movie is read the reviews... the positive ones. Yes, you read that right. They all can rave about this movie, but much like the movie, they don't really say what its about or anything besides the same thing you hear about every coming of age movie. Ladybird is complete unlikeable. Something I believe was the writer's intent, but is all the script accomplishes. There's no story or climax.I'll just spare you the hour and a half. Girl with self inflicted problem has a problem with everything. Then goes to college, grows as a person (maybe) off screen. Movie endsDo yourself a favor and watch Eighth Grade or The Edge of Seventeen"
LADY BIRD,8 April 2018,9/10,"Enjoyed this movie more than I had anticipated. Very relatable, especially having been in high school in the early 2000's."
LADY BIRD,5 June 2020,10/10,"Spoilers below.
Love the portrait of the period, 2003. love the ""nah i like Sacramento, i don't think about san francisco, i like the hills"" the movie was like, if Napoleon dynamite had a baby with the plot of High school musical 3 (the one where everyone is applying and going to college)
in terms of cinematography, very beautiful like a y tu mama también bicycle thieves ""road film""
in terms of script & casting, very world expansive like a theater production, the florida project, very ennui (scenes of people), but comedic at the same time with strong acting
the set designers did a great job. yeah, production designer did a crazy job. Got a huge bang for that buck. The color palette was wonderful too, very colorful. vivid.
in terms of theme ""love and attention, aren't those the same thing?"" was my favorite. Shelly's one scene was stellar. ""you hate your hometown but you'll still be homesick"" and ""friends connect and drift apart, and we never spend enough time with them"" were my other two enjoyed themes
dad playing depression solitaire. that was a good one too. sometimes the happiest people are the most depressed people. very vignette heavy, like theater again. and the script, the choices of where it zooms in. her getting 2 jobs, only 3 scenes for that, her fighting with her mom, only 1 big scene of ""why won't you talk with me?"" all summer her living in that stifling house trying to make the best of it and also GROWING a lot during that summer, starting to think more critically, be more honest with herself, hanging with her best friend again, cleaning up her room. honestly makes me feel like you could have a whole film on just that one summer, but wisely zooms past it, making me use my own feelings to fill in the gaps, makes it more emotional that way, recreates that ""our time is fleeting"" emotion that makes you want to hold everything precious"
LADY BIRD,27 November 2017,2/10,"I watched the trailer and saw that it received 100% on rottentomatoes.com so I figured it must be worth watching, but when I walked out of the theater I felt disgruntled and wanted my money and time back. The movie reminded me of 'Garden State' (2004) in that it was trying to be quirky, deep, and epic all at the same time, but was just another forgettable film. It really fell flat for me and the script/dialog was sometimes awkward and/or did not make sense. I'm surprised IMDb only listed one 'goof'. There were a couple of funny moments and the soundtrack wasn't bad -- those are the only nice things I can say about it."
LADY BIRD,12 February 2020,5/10,"I absolutely adore Saoirse Ronan as an actress and she seems like such a sweet, lovely person. Maybe I'm just not deep enough, I just didn't get why it's hyped so much 😬 It was watchable but certainly not some amazing piece of art as it's painted to be."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,1/10,"The movie is boring, nothing ever happens, the character is unrelatable, especially for non americans because in a normal world children dont act like this and if I ever would my parents would disown me. In conclusion boring!!!!!"
LADY BIRD,24 February 2018,4/10,"Went to this film expecting great things but found it cliched - the acting is pretty good, but a lot of the scenes feel so obvious and so 'coming of age' US style they made me cringe. Still, clearly I'm in the minority as most of the people in the cinema seemed to be laughing at most of the jokes and came out looking like they'd enjoyed themselves. I was expecting much more of an indie movie than this way, but this felt like a straight to the Oscars Hollywood movie. Disappointed and underwhelmed."
LADY BIRD,28 December 2017,8/10,"A lovely movie i truly enjoyed all the way through. I love Gretha Gerwigs directing in this film, and the story telling is amazing. You truly feel that the movie has a story to tell, more than just a teen tired of her boring life and parents. A great and enjoyable coming of age movie.
The directing reminded me a bit of the same style as Woody Allen type movie which only made me enjoy the movie even more. I am excited to see what the future brings for Greta Gerwig!
Saoirse Ronan is yet again brilliant. Her performances are always so captivating and keeps you entertaint all the way through. Truly an Oscar worthy performance."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2018,1/10,"This is my first time i am writing a review on IMDb. I have been a long time user of IMDb, but i have never have the urge to comment on a movie untill now. This movie is a great example of what is wrong with this world. The movie is about the main charecter called ""Lady Bird"" who will give up everything to become popular. Dumps her best friends, have sex with a jerk, lies and going against her parrents just to reach her goal of becomming polular. This movie is just a normal story about a girl where NOTHING really happens. The reason to the movie's succes is the way girls and women identify themselvs with ""Lady Bird"". Unfortunately almost every girl have been throug this period of their life, and by watching this feminist movie, they get the feeling of what they have done, or is doing is okay because this is the norm. Lady Bird is saying that it is okay for women to behave like ""men"", but it is not. It is not right for men to behave like ""men"" either. To get back to the movie it is boring and trivial. Laurie Metcalf delivers a great performence in this movie and it is such a shame it is wasted in such a trivial movie. The movie is filled with clichés that just indicate from the beginning that it is not a ""new movie"" we are about to watch but instead just another movie about normal girl that has been done many times before. When i heard about this movie i thought i was going to se a movie like ""Boyhood"". Nothing really happens in this movie either, but it is catchy and you get a lot of empathy with the charecters. It does everything that ""Lady bird"" tries to do. All things considered this is not a movie worth watching, and 5 oscar nomination is 4 more than it deserves."
LADY BIRD,20 May 2018,5/10,"Outside of the McPherson family (which was also a recycled theme of family angst), this film was full of shallow, stereotyped characters. The gay theater kid, the underemployed Berkeley grads with a lot of crap in their faces, the vapid rich kids, the absentee rich parents. Come to think of it, this came close to just being a movie contrasting the depth of the working class versus the idleness of the rich. The whole thing was just so cliche and uninspired."
LADY BIRD,10 January 2020,8/10,"Good story, The realistic and ordinary performance brings out a real life story, which is thoughtful and moving!"
LADY BIRD,28 August 2018,1/10,Whoever added this film in comedy genre is a fool. Stupid film only cares about actors not audience.
LADY BIRD,17 May 2018,6/10,"This movie totally misses the point. Between convincing actor performances and well placed funny moments it isn't possible not to notice, that this movie barely has a plot. Since ""Boyhood"" we know, that growing up is not an easy thing. So it takes a little bit more these days, than showing a few months in the adolescence phase of a young woman. Unfortunately this movie is heading nowhere. While watching it, you never know, when it could have it's last scene, because there isn't a story, that guides you through the film. Don't get me wrong: I don't have a problem, watching people doing just some stuff in movies in the first place. But in my opinion there is a huge gap between Noah Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" or Jim Jarmusch's ""Stranger than Paradise"" e. g. and this movie. It's not a crime barely having a plot. The trick is to make your audience not notice it."
LADY BIRD,15 April 2018,,"Are you kidding me? After all the hype I saw during the Oscars, I thought I would be seeing a work of art. Instead, I got this long, boring, nothing ever happens except every cliche you've ever seen in a coming of age movie.Every character is a cliche. None of them generate much interest, none of them have anything going for them. The dialogue is as brittle and unrealistic as things get. I was squeamishly uncomfortable at how these people interacted with each other - hugging when they should be shaking hands and vice versa, talking to each other as if they were reading parts from a movie scri - oh wait. Even the mother-daughter fights were stilted and at the same time banal and cringe-inducing.Ever since I started watching Cinema Sins, I cannot help but count sins as a movie progresses - and this one has every single sin Jeremy points out in such movies.But that's not the worst of it - this film is a thinly-disguised Catholic Church propaganda piece. Here's the plot: Rebelling teenager is too stupid and sinful to see how good she has it until she throws up after drinking too much and ends up in an emergency ward (really?!) whereupon she finds a church and calls her mom and all is right with the world, all her sins forgiven, and her wrong-headedness cured. She's a complete woman now she has come back to her savior. UGH."

LADY BIRD,23 November 2017,10/10,"On this planet, specifically within the borders of the United States, countless people dream of lives that just aren't obtainable, or at the very least harder to obtain than said people perceive. In Lady Bird, the writing and directing debut for Greta Gerwig, a go to for Noah Baumbach, Christine McPherson dreams of a life in New York... where the culture is. She is constantly reminded that she would never be able to go because she is a bad student, and on top of it, out of state tuition cost ""a lot of money"". Christine, self labeled ""Lady Bird"", is constantly at odds with her mother, her brother, and most others around her. During a scene in which a woman is presenting a lecture on abortion, she says something so disrespectful, that she ends up suspended. This movie isn't that kind of coming of age story though... not like Thirteen or Edge of Seventeen. This is a story about mothers and daughters and hometown pride. The screenplay is subtle and exhibits small quiet scenes of discourse that never once cross over the derivative threshold of melodrama. Gerwig, basing this loosely on her life manages to provide a vision of pure art while maintaining the qualities that make high school movies popular and entertaining in the first place. This movie is about the relationship between two women, one growing up, the other already grown. It is always about the mother accepting the individuality of the daughter, and the daughter accepting that her mother is not out to get her. The story manages this central narrative idea while balancing the young love life of Christine, presenting her with two relationships that change who she is, shaping her during the course of the movie. The story balances these two male counterparts perfectly, thanks once again to Gerwig's directing and Chamelet and Hedge doing fine work. All in all, this is a great film, that must experience by any mother and daughter in a trying relationship."
LADY BIRD,3 March 2021,2/10,I have never been so bored by a movie in my life. Literally nothing interesting happens.
LADY BIRD,13 December 2017,6/10,"I was drawn to this movie about Sacramento since I live near there. The
cinematography was beautiful. With the soundtrack I was reminded of
""Sideways."" Unfortunately, the story was not as well developed. Several
characters seemed to have been inserted into the movie without any real
development (the boyfriend and the brother and sister, to name a few examples.) The saving grace was that it does not go on too long, the story is a positive one about coming of age, and the movie feels authentic and genuine. It''s a decent date movie, better than many others."
LADY BIRD,20 December 2017,8/10,"An ordinary story about a girl who wants to be anything but that, Lady Bird's strength lies in its authenticity. Sincere performances based on a personal script, the film is so real, it's as if it isn't aware of its own message. We read it as we read life, navigating through insignificant important events and special common moments we interpret however we relate. Lady Bird is a little bit of what we are, what we want to be, and what we don't want to be, and that's why we can all find a little bit of our truth in it."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,8/10,"I haven't done so for awhile but once upon a time I used to review films professionally. All the publications claim critics love this film and audiences hate it but that isn't so cut and dry an assessment.A film must be reviewed on all of it's qualities. How was the acting, the script, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, what makes the film unique or different, what makes it stand apart from other similar films? I do not feel my fellow peers have reviewed this film accurately. I honestly think they are so terrified by the me too movement (Which they shouldn't be as things definitely need to change) that the majority of critics are rating this film higher than the rating actually deserves as a promotion of female empowerment or something. Again there is nothing WRONG with that but the film should be reviewed on it's merits not for publicity campaigns and positive PR.Film ratings are far stricter than any other form of media. This film is nowhere close to worthy of a perfect rating and it is NOT a bad film. But the amount of near perfect ratings is kind of ridiculous. Reviewers known for scrutinizing the smallest detail out of place are praising this film. Reviewers known for hating open ended endings are doing the same thing. Something else is going on here. But maybe a review should actually talk about the film itself?Saorise Ronan is superb. She has a very thick Irish accent but in this film she pulls off an american accent as if she has been a native of the United States her entire life. This is commendable and is worthy of acclaim. Most of the supporting actors do a great job in particular her parents and her best friend. Almost everyone else is pretty forgettable. A ""perfect film"" needs to have a perfect cast. That wasn't the case here. There are instances where plots start and have no resolution. The biggest issue with the film bar none is the editing. Wildly inconsistent quality. About 3/4 of the film has professional editing as would be expected but there is about a 20 minute section that abruptly switches from one moment to the next over and over again. This by itself wouldn't be an issue but all cuts in this duration of film are sharp and abrupt as if an amateur was filling in for the editor. Considering how important setting the tone and pace of the film is Lady Bird should be marked down in quality for the uneven editing. Yet critics have given nearly unanimous acclaim.The cinematography is decent but by no means groundbreaking. This is a coming of age story told from the female perspective which is a breath of fresh air that doesn't come about very often. It is an original concept but a film must be reviewed on all of the pieces of the puzzle and that just isn't the case here. When I say the editing quality is inconsistent just to reiterate it is REALLY bad. I don't know what happened but there has to have been some sort of disagreement in that one section as the entire tone of the film doesn't fit the rest of it. Maybe there is another half hour of scenes on the cutting room floor, maybe some takes weren't good enough to use for specific scenes but it's BAD. The biggest reason I stopped reviewing films is because of the ""selective reviewing"" so rampant in the industry.When you want consider a films quality before watching it do not go off of an individual critics reviews. Metacritic allows you to click the name of any reviewer and see all the reviews they have submitted. It gives you a score average. You can look through review summaries and find out if that critic has your same taste in films. Chances are if a critic reviews ""The House Bunny"" as their favorite film of the year and completely hates something like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" their credibility should be seriously reconsidered.Not a bad film by any means but far from the masterpiece my former peers seem to think it is. The Editing quality is inconsistent to the extent that some sections of the film cut so abruptly you have no time to even process what said scene is about before it cuts again. I genuinely think the montage may have been twice the length and studio influence cut it in order to reduce the film length by another 10 minutes for an additional showing a day in theaters. The problem is that reviewers need to submit their scores based off of the film they saw not what it could have or might have been."
LADY BIRD,27 February 2018,1/10,"The premise as I felt it was to take one sided gender sterotypes, turn them around, assert them true (a horrible thing to do) and then ask what follows, in a situation where there is no equivalence then a parody is constructed. The at whatever cost parody parts were what I found most amusing, and the highlights of the work, but on the whole its zero sum gain mentality dominated and more than anything I found it depressing. Although it had love (of a kind) friendship (of a kind) and estrangement of mother and daughter with moments where we see the beginnings of.. and in fathers case actual mental illness. Fortunately our female lead is built to take it and can handle anything, but at one point still asks the question ""why don't you like me?"" its all a bit cliche."
LADY BIRD,25 November 2017,10/10,"So refreshing to go to the theater and watch an honest coming-of-age story about community, family & friendship for a change. Saoirse Ronan gives a fantastic performance playing Christine, the ''hard-done by'' teenager, and Laurie Metcalf as Marion, Christine's overbearing mother. The supporting cast all give incredible performances too. I would describe LADY BIRD as a *universal* story. Greta Gerwig has created a masterpiece considering this is her first *solo-directorial* debut and her writing is so spot-on too. Jon Brion's score is exquisite. 10/10"
LADY BIRD,12 February 2018,8/10,"A quite extrovert young lady from Sacramento is growing up and facing the usual choices and experiences of this challenging moment. ""Lady Bird"", the name she has chosen for herself, is a character with a strong personality, a different way to see things, a little bit careless about the emotions and the needs of her family and probably too focus on herself, like all the youngsters in that period I guess. A rebel probably, but capable to see trought her mistakes and admit her faults. As I said, too religious for my taste, as atheist I usually avoid movies with so many christian references, but behiond the religious part, I actually fall in love with this sweet girl and really empathize with her willing to find her place."
LADY BIRD,10 April 2018,8/10,It is so beautiful and realistically executed and I can't help but to fall in love with every character in this story. Truly a beautiful movie.
LADY BIRD,20 February 2018,8/10,"At first, I did't like Ladybird, a arrogant teenager with a bad attitude. But then, I remember: adolescence sucks and this movie actually portrays it very well.
This movie it's about identity and all the changes that goes for a teen and how this affects the relationship with parents, especially, the mother. One of the downsides of a male-dominated industry it's that there is very few movies that capture the complexity of a mother-daughter relationship. So praise be for more female directors as Greta Gerwing. I'm looking forward to seeing her next movie."
LADY BIRD,4 March 2018,1/10,"Never in my life have I left a movie so disappointed, someone is honestly paying these people ro write good reviews.The plot was tremendously bleak and pretty much non existent, i got no sort of emotional effect? and mind you im a person that is easily moved. The characters were just some hollywoodsy stereotypical tropes of teeenagers, the edgy and extremely angsty white pretty and skinny female protagonist, chubby friend thats always left behind and walked over like a doormat bc of her ""good"" heart, handsome but eventually gay boyfriend, ""deep"" edgy hot hipster second boyfriend and the gorgeous popular girl, the adopted(?) asian brother just for th sake of having a ""diverse"" cast and the overly anxious hard working mom. Wow truly astonishing! Never been done before! The whole movie was extremely cringy, dialogue was painfully unrealistic and nothing close to how real teenagers act or speak but rather a stupid glorification of some sort of silly YA book character from a book probably written by a 35 year old depicting how they WISH their teenagehood was like. A movie bleak like no other. Would recommend to no one , left me with so many unanswered questions."
LADY BIRD,11 February 2018,9/10,"One of the things this film does exceptionally well is give us a snapshot of the experiences Lady Bird has, while still filling each moment with so much meaning and emotion. This is not a film about a teenager actively going through the world, it is about being in your 30's and looking back at your teenage youth. Lady Bird does not rest on any single experience for very long and this is because when we remember our youth, we don't remember everything, and we don't remember all the sides to the story, we just remember how the door slammed and everything went silent or how we used to stare longingly at the dream house a few streets away, wishing it were ours. The criticism that this film touches on too much and discusses too little, is a misconception that this is a play by play of a young woman growing into an adult. This is how life is remembered, in moments, slivers, glances. More over, Greta Gerwig creates a female lead character that is at once self-conscious and determined. She does not wilt or waver in her goals even when she makes mistakes. Lady Bird is a new female lead that does not ask ""what will I do now?"" when something goes wrong. She simply keeps going, until she arrives."
LADY BIRD,1 March 2018,2/10,"$10,000,000 for this movie??? Come on... So boring, and so unuseful!!! :("
LADY BIRD,28 December 2019,7/10,The language and communication int the movie is at times kind of cringy but the general story and the stylistics of the movie is quite interesting and intriguing.
LADY BIRD,30 December 2017,9/10,"When I saw the trailer for this film I knew upon seeing it i'd enjoy it, however I didn't anticipate just how much of an effect it would have on me and how relatable it was. I decided to watch it as a pick me up and have continued to rewatch it a bunch since. The dynamic between Ladybird and Marion is so genuine and I found the portrayal of the opinionated strong-willed mother and daughter butting heads paralleled my own life in a way I needed to see on-screen to fully understand. In that way the film taught me about myself and I'm sure many other viewer felt similarly - I think anyone watching will find something they relate to as there are many heartfelt subplots that tie into the main plot. I tend to like coming-of-age films even though many of them are cringey. For example, Lady bird is similar to The Edge of Seventeen (which I enjoyed without having many standards for it) except Lady Bird actually stands out for its character development and integrity, cinematography, and resolution. Although I've just seen it I'd had to say this is my favorite film of 2017 and one of my favorite films I've seen in a long time. It sticks with you and for me personally, it was exactly what I needed exactly when I needed it."
LADY BIRD,12 November 2017,10/10,"One of the best coming-of-age, mother-daughter films since JUNO and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. LADY BIRD depicts what it really means to be on the cusp of adulthood; taking the big leap to move away from home, etc. It has many 'fresh' aspects to it. The main protagonist, Christine aka ''LADY BIRD'', she's not perfect! She has acne, she makes mistakes, etc, and played so wonderfully by Saoirse Ronan. Gerwig has really established herself as a strong director and screenwriter. Her screenplay is probably one of the strongest original screenplays. I look forward to watching again. Hopefully it will be a strong awards contender!"
LADY BIRD,12 November 2017,2/10,"A trite, masturbatory piece tailored towards middle aged cat ladies and those on the path to becoming one. The drama, despite being filled with talent, lacked any semblance of depth, and could easily be likened to a comedy when you begin to view it in its proper context. It is essentially an incredibly mediocre male coming-of-age tale, but with the genders reversed. ""Lady Bird"" is the projection of what third wave feminists (for some reason) wish women were. She is the emotional pillar for those around her; she is stoic, bold, confrontational, daring, and always the first one to initiate romantic advancements. In other words, she is a caricature of masculine virtues and behavior, but as a *17 year old girl*. In the few places where she is found to be emotionally lacking, her parental counterpart (whose character is infinitely more believable by virtue of her background and hormonal makeup) steps in to fill the shoes (and/or pants). In accordance with this narrative, the men in lead roles have seemingly been injected with soy from birth. Soft-featured incompetent doughboys who lack the agency to engage life, functioning instead as submissive basket-cases, vectors through which Lady Bird asserts her outright dominance and emotional stoicism. That's the catch. That's the novelty driving this movies popularity (besides decent acting), a young girl who acts like a man. How risqué, how compelling. The screenwriters and director should really give themselves a pat on the back for this one. Anyway, there's certainly more to be said of the social agenda etched into every corner of this films script, but I've not the time nor the patience to spend another minute of my life on this trash. It is completely incongruent with reality, and therefore unrelatable to anyone who isn't living vicariously through the protagonist.The only redeeming factor of the film was the degree to which this absurd gender reversal dynamic managed to add a veneer of comedy to virtually everything that took place (especially the ""serious"" scenes)."
LADY BIRD,29 November 2017,10/10,"Thoroughly enjoyed LADY BIRD. Likely one of the best films of the year so far for me. With LADY BIRD, Gerwig has managed to bring a *fresh* approach on the coming-of-age genre filled with believable characters. I was basically watching my youth on the big screen. Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf both give Awards worthy performances backed-up by a fantastic supporting cast. The scenes are fast-paced so you don't feel like the story is dragging. I look forward to seeing what Gerwig does next! 10/10"
LADY BIRD,30 November 2017,2/10,"Ugh! I kept waiting for the story to get interesting, and it never did. I wouldn't have bothered sitting through more than 5 minutes of it if it were on TV. I was willing to give it a chance because I liked how Frances Ha came together at the end after what felt like a slog, but this was trite through and through. Even worse, it wasn't even interesting visually."
LADY BIRD,3 December 2017,1/10,"I have no idea how this movie got this high of a rating as I kind of felt that the movie is one of the most boring movies I've watched in 2017. It seems that the trailer has all the good scenes. I'm mainly talking about the ""idea"" of the movie & the flow. I am NOT referring to the performance by any means."
LADY BIRD,4 December 2017,8/10,"Having been a product of Sacramento I can speak with some authority on the vibe and allure the city/town offers. The casting was superb, the detail mindful and the dialog real. The fast pace of the film was a contrast and appreciated yet real time in Sacramento lags. Lady Bird and her mothers relationship is all too common during the teen years of angst and the coming of age battles one fights are displayed truthfully. Anyone with attachment to the city must see this film, you'll realize that sometimes the grass is not always greener and appreciate what you had when it's gone."
LADY BIRD,27 December 2017,2/10,"Gerwig really had to create a VERY passive cuck dad character to use as a comparison for labeling the mom and daughter as strong. Ladybird really wasn't that strong of a character... which makes this 'coming of age' story boring. And on top of that, the story was basically comprised of just a bunch of random events that felt like it was taken from the vague memory of the writer's poor recollection of their senior year. All opportunities for the Ladybird to develop any sort of drive or gumption were just tossed aside as we basically just watched her walk through the scenes of the movie.But on the bright side, A+ for the acting. Saoirse Ronan was very believable and Laurie Metcalf is always a joy to watch."
LADY BIRD,12 January 2018,10/10,"I personally loved this movie, i have already watched it twice and i want to watch it again, everytime i laughed with the same jokes and cried at the same parts, a movie that touched me emotionally it's already a great one. Very proud of Saoirse and Greta! that was the greatest debut ever, and i expect a big future from this girls :)"
LADY BIRD,8 January 2018,1/10,"Why bother to watch, let alone make, a movie about a whiny dishonest teenager? I could not empathize with her and ended up walking out of the movie halfway thru. Maybe the third movie that I have walked out of in my life."
LADY BIRD,21 January 2018,9/10,"A movie which is based on true events , but not for a specific person it's for many people in many generation and it is repeating all over the time . It's about that ambitious teenager (christene) of the middle class family , who always want to be better than his/her society and there family are not helping in the way he expects , not because the don't want to but because they don't want there child to fail and experience that feeling of being poor , they afraid of taking unnecessary risks , or ,as in most cases , they don't have the financial ability to support their heir . Sometimes both parents have the same way of thinking and they don't encourage their children to take risks or even to risk their life and support him financialy , and , as in our case , one of the parents totaly supports the boy/girl (larry ,the father) and the other is not and alway try to make him/her think more realistic (Marion , the mother) . In the other hand , the teenager (Christine) , who thinkd that her mother don't love her and that's why she don't support her and this though makes experience some psychological disturbances which reflects on her general attitude with her friends , makes her unresponsive and takes bad decisions , of course it affects her grades on school . 
In the movie the child called christien and her mother is the one who thinks that her girl have to be better and her father is the one who always supports her and want to make his girl happy whatever it costs him . I think that it was obvious that the director wanted to make a movie not an artistic masterpiece like alot of directors are doing nowadays and this is what made the movie more realistic and connected with real life , and it also had some masterpieces and quotes . 
The movie has entered every aspect in christien's life her relationship with her friends , her relationship with her family , her educational life , her sex life and her love life , and how she looks like her mother . The actors were really fascinating every one gave the best to his role and especially Laurie Metcalf , Tracy Letts and of course Saoirse Ronan. 
 I have just one comment on the movie and that ot would be better if they switched the personalities between the father and motjer because it's always the man who is so realistic but maybe it was done like that because the child is a girl and the mother is more connected to the girl and the father always treat the girl with much love and don't like her saddens ,i think that men will understand what i want to say 
. The movie is a lesson for parents and they shoulf watch it alone without their children to learn how to treat them in such a hard part of their lives . In the end i would like to spot the last seen , which i consider the scene of 2017 , i loved it."
LADY BIRD,18 January 2018,2/10,"For me, this movie made me feel sick. Lady Bird is the type of girl I hate most when I was a teenager, Her selfish, hypocritical, lack of courtesy. She can easily abandon her friend just for a boy.If that's rebellious, I would rather never be young."
LADY BIRD,28 January 2018,,"I loved this movie. But my friends and I all had the same question. The priest leading the school play, Fr Leviatchm played by Stephen Henderson, visits the mom in the psych unit. But we don't know why? What was his problem? I wanted to put this in FAQs but couldn't. I use IMDB a LOT, but just officially joined just to ask this question!"
LADY BIRD,17 February 2020,9/10,Lady Bird is a masterpiece of young-adult comedy/drama. It speaks on a whole another level to it's audience and Saorise Ronans performance is what i think is one of many greats yet to come by her.
LADY BIRD,7 February 2018,3/10,"I dont know why this movie is getting more than 5 stars !!!
i mean its has no story at allllll , i believe that most of these ratings has been made by teenagers."
LADY BIRD,10 February 2018,4/10,"I've found this movie very bleak and depressing. Sure, it raises a few important issues but I do think there are better movies out there deserving these awards. I would not suggest anyone with depression to watch this movie. It makes you hate your life even more rather than appreciate all the good in it. Maybe it was so well received because almost half of the US population can relate to this story, but i can not see any other reason why it is so praised."
LADY BIRD,15 February 2018,9/10,"As someone who went through the exact portion of their life that Lady Bird herself lived through not too long ago, this film pushed all the right buttons in order for me to leave the theater feeling very emotional and touched. I come from a relatively small, boring town in Pennsylvania and I ended up going to a university quite far from it. The college application process was just about as stressful as Lady Bird's, with just as much tension between my mother and I during it. And, of course, I went through normal soul-searching teenager feelings.
The thing that struck me the most of all the film was the very end, the coming to terms with herself and realizing all the tension with her mother was the result of realizing that her mom just wanted the best for her and for her to be happy in the end. There's a looming guilt that come with her voicemail to her mother, and that's honestly exactly what I felt the first week of being at my new university.
In terms of cinematography, the film never makes it hard to spot Lady Bird as she is very obviously made the dominant with her colored hair compared to everyone else in the film, as well as the fact the camera always seems to be entirely focused on her, because during the film there is a lot of non-verbal awareness of self that you begin to see on her face.
The film's colors are also very pastel and muted, with soft lighting that makes the film feel like a memory or a dream, which fits the mood of the film and having it take place in the very early 2000's. That within itself makes it feel all more like my own nostalgia as that period of my own life, while being very young, is very dear to me. However, the one thing in the film that wasn't quite as light and muted was the inside of the house that Lady Bird and her family resided in. The dark colors of the walls and the purposely claustrophobic feel of the house reflect the way that Lady Bird doesn't really FEEL at home where she is, and the darkness is almost like the tension that is present between her and her mother throughout the film.
The colors also become un-muted when Lady Bird finally goes to NYC and in the final shot of the scene. It leads itself to the somewhat grim but entirely real, no longer dream-like reality that Lady Bird is in: she's now living in a foreign place with no family or friends after having lived in the same place for her whole life with no one there to support her but herself. That very last shot is what I felt like I could relate too as well, the transition process in moving 300 miles away from home to Rochester, New York of all places (known for its bleak, cloudy days) and the guilt I mentioned earlier hits hard.
I don't believe I'll be able to rewatch this movie any time soon, but I think that a few years down the line, maybe once I graduate and start working I will seek this film out and let these feelings wash over me again, and perhaps I'll feel them with less sadness but more nostalgia and will be able to self-reflect with them and realize how much I am capable of growing as a person. As a coming of age film, that's what it's all about, of course: letting people take a look back to see how similar or different their upbringings and life events were and how different you come out in the end."
LADY BIRD,26 July 2019,8/10,"It's funny, sad and heartwarming at the same time, like the real life is. So many emotions combined with fine editing and great storytelling. So many pieces with small stories about adulthood, first steps in independent life, child dreams, first love interests, heartbreaking moments with people around and the main storyline about true hard love between mother and daughter.
This story really resonated in me. In each character I found someone I know. Post graduation problems and love that is not always easy to show and understand from another."
LADY BIRD,2 March 2018,7/10,"A realistic and wonderfully acted movie. Lady Birds brother although we'll acted, miscast physically. Hence the score of 7. A little overacting on Laurie Metcalfs part but the father role was magnificent. Will see this ever so times to keep enjoying it."
LADY BIRD,5 March 2018,6/10,"I was expecting much more, I must say. Having read some reviews, I thought this highly acclaimed film would offer a new perspective on the experience of being a teenager and the transition to adulthood. However, I found myself watching a story which has already been told many times.Apart from the predictability, I would highlight the lack of emotional connection that I felt: the story failed to move me, even though there were some moments that I think were clearly meant to. Maybe the fact of not being familiar with Sacramento ( where the story takes place and the town Lady Bird has a strong attachment to) makes it more difficult to grasp the meaning of the film.Aside from that, the film has some interesting moments; on the whole it's entertaining and the acting is good. The storytelling is quite original, or at least it intends to be.To sum up, not a bad film, but quite forgettable I'm afraid."
LADY BIRD,8 March 2018,1/10,Complete thoughtless time wasting trash!!!! high raters for this film are absolute conscienceless!!
LADY BIRD,18 March 2018,3/10,It started off okay but then quickly fell apart and became one of the most boring and predictable movies I've seen in years. There was little to no character growth throughout the entire movie. I can't figure out why this was loved or ever liked by so many. It was like a Mean Girls with less memorable characters.
LADY BIRD,21 March 2018,10/10,"With such a vague description, I didn't know what to expect when watching Lady Bird. I had seen that it was nominated for some Oscars, so figured it must be good. It isn't good, it's fantastic.Not everyone will enjoy this film as it's just not for everyone. Where Lady Bird stands out and why I believe it warrants 10 stars is that it mentally transports you to Lady Bird's world. You forget you're watching a movie because everything is done so well. I found myself feeling as though I was in the same room with the characters in this movie.This is why we watch movies- to mentally go outside of our living rooms. Lady Bird achieves this. Best movie I've seen in a while."
LADY BIRD,23 March 2018,1/10,"""Lady Bird"" was most likely the worst movie I've ever seen. It was anti-climatic in every way. It is just another story about teenage rebellion with an antagonistic parent. This is not surprising or worth spending millions on a movie. The storyline was beyond flat. The supporting cast was questionable. This was marketed as a comedy but there might have been two chuckles throughout the entire two hours of drudgery. Don't waste your time insulting your intelligence by watching this film."
LADY BIRD,29 March 2018,8/10,Fajny dramacik nastolatki pokazany w ladny i fajny sposób. Bardzo fajny
LADY BIRD,24 May 2018,7/10,"Greta Gerwig stunns critics with her directorial debut in the charming ""Lady Bird"". I have finally got to see a movie for the adolescents which seems almost mainstream but is not packed with perfect faces of actors who are way older than their characters. The action is based in Sacramento, California, in the beggining of the 21st century. The plots is centred on Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), a high school senior who wants to be someone else (for instance, we can see it in the name """"Lady Bird"" that she uses; ""It was given to me, by me""). Lady Bird gets older and finds out about the perversity, hardships and formosity of growing up. She has to understand that with independence come many responsibilities. She starts to get involved with all the problems faced by her family and friends. Greta Gerwig did a great job; especially when talking about the young cast. The ones who stood out for me the most where Saoirse Ronan, who fits perfectly in the role of the impetuous Lady Bird, and Timothee Chalamet, who portrays the charming and introverted Kyle Scheible. The scenery and overall vibe of the movie is almost ""cozy"". It is a piece that is perfect for long autumn evenings, spent under under a blanket with a cup of tea. All in all, I think that ""Lady Bird"" is a movie suitable not only for misunderstood teenagers, but also for anyone who wants to relive their youth in a funny, moving and genuine way."
LADY BIRD,23 May 2018,9/10,"I love Lady Bird, maybe the mom's negativity and put downs were a bit over dramatized, but I think we all can relate to fear and the fear of the future, especially for our kids & as a kid growing up in any era. Having been raised in a Catholic family and attending Catholic school and also not always having the best dynamic with my parents, this film really hit home for me. In so many areas as a mom, but also as a daughter. I loved the film and would recommend seeing it, I think that it will go down in film history as this generation's Pretty in Pink or 16 candles."
LADY BIRD,21 June 2018,8/10,I didn't really know what to expect but I was surprised in the most positive way!
LADY BIRD,16 July 2018,3/10,"I watched Lady Bird on a plane. I was bored out of my mind, excited to see what all the hype was about. I had to turn it off five minutes into the movie. It is every stereotypical coming of age movie. And the main character is just a snobby brat. Not the charming kind of brat, either. It all just seems too overdone. If you'd like to watch the same thing you've seen a million times, go ahead and watch Lady Bird."
LADY BIRD,17 October 2018,1/10,"This movie can only be for those who live in America or think that awards mean something. The self-centeredness of the protagonist annoyed me (and not only me), though she could be excused for this, as the main value in America is individualism. In short, this movie can be either brilliant, if you like such type of movies, or it could be extremely boring and uneventful. Be cautious or you will waste your time watching this ""masterpiece""."
LADY BIRD,17 September 2018,2/10,"For a movie attempting to capture the coming of age of a young girl in a place she feels she doesn't belong, this was incredibly superficial. Lady Bird claims to be passionate about art and a deep thinker, yet this film barely scratches the surface of these great, emotional aspects of her and instead forces her into a box labeled ""angsty teenager"" and ultimately has her apologize for being herself. This was not set up to be about how one should always listen to their (emotionally abusive) parents, but rather it was set up to be inspiring and hopeful and show teens that they can be successful under scrutiny. However, about midway through it lost all its traction and fell flat into conformity."
LADY BIRD,25 February 2021,10/10,Greta gerwig perfectly captures coming of age. nothing spectacular happens in this movie which is the most realistic depiction if coming of age
LADY BIRD,6 January 2019,2/10,"I do not understand how this movie is highly rated. I think its rubbish. I felt nothing for the main character. The only time I felt any spark of emotion during the whole movie was when Lady Bird's first boyfriend came crying to her asking her not to out him about being gay.
I tried to get invested in the characters but I just could not. There are better coming to age movies on the Disney channel."
LADY BIRD,19 January 2020,1/10,"Movies doesn't have any specific theme. Boring.Don't ever watch it you will get bored really soon, and you will waste your precious time. And i dont know why its still short review but i don't know what to say about this movies just its so boring and that is it."
LADY BIRD,16 January 2019,8/10,"Writer and director Greta Gerwig of the film Lady Bird does a splendid job at casually touching on many prominent issues that teenagers face growing up in America. It doesn't make it obvious and it doesn't make feel like it's trying to make some PSA. But the main character Christine McPherson or Lady Bird which is the name she has given herself and is the names she's prefers everyone to call her by. Lives through her senior year and experiences many difficult experiences as she makes the transition from High School into college. It captures in a unique way many aspects of the struggle of high school, trying to fit in with the cool crowd even if it means you might lose something. And juggling family life with school life or with boyfriends.
It's entertaining to see the unexpected behavior of lady bird, like in the opening scene of the movie when she argues with her mother and she gets so fed up with her mother she opens the car door and jumps out of a moving vehicle. From the very start we see Christine's impulsive behavior, but it's that impulsive behavior that leads her to learn and make mistakes and eventually will lead to finding herself.
Gerwig reveals this story about a girl in a poor family trying to make it through her senior year of highs school in Sacramento. Her dream is to attend a college in New York but financial issues and her mother are keeping her from making that dream reality. With her best friend Julie by her side to battle through High School they are always there for each other.
Where Gerwig does a brilliant job is in the script. With every interaction Lady Bird has with someone else it brings us deeper into who she is and what's she's trying to accomplish. Every argument with her mother or impulsive action brings a depth into her character that makes it easier to understand why she does what she does. I also think that the setting, especially the time period, of this movie is important. It's in 2002 where cell phones are just starting and not everyone has them. It's more of a wealthy person item and it also helps veer away from the Instagram and Snapchat obsessive lives that most kids have today.
This movie also connects very well with audience members especially teenagers in school right now because it just shows the raw life of a teenager. There's no sugar coating or anything like that, just harsh and real conditions. But People are intrigued by things they can relate to because it makes you think. It makes you think about your own life compared to the movie and this movie definitely connects to a lot of viewers out there. Also the mother and daughter or just kid to parent relationship will resonate with a lot of the viewers out there.
One of the more weaker aspects of the film was probably one of the last scenes of the movie where Lady Bird gets drunk and ends up in a hospital. The scene wasn't well put together and fast. Also the acting in that particular part wasn't that great and it just seemed like a the doctor that had like one line was just bad at trying to be a doctor.
Gerwig simply captures the highs and lows, the happy and sad, the dirty and beautiful moments of teenage life that is unparalleled to any other movie. That is why the movie is so good, because it reveals all of those things about High School in such a fresh and perfect way. It is also brings to life many situations we all have been apart of or will be a part of that makes relive those moments, and that what draws everyone to this movie, because you can connect to it."
LADY BIRD,22 August 2020,10/10,"Honestly, I did put this movie on with the lowest expectations possible, but I'm extremely glad I was wrong! This movie is a perfect modern drama masterpiece.The directions that Greta Gerwig chose to go with this are somewhat unexpected, yet so interesting that you can't but root for every single character here and relate to at least have the situations that they find themselves in.Camera-wise there was some pretty good framing and mirroring of the characters' emotions and situations. It was subtle most of the times and they all hit home right.Usually I'm not a big fan of modern drama comedies, but Lady Bird gave me an amazing time and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time..!"
LADY BIRD,25 January 2019,8/10,"A true coming of age story, the dialogue is smart and witty. The relationship between ladybird and her mother has it's ups and downs but no matter what there love for each other was unconditional and inspiring. The acting is superb and is worthy of Oscar nomination including best picture."
