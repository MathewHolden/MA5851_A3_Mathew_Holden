THE POST,23 January 2018,6/10,"'The Post' had a lot going for it. A great cast, that it was directed by Steven Spielberg (who directed a lot of great films and several childhood favourites) and an intriguing subject, such a lot could have gone right here. A lot actually is done right but not everything, found a lot to admire but it didn't quite click as an overall whole. Can see why it has been so positively reviewed but can also see why it has not worked for others.What makes it especially worth watching is the cast. On paper there was a lot of talent in the first place and there is some truly great work here. Impeccable in the case of commanding Tom Hanks and a typically powerful turn from Meryl Streep as the most fully rounded character, then again usually one wouldn't expect anything less from actors of such high calibre. Bob Odenkirk's nuanced contribution is the standout of the supporting cast, while Carrie Coon and Matthew Rhys are also strong.It is a well made film visually, made with grit, slickness and style and with an audaciously evocative period setting. While not one of his best or most memorable works, and it won't go down as an iconic score, John Williams' music is a clever mix of lush orchestral themes and a more sparse electronic tone that adds a suitably unsettling vibe. Spielberg shows signs of capable direction, while the second half is thrilling and suspenseful.'The Post' is at its most successful in its portrayal of gender inequality and that some of the decisions made were difficult ones to make and how and why they were made and enforced. The script does have enough thought-provoking moments to keep one gripped.Against all this some of the story is heavy-handed and hammers home its points too much, the exaggeration of the Washington Post's involvement was a prime example. The pace is uneven, the first half did need a fair bit of tightening up and felt too calculated while there is also a rushed feel to the film (perhaps for it to be released in time for awards season), particularly in how interesting and important themes and ideas were glossed over and not fully explored and there is some carelessness at times to Spielberg's directing.Contrivances and a too talky and too on-the-nose approach is apparent in some of 'The Post's' script in primarily the first half, while the too tonally soft and lacking in dramatic integrity conclusion seemed at odds with the rest of the film. In summation, an intriguing and worthwhile film but to me it was an uneven one. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
THE POST,15 July 2018,6/10,"THE POST is Steven Spielberg's attempt to make a newspaper-focused political thriller along the lines of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or SPOTLIGHT. As a film, it fails in comparison to either of those classic movies, although it does have plenty of reasons to tune in. The direction is adequate and the material fine, although this isn't as good as BRIDGE OF SPIES as it doesn't have the same heart. The main problem I have with this is Meryl Streep, giving a performance EXACTLY the same as the one in THE IRON LADY. Her character feels extraneous, shoehorned into the story to add a modern-day feminist spin, and the whole moral dilemma she faces is more than tiresome. The good news is that, back in the newsroom, an all-but unrecognisable Tom Hanks is at the top of his game and leads the meat of the story, which is involved and suspenseful enough to keep you watching and engaged in the tale that plays out."
THE POST,17 August 2018,8/10,"In 1966 Vietnam, Daniel Ellsberg is a military analyst in the field writing reports for McNamara. He grows disillusioned with the outright lies to the American public and decides to smuggle out the secret Pentagon studies. In 1971, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) is the struggling owner of the Washington Post taking over from her late father and then her late husband. As a woman, she is an oddity in the upper echelon white men corporate world. Chief editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) is tired of being out-reported by the New York Times. When the Times is halted from reporting by a suit from the government, Post reporter Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) is able to track down Ellsberg and obtain a copy of the Pentagon Papers. Kay is faced with the dangerous decision to publish.The subject matter is important and relevant for the present day. Director Spielberg is heavy-handed in a couple of scenes but mostly, he is able to bring a tense realism to the proceedings. The first half is a little slow. It needs a little tension from the Ellsberg side. It needs more of the Times with him. The acting is first rate from well-established veterans. The setting has a lot of minute details that give it a real sense of time. The central story of Kay's struggle is one of the central plots. Here Spielberg is at his most heavy-handed. Over and over again, young women look admiringly at Streep. I'm actually more struck by her fragility and her growth as a character. It works much better when Spielberg isn't pointing the camera right at the female empowerment of it all. He needs to give the audience more respect. It's a Spielberg lack of subtlety that is getting more noticeable as the years go by. Kay is walking the step of the Supreme Court and she's flank by the silently adorable female crowd. It doesn't need to be that obvious. He just needs to dial it back to ten. What I appreciate most about this movie is the tackling of the close relationship between the press and the political establishment. The 4th estate likes to portray itself as an impartial arbiter but they are often influenced by their connections. It's compelling to see the influence and the breaking of that. Overall, it's a great look at a compelling moment in newspaper history."
THE POST,16 January 2018,8/10,"If you lived through Vietnam and have read and seen the material in the aftermath (including Ken Burns' incredible documentary), there seems little doubt that our leaders were at the center of the deaths of thousands of our dear sons and daughters. From Truman to Eisenhower to Kennedy/Johnson to Nixon, image was what it was all about. The tapes and phone conversations prove this. So when Daniel Ellsberg delivered those damning documents to the New York Times, he brought down evil. Nixon had the world by the butt and overreached. So what about this movie. I have to agree that it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Despite portrayals by real troopers and a masterful performance by Streep, it had a kind of yawn factor. Somehow, there seemed little suspense. Of course, we knew the story, but it never picked up much steam. It needed fine tuning. An interesting continuing commentary in IMDB is the use of a movie forum to perpetuate a soapbox. But to give this film a one or two because it shows the parallels of that time with the one we are living in, is counter to the whole point of reviewing. Anyway, I thought it was a reasonably thoughtful portrayal of a time when government got bigger than it should have."
THE POST,15 March 2020,8/10,"Was the week the Washington Post began to print the Pentagon Papers really the same week the company went public, or was that something the screenwriters added to the script of this movie? It's a very adult, hip, feminist script that seems timed, not just for the sort of Suffragette script we got a couple of years back during Oscar season, but in light of the post-Weinstein Hollywood that's leading into hysteria and reaction from Catherine Deneuve.My first reaction to the trailers was that Tom Hanks was channeling Jason Robard Jr. That made me check the cast list of All the President's Men. Katherine Graham doesn't appear in that movie. It's all about the boys of the newsroom, with women keeping the books and fetching the coffee and even writing the stories about the weddings, I suppose, but never saying anything important or central to the story. Rosalind Russell has retired into a negligee for the seventh reel, and Meryl Streep feels herself feels herself alone and inadequate to the job she must do, alone among the merchant bankers, but knows she is the one who must do it.The principal pleasure in this movie is observing people talking, saying things to each other, eventually hearing and reacting, the way people do. Streep, Hanks, Bob Odekirk... movie-maker Steven Spielberg has not neglected the big shots, but like many a film maker, his technique has gotten simpler as he has aged, and when the story is about people talking, how elaborate do you need to be?"
THE POST,3 March 2018,6/10,"""The Post"" is a recent American 2-hour movie from 2017 and here we have the newest work by Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg. He got acting heavyweights Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep on board for this one that focuses on the press reporting on the government's comments and secrets about the Vietnam War, so this one plays of course several decades in the past. Maybe you have come across the name Daniel Ellsberg in other projects, then you roughly know when this is set and what it is about, even if his character is not one of the key players here. It's more about life at the Washington Post, so there are some parallels to Spotlight in terms of where the film is set and the controversial subject it is about, even if it is another area completely of course. But it is also a Best Picture nominee at the Oscars and Meryl Streep got in once more too for her portrayal. Still 2 nominations are not that much given how successful the film was with other earlier awards bodies. Spielberg and Hanks were probably not too far away from a nomination and can you imagine that the latter has not been nominated for an Oscar in over 15 years. The tough competition in Original Screenplay also made it difficult for this one here to get in. In terms of the cast, there are of course many more familiar faces next to the two stars. We get a Breaking Bad reunion and then there's Paulson, Brie, Rhys, Cross, Coon etc. so if you have watched films and television in the last years, you will know some players here for sure.As for the plot, I am sadly not too sure the execution fits in with the gravity and importance of the subject. The question if they will release it is one that can be guessed correctly very quickly of course and the way they present the road taken towards this decision is not always particularly entertaining to watch. The film did not drag a lot for this running time and that is always a success of course, but something was missing here to convince me that this really should be listed among the year's best. Early on it seems as if the main antagonist could also be the New York Times, but the longer the film goes, the more obvious it becomes that the President is the enemy and let's be honest they really used some cheap shots here that felt more like from a gossip magazine making use of several smear campaigns against the current President and honestly press today really could learn something from press back then, at least if we believe the way it is depicted in here. Honor and integrity still played a role back then, today it's much more about stirring things up. Anyway, as for the film here, the weakest moment was probably the rushed-in Watergate reference here and it left a really bad aftertaste as it happened the moment the ending credits rolled in. Before that, there is some mediocrity, but there are also many good moments. I am not sure Streep was Oscar (nomination) worthy here, but she was good like the rest of the bunch, Odenkirk especially, who may have been the MVP here. Hanks was rock-solid too, Paulson did not really have the material to work with that you'd expect for a third-billed. All in all, it was another decent work by Spielberg, but like with some other of his recent stuff, the real stand-out moments that you will remember weeks or even months after seeing are missing here unfortunately. Still, it's a decent watch for everybody with an interest in American politics and history and I give the film a thumbs-up, just not an enthusiastic one. Seeing this film once is probably enough for a lifetime."
THE POST,25 January 2018,6/10,"Steven Spielberg has made a prequel to 'All the President's Men.'The Post deals with The Washington Post scoop of getting hold of the leaked Pentagon Papers in 1971 which gave a different slant to the US involvement in the Vietnam war.Once they decided to publish the newspaper along with the New York Times, they had to take the battle to the Supreme Court.Tom Hanks plays the editor Ben Bradlee, his performance is a world away from Jason Robards. Meryl Streep plays the publisher of the Post, Katharine Graham. She has to prove herself worthy in following in the footsteps of her father and late husband who successfully ran the newspaper.Despite Spielberg's attempt to jazz up the story the film comes across as stilted. There are times when it builds up momentum and speed and the pace comes to a crashing halt.It is like there was not enough of a story there to justify a film that attracts the talent this film has both in front and behind the camera. None of Spielberg's film-making skills can disguise that this is an underwhelming movie."
THE POST,30 January 2018,7/10,"In 1971, The New York Times has access to classified documents about the Vietnam War. However, the government uses the justice department to stop the distribution of newspapers claiming violation of the national security laws. Immediately after, the Washington Post has access to similar documents but they decide to face the government and publish the newspapers against the will of their lawyers and investors.""The Post"" is a film directed by Steven Spielberg with the battle between the press and Nixon´s government in 1971. The performances of Meryl Streep and Tom Hank are top-notch as usual and the dramatization of the situation is suspenseful. The truth about the Vietnam War is probably painful for the American people that lost their sons to hypocrite governments. However the right of free press without financial interest from the government seems to be utopic at least in the present days. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""The Post: A Guerra Secreta"" (""The Post: The Secret War"")"
THE POST,24 January 2018,8/10,"This is a behind the scenes look at the Washington's Post decision to publish top secret documents after a court had shut down The New York Times. While the Times was publishing the story, the Post was covering the WH wedding. Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep,) the owner of the Post, was taking the company public on AMEX in order to save the floundering small town publication. The film was interesting but doesn't hit a bull's eye. Hanks is good, but seriously, Jason Robards was better. Katherine Graham is portrayed as weak and having difficulty making decisions, someone who was once called, ""the world's most powerful woman."" There are themes such as ""the press vs the President"" that relate to modern times as well as showing the close relationship of government to the press as being unhealthy for democracy. There was an ""F"" word but I don't recall the protest phrase ""We don't want your stinking war."" Not the adjective I used. The film does a lousy job at introducing people. I knew who they were because I lived through this, but for anyone who doesn't know publishers, owners, reporters, and cabinet officials of the era, might be lost. I read ""The Pentagon Papers"" and the whole aspect of the government lying about a war, I did not find amazing. What I did find interesting was that Ho Chi Minh had written 2 US Presidents (Wilson and Truman). He wanted to be an ally of the US, loved our democratic institutions and requested help to free them from the French. Our OSS trained the Vietnamese (who would later become the Viet Cong) and recommended that Vietnam be given their independence and not turned back over to France. The rest we know."
THE POST,12 April 2018,7/10,"Actually this is very timely. In a time where the White House tries to silence and/or bully the press (and others for that matter), you wonder if you are thrown back ... back into time. And then you get this story and go: ""Oh yeah, there was a time when the truth was not supposed to reach the public."" On the other hand, how much does the overall public care? It seems like if some do not feel like they are being affected by some things surrounding them (see what happened with Facebook and if anything will change).But back to this. And while this is not as good as last years Oscars contender about a newspaper and their reveal of a scandal, this is still more than solid and decent. Performances are really good, which is to be expected if you look at the actors involved."
THE POST,20 February 2018,8/10,"I'd bet dollars to a whole bunch of doughnuts that not many people watching this film today are aware that the history of the Vietnam War precedes the presidency of Richard Nixon by four prior administrations, dating all the way back to Harry Truman. Nixon gets most of the blame of course, for the country's failure in Vietnam, somewhat undeservedly, whereas he does shoulder all of it for the break-in at the Watergate Hotel. Perhaps the title of this picture might better have been 'The Pentagon Papers', with the Washington Post playing it's role, but it was Katherine Graham's newspaper, and as portrayed by Meryl Streep, Graham's stewardship required the requisite amount of diplomacy and resolve. I thought her confrontation with Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) over his relationship with the Kennedys while JFK was in office was quite remarkable, knowing that as President, he did get a pass on all of his extracurricular activities.What this film probably does best is bring us back to a time in the country when there was such a thing as investigative journalism. Sources were double and triple checked before stories made it into print, while today all it takes sometimes, is a tweet, to send reporters into a frenzy. Personally, when the Pentagon Papers story broke, I was somewhat conflicted and on the fence whether or not a newspaper ought to print stories based on classified government data. In retrospect, the country's national security posture was not harmed, and as an informed public, we're better off knowing what our leaders are up to, especially when decisions to send soldiers into harm's way are concerned."
THE POST,5 November 2018,6/10,"In 1971, a military analyst working for the RAND corporation released classified documents exposing the US government's decades of lying to the public about involvement in Vietnam. After The New York Times published the initial pages, the Nixon administration ordered them to stop, leaving it up to The Washington Post to expose the rest.Steven Spielberg's Academy Award-nominated movie ""The Post"" focuses not on what Daniel Ellsberg exposed - which included war crimes - but on The Washington Post's efforts to publish the documents, knowing that the paper will face Nixon's wrath. The movie has been seen as a reminder to the media to hold the powerful accountable. It's ironic that the newspaper is now owned by Jeff Bezos, who has a vested interest in suppressing information. As for Ellsberg himself, he voiced support for Edward Snowden (at one point he voiced support for Julian Assange, but Assange's championing of the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville probably made Ellsberg withdraw support).Another effective scene was a scene of a gathering in the house. The women go into one room to talk about ""nice"" things while the men stay in another to talk about serious things. This crowd still tries to live in the '50s, not realizing that they're about to expose the government's lies.Anyway, it's like Oliver Stone's ""Snowden"": not a great movie, but a reminder to hold the government's feet to the fire, especially during wartime. Aside from Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, the rest of the cast includes Bob Odenkirk, Michael Stuhlbarg and Sarah Paulson (whom one of my friends in New York met right after Paulson had performed on Broadway a few years ago)."
THE POST,28 January 2018,6/10,"Awards Season was coming around, and from the various sources I had heard, this movie looked most likely to be one included for nominations, and I was right, so I looked forward to it, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List, Lincoln, Bridge of Spies). Based on the true story, in 1966 Vietnam, troops are in combat, State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) is there documenting activities and progress in the region for Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). On the return flight home, McNamara expresses his views to Ellsberg and President Lyndon B. Johnson, that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet on landing expresses his confidence in the war effort, Ellsberg overhears and is disillusioned. Years later, Ellsberg now works for the RAND Corporation, civilian military contractor, he surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the progress of the ongoing Vietnam War, dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg leaks these documents, detailing twenty years of concealed U.S. activities and frank discussions that the war has been going poorly, to reporters at The New York Times. Katharine ""Kay"" Graham (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) has inherited and taken over as owner and published of The Washington Post, following the suicide of her husband who had succeeded her father. She tries to balance her social life and the responsibilities of the newspaper, she is conflicted over preparations for the paper's IPO (initial public offering), this is an important move for strengthening the paper, but at the risk of losing family control. Graham lacks confidence as a woman to lead the organisation, the more assertive men who work for or advise her often ""overrule"" her, including editor Ben Bradlee (Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) and board member Arthur Parsons (Bradley Whitford). Bradlee notices that investigative reporter Neil Sheehan (Justin Swain) has not published any articles in some time, he concludes that Sheehan is working on something big, and in vain he tries to get the scoop. Meanwhile, Graham's long-time friend McNamara tells her that the Times will be running unflattering coverage about him, in fact it is an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public, but a court injunction halts the Times from any further publication. Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk), assistant editor of the Post, tracks down Ellsberg as the source for the leak, he provides Bagdikian with copies of the same material given to the Times. A small team of reporters at the Post work together to sort the unorganised papers, trying to piece together parts of the larger story, lawyers of the newspaper become aware of the project and advise against publication, to avoid the Nixon administration bringing criminal charges. Graham fields the input and advise of Bradlee, McNamara, trusted chairman Fritz Beebe (Tracy Letts) and the other men around her, she agonises on the decision whether to publish the story or not, that the U.S. military were aware that they could not win the Vietnam War. If the legal fallout goes badly, she could destroy the reputation of the newspaper, also a family legacy, however if legal challenges are dealt with, the Post could become an important journalistic institution, she chooses to run the story. The White House retaliates, the Post and the Times both go before the Supreme Court to plead the First Amendment argument, for freedom of speech, and the right to publish the material, meanwhile newspaper across the country follow the proceedings. In the end, the court rules 6-3 in the newspapers' favour, Graham's decision is vindicated, Nixon demands that the Post is banned from the White House, as a security guard discovers a break-in in progress at Watergate. Also starring Sarah Paulson as Tony Bradlee, Alison Brie as Lally Graham, Carrie Coon as Meg Greenfield, Jesse Plemons as Roger Clark, David Cross as Howard Simons, Zach Woods as Anthony Essaye and Michael Stuhlbarg as Abe Rosenthal. Hanks and Streep are often considered the best actor and actress of their generation, if not all time, they are certainly the powerhouse duo. This telling of the leaking of the Pentagon Papers scandal of 1971 came at the right time, fitting in nicely with the recent ""fake news"" age, it is just a good old-fashioned, chatty, well-acted and well scripted political thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score for John Williams. Good!"
THE POST,6 May 2018,,"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay. She was a sophomore in college, I was in the first two years of my career in 1971 when the events depicted here were occurring. We both remember but only vaguely, this movie brings it all back.The impetus of the story starts when an analyst, Daniel Ellsberg, still alive today, finds out the presidents Truman through Nixon plus military officials have not been telling the truth about the Vietnam war for years. Upset with this he copied and leaked a large volume of top secret documents which contained the truth.The Washington Post gets the information and are faced with the dilema, to report of not to report? This is dramatized with Meryl Streep in the role of Kay Graham, died in 2001, in 1971 was leading her family newspaper The Washington Post. The business was near bankruptcy in 1971 and their public offering was needed to insure their financial survival. They didn't need any negative publicity.Tom Hanks is in the role of Ben Bradlee, died in 2014, in 1971 was still the relative new executive editor of the Washington Post, making the difficult decisions. Both Streep and Hanks are great in their respective roles.The movie ends with a very brief scene where security has detected a possible breakin at Watergate in the Democratic headquarters. This of course was in 1972 and was the beginning of the crumbling of the Nixon administration. This movie, ""The Post"" complements the 1976 movie ""All The President's Men"" and the more recent ""Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House.""My wife and I enjoyed all of these movies which depict events that actually happened during our young adult years."
THE POST,13 September 2018,8/10,"Having been alive during the time featured in the film, I found The Post fascinating. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it sports a wonderful cast that includes Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bradley Whitford, and Matthew Rhys.The story ostensibly concerns freedom of the press, which makes the movie very timely, as does the presence in the film of a corrupt and vindictive President.What it's really about is Katharine Graham coming into her own as the publisher of The Post. Sick of hearing ""Your father would have..."", ""Your husband would have..."" she finally says, ""By the way. This isn't my father's paper anymore, and it's not my husband's. It's mine."" Despite her position - which it never occurred to her that she would be in -- she has a lack of confidence. Nevertheless, it's her courage that brings not only the Pentagon Papers but Watergate to light.All of the acting is terrific.The Post is a sobering story. As is said by the Supreme Court in the film, ""The news isn't for the government. It's for the governed."""
THE POST,2 May 2019,9/10,"This film is about the attempts of The Washington Post to publish the top secret Pentagon Papers during 1971 after The New York Times scoops them on that. Meryl Streep is publisher Katherine Graham, Tom Hanks is editor Ben Bradlee, Steven Spielberg is the director and John Williams handles the music score. The drama is pretty compelling if not always visually exciting to watch. Still, it enthralled me from beginning to end so that's a recommendation of The Post."
THE POST,6 February 2018,,"This film tells the story of a local newspaper who is seeking an IPO to stay afloat. The paper is at professional, moral and financial crossroads when they have access to classified government documents.The story is a bit confusing to start with, and I had to watch the first half an hour again in order to catch all the information and recognise who is who. After the rewatch, I can follow the story without problem. I can say that it has a thrilling plot, as it recounts the high pressure environment in the newspaper office. There is so much at stake, hence the story is very engaging."
THE POST,16 December 2019,10/10,"Meryl Streep stars in this movie directed by Steven Spielberg entitled,""The Post"". She portrays Katharine Graham,the first female publisher of an American major newspaper known as The Washington Post. She co-stars with Tom Hanks,who portrays Ben Bradlee,the executive editor of the said newspaper.In the movie,both Graham and Bradlee forms a great partnership in a news to tell that occurred during the last three decades in relation to the Presidents of the United States to the Vietnam War. In this process,they both try to uncover classified information from the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) and report it to the public.The movie was a good one in the sense that it provided great performances from Streep,who got her 21st Oscar nomination and her 17th Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Added to that,we also see a high-caliber performance from Hanks. The unlikely partnership between their characters - Graham and Bradlee - is a road to self-discovery particularly for Graham as she was able to carry on to the task at a time when women aren't considered as qualified as men particularly as publishers. Added to that,we also see how the Washington Post made it possible to uncover the government secret activities particularly involving the Vietnam War.Overall,it was a good movie that would be appreciated at present at a time when the news media has become too partisan and has focused on money-making rather than telling the truth to the public."
THE POST,23 May 2020,,"No need to recap the plot. The first part almost had me pressing the ""off"" button. Both the scenes and the dialogue are fragmented in rapid fire order. Thus it was hard to determine both the characters and plot. But then the editing settles into more conventional timing and pacing as the story emerges and the characters take shape. I suspect director Spielberg had reasons for the scattered first part though I'm not sure what. Anyway, once things settle down, it's a fairly riveting narrative as newspaper owner Graham must decide whether to publish the explosive Pentagon Papers and risk jeopardizing the Post's future. Considering what was at stake, namely high-level government reputations and the course of the Vietnam war, her decision was an historic one. All in all, it's more a movie about Graham than the PP's secrets or vital whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg who remains something of a side character. Then too, in the sense that Graham is having to power-play in a rich man's world, a subtly feminist subtext emerges. Nonetheless, as drama the acting is first-rate, and the settings well-mounted, though I did have trouble keeping up with the flow of middle-age men. So catch up with the flick if you can, both for entertainment value and for a penetrating glimpse of power-plays and just plain lying among our elite during the fraught Vietnam years."
THE POST,29 January 2020,7/10,"This is essentially a film about the freedom of the press - and how that terrifies even the most ""democratic"" of institutions. Disillusioned military analyst (Matthew Rhys) discovers the extent to which the US military had been misleading the government and population about the Vietnam War and takes some sensitive information to the Washington Post (initially, this is more about who gets the scoop - them or the New York Times) but rapidly the Post - edited by Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) decides it must get there first and with the support of it's ballsy publisher Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) they take on the political and judicial establishment to win the right to publish their story. The performances, under Steven Spielberg's direction, are fine - nothing much to write home about. The film is about journalism and the right of all of us to know what's being done in our name (and with our troops/money etc.). and is told in a adequate fashion."
THE POST,24 January 2018,10/10,"Based on fact film. In 1971 the Washington Post came across some confidential documents that told about America's involvement in the Vietnam War--a war the US kept saying they weren't involved in. It spanned decades back to the 1950s. The editor of the Post Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) wants to publish them. The publisher Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) thinks otherwise. Then the Justice Department threatens to sue them if they do publish them.Spellbinding, exciting and tremendously entertaining movie. Even though you know how it's going to end you're never bored. The acting was superb across the board--if Hanks and Streep don't get Oscar nominations there is no justice in this world. It's brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg and has a beautiful understated score by John Williams. A great movie and of the best movies of the year. A 10 all the way."
THE POST,31 December 2018,8/10,"1971. The Washington Post, owned and run by Katharine Graham, is about to list on the NYSE. On the news front the New York Times has managed to scoop them, publishing an article revealing the US Government's clandestine involvement in Vietnam since the 1950s and other Pentagon papers. Not to be outdone, executive editor of the Post, Ben Bradlee, has his reporters try to obtain similar information. This seems pointless once the US Government obtains a court order banning the New York Times from publishing anything further, citing national defence interests. One of Bradlee's reports manages to track down the source of the Pentagon leak and gains access to the entire Pentagon Papers. Bradlee is keen to publish but faces legal concerns. Moreover, the decision lies with Graham, who is torn between her role as a publisher and her friendship with Robert McNamara, US Defence Secretary for much of the Vietnam War. More importantly, publishing the papers could spell the end of the Washington Post.Great drama, directed by Steven Spielberg. I was sceptical at first, figuring that journalists-as-heroes movies have been done before and there is nothing left to tell. Spotlight (2015) was great, but was only released two years previously, so this smacked of unoriginality. Furthermore, when you consider that The Post deals with a political scandal of the early 70s, you immediately think of All The President's Men (1976), so this seemed particularly unoriginal.Personally, I was also sceptical on another point as I believe that some things, especially military secrets, don't belong in the public domain.I needn't have worried. While The Post does cover some of the investigating involved, the area movies like Spotlight and All The President's Men concentrated on, it is more about the decisions editors and publishers have to make in getting controversial articles published than anything else. It is also about freedom of the press.As for publishing military secrets, that side is covered too. The movie makes a compelling argument for the course of action the Washington Post took.Themes and ethics aside, the movie is interesting simply as a drama. The story is very engaging with a brisk pace and it draws you along. As mentioned, I wasn't on the Washington Post's side, or that of the press in general, at the start of the movie but by the end I was.Superb performances by Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks as Graham and Bradlee, respectively. (Though you would expect that from the two of the greatest actors of all time). They are perfect in their roles and their chemistry is fantastic. Streep got a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance (her 21st, 3 of which have become wins)."
THE POST,23 January 2018,8/10,". . . a devious Un-American lying bozo inflicting much of his carnage against Civilization while being held hostage within the icy grips of Alzheimer's Disease as he's shown spouting his warped world view facing a Real Life camera during Errol Morris' documentary THE FOG OF WAR, so director Steven Spielberg goes one step further in THE POST to expose the existing moldy Racist U.S. Constitution from the 1700s as the quaint virtual suicide pact which it has become in its encouragement of mentally defective tyrants such as LBJ, Tricky Dick, the Gypper, Slick Willie, Weasel Junior, and Jello the Hutt (all of whom lacked the self-awareness to realize that America would stumble further down the Road to Perdition if THEY lived in the White House). Spielberg deftly includes a scene at the U.S. Supreme Court during THE POST to remind viewers that this archaic clown panel appointed Weasel Junior to the Oval Office, and then allowed Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin to dictate its newest member, which will no doubt allow Jello the Hutt to permanently erase America's First Amendment, Freedom to Think, and to shutter the New York Times and THE POST once and for all."

Steven Spielberg's absorbing chronicle of The Washington Post's pivotal turn as a periodical - to wit: following the story of The Pentagon Papers, documenting the ongoing lies of The Vietnam War - and eventually finding the truth for the American public. Well-cast and a strong script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer the film is a perfect book-end companion piece to 'All The President's Men'.

THE POST,28 February 2018,6/10,"In the age of Trump, a movie about journalistic freedom directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep should have gobbled up every movie award in sight. And early buzz suggested that it would. The fact that it eked out only two Oscar nominations, albeit one for Best Picture, is a clear indication that something about it that was supposed to connect with audiences just didn't. And it's not hard to see why.""The Post"" is competent in every way that one expects a Spielberg movie to be, but it's done in by its mainstream sensibility and Spielberg's dogged resistance to ever making a movie that lets audiences think for themselves. This movie won't let its audience breathe, so insistently is it cramming its message down our collective throat. Its competition in the Best Picture race this year are movies like ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" ""The Shape of Water,"" ""Get Out,"" and ""Lady Bird."" Even if flawed, and at least a couple of them are, these films are intelligent and complicated, and they mirror our fractured times. They give us uncomfortable situations and characters and allow us to feel about them however we want without a pre-packaged moral lesson. ""The Post"" on paper may sound relevant in today's world, but compared to these other films it feels like a relic from a previous era.Spielberg has never been a challenging filmmaker, but he has for much of his career known how to tap into our emotions and give us films that resonate strongly with us. ""The Post"" just feels tired, like he's going through the motions.Grade: B-"
THE POST,1 May 2018,7/10,"The Washington Post faces a difficult decision: should it press on and publish embarrassing secrets about governmental duplicity concerning the war in Vietnam knowing that this might result in the newspaper being ruined and the editor and owner facing prison?Spielberg takes a real-life episode of significance, sticks some high-powered acting talent in at the top (Streep and Hanks, with 5 Oscars between them) and lets rip.Actually, no he doesn't. Spielberg is more or less incapable of making a bad film, but this reconstruction of true events, with a huge amount of built-in drama, fails to meet its potential. It's well-made but, for me, it never really caught fire. Perhaps this is because it resonates more for a US audience than internationally, but I don't think so. This film is technically efficient, but lacks heart."
THE POST,23 November 2018,6/10,"Steven Spielberg, with Jeff Skoll's activist Participant Media bankrolling his projects, has been on a kick for sentimental ""Great Progressive Moments in History"" epics with Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. However, this has to be his least emotionally invested project since ""The Terminal"". The trailer for this film just screamed ""I'm making this for the Oscars"" with its main theme
of freedom speech from almost 50 years ago made in an era when we once again have a president and press embattled and starring two - count em -
multiple Oscar winners. But then Speilberg gets shut out at the Oscars. He gets a Best Picture nomination nod only because there are ten slots available. Make it nine and this would likely not have made the cut.So I watch the film and my worse suspicions are validated. Tom Hanks plays Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post, Meryl Streep plays Katharine Graham,
owner of the Washington Post. The whole film has to do with the question - to print or not to print the information derived from the Pentagon Papers, government documents that show that from the 1950s the American government knew they could not win in Vietnam but continued to send American young men out to die in vain. But there is an injunction against the New York Times for publishing this same information, and the case is headed to the Supreme Court in a week. But the story gets muddled between two issues - first, the screenplay keeps getting off track with the female empowerment storyof Katharine Graham, a woman to the manor born who never had to work or worry a day in her life until her husband died and she was left the titular head of the Post. She doesn't quite know how to handle the old white male investors who talk down to her or the decisions that are now hers to make. Second, what EXACTLY is Tom Hanks doing with this role? Is he trying to be Ben Bradlee or is he trying to portray Jason Robards as Ben Bradleee with that obviously fake gravelly voice and pot belly? Instead he seems to be doing a killer Lou Grant.""The Post"" does manage to have some nice tense newsroom scenes, some legal decision suspense as everyone is reminded just how vindictive Richard Nixon can be, but all of the other stuff I mentioned overrides it. Oh, and is there anything more dramatic than the rolling of an old time newspaper press? But just how old time is this film trying to go? ""All The President's Men"" was set the year after this film is set - 1971 -yet this Washington Post newsroom looks like something out of 1940's ""His Girl Friday"" with the old Royal typewriters, dingy walls, and poor lighting. And you'd think that the director of ""Lincoln"" could capture the national confusion and outrage when the public first discovered the government had been lying to them, but no, other than a few protesters outside of the Supreme Court - zip, zilch, nada. The Judd Apatow comedy film ""Anchorman"" did a better job of depicting public outrage when Ron Burgundy accidentally profanes San Diego's name.Oh, and the punchline - the final scene is Nixon raving against the Washington Post as a security guard stumbles into the break in at the DNC one year before it actually happened. Since this is reminiscent of the same scene in Forrest Gump, also starring Hanks, is it time for a face palm or applause at the anachronistic irony of the situation? Mildly recommended because, hey, who doesn't love Tom Hanks? Just too bad that nobody showed up to direct the film. An editor would have helped too."
THE POST,24 December 2017,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's the first time a movie marquee has read ""Spielberg-Streep-Hanks"", so expectations are sky high - and rightly so. The result is level of cinematic preciseness we don't often see. As an added bonus, it also features both historical and contemporary relevance - the type of relevance that forces us to consider where we stand and what type of society we prefer. So for the price of a ticket, we get Hollywood star power, a history lesson, and current societal commentary ... now that's a holiday bargain!Meryl Streep stars as Katharine (Kay) Graham, the first female publisher of a major U.S. newspaper, and she delivers her most nuanced performance in years ... that of a conflicted woman coming to grips with her immense power at a time when many men believed she lacked the capacity for making such far-reaching and weighty decisions. Tom Hanks slides into the loafers of Ben Bradlee, the hard-charging editor of Ms. Graham's newspaper, The Washington Post. The role fits Hanks like a glove, and he even brandishes Bradlee's trademark growling speech pattern. Bradlee is laser-focused on what he believes is the right thing to do, and steadfast in his commitment to the cause.Of course, the dilemma faced by these two involved the Pentagon Papers scandal of 1971. The film kicks off with a quick timeline of the political maneuverings that led to, and escalated, the Vietnam War. When Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) leaked documents from the Defense Department's study on decision-making during the Vietnam War, and the New York Times published some of the pages, the ramifications were numerous and the fallout was ugly. The complicated web of deceit and bad decisions spanned 5 Presidential administrations (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon). It became obvious that those in power continued a war they knew we couldn't win. The cover-up was widespread and the string of lies were delivered by many. The government lost the people's faith, and then tried to crush the free press that had exposed its dirty secrets.It's only been a couple of years since SPOTLIGHT won the Oscar for Best Picture, and now that film's Oscar winning writer Josh Singer teams with Liz Hannah on a script that is elevated by an extraordinary cast and crew. We get the real feel of the organized chaos of a newsroom, and it's a thing of beauty. The clacking of typewriters, exuberant phone conversations, and a cloud of cigarette smoke all blend to create the fabric of an institution designed and intended to deliver the truth. As with all things, it's never quite so simple. We learn of the historical collusion between press and politics, as reporters and editors comingled with politicians, only to draw the line when deemed necessary. Both sides have flaws, yet as citizens, we simply can't tolerate the government manipulating and even quashing the free press - a free press designed to protect the governed, not those that govern (per the Supreme Court decision).Spielberg has delivered a master class of ethics vs legalities vs political power, touching on not just the responsibilities of all parties, but most crucially on the conflicting objectives of a free press (making money) and the government system (getting elected) it is charged with holding accountable. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (two time Oscar winner, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER'S LIST) captures the authenticity of the newsroom, the intimacy of private discussions, and the fascinating look back at typesetting machines and a newspaper delivery system that silently forces us to recognize the power of today's internet.As you would expect, the supporting cast is remarkable and deep. Bradley Whitford, Bruce Greenwood (as Robert McNamara), Alison Brie (Kay's daughter), Carrie Coon (reporter Meg Greenfield), Sarah Paulson (as Bradlee's wife), Jesse Plemons (attorney Roger Clark), and Michael Stuhlbarg (as NY Times publisher Abe Rosenthal) all bring realism to their roles. Two particular standouts are Tracy Letts (Ms. Coon's real life husband) as Kay Graham's trusted advisor Fritz Beebe, and Bob Odenkirk as The Post reporter Ben Bagdikian who meets with Ellsberg. Gender inequality of the era is front and center for many scenes - sometimes even a bit too showy or distracting. The prime example is the scene where Ms. Graham is leaving the Supreme Court through a sea of silently admiring women - an unbelievably disproportionate crowd make-up. The gender point is made clearly through the position of Kay Graham and her actions, and no further proverbial slaps upside the head were required for the audience to ""get it"". A rare Hindenburg joke is tossed in, and Bradlee is referred to as a pirate ... two attempts to lighten the mood on a story that deserves serious attention. Composer John Williams' score is never over the top, and perfectly complements the various conversations throughout. The film is quite clearly meant to impress how history repeats itself = those in power believing they are above all, while the free press tries to expose the abuses. It also makes the point that we as citizens must remain vigilant in our pursuit of the truth, as all sides have an agenda ... sometimes it's as complicated as covering up bad decisions, while other times it's as simple as driving up the stock price. With its cliffhanger ending, Spielberg's film could be viewed as a prequel to the fantastic 1976 film ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and that's pretty lofty company."
THE POST,14 January 2018,5/10,Oh dear how could a movie with such a cast and subject matter be disappointing? Well it is. Firstly there was too much about the newspaper business and the survival of the Post. Who cares. The things that matter were glossed over. The actual revelations of the Pentagon Papers and the implications on the various administrations. The worst part is the link to the Watergate scandal is glossed over and left out. That is more the role of the Post in bringing down Nixon since the NY Times broke the Pentagon Papers first.Meryl is alright but not worth winning any awards for. Tom is alright too but there isn't much to act. The wonderful Bob Odenkirk is a welcome addition.
THE POST,19 April 2018,10/10,"Steven Spielberg steps up to focus on the ills and hopes of American government and view of life in this multifaceted film about a cover-up that spanned four U.S. Presidents and pushed the country's first female newspaper publisher and a hard-driving editor to join an unprecedented battle between the press and the government. It is an unseemly complicated script by Liza Hannah and Josh Singer but with a cast that includes some of the best actors in film today Spielberg makes the story works well.Appropriately, the film opens in South Vietnam in late 1965 - the middle of the war. Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) is at a campsite with other soldiers to observe any progress in the battle for his work at the Embassy. At night, the soldiers walk through the forest before they are shot at by unseen enemy soldiers. On his flight home, Ellsberg speaks to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) and talks to the Chief of Staff regarding the progress in the war. According to Ellsberg, nothing has changed, which McNamara states means things are just getting worse. Upon landing, McNamara speaks to the press, lying to them and saying that things are getting better. Unable to tolerate the tenor of the progress and history of the war Ellsberg later sneaks out of the Pentagon with classified documents on the Vietnam War. He meets in secret with two of his colleagues as they make copies of the papers. Ellsberg reads them, and it reveals that four U.S. presidents (Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson) were covering up certain facts regarding the war, contrary to what they had told the press. Jump forward to Washington, D.C., 1971 and Publisher Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) meets with a colleague as she is set to take her company, The Washington Post, public. Graham gets a call from the Chief of Staff to inform her that President Nixon does not want The Post to cover his daughter's upcoming wedding. Graham later meets with her managing editor, Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), to discuss this. Graham makes suggestions to Bradlee about expanding their coverage on certain topics to attract a wider demographic of readers.And the rest is history. The leaks, the shutdown of the New York Times by Nixon, the transfer of the documents to the Post and the Post's decision to go forward with exposing the lies that span for presidents about the very wrong Vietnam War. As we all know now, in the end the Supreme Court allows publication by the Post, offering the judgment -'In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.'A fascinating reenactment of history, but the most poignant moment is the statement for Feminism made by Meryl Streep's walk through crowd of finally proud women at film's end. Well worth watching."
THE POST,14 May 2020,10/10,"Before Watergate, Woodward and Bernstein, there were the Pentagon Papers scandal. This film covered how the Washington Post published actual reports over several presidential terms about the Vietnam War. Meryl Streep was devine as Katherine 'Kay' Graham, the head publisher who inherited her husband's newspaper. Tom Hanks was Ben Bradlee, the editor in chief. Hanks and Streep were marvelous in their roles. The cast was superb in telling a story that needed to be told. I had no idea about the Pentagon papers at all. I thought this was more about Watergate. The film was done first rate. Hanks, Streep and Spielberg finally worked together and brilliantly to tell the story."
THE POST,22 May 2018,8/10,"Print media may be dead, but the crusader journalist movie is alive and well. ""The Post"" is just as much a paean to the newspaper's heyday as it is a warning against corrupt government, complete with top-shelf cast. Given the Washington Post's lasting legacy (to this day), you can easily tell that the Pentagon Papers weren't the certain doom they seemed to spell out for the paper. Yet Spielberg jumps right into the material, creating excitement even in mundane printing press scenes. This is a stirring tale, masterfully directed and timelier than ever. 
 
Sure, it's probably Oscar-bait, but you can't argue with that level of quality.8/10"
THE POST,17 April 2018,,"The film opens in Hau Nghia Province, Vietnam, 1966. Working in special ops under counterinsurgency specialist Edward Lansdale, Daniel Ellsberg is on the ground in Vietnam as an eyewitness of the futility of the United States to thwart the Viet Cong. On a plane back to Washington, D.C., Ellsberg informs Secretary of State Robert McNamara that things are staying the same in Vietnam. That is Ellsberg's polite way of describing a military quagmire.Unfortunately, the thrust of the good background scene above drops out of the film and the balance of the ""The Post"" focuses on the relationship of editor Ben Bradlee and newspaper owner Kay Graham and their decision to publish a chunk of the Pentagon Papers. Those were the top secret documents smuggled out of the vaults of the Rand Corporation by Ellsberg to inform the American public about the workings of its secret government during the Vietnam War.While the film features endless scenes with Bradlee and Graham in offices and dinners parties, the more interesting character development was LBJ's Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, effectively portrayed by actor Bruce Greenwood. McNamara was one of the principal civilian architects of the Vietnam War and the man who commissioned the top secret Pentagon Papers for the historical record. There is a critical scene in the film where McNamara meets with Kay Graham, pleading his case not to publish the secret dossier. McNamara argues that he and his fellow policy makers were guided by the domino theory and containment to exert ""military pressure"" on the Viet Cong. These cold warriors were what David Halberstam called ""the best and brightest"" men of their generation. As if paraphrasing Halberstam, McNamara, caught in the lie, tells Kay Graham that '""we were just doing our best.""Because this shallow film focuses on the relatively insignificant backstory of the publication of the documents, it misses other vital issues about the role of Ellsberg in stealing and leaking. Ellsberg is implicitly portrayed as a hero. But shouldn't Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning also be heroes? The film doesn't have enough courage to tackle that question.In the bonus segment of the DVD, it was revealed that Ellsberg himself met with Tom Hanks and Steve Spielberg. The DVD commentary discloses that Ellsberg was a Marine who had been on the ground in Vietnam to observe the quagmire in progress. His first-hand observations are captured in the best scene in the film in the opening sequence in Hau Nghia Province. But the film did not go far enough in revealing that Ellsberg potentially faced a 100+ year prison sentence under the 1917 Espionage Act. Sadly, Ellsberg's story is merely widow dressing for the glorification of the saintly publishers. The filmmakers missed a golden opportunity by failing to capture the dramatic moment when the documents that Ellsberg stole were read into the record of the United States Senate by Sen. Mike Gravel. More than 4,000 pages of the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers were part of the Senate record, which meant that any publisher could print them without fear of any legal retribution. Thus, the real hero in revealing the truth to the American public was Mike Gravel, not Ben Bradlee or Kay Graham. The essence of the Pentagon Papers was the revelation of a government that realized the war in Southeast Asia was a losing cause, yet continued to send American troops to their deaths in order to save face. The film points out that 10% of the war effort was to help the Vietnamese; 20% was to stop communism from spreading; and 70% was for Lyndon Johnson to avoid the humiliation of a defeat attached to his nameThe manipulation of public opinion and the lies of propaganda should have been the focus of ""The Post,"" not the romanticizing of newspaper people. Thumbs down!"
THE POST,10 June 2018,8/10,"You know what an Oscar bait is, right? Great director making a movie where legendary actors play usually roles of famous people from the history of the United States in the situations that made them famous. Such a film is The Post. Nothing in it is particularly original, from the camera following people in a room to give the impression of dynamics for a discussion in an office, the direction, the dialogues, the sometimes heavy handed scenes, to the way people acted. However, this doesn't make it a bad movie, only one that is foundationally sound. And whatever you might think about the formula used to tell this story, it is clear that this is a story that needed to be told as soon as possible. In fact, one might argue that it is a movie four years too late! Imagine the power of the story of the Washington Post publishing a top secret analysis of the Vietnam War that damned three presidencies while the government is trying to sweep it all under a rug and prosecute everybody involved back in 2013, when Snowden was leaking similar documents to that same paper, to astonishingly similar reactions of the government. Read the story of Daniel Ellsberg and his subsequent trial and how that influenced every government whistleblower case since. Yet, while Snowden is in exile, Ellsberg went free for doing the right thing. A disconcerting difference.It was said that Hank's and Streep's performances were lackluster, but I strongly disagree. Both were playing real characters so were restricted by their historical counterparts, while still showing true subtlety of play. In fact, it would have been wrong to make it about the various actors playing, when the real main character was the story and how freedom of the press is more important than individual or corporate concerns. It shows that history will repeat itself and so we must remain ever vigilant as the governments will always test the resolve of the governed in maintaining control over their own lives.Bottom line: a remarkable story told in a rather traditional way. If you can get past that, it is a movie that needs to be seen."
THE POST,23 December 2017,8/10,"Steven Spielberg returns to top-form with 'The Post'. This courageous & rousing true-story on the quest of The Washington Post & co., who used the power of Freedom Of Speech & went against the government and exposed a shocking truth, remains as timely as it was during the administration of Richard Nixon and now with Donald Trump. Its a timely film, that never forgets to entertain, despite its strong theme of democracy. 'The Post' depicts journalists from The Washington Post and The New York Times who published the Pentagon Papers regarding the involvement of the United States government during the Vietnam War.Spielberg has made a chase film with journalists. We watch the Team of The Washington Post go at it & their journey to uncover & publish the truth, will you you engrossed & captivated. With an outstanding ensemble cast who bring in their A-Game here, Spielberg edges out a historical political-thriller, with huge success. This is a relentless, courageous film, that has its pulse rising each moment & watching its HEROES uncover the truth & going against the government with force. 'The Post' is truly about informing the people about the truth & how the ones we lose at the war ground, are at times sacrificed in the name of cover-ups and heartless politics. Its truly a film punches you hard! Liz Hannah & Josh Singer's Screenplay is first-rate. Its gripping & sharp, never giving you chance to look away from the screen or the truth. Spielberg's Direction is terrific. The Legendary Oscar-Winning Director is in peak form, delivering one of his finest films in years. He commands the film with an urgency, that is much required here. He deserves some Oscar buzz for sure. Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography is fantastic. The lensman has captured the urgency of the narrative, to perfection.

Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee, are in superb from. Streep is wonderfully restrained in her portrayal of a woman facing chauvinism, despite being in power.

Of the rest of the terrific cast, Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian, Bradley Whitford as Arthur Parsons, Bruce Greenwood as Robert McNamara, 
Tracy Letts as Fritz Beebe, David Cross as Howard Simons, Michael Stuhlbarg as Abe Rosenthal & Carrie Coon as Meg Greenfield, stand out.On the whole, 'The Post' is a winner all the way.

THE POST,10 January 2018,,"Although I lived through the commotion of the Pentagon Papers in the New York Times and the Washington Post, it doesn't seem half as exciting in my memory as it is depicted in Steven Spielberg's The Post. This docudrama is in the tradition of fine films like All President's Men, and Spotlight and numerous other quality journalism films.Ben Bradlee, editor of The Washington Post, and Kay Graham, its publisher, duke it out over whether or not to publish the papers purloined by Daniel Ellsberg about the government's secret promotion of the Vietnam War. Even Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) knew the US couldn't win the war. Hence, thousands of young men went to their deaths for political expediency sanctioned by presidents from Truman on down.The excitement at The Post can be felt through the movie screen, a tension wrought from both sides about the privileges of war-time secrecy versus the freedom of speech of newspapers supporting the public's right to know. Yet, the director and writers Hannah and Singer play on another tension: the emergence of a strong woman, Graham, into a leadership position in a male dominated world. Given that most of the docudoc is from the liberal point of view, with only McNamara there to defend the White House's conservative power play, the film is Spielberg all the way with smooth camera work and a thematic emphasis on the righteous side of things. Regardless of his politics, the director can tell a story that places you in the middle of things. And I lived through the history without enjoying its revelations, as only a gifted filmmaker can make real and compete for Oscar. You'll love the dialogue, acting, and contemporary relevance!"
THE POST,10 January 2021,7/10,"Oscar winners Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, directed by Spielberg! doesn't get better than that team.

THE POST,13 January 2018,7/10,"The latest Steven Spielberg film ""The Post"" is a nice showcase of the real life 1970's battle between government and journalist which would go to the highest court in the land(The U.S. Supreme Court). The film shows how information is uncovered and leaked about the highly criticized ""Vietnam War"".All of us want freedom of speech and freedom of press, and us as people expect the news media to give it to us and when documents are uncovered by people in the press which exposes cover up and lies from many previous presidents, you feel relieved and mad also. And with this picture it shows the process of how to investigate and publish hard hitting truth even if it means to challenge the powers that be.That's what ""The Washington Post"" did as the owner a powerful woman in Kay Graham(a wonderful Meryl Streep)put it all on the line with the help of a powerful and well know editor in Ben Bradlee(the good Tom Hanks). As anything worth exposing and challenging is worth a fight for as it makes the powerful upset and angry.Overall this picture is a must watch for political history buffs also as it shows how the ever on going war between media and government began and how it became a political dogfight for each and all involved. Proving that accountability is needed for all."
THE POST,18 January 2018,8/10,"The message of this film is very clear. The free press is important. In fact it is critical to our country. This movie precedes the film ""All The Presidents Men"" even though it was made now, years after it. The story of The Pentagon Papers does lead to Water Gate. In many ways it is more important.Irony here is the film ends with the Watergate Break-In happening. This story lays out with a chilling accuracy how money had already bought our media in 1971. Meryl Streep is excellent as the owner of The Washington Post. She is presented as the woman who has to decide if the press is truly free to publish a sensatational story and it is based upon the real story.The IR (Rand) company was truly involved in leaking the Pentagon Papers. Daniel Ellsberg was truly the whistle blower who got these papers released. Yes, everyone from the French, to Ike, JFK-Johnson, and Nixon all lied to the World and the United States about South East Asia and Vietnam. In fact, when Gerald Ford gave Nixon a ""full and complete pardon"" in 1975, it permanently covered up Nixon's Watergate Crimes, and his crimes in South East Asia. You see, Nixon as VP under Ike was involved in this much earlier than has ever been reported. It still remains to be seen if his role under Ike will ever come to light even now.What is not uncovered here is who really was the source of the Pentagon Papers for the NY Times. The movie hints that Ellsberg was also their source, but does not state that as fact. Tom Hanks makes an excellent Ben Bradlee here, a role Jason Robards did in 1976. He does look younger than Robards, so when the inevitable Double-Feature of these films is shown down the road, the carryover will look logical. Kay Graham (Streep) is perfectly drawn as the woman who is only in her postion of owner of the Post because of the death of her husband. Now while this is a very good drama, Bruce Greenwoods portrayal of Robert McNamara is excellent but does not allow his character whose intimate relationship with Graham (Streep) to mention a very important fact that could have possibly been part of their relationship if it was this close. This also exposes a major flaw in the media showing it has already been bought. This fact did not come out until 2003 -
"" On October 2, 1963, Kennedy received the report of a mission to Saigon by McNamara and Maxwell Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The main recommendations, which appear in Section I(B) of the McNamara-Taylor report, were that a phased withdrawal be completed by the end of 1965 and that the ""Defense Department should announce in the very near future presently prepared plans to withdraw 1,000 out of 17,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Vietnam by the end of 1963."" At Kennedy's instruction, Press Secretary Pierre Salinger made a public announcement that evening of McNamara's recommended timetable for withdrawal.""Now if Graham and McNamara had this close relationship, he would have told her about this in 1971. Obviously, this was either not the case, or this fact was not reported for many years because of the bias of the rich elite running the ""free press"". This is the first hint of not only why a free press is important, but also a press that is intelligent enough to get the story right. There can be no reason that the press buried this fact for so many years, unless the press was either not free, or just plain stupid. I give this film credit for getting the history right, though the script might be off about the Graham-McNamara relationship.One thing interesting about this is JFK Conspiracy books reported the JFK Plan for withdrawal from Vietnam many years before 2003 when the free press finally confirmed it. Even JFK in 1991 mentioned it, which has to make you question how paranoid the ""Free Press"" was about that film in 1991?"
THE POST,13 February 2018,8/10,"""She did it again!"", racking up Oscar nominations (her 21st) until she will finally get her fourth golden statuette, Meryl Streep sets an insuperable barrier for her fellow screen thespians to surmount, a priori, the most possible future emulator are Aussie Cate Blanchett and Brit Kate Winslet (both with 7 nominations under their belts so far), and stateside, 4-times nominee Jennifer Lawrence has a faint chance considering her relative youth and 5-times nominee Amy Adams comes as a long shot if her momentum catches up. THE POST, upholds the venerable tradition from former Oscar-winners like ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN (1976) (to which the film can be deemed as a prequel) and the recent BEST PICTURE champ SPOTLIGHT (2015), is a rousing true-story in praise of the integrity of journalism, the hallowed beacon and guardian of USA's democracy and a cardinal token of liberty which the country fervently promulgates. The time is 1971, Streep plays Katharine Graham, the owner and publisher of Washington Post, has to make a crucial call of whether or not the Post should publish the notorious Pentagon papers before a court injunction comes into effect, banning divulging classified governmental dossiers relative to the truth about Vietnam Wars, and comes in for its ramifications from the Nixon-resided White House. Spielberg marshals a briskly intelligible narrative arc which shows its conscientious concern with a global audience in its heart, the progression is put into effectual momentum on the strength of its gliding choreography of camera and concise editing choices (e.g. in the heightened crunch when Katharine negotiates with various parties on the phone) among others, and what strikes as palpably mesmerizing is Spielberg's felicitous blocking of his often chock-a-block ensemble, whether they are in the Post's office or Katharine's plush home where dinner or party is organized, the transmission of immediacy, agency and efficacy is conduced with winning panache (if laced with several belabored snippets, say the stilted inclusion of a dark-skinned female assistant getting a word in edgewise with Katharine outside the courtroom). The characterization of its dramatis personae, save the obvious wow factor of its female lead, is functional and one-faceted, especially the gung-ho journalists, almost run to boilerplate, it lacks the clinical poise which distinguishes SPOTLIGHT from its ilk, as great as Tom Hanks and as eloquently as his portrayal of editor in chief Ben Bradlee engages us (the same character won an Oscar for Jason Robards in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN), he doesn't live up to his co-star's caliber due to the film's surface-scratching practicality. And among the subservient roles, Bob Odenkirk's assistant editor Ben Bagdikian is given some special treatment to ruminate during the on-going hubbub but it is Tracy Letts, who emits such humility and allegiance in his quiet role as Fritz Beebe, the chairman of the Post, that appears as the unsung hero; whereas two female characters are vouchsafed with message-delivering, Sarah Paulson as Ben's wife, Antoinette, self-consciously illuminates Katharine's bravery to her self-vaunting hubby, and through the mouth of reporter Meg Greenfield (Carrie Coon), THE POST enunciates its righteous tenet ""The press was to serve the governed, not the governors"", rams home the allusion between Nixon and Trump with a slam-dunk bang. For all intents and purposes, Streep's performance is roundly stricture-free, her Katharine is a fish out of water in a men's clique from whom she is perpetually disparaged and patronized (even from Ben), feels enfeebled by the potential catastrophe which would throw away her dead father and husband's entire legacy, Streep doesn't apply hyperbole to underscore Katharine's fix, instead, she weaves through it with almost understated gestures until her climatic, counter-intuitive (a feature more predisposed to the female sex) decision, to hit the bull's eye with its women-empowering reverberation, after all, on that matter, everyone can only dance to her tunes. All in all, Streep's award-worthy transcendence is something no one can take away from this opportune bio-pic tossed off swiftly under the aegis of Mr. Spielberg's reassuring confidence."
THE POST,6 April 2018,7/10,"Some people have expressed puzzlement that a movie about the Pentagon Papers centers around the Washington Post's attempt to catch up to the New York Times rather than the Times own coverage. But the thing to understand is that, unlike All the Presidents Men, this isn't a reporting story. Instead, the movie is partly about the need to face down powerful forces, and part a characters study of a smart, capable woman, Katherine Graham, whose live in a pre-feminist world leaves her uncomfortable with showing people how smart and capable she is.Streep is wonderfully subtle as Graham. In an early scene she speaks knowledgeably about an issue, yet in a big meeting she finds herself ignored and seems unwilling or incapable of changing the dynamic. The movie watches her move, inch by inch, into her inherited power. But even at the end, she never loses that softness of a woman who doesn't want to scare men anymore than she has to.The story itself is engrossing and the cast is quite good. The movie starts rather slowly, and Spielberg's direction is competent (of course) but rather subdued, but by the end I was very taken with the film."
THE POST,24 July 2019,2/10,"Not my kind of movie, at all. not entertaining, at all. super boring and mostly uninteresting. i'm glad it happened and i applaud the real life people for doing it, but i could barely get through this movie. even other similar movies like bridge of spies and spotlight were much more entertaining than this. (1 viewing)"
THE POST,23 February 2020,4/10,"Steven Spielberg's movie recreating the story behind the Washington Post's articles on the Pentagon Papers exposing years of government mistruths on the Vietnam War, is obviously set up as a big deal. John Williams is called on to yet again deliver one of his this time lesser soundtracks, no expense is spared on recreating the Post's newsroom and printing press and there's a cast of it seems like thousands, headed by Mr and Mrs Hollywood Royalty, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.I get that it was a big, big story in America at the time, in establishing the constitutional right of a free press to effectively speak truth to power, especially as at that time the government of the day was that of the since disgraced President Nixon, with of course, its very obvious read-across to a let's say yet-to-be officially disgraced current Republican president. I also usually enjoy true-life crusading newspaper stories going all the way back to ""All The President's Men"", in which, in a piece of almost instant karma soon afterwards, the same paper's journalistic duo Woodward and Bernstein broke the Watergate story which in time would bring down Nixon. However something for me was off this time.Maybe it was the unnecessary, too blatantly obvious prologue set on the battlefield of Vietnam as if we didn't know what the point of the movie was about. Then there was the elevated ""heroism"" of the Post's publisher Kay Graham and editor Ben Bradlee which I felt was overdone. Much, indeed too much is made of Streep's multi-millionaire Graham's troubles in seemingly running a newspaper on her own in what is very much a man's world just at the time when she's floating her paper on the New York Stock Exchange.When the big story falls into its lap and with it, attendant government pressure threatening the viability of the flotation, she has to make the decision whether to run the story or not which while not to belittle the choice she actually made, seems to me again to be overdramatised. There are clunky scenes where we see Streep find her backbone and moral compass by drawing on her daughter's support at the time Streep's husband committed suicide and so landed her with the sole ownership of the paper, then later bumping into a young female Supreme Court intern on the day of the trial who naturally offers her support despite being a government employee herself because her brother served in 'nam and golly-gee I admire you for standing up for all our rights. And why, after the trial does Streep walk through a crowd of women as she makes her exit, it almost seeming as if she made her stand on behalf of woman's lib rather than freedom of speech.It seemed to me that Spielberg tried too hard to make every development seem like a cliff-hanging game-changer with noble speeches pouring out of all and sundry in favour of the constitution. I also didn't think the acting sold the premise either as Streep and Hanks dip into their trick-bags of facial expressions one more time for Uncle Steven to deliver very artificial and too-obviously acted performances.A very talky, long, slow movie, glorying in its own seriousness, I just couldn't get behind it at all. And you can print that."
THE POST,25 June 2018,7/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA true life dramatization set in the early 1970s, about Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), who was thrust into the position of running the Washington Post following the death of her husband. Her chief editor, Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), is determined to run with a story that the rival New York Times couldn't handle, regarding the US government's full knowledge of the futility of the involvement of the US in Vietnam. Needless to say, the Nixon Administration refused to take this lying down, and the team were thrust into a game-changing legal battle, in which freedom of the press was dramatically challenged.In the pre-internet era, a major scandal splashed across the frontpages of the tabloid spreadsheets was seen as the greatest threat prominent people or institutions could face. Today, with high court battles and injunctions, it's obviously still seen as a threat, but with more futility given how quickly it can end up spread all over the internet. In between making big blockbuster movies, Steven Spielberg likes to engage our minds more with considered, intelligent films such as this. While it's a very interesting concept, sadly the end result is something that isn't quite as riveting or revelatory as it could have been.
He may have plenty of juicy subject matter to chew on, but here Spielberg doesn't always manage to keep the pace flowing at the required level it needs to be, and the result is an overly talky and protracted piece that, crucially at the beginning, fails to really engage us much as it could. That said, it does perk up a bit about mid-way through, and still manages to keep us at least fairly interested in what is still a very promising story with lots of potential. Carrying the film, Streep is elegant and refined, while in a supporting role, Hanks pulls off the kind of work he can do in his sleep. Both are complimented by a supporting cast including Bruce Greenwood and Matthew Rhys.It's certainly encouraging that films like this, that require you to think and have an attention span of more than two seconds, still get made today. Sadly, they really need to fire on all cylinders, and while this is an interesting, intellectual piece of work, it's just not as seat edge and compelling as it needs to be. ***"
THE POST,21 January 2018,6/10,"Essentially a prequel to 'All The President's Men (1976)', this bio-pic covers the Washington Post's uncovering of the scandalous government cover-up surrounding the Vietnam war and represents some of Spielberg's most inspired directorial work in quite some time, with beautiful compositions carrying the slightly-too-long story through its conversation-heavy claustrophobia. Indeed, it is a technical achievement considering it was all put together in under six months, but there is a sense that some of the themes could've done with being mulled over a bit more or that some of the characters could've had a couple more scenes to make their arc's resolution really stick (though so many 'true-stories' omit these entirely.) Unfortunately, its also a little dry in a way which feels like we've been here before and already know where its going, even though some it does draw some tension out from its well-known situation and is consistently interesting. 6/10"

Robert McNamara is portrayed surprisingly sympathetically by Bruce Greenwood (who had played JFK himself in 'Thirteen Days')."
THE POST,17 March 2018,6/10,"I'm not going to talk about facts if they were real or not but the movie was kind of boring. From the trailer I've expected more action and different plot that was shown. The plot of the movie was a little bit like a Drama(like Indians Bollywood) which I didn't expect from Steven Spielbarg also the main part of the movie started only at the end so I'm basically disappointed for that too. Well, on the other hand, the movie is based on real events so people who like that kind of films should watch it."
THE POST,15 January 2018,8/10,"Movies about the late 60s or early 70s become more and more epoch films. They describe a time when dollars were kept in boxes to be used by kids ten or fifteen years later and still have some value, when smoking in restaurants and working places was the norm, when journalist used typewriters and lead was making the printing industry a health hazard, when people used public phones and put coins in them to get a dialing tone, and when parking places were available in Manhattan. And yes, a time when women were an exotic presence in board meeting rooms (unless they were serving coffee) and when printed press mattered. Yet, understanding the past seems essential to make sense of our present, including some of the wars of today that seem to have been fought forever (or at least since half a century ago). These include the need and right for a free press to tell the truth even if this is inconvenient for the government, and the need and right to have women who make key decisions at the higher levels of our society and institutions. These make the story and the essence of Steven Spielberg's most recent film The Post.The Post is actually 'The Washington Post' whose story we follow until the very moment that starts the Watergate case, one of the most famous cases in the history of the United States of America and of printed journalism. Before the newspaper became famous it was a respected but rather small and 'local' liberal newspaper, run for long time as a family business. They were not the first to write about the Pentagon documents but had their opportunity when the NYT were preempted to continue the publication by a judge order. The risks they took were both economic and personal and the film describes the crucial week when the decisions of the owner of the newspaper (Meryl Streep) and the editor-in-chief (Tom Hanks) promoted the Post on the national scene and wrote a page of courage in the history of the American journalism and democracy.Of course, the two principal theme resonate today but in a different context. There is no need for a journalist or for a TV reporter for any citizen of the US or of the world in order to make their opinion known or generate news. The problem is not in making the news public, but in filtering between fact and fake. Yet, the right of saying what is right and true even if it comes in conflict with the interests of the rulers is still a critical problem. So is the role of women and the attitude towards their contributions. Women are no longer a rarity at decision levels, but they are still under-represented, and other factors of the relations between the sexes in the centers of influence became a priority lately. I would say that of the two strong political messages of the film, the feminist one was better presented, and no little credit belongs of course to Meryl Streep. I was not enthusiastic with the level of the cinematographic execution of the story overall. I expect more from a film directed by Spielberg than plain and clear story telling, but he seems to have decided to let the things run and speak for themselves on the screen. A classical political story about good journalism deserves a classical cinematographic approach Spielberg may have thought. Yet, some of the technical details overwhelmed the story, and a few moments were too 'classic' in style to my taste. The three minutes dialog between Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) and her daughter compete for Spielberg's worst three minutes of film in his whole career. On the other hand Tom Hanks is - again! - stellar in his acting. He IS Ben Bradlee, the journalist professional and the citizen. This is one of the several reasons to see this film, which may end by receiving more honors that it deserves, for various reasons."
THE POST,18 January 2018,8/10,"The Post is assembled by director Steven Spielberg and stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. There may never be a better 1-2-3 combo then those three names involved with one film. And the star power doesn't even stop there. The rest of the cast is comprised of Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Alison Brie, Bruce Greenwood, Bradley Whitford, Carrie Coon, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Jesse Plemons. And the important thing to note is that they are all extraordinary in the movie, which actually hurts the film to some degree ironically enough.The one complaint i've consistently heard from people (and even those who like the film), is that it was hard to connect to any of the characters. If I'm being honest, it's not all that invalid of a claim. I can't say that I agree with that 100%, but I certainly felt like there was more room for character development then there should have been with the talent involved. Strangely enough, the immensely talented cast distracts from the lack of character building by giving tremendous performances. I'm a sucker for movies about the inner-workings of a newspaper, being an aspiring writer myself. I find all of the ins and outs of putting together a great lead/story fascinating. Perhaps no stories were more interesting than the ones The Washington Post (among many papers) were putting together in the late 60's and early 70's. That is of course, until the ridiculous surge of ""fake news"" in today's age. My god, will there be a movie about every single one of the absurd things that comes out of the White House during this presidential run?In all, The Post moves at a rapid pace with beautiful cinematography and long takes of a newsroom, there honestly isn't much more I could have asked for in that department. However, I don't think this was Spielberg's best effort (actually nor Streep or Hanks either). It could have used a better script, but the importance and relevance to this story is more than enough to make it worth watching.8.3/10"
THE POST,17 January 2018,,"I think the biggest surprise of this film was seeing all of my favorite TV actors (Matthew Rhys, Carrie Coon, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk) pop up throughout in some great supporting roles. Overall, this is definitely the most I have liked Spielberg in quite some time. I usually think he doesn't do the material justice and overdoes it (and there are a few scenes in here that do threaten to go overboard, mostly the ending and the inspiration that is supposed to come with it). However, for the most part it is the writing and acting that drive this one, and there's some great work there. The editing and writing is tight and crisp, and the acting (particularly by Meryl Streeo) is fantastic. This is definitely recommended."
THE POST,7 November 2020,7/10,"As the United States elects a new president, I decided to revisit a movie that while ostensibly set during the Nixon administration and revisiting policies in Vietnam from prior administrations through the Pentagon Papers, is rather transparently about the, as of this writing, current occupant of the White House. As others have pointed out, director Steven Spielberg did something similar and more subtly with commenting on the Obama administration with ""Lincoln"" (2012), a movie about the president who abolished slavery recalling the nation's first African-American president and of compromise and radical change through eloquent speechifying, legislative lobbying and cabinets of ""rivals."" ""The Post,"" to say the least, paints a more unflattering picture in its presidential comparison of Nixon to Trump. This is a movie about presidents and their administrations lying to the public, interfering with the freedom of the press and, ultimately, abusing their power to undermine democratic elections, as well as being a movie about the resistance thereof from whistle blowers, the press and protesters.If all of that weren't obvious enough, being released after the 2016 electoral defeat of Hillary Clinton, center stage of the movie's conflict between the press and the president is the owner of the Washington Post newspaper, who is also a woman, and the obstacles she faces in her rise to power in a patriarchal society becomes a major theme of the picture. It helps, too, that Meryl Streep is in the role. She earned her Oscar nomination with that one phone-call scene alone. When I first saw it in theatres upon initial release, the audience I was in broke into cheers and clapping at that moment. Regardless of politics, it's some fine dramatic acting and tension built cinematographically and through editing. Some of the other performances here have received praise by others, but this is Streep's show. The others are fine, too, although I found the casting of Matthew Rhys awkward--not due to his acting, but because at the time I associated him mostly with the TV series ""The Americans,"" where he plays a Russian spy interfering in American affairs. Thinking about a Russian spy challenging President Trump probably wasn't what Spielberg and company intended.While at face value ""The Post"" is something of a poor man's ""All the President's Men"" (1976), such mainstream and sometimes oblique commentaries on the Trump administration may have the most lasting impact on motion-picture tellings of history, even though there've been plenty of documentaries already and, such as the second ""Borat"" prank video, some mockumentaries. Two other such movies that come readily to my mind are Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), which deals more with present racial issues through a historical prism and with a more blatant commentary on Trump than in ""The Post,"" and, on the opposite end of the political spectrum, Clint Eastwood's ""Richard Jewell"" (2019), which is something of a counterargument on the press to Spielberg's picture, as well as an unflattering portrayal of the FBI. I think this is the most interesting thing about such movies; otherwise, we're merely dealing with rather routine biopics and history lessons. But, history is always being recorded, made and remade through the lens of the present."
THE POST,20 February 2018,,"From the greatest filmmaker of our time comes another politically charged historical drama that's crafted with care, narrated with flair & exhibits first-rate craftsmanship in all aspects of filmmaking. Marking Steven Spielberg's fifth collaboration with the ever-reliable Tom Hanks and his very first with the seasoned Meryl Streep, The Post is both timely & topical, for the infamous chapter of United States history it brings to cinematic life resonates strongly with the nation's current sociopolitical climate. And thanks to Spielberg's assured direction & excellent performances from its outstanding ensemble, it is riveting from beginning to end."
THE POST,28 December 2018,6/10,"Steven Spielberg. Meryl Streep. Tom Hanks. The Post should be a powerhouse, but instead it's a mediocre power-of-the-press drama filled with thinly-veiled criticisms of the current administration. And the problem with this movie putting all its heavy-handed messages in bold is that, at times, instead of talking to each other, it feels like the characters are preaching directly to the viewing audience. This film isn't anything to stop the presses over."
THE POST,13 April 2021,7/10,"The PostA very well made but also very straight forward movie about a moving moment in newspaper publishing history. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep are both superb-and the few scenes where it is just the two of them (like an early restaurant conversation) they are really amazing. Worth seeing just for that, if you love good acting.But what drives the movie is a sense of justice-and a certainly pro-democracy anti-Republican kind of justice (that's a given, these days). That is-Nixon was a crook and was trying to squash the free press, and the people behind the scenes, publisher and editor, were caught in a trap because they were in many ways part of the social and political world of their subjects.This is where the movie has real potential, trying to remind us how even newspapers are caught up in the actual net they are reporting on. Which means lots of conflicts. The screenplay starts to deal with this (the writers would insist they dealt with it thoroughly) but in fact they miss a real opportunity to talk about a huge problem of boundaries and honesty in reporting. And publishing.What the movie turns to more convincingly is a straight up drama about the courage of a relatively small newspaper (the Washington Post) in a quest to give facts and depth to our understanding of the Vietnam War. The Pentagon Papers would be a resounding encouragement to good investigative journalism. And the movie ends (with no spoiler here) with a quiet, and chilling, portrayal of the discovery of the Watergate break-in.So, a great story, with some great acting. End of story. (Though you can find MORE of the real story in a recent New Yorker article about the connection between the Pentagon Papers and Watergate.)"
THE POST,27 August 2021,7/10,"The movie is good, but the plot is a bit boring. I didn't know much about the subject, maybe that's why. But it was still a good movie."
THE POST,7 May 2018,8/10,"First, a comment about the one star ratings. Most people thought it was boring, slow, dull and over acted by our two main characters. My response is that retelling how a newspaper publishes what is now a fifty year old story is not the stuff of imagination. Publishing a newspaper is a tedious job, so good luck with figuring out how to tell that story for film. Importantly, the overacting probably didn't really alter the substance of the narrative, and was probably meant to add spice to what is by nature a bland meal. 
Second, my thoughts as the credits roll. Who were the three Supreme Court justices who voted against ""freedom of the press"" as a right of the people being governed, and voted for the protection for the governing. Do those three bear any similarity to current Supreme Court justices? At the end, Nixon sounded a lot like someone who is currently in that role."

THE POST,4 December 2018,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.Leave it to Mr. Spielberg to take a material about journalism and make it into a fascinatingly involving and entertaining 2 hours movie. ""The Post"" (2017) for me is surely the most entertaining and involving movie about journalism i have ever seen (and i did see ""All the President's Men"" (1976)). ""The Post"" plays very closely to being to sentimental near the end, but hey, if it is done that good - i buy it. Acting was great by all involved as well as script and directing. But i must say the first 30 min or so of this movie were pretty hard to watch, because of not knowing basically what this story is about or nothing about characters the movie just throws a lot of information at you, but after that 30 min mark the whole movie just sky rocketed.Overall, ""The Post"" is a very entertaining movie about journalism and right of a free speech. Superbly written, acted and directed, this is top notch picture."
THE POST,16 January 2018,9/10,"This film basically grabbed me as soon as I saw the trailers, but then again I probably would have let it pass me by if it wasn't for Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, two actors that I have literally grown up with. Honestly, I still remember when Hanks was a comedy actor, though that part of him is long gone now and these days he only appears in serious films. Then we also have the director, Stephen Spielberg, which surprised me somewhat because I didn't expect him to get behind the camera of what is in effect a very political film that deals with issues that we still struggle with today.
 The major theme of the film is the balance between national security and the freedom of the press, and this is always a sticky issue, and something that has dogged the press, and presidents, for quite a long time. This isn't something that was specific to Nixon and Trump, but also something that dogged Obama (and to a lesser extent, Bush). Yet, while there is the issue of national security, we also have the role of the press, and that is to hold the government responsible. Yet the problem arises when the press and the government are basically quite friendly - this is something that we see quite often as well, and also something addressed in the film.
 The Post is the story of the publication of the Pentagon Papers, a study commissioned by Robert McNamara, secretary of defense under LBJ. At the time The Washington Post was little more than a local newspaper, however when the New York Times was slapped with an injunction forbidding it to publish any more of the papers, the Post, who had also received copies of some, decided to take the risk and follow in their footsteps. The thing is that we all know the outcome of this particular incident, though of course things aren't quite as they were back then, but then again the press has changed a lot since the early seventies.
 The other thing was the role that Meryl Streep played, that of Kay Graham, owner of the Washington Post. The thing was at the time she was basically a woman doing a man's job, and there was an element of resentment there. She had inherited the role when her husband died, and there seemed to be some resistance. She was also attempting to float the paper, and of course there was the issue that if she published the pentagon papers, then it could jeapordise the listing. 
 I actually really liked the film, and it certainly met my expectations. What surprised me was that it was made in such a short time, yet was still of a very high caliber. In a way it reminded me somewhat of 'All the President's Men', but that event comes a little afterwards (though there is a hint as to what is around the corner at the end)."
THE POST,22 February 2018,,"Cheekily, this movie could be called ""Prelude to Watergate"". Indeed, this is how it ends: the Watergate security guards discovering the burglars - identical to the opening of ""All the President's men"" (1976). Still, ""The Post"" is about another matter, The Pentagon Papers, although with the same ultimate ""villain"" Richard Nixon. While full details are available in the public domain, here is the brief background. The Pentagon Papers reveal that over 20+ years, the U.S. government had been aware that the Vietnam War was tantamount to ""mass murder', and could never be won. In 1971, The New York Times, followed by The Washington Post, obtained these secret documents and published part of them, thereby attracting legal action pertaining to conspiracy, espionage, even treason. But then, Watergate took the country by storm and the Pentagon Papers charges were dropped. ""The Post"" is the story about the The Washington Post.As if to remind you who is at the helm, Steven Spielberg opens the film with a prologue that might have been taken from ""Saving Private Ryan"", except for the lush tropical vegetation. Then, it is back to where the real battle takes place, insofar as this story is concerned, Washington D.C. To cut a long story short (a story fully available in public documents), the focal point of the movie is The Washington Post's publisher Kay Graham (Meryl Streep). While the promotional material shows Streep and Tom Hanks (playing Ben Bradlee, The Washington Post's managing editor) with equal prominence, there is a reason why she has been nominated for Oscar and he hasn't. Hank's role is arguably a support role, albeit an absolutely heavyweight support. I am not talking about the relative importance of the actual people, but rather the characters in the movie, and the level of acting skills demanded. While I wouldn't undermine Hank's role by calling it one-note, his character in this movie is a firm-as-a-rock type hero, steadfastly unwavering under pressure, upholding his principles. The Ben Bradlee we see at the beginning of the movie is exactly the same as the Ben Bradlee we see at the end of the movie. Not a particularly big challenge for someone in Hank's league.Streep's character, on the other hand, evolves throughout the movie. Perhaps not THE most challenging role in Streep's distinguished acting career, Kay Graham in ""The Post"" is certainly worth her steel. At 45, she has a rude awakening that, at the death of her husband, she has the responsibility for running the family business (left previously by her father to her husband). She has never had a job before. Furthermore, in those days, a woman trying to do anything important in a men-dominated world was ""like a dog walking on its hind legs"". Throughout the movie, we see Streep's superb portrayal of how Graham grows from tentative timidity to confident self-assurance. There are two particularly pivotal scenes, both about her giving the go-ahead for the publishing of the devastating revelation of how the Administration has lied to the people. The first shows her on the phone, with Bradlee waiting at the other end for her answer. A long closeup in which Streep gives a classic demonstration of what top-notch acting is all about culminates in Graham giving Bradlee the go-ahead, somewhat to his surprise (and, needless to say, jubilation). The second shows a small group (include Bradlee) gathered at her house, with some board members still trying to make her to change her mind. Here, we see the triumphant completion of the metamorphosis. Again superbly delivered, we see Graham giving them a piece of her now firmly established mind, concluding with ""my decision stands, and I'm going to bed"". Said decision underscores Bradlee's motto: the only way to protect the right to publish, is to publish.Spielberg still has it in him to tell any story in a most entertaining way. There is also a good sized solid support cast. I only want to mention one: Sarah Paulson playing Bradlee's understanding wife reminding him that although he is unquestionably brave facing possible sacrifices, he will be enhancing his reputation and may easily find another job. It is Kay Graham who is truly brave, she honestly tells her husband. If you have seen Paulson in ""America Crime Story"" (the O.J. Simpson murder case) which earned her a well-deserved Golden Globe, you would want to see her in any performance. It is only a small role here in ""The Plot"", but will truly delight."
THE POST,20 April 2018,7/10,"Steven Spielberg's The Post is the great director's most handsome film in years. Shot quickly and clinically while he waited for the effects to be finished for Ready Player One, the film, if anything, is a sign of just how masterful he is at his craft. Starring A-list heavies Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, The Post tells the story of the Pentagon Papers, leaked by disgruntled military analyst Daniel Ellsberg, which revealed that the President knew the war in Vietnam could not be won early on in the conflict. Many young men were drafted anyway, and sent to their deaths half a world away from home. The New York Times had the story first, but were threatened with a court injunction in an attempt to halt the publication of a series of planned articles which would damage the reputation of many high-ranking officials, including the President himself.It's a story Spielberg felt needed to be told now, and for good reason. There are many parallels to the modern day, only nobody here is forced to live out their days hiding in an Ecuadorian embassy or assassinated with poison. When The Washington Post is handed the story themselves (by a hippy girl who dumps a package on the first desk she sees), editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee (Hanks) immediately decides that the revelations must be released to the public. Being the intelligent man he is, Bradlee had long suspected that the Times had their hands on something huge, and refuses to be silenced by the government of a country whose right to free speech is written in its very constitution. The Post depicts the newspapers search to locate the source of the leak, and Bradlee's relationship with publisher Kay Graham (Streep). The heiress and socialite has her own reservations about the newspaper's upcoming stock market launch, and how the Papers will affect the reputation of her close friend Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood).There's an earthy, smoky quality to the 1970's-set The Post. Spielberg manages to capture the sweaty urgency of some of the great movies to emerge from Hollywood in its greatest decade, with All the President's Men being the most obvious comparison. In a world now filled with information at the swipe of a thumb, it's exciting and invigorating to see Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) spills his pay-phone quarters onto the floor as he desperately searches for a pen, or the sight of Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) holed up in a motel with thousands upon thousands of printed pages stacked all around the place. The large ensemble, which also includes Sarah Paulson, Tracy Letts, Carrie Coon, Jesse Plemons, Bradley Whitford, Alison Brie, Michael Stuhlbarg and David Cross, is impressive across the board, and although its hardly a stretch for such seasoned screen giants, Streep and Hanks - the former a fumbling yet oblivious feminist icon and the latter a cranky but good-hearted fighter - help the film to be incredibly watchable. It doesn't offer any further insights into a story many will already know, and Ellsberg is somewhat sidelined, but The Post is a timely stance against anyone looking to threaten the right to free speech and the freedom of the press."
THE POST,20 April 2018,7/10,"The Post (3.5 out of 5 stars).The Post delivers for a historical political film about journalists working for the Washington Post publishing classified government documents about the United States involvement with the Vietnam War. This is definitely one of those films were the audiences will be divided depending were their political views are. The Post is a good political thriller film. May not be for everyone cause it focuses on the journalists and editors of The Washington Post as they debate back and forth if they should publish the government's classified documents. And the consequences if they do it which can lead them to prison or if they don't they could be hiding a secret to the American people. Steven Spielberg does well handing his direction with The Post. It is a well made drama film. That delivers with performances by Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. The supporting casts like Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Bruce Greenwood, and Matthew Rhys all did good as well. Katherine (Meryl Streep) is trying to maintain leadership with The Washington Post after the loss of her husband. Which her staff questions her leadership skills. Besides Ben (Tom Hanks) is trying to get her to go with the governments secrets story that may have repercussions if they do.  Besides the films political standards. The film is also slow moving which some audiences may find it boring. But it does deliver a history lesson during the Vietnam War and The Washington Post event in the 1970s. It was interesting to see. When Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) views of the Vietnam war seemed hopeless. Sure, others may agree or disagree. Overall, The Post is a good drama film. The cast was great. Steven Spielberg direction was sharp with a historical moving script. It is slow at times. And may not be the type of film that is worth watching twice with its story. I definitely recommend checking this film out if you enjoy historical drama movies or want to see the events with The Washington Post trying to reveal the classified government documents."
THE POST,23 January 2018,7/10,"There is absolutely no doubt at this point that Steven Spielberg has no trouble expertly directing a film. Much like, say, Clint Eastwood, movies directed by these luminaries are always going to be 100% technically sound. The challenge for them is showing viewers why these stories are important to be told. ""The Post"" really struggles with that for the first hour of its runtime, but then ""gets it"" at about that halfway point and is compelling human drama the rest of the way.For a basic plot summary, ""The Post"" tells the story of the now-infamous ""Pentagon Papers"", which tell a much different tale (essentially that the war is un-winnable) than what the public had received to that point. In the film, the papers are essentially smuggled out of government control by Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), and collected as a journalistic story by news reporter Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks). This creates a very difficult decision for the owner of the Washington Post, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep). Does she publish the papers to give the public the ""real story"" of Vietnam? Or will she be cowed by the fact that doing so could ruin the ""family paper business"" and perhaps even lead to jail time.Coming somewhat on the heels of the Ken Burns Vietnam documentary, this is a story that should resonate with the American public (especially considering its parallels to the War on Terror and the current Trump Administration stance on journalism in general). Plus, the events weren't ""that long ago"" in the sense that many people who lived through them are still alive and able to see this film.Unfortunately, for the first hour the movie really struggles to gain traction. It doesn't have the clear focus of all the events interacting together, such as Graham being the female owner of a newspaper, journalistic integrity, or the role of the law in all these. One can see why all those specific tangents are (or could be) important, but to about the halfway point they just aren't working together as well as they could/should.After a tense and dramatic conversational scene between Hanks & Streep at a dinner party, however, ""The Post"" really kicks into high gear and everything starts to click. The focus seems to become clearer as all those once seemingly-disparate plot lines converge to form high drama.Only helping matters is a superb cast even despite the names I've already mentioned. ""The Post"" is a regular who's-who of quality acting talent: Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Bradley Whitford, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, Jesse Plemons, David Cross, & Zach Woods. Wow! With a cast like that, ""The Post"" can, in reality, spend half its runtime finding itself and still be an entertaining experience.Overall, I had this film pegged at 6/10 stars for most of its runtime, but the final 10-15 minutes upped it even further for me. The whole experience was very comparable to Spielberg's earlier political thriller ""Bridge of Spies"". Perhaps not the greatest movie you'll ever see, but so technically sound, well-acted, and with such a compelling message that, for the most part, its pacing flaws can be somewhat forgiven."
THE POST,18 February 2018,6/10,"While there's nothing specifically wrong about The Post, you can't escape the feeling that this workmanlike Spielberg effort is an oddly forgettable experience that lacks a real beating heart or a truly standout component to make it something worthy of much praise.Like reporting drama darlings before it such as usual suspect All The Presidents Men and 2014's big kahuna Spotlight, The Post sees Spielberg follow a very well-worn and inescapable pattern of filmmaking as we begin to follow the true life story of the Washington Post's dealings with the highly politically and potentially life-changing Vietnam War papers that leaked to the press in the 1970's.The pattern that The Post follows makes it familiar from the get-go and while Spielberg as per-usual can be relied upon to tell a story as good, if not better, than anyone else can, the very nature of The Post's being places it into a corner it can't get out of as we follow Meryl Streep's determined paper owner Kay Graham and Tom Hanks committed newspaper boss Ben Bradlee on their journey through a time in which the very nature of free-press was being threatened.Both performers are fine without standing out, Streep yet again sneaking into an Oscar race that she arguably shouldn't of been contending and in doing so both A-listers contribute to the fact that The Post feels perfectly adequate without ever threatening to be anything more, there are no surprises here, no real standout pieces of Spielberg magic, even long time musical collaborator John Williams score fails to illicit much in the way of advanced emotional engagement.What The Post does have in its favour however, and a likely reason as to why it has found itself competing in this year's field of Best Picture nominees at the Oscars, is a timely expose of freedom of speech and in particular news outlets reporting the truth for the people and by the people.In an age where it appears as though ""fake news"" has all of a sudden become a very real and dangerous thing, The Post is a not to subtle dig at our current state of reporting affairs and Presidential meddling and in reminding us all of the importance the papers, TV and general reporting play in our lives, Spielberg has done us all a favour.Final Say - As polished as you'd expect from a Spielberg movie that stars icons like Streep and Hanks, The Post is an easy watch and one that tells a relevant story but there's also something overly workmanlike about this particular awards baiter and a sense that we've seen this type of thing before and seen it done better.3 lemonade stands out of 5"
THE POST,25 January 2018,7/10,"Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks performances were lack-luster in this film... I'm not sure what all the hype was about. Meryl Streep especially had me yawning with her performance. And Spielberg didn't do much to impress me either. The pace felt really slow, some scenes lacking depth and others over-told. The only interesting part of this film was the story behind the film, that's it. 7/10 from me."
THE POST,8 June 2018,6/10,"Review:
With such a great cast, and one of the best directors in the world, I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be extremely average. Don't get me wrong, the performances from Streep and Hanks are top class but I did find the storyline quite boring after a while. I know that it is an important part of American history and that it changed the way that the newspapers reported the news, so I respect the fact that everyone who worked on this project, wanted to stay true to the real story but from an entertainment point of view, it is very one toned. With that aside, it's still worth a watch, mainly because of the chemistry between Streep and Hanks but don't expect a movie spectacular. Anyway, the movie is about the Pentagon Papers, that got leaked to the New York Times by an American analyst, Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys). Meanwhile, Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep), owner and publisher of the Washington Post, after her husband's suicide and the death of her father, is troubled over the preparations for the newspapers stock-market launch. With the paper under threat, because of there lack of resources, compared to the New York Times, Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), editor-in-chief, seeks to get his hands on the original Pentagon Papers, to leak the truth about the Vietnam war. When the papers mysteriously arrive at the Washington Post, a hand-picked team of reporters go through the pages of material, searching for the headline stories but their lawyers advise against publishing the story because the Nixon administration can bring charges against them, as the New York Times has used the same source. The final decision to publish, is up to Katharine, who could totally destroy the paper or establish itself as an important journalistic institution, so with everyone saying that she should back down because she could go to jail, she decides to publish the story, which leads to a monumental court case which would change journalism forever. There are some emotional moments, especially as the head of the Post is a woman, living in a man's world, and I did feel the intensity during the decision to publish but I still was expecting more from this unique collaboration, which might not happen again anytime soon. The period was captured extremely well, and the attention to detail was great but I can't see myself watching again, once you know the outcome. In this day and age of ""fake news"" it is an important story to bring to light but I doubt that it will make a massive impact like it did back in the 60's. The film only took 3 months to make, 9 months from script to final cut, so it's a decent achievement from the director, especially with such an A-list cast. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but it's a bit too straight-laced for me. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by one of the best directors of all time, Steven Spielberg, 71, who kicked off his movie career with the Sugarland Express in 1974. In 1975 he came out with the great Jaws, and two years later he made the all-time classic, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. 1941 came in 1979, and then Raiders of the Lost Ark was born in 1981. E.T. shocked moviegoers in 1982, and Twilight Zone: The Movie was released in 1983. In 1984, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom went down extremely well with audiences, and then came the Color Purple in 1985, which shook the world. Empire of the Sun saw a young Christian Bale showing off his acting skills in 1987, then Spielberg returned to the Indiana franchise with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989. Always came later that year, and then Hook was born in 1991, starring the late, great Robin Williams. Jurassic Park shocked moviegoers in 1993, along with Schindler's List, which got many awards. After a few years out, The Lost World, the Jurassic Park sequel, was released in 1997, along with Amistad in the same year. Saving Private Ryan came in 1998 and 3 years later A.I. Artificial Intelligence, saw a young Haley Joel Osment warming audiences hearts. In 2002 Catch Me If You Can and Minority Report were released, and in 2004 he worked alongside Hanks again in The Terminal. Munich told the true story of the Black September aftermath in 2005, and he returned with Tom Cruise in War of the World in the same year. After much debates, he returned to the Indiana franchise with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008, and in 2011 he released the Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, which I didn't really enjoy. One year later he directed Lincoln, which went down well with audiences, and 3 years later he returned with Hanks in the Bridge of Spies. The BFG came in 2016, and he released Ready Player One this year, which I haven't actually seen yet. What a Filmography! Spielberg has also produced nearly 200 projects, and he has 7 projects in the pipeline, which include another Indiana movie and West Side Story, which is in production. I can honestly say that he is definitely one of the biggest players in Hollywood at the moment, and I have personally been entertained by movies since a small age. This movie doesn't really come close to some of his all-time classics but I will always rate him as a director, mainly because of his unique vision and remarkable storytelling.Budget: $50million

THE POST,26 January 2018,9/10,"If The Post was little more than a piece of agitprop beating the drums for the value of a free press in a democracy, it would more than justify its reason for being. The fact that it is so much more is a testament to the skills of director Steven Spielberg and the talents of Meryl Streep (""Florence Foster Jenkins"") and Tom Hanks (""Sully""), working together for the first time. Written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer (""Spotlight"") and based on The Washington Post Publisher Katharine ""Kay"" Graham's memoir ""Personal History"" which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998, the film dramatizes the struggle within the newspaper over whether or not to publish the highly controversial Pentagon Papers in June, 1971 and it is an engaging and often exciting look.An explosive political statement that rocked the country with its revelations of how successive administrations, both Democratic and Republican, had lied to the American people about the nature of our commitment in Vietnam, the Pentagon Papers were first leaked to The New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan (Justin Swain, ""Luke Cage"" TV series) by Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys, ""Burnt"") after hearing Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood, ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"") say privately that the war was going badly, and then minutes later tell reporters that it was going splendidly.The study was designed to be a chronicle of American involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1966 for the benefit of future generations of scholars but, as the reporters discovered, the 47-volume document containing 7,000 pages showed how the government misled the people into thinking that Vietnam was a winnable war while privately conceding that it was not. The document also claimed that while the U.S. was pursuing peace talks, the military and the intelligence agencies were covertly expanding the war. Acting on the premise that The New York Times was in violation of the Espionage Act, however, Attorney General John Mitchell obtains a court order preventing the paper from any further publication of the document, an event that provides an opening for The Washington Post to become a bigger player in the world of journalism.On the direction of executive editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks) and publisher Graham (Streep), the paper's national editor Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk, ""The Disaster Artist"") obtains 4,400 photocopied pages of the document from Ellsberg, his friend from the days at the RAND Corporation. It was the same Bagdikian that years later Graham called an ""ignorant, biased fool"" in response to his criticism of exorbitant administrative salaries at the newspaper (not mentioned in the film). The decision of whether or not to publish, however, forms the centerpiece of The Post and it involves a furious debate that includes the newspaper's lawyers, bankers, and would-be investors.The first female CEO of a Fortune 500 Club, Graham was a former socialite who inherited The Washington Post after her husband's death, but had to earn respect in the atmosphere of a ""good ol' boys"" club where women were either objectified or invisible. Since she launched a public stock offering worth millions, she now has to weigh the paper's right to keep the public informed with the possibility of investor's pulling out and even a potential jail sentence for herself and Bradlee. Though Bradlee argues: ""The only way to assert the right to publish is to publish,"" and proclaims, ""We have to be the check on their power. If we don't hold them accountable, who will?"" Nonetheless, he is conflicted on whether to publish in this instance and the final decision has to be made by Kay. Ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court would decide the issue, a decision that is the dramatic highlight of the film.Unlike ""All the President's Men,"" where the only women in the newsroom are secretaries and reporters, The Post makes Graham's contribution visible even as it avoids anything negative in her story, such as her anti-union stance during the Pressman's Union strike of 1975. The film, to its credit, does point out that Bradlee and Graham both had cozy relationships with high-level politicians, relationships that would not be acceptable today. Kay, however, reminds McNamara that her son fought in Vietnam and that she owes it to him and others who fought and died there to expose the government's lies about the war.Perhaps the best tribute to Katherine Graham came from her son, Donald E. Graham, who later became chief executive, ""She stood up,"" he said, ""against people who literally thought they could push her around."" Streep's Graham is a bit unsteady at the beginning but full of gathering resolve and, when she decides to publish against the wishes of some of the prominent men on the Board, it is as if we are all saying, ""Let's go, let's go, let's publish."""
THE POST,9 January 2018,4/10,"Steven Spielberg's addition to the mass products of movies done lately. The ""important"" theme: showing us how important women are to society. Like Battle of the Sexes the movie does not hurt but entertainment is not its strongest point. Some people read the Bible, some watch such kinds of movies.Anyway, I am not a friend of rating movies because of their ""message"". If I have an important message and nothing else to tell (story etc.) I write an essay or something like that. Apocalypse Now is an outstanding movie and it got a message but even without any message the movie would be outstanding and entertaining (acting, cinematography, soundtrack, directing). The Post did not entertain me very much. Everything (acting, directing, production etc.) is mediocre, done for the right cause but without much care. And the so-called message, well, yawn... I mean, common, if someone is convinced that women are less ""important"" than men, this movie won't change his (or her) mind, and more likely, he or she won't watch such a movie at all. Well, The Post is no disaster and I guess it may even be good for people who need their daily dose of p.c.-speech to have a good nights sleep. Verdict: a mediocre output and just a jump on the on full steam running p.c.-train. How boring."
THE POST,24 February 2018,9/10,"I consistently read ""this is so Oscar-bait"" or ""another nomination for Streep again!"" to which I just have to say ""no, you're wrong! Get out!"". Opinions are opinions but if reviewers moan when acting is bad or a film is poorly made, to then complain that the talent on and off screen clearly desire awards...well, you're just contradicting yourself. It rarely gets better than this! Detailing the 'Pentagon Paper Leak Scandal' that involved The Washington Post and New York Times in debating to publish government secret documents. An ultimatum where each decision has a consequence. Publish the article and risk imprisonment, or hold off and let the administration continue unnecessarily sending troops to Vietnam. Freedom of speech is the clear theme here, and it is masterfully conveyed through a concise script that is executed perfectly by every single actor on screen. Honestly, I have no nails left...just kept on biting them! The journalism involved, both in the news reporting and in the company board, was electrifyingly intense. A subject unknown to me, I was enthralled and left the film factually educated which is always a bonus. Female empowerment is also evoked as the head of The Washington Post is having to fight her way through a board room of old school men. Hold up! Everyone put your film caps on...and ready: Tom Hanks plus Meryl Streep plus Steven Spielberg equals powerhouse talent. My mind couldn't comprehend the competence that was being shown to me. Give Streep the anxious character so that she can eventually stand tall (great scene by the way). Give Hanks the bullish character so he can throw his forceful, yet likeable, personality around the room. Spielberg just lets them talk. Just...dialogue. Nice long takes. Hanks and Streep. Talking. Yup, it's all I wanted. My only criticism is that the beginning was a tad too slow, but the gradual build up of tension was effective. Journalistic dramas rarely exceed The Post."
THE POST,18 January 2018,7/10,"Spielberg may be the only guy in Hollywood who can get a movie like this financed and released today. A mid-high budget drama driven by precise performances and bullet-like dialogue, it's a genre that rarely makes it to the multiplexes nowadays, pushed aside by superhero-CGI and Kevin Hart. That's a shame, as Post is a welcome reminder of cinema's distinguished history with entertaining historical thrillers. Whistleblowing, war-profiteering, presidential corruption, personal integrity, and gender politics; it's smart and engaging grown-up entertainment.
The Post is the morally-complex process by which The Washington Post published confidential Pentagon studies about America's Vietnam involvement. Concisely capturing the climate of the 60s-70s uprising against unwieldy government power, especially to influence the media, it's shocking how potent it's themes remain; not just ""media-vs-politics"", but Post owner Kay Graham's (Streep) story of having to overcome society's biases against her to do the right thing.
Streep and Hanks are a joy to watch play off each other. Their first scene is a wonderful long-take, just the two of them speaking, and it's richly enveloping, like watching two giants arm-wrestle. Hanks is fantastic, but Streep wins the match, delivering even the most difficult of speechifying exposition with unmatched naturalism and strength.
And that strength exudes from every filmed frame; it's almost like a Spielberg is a master director. Yes, the editing is strong, the direction consuming, and the story well-told. However, Spielberg brilliant command of his tight script serves to remind us that he's a guy who can more than handle sharp, overlapping dialogue (just rewatch Jaws). With great casting, honed direction and controlled script-management, Spielberg's has deliver his best film in over a decade."
THE POST,25 October 2020,8/10,"Excellent film, essentially this journalism-denunciation, at a time when we are experiencing an inversion of values, and the government pits the population against the press, world trend, publicity and transparecias two fundamental constitutional principles in favor of probity... Duo Tom and Meryl excellent , as always, and deserved awards..."
THE POST,9 April 2018,6/10,"Even the most casual of filmgoers could sense that a Steven Spielberg-helmed newspaper drama starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep would be making a play for the Academy Awards. Although some will misguidedly think ""The Post"" was made solely to earn Oscar statuettes, it's sure easy to understand why. The marquee talent and ""Oscar bait"" label, however, sets the bar too high for what's a perfectly decent, ordinary journalism film.The film is very simply the story of the publishing of the Pentagon Papers, in which the government moved to file suit to keep The New York Times from further publishing details of a study that revealed that the White House knew the Vietnam War wasn't succeeding but kept sending troops anyway. Also having access to the papers, The Washington Post - under the leadership of editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks) and publisher Kay Graham (Streep) - was in position to either cave to the Nixon administration's demands or risk its business interests in the name of a free press. ""The Post"" is the story of their decision to publish, which isn't nearly as thrilling as those who decided to write, produce and create it seemed to think it was. There's a lot of talking and hemming-and-hawking constituting drama in writer Liz Hannah's script, which received help from Oscar-winning ""Spotlight"" screenwriter Josh Singer. Most newspaper films have a strong element of mystery to them to aid the gutsy moral decision-making elements. They also have strong underdog characters compared to pushy, whiny white men.The pushy, whiny white men are presumably to contrast with Kay Graham, the true main character. One might presume a woman newspaper publisher in the early '70s to be of the strong feminist variety, but the film portrays Graham as an unlikely leader and hero, a woman of the mold of '50s and '60s housewives thrust into the part of a decision-maker. Spielberg deploys a few heavy-handed but highly illustrative shots to show Graham standing out amidst the sexism and gender divisions of the time.Streep also brings all this out in her performance, communicating the anxiety of the situation extremely well. Her character has the most at stake in this whole situation, which puts her in a position she's clearly uncomfortable with at first and slowly grows into owning. Her story is far and away the most interesting part of the film.Littered with pithy journalism dialogue, ""The Post"" walks a fine line between important true story and cliché free press drama. That language doesn't work as well when the journey for the characters hasn't been arduous. The Post was literally handed the Pentagon Papers and just had to decide what to do with them. Without any other drama or action, it's no wonder the film was finished from script to final cut in just nine months. Thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, all that decision-making sure looks good though. In all seriousness, though that's the perfect example of the undeniable quality of ""The Post"" working in service of a story that just wasn't that interesting or original to begin with. It's a terrific example of what happens when the story of a film isn't quite right; you can have the best director, cinematographer, actors and an Oscar-winning screenwriter, but the whole thing will turn out ordinary if the story doesn't beg to be told. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

THE POST,25 August 2019,7/10,Meryl streep takes spotlight in this movie with tom hanks and shows her great skills again but i wish the movie also focused more on other characters
THE POST,27 January 2018,3/10,"""The Post"" (2017 release; 116 min.) brings the story of the Pentagon Papers. As the movie opens, we are in ""Vietnam 1966"", showing a mission where the US troops are ambushed and take heavy casualties. A State Department internal reporter takes note of it all. Back in the States, that same guy decides to smuggle out a McNamara-commissioned study about America's decades old involvement in Vietnam. We then go to ""Washington DC 1971"" and we get to know Katherine Graham, owner/publisher of the Washington Post and about to take the company public to secure badly needed cash-flow. Meanwhile, her Executive Editor, Ben Bradlee, is trying to upgrade the paper's reporting. At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from legendary director Steven Spielberg, shot in a hurry in early 2017 when a gap opened in his schedule. The big challenge in a journalism drama like this one is how to keep the audience interested and challenged when the outcome is known beforehand. That is of course what makes ""All The President's Men"" and more recently ""Spotlight"" such fabulous journalism movies. Alas, ""The Post"" (which should be titled ""The Pentagon Papers"" or ""Graham and Bradlee"", as the movie is not really about the Washington Post) falls short on every level against these brilliant movies. ""The Post"" is done strictly by the numbers, and you can see the ""acting"" happening right before your eyes. Nor is there any sense of mystery (as in ATPM) or outrage (as in ""Spotlight""). It all just happens. About the best thing I can say is that Spielberg uses the Nixon White House tapes (remember, the guy secretly taped all conversations) effectively to advance the plot where needed. The 2018 Oscar nominations were announced earlier this week, and how this movie was nominated for Best Picture is absolutely beyond me. Let's call it Hollywood PC at its worst. Likewise for the Best Actress nomination for Meryl Streep, who (in my book) is easily outplayed by Tom Hanks (as Ben Bradlee). So many actresses that would be more deserving of that nomination (I'm looking at you Jessica Chastain!).""The Post"" wend wide a few weeks ago, and based on the lukewarm reception I was hesitant about seeing this, but eventually I gave in (due to a lack of new worthwhile theatrical releases). The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely. The movie played out pretty much exactly as I had expected, not a single surprise in it. A darn shame. If you love a thrilling journalism drama, I'd suggest you reach back to ""All the President's Men"" or ""Spotlight"", and steer away from ""The Post"", an ATMP-lite that falls short, period."
THE POST,2 February 2018,5/10,"Who exactly are the ""heroes"" responsible for the release of the Pentagon Papers? According to Stephen Spielberg, not Daniel Ellsberg, the man responsible for leaking the papers to the press; not the intrepid reporters who risked their careers in obtaining the papers from Ellsberg; nor The New York Times which was the first newspaper to break the story and the first company subjected to a federal injunction. No, according to Spielberg, the ""heroes"" were Ben Bradlee and the owner of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham, played by the darlings of the liberal Hollywood establishment, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Spielberg briefly handles the uncomfortable reality that both Bradlee and Graham were tightly connected to players in those past administrations (not Nixon) whom were responsible for escalating the Vietnam conflict and lying about chances for success (Bradlee through his personal friendship with JFK; and Graham, with her close-knit pal, Secretary of Defense Bob McNamara, perhaps the chief architect of the Vietnam War).Spielberg rather lamely dismisses these damning associations when he has Hanks as Bradlee acknowledge the tainted friendships by stating in substance, ""we won't do it again."" The actual decision to publish the bulk of the Pentagon papers is the other way in which Spielberg shows how Bradlee and Graham absolved themselves from their previous ""guilt by association."" Did their absolution make up for the past bad conduct? A better question is to ask whether what they did (sticking up for the First Amendment and Freedom of the Press) was an act that deserves so many accolades? We shall see. Instead of examining what the Pentagon Papers were all about (all that important stuff about how the US government deceived the people about Vietnam), Spielberg prefers to delve into the minutiae of Bradlee and Graham's machinations running the Washington Post. Quite a bit of time is taken up explaining how the Post was about to ""go public"" in a stock offering which is designed to keep the company solvent. The offering occurs coincidentally at the same time the Pentagon Papers are first released by the NY Times, and soon both papers are subjected to a looming federal injunction. If the paper is held in contempt (and its principal officers-that is, Bradlee and Graham-could actually be sent to jail), investors might suddenly flee and the Post could possibly sink faster than the Titanic. Is it possible that unconsciously Spielberg may have used the triumph over Nixon back then to compensate for Hillary's loss to Trump in the present? Could it be that this is wish fulfillment on Spielberg's part? And isn't Graham now being cast anachronistically as a feminist icon, as she goes up against her all-male board, most of whom don't like the idea of a woman running things? The moment where Streep is cheered by all the female protestors after the Supreme Court victory sounds like something that probably would happen today, but not back then. And Armond White writing in the National Review makes the very important point about the lack of inclusion of minorities while Graham was running the Post: ""Here is some of the most dishonest filmmaking of Spielberg's career: There are strategically placed blacks and women in nearly every scene (though not on the Post's editorial board).""Charles Bramesco writing in ""Little White Lies"" hits the nail on the head when he writes: ""But it's Spielberg's attachment to an America that no longer exists that ultimately becomes his undoing. He wants to believe that justice naturally follows truth."" Bramesco correctly points out that the ""triumph"" of the Post, supported by Spielberg and his liberal minions, is nothing but a Pyrrhic victory: ""Never mind that nobody implicated in the Papers faced jail time, or that the government has continued its sketchy overseas meddling elsewhere, or that moneyed newspaper owners - a position inexplicably placed at the fore of the film, while the leakers and writers who assembled the story get scant minutes of screen time - represent the greatest threat to journalism in America.""If you marvel at catching a glimpse of all the old gadgets that constitute the technology of the 1970s, then Spielberg's obsession with those inanimate objects might pique your interest. As for the acting, Tom Hanks is completely miscast as the gruff Ben Bradlee and one longs for a glimpse of Jason Robards in ""All the President's Men"" who was completely convincing in the part. Meryl Streep does much better than Hanks and interacts nicely with Bruce Greenwood who looks and sounds like Bob McNamara. Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian probably has the best of the reporter parts, as he's entrusted with ferreting out the Pentagon Papers from whistleblower Ellsberg. If you want to find out about the behind-the-scenes machinations at the Washington Post in the early 70s, The Post is a semi-reasonable chronicle of those events minus Spielberg's editorial adjustments which can best be described as continuous proselytizing or preaching to a choir of committed do-gooders.Ultimately, the sanctity of the Freedom of the Press here is really a baseless canard. Justin J, a poster at Rotten Tomatoes, grasps the absurdity of Spielberg's obsession with being on the ""winning side"". He writes: ""The Post"" does for the cinema of journalism what ""The Newsroom"" did for television: it uses history to preach to a choir of self-satisfied, smug circle-jerkers who pat themselves on the back for stating (and re-stating) a proposition that is already quite obvious to reasonable people. Should the First Amendment be defended and protected? Yes. Should anyone waste their time with this treacly, sanctimonious nonsense? No."""
THE POST,4 March 2018,6/10,"As I've already mentioned a couple of times this Oscar season (notably with 'Dunkirk' and 'Phantom Thread') there are films where you can't help but wonder whether if they didn't have their director's name attached to them, would they be considered as good as they are. 'The Post' isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but is it really one of the nine best films of the year and worthy of a Best Picture nomination? You'd like to think 2017 had enough to offer that that wouldn't be the case.The strength the film possesses if that it does a good job of putting you in the character's shoes. You feel the dilemma they are in as if it is your own. Despite being a complicated situation with multiple factors to be accounted for, you as an audience member feel like you can fully grasp the situation and debate back and forth on what decision you would make. It is also a well paced film considering how dry a lot of the material is. Meryl Streep has been nominated for a Best Actress award at the Academy Awards tomorrow and I'm not quite sure how, other than the fact that her name is Meryl Streep. Not only was she not overly impressive in this film, I thought she was actually phoning it in in a number of scenes. Tom Hanks was probably the best of cast, but this really isn't a film where any actor is given a lot of opportunity to show their chops. 'The Post' is a watchable and interesting enough film, but I fear it will be forgotten from my memory rather quickly."
THE POST,25 January 2020,8/10,"'The Washington Post' owner (Meryl Streep) and editor-in-chief (Tom Hanks) struggle with the decision as to whether to publish excepts from 'The Pentagon Papers' in light of court rulings suggesting that to do so may be a felony. The film is very much about the complex 'gray areas' between national security and freedom of the press and many people seem to think that it is a jab at the current Trump administration (which it may be) but the issue is timeless (although the 1970s may have been a particularly egregious decade in the US). The film is typical of director Spielberg: very well acted but portraying a world populated more by 'characters' rather than 'people' (the John Williams score enhances the Spielbergesque quality). The story is very interesting, although I agree with comments that the original leak to The N.Y. Times may have been more interesting than the secondary leak to The Post (but the Times story wouldn't have the 'sink-or-swim' drama or the spotlight on the travails of a female newspaper baroness). The topical gender issue is dealt with deftly (i.e. for a change the audience is not bludgeoned with the message) although the scene with the articling student (?) gushing over Streep's character seemed a bit contrived. Almost a prequel (and a great companion piece) to the excellent 'All the President's Men' (1976). The latter is more of a 'political thriller' than a 'historical drama', perhaps reflecting the fact that it was made only a few years after the events, rather than decades later. Worth watching, worth thinking about."
THE POST,13 April 2018,7/10,"As I consider Meryl Streep the greatest movie actress of all times, I have tried to watch all movies with her participation. And Spielberg and Hanks do not spread disappoinment either... But still, apparently due to the topic and being non-American, The Post did not please me in full. The ending was clear as the plot is based on real events, the twists were not too thrilling, and it was only the performances that let me focus on screen more or less continuously. Streep, Hanks, Odenkirk had the most dynamic characters to play - and they did it well - but when bearing in mind that it is a Spielberg movie, then it is too plain and ordinary, in the rear part of his creations for me. I do not envisage myself to watch this movie again."

THE POST,14 January 2018,7/10,"I saw ""The Post"", starring Meryl Streep-Into the Woods, Death Becomes Her; Tom Hanks-Sully, Elvis Has Left the Building; Sarah Paulson-American Horror Story_tv, 12 Years a Slave and Matthew Rhys-The Americans_tv, Burnt.
This is based on a true story and concerns a timely topic; Freedom of speech versus the power of government. It's directed by some newcomer named Steven Spielberg. It takes place in the early 1970's when Vietnam was the hot topic-should we be there or not-with protesters in the streets saying 'Hell No!' Matthew plays a whistleblower that spilled the beans on all the cover ups and lies being told by our government about the war-his proof was nicknamed 'The Pentagon Papers'. He first goes to The New York Times, who starts to publish some of the documents but is quickly shut down by President Nixon-he thinks he can do anything he wants to, since he is the President. Meryl plays the first woman owner of a newspaper-The Washington Post-and Tom is her chief editor. Sarah plays Tom's wife. Meryl inherited the ownership of the paper from her husband, after he died, so she is not real familiar with how papers run. When a chance pops up where she can get her hands on the Pentagon Papers from Matthew, she has to decide how risky it could be. Her chief rival, The New York Times, is facing court and possibly jail time and that was after publishing just a few articles. She has over 4,000 pages so it could be really bad. Decisions decisions. It's an interesting story about the right to publish vs the power of the government-or free speech vs censorship.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and war violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be a good rental."
THE POST,12 February 2018,7/10,"Another journalistic thriller from one of Spotlight's screenwriters, another Oscar nomination. This time we're investigating the pre-Watergate struggle between the government and the free press, a fight that went all the way to the supreme court and drew the personal ire of President Nixon. So loaded with parallels to the current social climate that director Steven Spielberg sprinted it through production, it's well-made but rushed, straightforward and more than a little familiar. Most impressive is Meryl Streep, who conveys vast inner turmoil as Kay Graham, marginalized publisher of the Washington Post, as she labors to balance her writers' integrity with an impending IPO that could potentially sink the paper. Kay's growth is what really drives the chariot, a compelling counterpoint to the journalistic sleuthing and boardroom/courtroom decisions that don't directly involve her. We see her resigned to the sitting room with the other ladies so the boys can talk politics, willingly accepting her preordained role in society, then slowly grow bolder and more outspoken as the waters grow dicier. She's never completely confident, especially in the one pressure-packed phone call that signifies her pivot, but that makes her all the more interesting and sympathetic. Where the antagonistic relationship between President and press signifies an obvious complement to Trump's war on fake news, Graham's battle is an equally appropriate nod to the recent push for women's rights. Rich and pertinent, it's an engaging watch, but the workmanlike, by-the-numbers production and hollow, lackluster climax left me feeling a little flat."
THE POST,23 January 2018,8/10,"When I heard about the premise of this film, the cast and the director I knew that this was a film that I would be interested in and I have seen the post and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a paper get classified government files that can harm president nixon, so they must decide whether to publish. Meryl Streep is the lead in this film and she does a truly great job in this film, she is strong when she needs to be, friendly when she needs to be and vulnerable when she needs to be. Tom hanks plays her editor and surprising nobody he is fantastic in the role, he is just super charismatic and charming which makes him super likeable as he always is. The rest of the cast is great too Bruce greenwood and Bob odenkirk especially shine in there respective roles too. The story is really interesting to watch unfold, there is a good sense of balance between the arguments being presented and it really helps the film. It is great seeing the twists and turns especially in the last act of the film. However, I felt like at times this film tries to show so much that certain aspects of the story feel underused and underdeveloped and tacked onto the film. The script is really good with some great drama involved that gets better as the film progresses. The humour is really nicely placed aswell to make these characters feel real. The style, hits the tension well and allows you to follow well. But as mentioned a little before there is a slight pacing issue with this film that affects it, also maybe a bit too much exposition used in the first act if the film. Overall I really enjoyed the post and think it is definitely worth a watch."
THE POST,25 May 2018,5/10,"I think we all know that Mr Spielberg knows how to make hit films and his leading actress knows how to act. But is that enough?This is a film about the freedom of reporters to tell the truth, to hold governments to account and expose wrong-doings of people in high places (specifically in this instance, over the U.S.-VietNam War). It's a good story, with only a few evasions of accuracy. For instance, C.I.A. whistleblower leaks have demonstrated quite clearly that the C.I.A. were actively misleading presidents and that not all the blame could be placed at the feet of now safely-disgraced feet of persons successively sitting in the White House. Historically, the big heroes were not the Washington Post but the N.Y. Times, although the film manages to sidestep this in its desire to have a female lead, and so be able to focus on the female owner of the Post and thereby cast Ms Streep. The emotions are painted vividly - some would say far too vividly for an audience fully awake - but the real problem for many would be Ms Streep herself. Not that she doesn't play it well - there are many 'Streep' moments of 'award-worthy' pauses in the midst of self-righteous monologues. Such are those on behalf of the lead character, torn between protecting her own fortune and doing the right thing. The unmistakeable context is that while the film was being made, released and subsequently, Ms Streep had not batted an eyelid at the similar high-level misdemeanours of her friend and political hero, Mrs Clinton, that were exposed in the cables leaked to Wikileaks. Her hatred of the person who won the presidency, justified or not, seemed to take precedence over the support for freedom of information that her on-screen character espouses, and this makes suspension of disbelief so much harder when the actor frequently uses her high profile to become involved in the sort of politics the movie describes. On-screen, her character supports transparency and the people who produce it. One might think that off-screen she would at least pay tribute to the present-day 'Washington Post' whistleblower, Julian Assange, instead of such vocal support for the people that her on-screen character would have stood up against. One doesn't expect movie stars to be their characters, but they choose their films and when then go on to portray themselves in the glory of such great characters (but making the opposite decisions) it rather trnds to reduce my enjoyment. It was a great story, and Spielberg tells a great story. But on such a big issue that still faces us today, one can only wish the film had perhaps been handled by a director who has not only skill in his or her art, maybe using a deft palette knife instead of a trowel; but above all the moral courage and sophistication to tie the story more poignantly to current events."
THE POST,10 September 2018,8/10,"(Flash Review)This spans the history of The Washington Post and The New York Times during the time of the Vietnam War involving the decision to publish or not to publish some top secret documents regarding the President and sensitive decisions of the Vietnam War. Detailing how publishing them would affect personal relationships between editors and journalists with politicians, the impact of the freedom of the press, the financial solvency of the Post not to mention the perspective American public toward its leaders. Easy to say a lot rides on this publishing decision. High production value, thoughtful camera movement, lighting and color usage with twisting and detailed plot points make this a riveting (yah, rather cliché descriptor) viewing. Not to mention the depth of a quality cast. There were also some stylish up close shots of the typesetting process of a daily paper."

THE POST,8 April 2018,8/10,"The Post (2017) is the newest Steven Spielberg film. It stars Hollywood heavy weights such as Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. I love that this film had these three attached to it, when you see that something is directed by Spielberg, and stars Streep and Hanks, you just know this is going to a slam dunk. So obviously I went in with pretty high expectations, and I'm glad to say that I was not disappointed. I'm a huge Streep fan, and she once again turns in a fantastic performance as the lead, Kay Graham. Hanks also turns in a great performance as Ben Bradlee. They are both so powerful and sure as their characters. The story is grounded in facts, which makes it all the more interesting, and Spielberg tells it in a very effective way. It writing is smart, the performances are great all around, and the pace is perfect. If there's one thing I hate, it's bad pacing in a film, it just throws everything off and my attention and interest is lost. I thought the runtime for this one was perfect and every scene was necessary. No, this isn't the most breathtaking film I've ever seen, but it certainly is a very good one and I recommend it enthusiastically. 8/10 for The Post."
THE POST,1 December 2018,6/10,"First the good : both Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep add yet another fine, beautifully nuanced performance to their résumé. There is also an important message about the key role of a free press in the survival of a democracy. The press is not there in order to flatter the powerful, to repeat comfortable fictions or to validate propaganda. The press is there in order to discover and publish the truth, so that well-informed citizens can determine their nation's policies and call their representatives to account. It is a crucial message, especially in our dark times, when ""strong leaders"" openly joke about killing journalists - or worse, when ""strong leaders"" openly kill journalists.However, while the movie may be as healthful and nourishing as oatmeal, it is also as bland and boring. Coming from a director as inventive and versatile as Spielberg, this fact is quite perplexing.At least part of this boredom is caused by the many, many scenes showing people staring at paper files, carrying paper files, sorting out paper files, sitting on paper files, copying paper files, discussing paper files, making little hats for poodles out of paper files etc. etc. etc.Another, more fundamental cause of boredom is the near-exclusive focus on newspapermen and women. The movie is good (even very good) at evoking the gathering of news, the examination of rumor, the analysis of facts, and so on. It is far worse at showing and treating the scandal itself. As a result the movie is filled with breathless sentences like ""What a disgrace, president X knew for a fact that nobody planned an invasion of that province"" or ""It's spectacular, this document proves that president Y lied about troop movements"". But the viewer does not get to see, say, president Y lying ; nor does the viewer get to see how president Y reacts to the later public unmasking of his lie. Neither does the viewer get to see the real-life impact of the lie - for instance, soldiers dying in helicopter crashes, eyeless veterans adapting to a life of blindness or terrified civilians fleeing into another country. Also absent is a serious examination of two vital questions : 1) how and why did so many politicians lie and 2) how and why did they get away with it for so long. The movie looks at these matters shyly and gingerly, shrinking away like a Victorian maiden forced to share a train carriage with a drunken sailor.While we're at it, the movie shows little in the way of international and diplomatic repercussions following the publication of the leaked documents. Yet another missed opportunity, both with regard to wider context and with regard to drama : it would have been nice to see, say, the reactions of a foreign head of state upon discovering that he had been played like a fiddle, or the reactions of an American ambassador somewhere upon discovering that he would have to spend the next ten thousand working hours trying to dodge questions about this incident or that...So no, ""The Post"" is not the most vibrant or vivid movie around."
THE POST,11 August 2020,3/10,"While both Meryl and Tom give there usual great performances and are supported by a good cast, I personally felt that this film was not driven enough. It lacked the tension that they were trying to build.
If I had made it, I would have shown the perspective of both The Post and The Times united and fighting their common enemy, in the shape of Nixon, together. I feel that there was probably more drama regarding the first exposé in The Times rather than the subsequent information discovered by The Post.
But, they didn't make that film, they made this one and I think it was ok, but I don't think I need to see it again. It didn't give me enough information about what actually went wrong with Vietnam, etc and although I understand that they were fighting for freedom of speech, I don't feel that this particular issue has a specific relevance to me individually at this time. And by that I mean, that there is almost certainly nothing I can do about these issues until a time machine is built (Should I decide it would be right to change the course of history that is). My generation weren't there and I'm on the wrong side of the pond to feel any association with this scandal. I could see how it might be more interesting to a Vietnam veteran or even just Americans and history enthusiasts, but it lacked something for me."
THE POST,27 May 2020,4/10,"Spielberg gets the best he can afford, which is the best in terms of professional movie making: a stellar cast, an interesting plot, a relatively contemporary ""message"" and yet...Being European I'll admit that I always found movies about Washington power struggles and politics rather boring. This one starts in Vietnam in 1968 and narrates how the Pentagon Papers came to be divulged: that is, thanks to the determination of Ms. Graham, the widowed owner of The Washington Post, who managed to make her newspaper relevant at national level in the process.Besides, Ms. Graham was the first female newspaper owner of the Seventies, so Spielberg can tack also a nice feminist notch, which these days is a ""must"".Still, despite the liberal and feminist angle, the perfect settings and the great acting, this is just a slick product that left me uninvolved and barely interested."
THE POST,17 March 2018,2/10,"Most boring film of the year. Spielberg is not the director he once was. Honestly, I can not think of a single Spielberg film I have seen in the past ten years that didn't put me to bed. The only saving grace about this film is the fact I scored free passes to a screening and didn't have to pay one red cent to a director who is unofficially over the hill. Maybe it has been 20 years since he made a watchable film? I'll have to check on that later. Anyway, the biggest problem with the film is that it drones on and on. The actors look bored and I swear in a few scenes it looks like the actors are reading off of a TelePrompTer."
THE POST,2 February 2018,7/10,"Having recently watched the brilliant Ken Burns documentary The Vietnam War I was really interested in seeing Steven Spielberg's take on just a small part of the story of that needless war . You don't get two bigger stars than Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep so you are pretty much guaranteed good performances but my worry was , was it going to be too schmaltzy? Thankfully the answer is no.This the story of Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of The Washington Post. With help from editor Ben Bradlee, they races to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover up of government secrets that spans three decades and four U.S. presidents. Together, they try to overcome their differences as they risk their careers and freedom to help bring long-buried truths to light.While I have to say I like The Post it did have the feel of a made for TV movie which is odd for a Spielberg film. It's very simply told and is easy to follow which is good for a political film but perhaps too simple at times. 
Tom Hanks is great while Meryl Streep seems to have slipped into her Iron Lady costume again.
I love the way the actual telephone conversations with Nixon are used throughout the film because that really does give it context.
Nominated for best picture , I doubt very much this will but knowing how The Academy fawn over Streep and that everything in Hollywood is about ""The Woman"" at the moment i wouldn't surprise me if she wins Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role."

THE POST,15 January 2018,7/10,"Timing, the old saying goes that it is everything. The movie The Post is about 40-years late for any shocking revelations. It's merely an attempted re-telling of the then largest leak in classified government documents. Oh yes, it was jaw-dropping stuff then as it was unthinkable by the average American citizen. In the last half-century belief in government has seriously decayed among Americans who now largely suspect everything is some shadowy rich man's game. Some things stay the same it would seem over a half-century later. Importantly, however, the free press was preserved legally. It would take the combined powers of unknown wealth in even more shadowy manipulations to control that press. I think we know that is what we're seeing now and this movie shows how we got there in many ways. It may be not so jaw-dropping now, but it still underscores what's at stake. That makes it still quite prescient now.Taken in the context of the time, The McNamara report by Rand Corporation was an almost unbelievable bombshell of government lying and corruption never meant for anyone outside a select few to lay eyes on. The Washington Post (always a left/liberal paper) struggles just as they are going public as their rival, The New York Times, breaks the story of the decade while The Post leads with Trisha Nixon's wedding. The Post has to get in the game of serious investigative reporting or be marginalized...especially since The Post is the leading Washington DC paper. The Post gets the entire volumes of the so-called Pentagon Papers from Rand Corporation whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg and goes The New York Times one huge one better (this as the gov't puts a lid on The Times further publishing of the papers). The magnitude of this might not be understood today, but at the time it was the most aggressive move by any newspaper to defend the freedom of the press in U.S. history. Destruction of The Washington Post loomed as well as multiple prison sentences by the reporting staff and female Post owner Kay Graham. What happens next is up to The Supreme Court and it makes history.The Post tells the story outlined above quite well. It's straight and not even as it clumsily attempts to create the unbearable tension the principal owner and players of The Washington Post were under. It does get a small measure of the rampant chaos which is mostly what the viewer will rally around. A real power shift is beginning in the mire.While the performances of Streep, Hanks, Odenkirk, and Greenwood are solid it's hard to invest in these characters. Perhaps that is how it should be as even Mrs. Graham's heroine isn't exactly easy to relate to personally by females of the day. No, it's the idea of freedom itself as a government check and balance personified here by freedom of the press. In that all of the cast and Spielberg nailed it. The ending, with the hint of a big unrelated breaking story just breaking, is a great twist. At times The Post moved slow, even boring, but in the end it delivered just like we still want the free press to return to today. We need a non-partisan free press to show us what is truly happening behind all the deception, smoke, and mirrors. Let freedom ring and see this film because even as late as this re-telling of a pivotal event is it is now more important than ever."

THE POST,22 January 2018,,"Steven Spielberg is one of the most commercially and critically successful directors in the history of Hollywood. Meryle Streep and Tom Hamks are among the very finest actors of their generation but, until now, have never appeared in the same movie. So a work which brings together these three titans of the screen has to be cinematic gold and so it proves to be.The year is 1971, the Vietnam War continues to devour lives, and someone has leaked the Pentagon Papers, a 7,000-page study of American policy on the conflict commissioned by then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. The renowned ""New York Times"" accesses the Papers first but is blocked from further publication by the US Government headed by Richard Nixon. When a much smaller, more local newspaper, the ""Washington Post"", gets its hands on the review, its owner Katherine 'Kay' Graham (Streep) has to decide whether to follow the urging of editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks) and risk the very existence of the paper by publication of the Pentagon's secrets.Every viewer will know what happened but Spielberg makes the story genuinely gripping, aided by superb performances by Streep and Hanks and a fine script by newcomer Liz Hannah and Josh Singer (who wrote ""Spotlight""). The period is wonderfully created with all the smoking, drinking and misogyny and all the visions of old technology (dial phones, pay phones, typewriters, vacuum tubes, and hot metal type). But the film - which was produced quickly without special effects - is so topical for our times, in showing both the need for women to be recognised and respected and the requirement for the American media to stand up to a bullying president.""The Post"" is a companion piece to ""All The President's Men"" (1976) since both films deal with the same newspaper and the same president. Indeed the final scene of the former is the first scene of the latter: the burglary at the Watergate offices. However, in 1976 nobody would have imagined that another American president would be so embroiled in nefarious activities and so hostile to the media.

THE POST,17 January 2018,7/10,"GRADE: B- THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well made but far too manipulative film about journalism and governmental corruption.SYNOPSIS: The story of the Pentagon Papers and the power of the press.JIM'S REVIEW: History seems doomed to repeat itself. Steven Spielberg political drama, The Post, becomes a cautionary tale about the value of the freedom of the press and its battle against an unhinged president, a polarizing scandal, deceptive governmental policies and cover-ups. The story may have taken place back in the 1970's but its 20th century subject matter is Textbook 2017. With cries of ""fake news"" and ""leftist media"" heard today, one forgets the power of the fifth estate and its fight against governmental conspiracies and corruption. A lesson to be learned and, in Mr. Spielberg's skilled hands, one expects a film of great importance. The Post isn't. It pales in comparison with other newspaper-based tales like the far superior Tom McCarthy's Spotlight, Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole, or Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Granted, that is some tough competition, but expectations run high with this film and its accomplished director. While there are some strong moments, The Post never quite achieves its lofty goal. It is an earnest but standard political gab-fest.The film has a ""ripped from today's headlines"" vibe, even though our story takes place in 1971. Classified document have been stolen by journalist Daniel Ellsberg and about to be made public that the U.S. government systemically lied about the Vietnam War. The stage is set and after a rather slow beginning and too much exposition, the film finally gets to its main plot: the possible publishing of the confidential Pentagon Papers and the issue of revealing their contents to a deceived American public. (For roughly 20 years and under the reign of six presidents, from Harry Truman to Gerald Ford, the war will rage on, amid violent protests and the forced resignation of Richard M. Nixon.)Per normal, Mr. Spielberg's direction is solid, although he continually overstates his liberally-gauged message of equal rights for women and the costly struggle over the freedom of the press vs. governmental cover-ups. The film tells its significant story and builds to its ultimate conclusion, one that may not have been the same results if addressed in today's political environs with 2017's divisive Congress and its conservative-leaning Supreme Court. And it's that particular theme that is the real reason for the film: to relate our past with our present and hope for a better future. The Post is an admirable attempt, a crucial history lesson that could have had more impact if the screenplay by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer took more risks and layered its story with more convincing characters and tension. Instead, it settles for conventional storytelling and endless political debates that become monotonous and predictable, especially if one is aware of the outcome.But Mr. Spielberg supplies the necessary craftsmanship to create enough interest in his politically tinged story. He casts his film very well and crafts his narrative with enough visual images that keep his action moving. (A wonderfully edited sequence shows the actual printing of the newspaper article with its old-fashioned typesetting machines, passionate editing staff, and the manual labor needed to start the presses rolling.) The production design by Rick Carter is exceptional in its period flavor. Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is quite memorable, and the film's strong costumes by the reliable Ann Roth add to the authenticity of the movie. But reality-wise, the film is let down with its heavy-handed message, granted one that I personally endorse, as it repeatedly preaches to the choir. Subtlety is not this film's forte, as in a scene where Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep), owner of the Washington Post newspaper, leaves the courthouse as the multitude of women outside stand in awe as the crowd parts like the Red Sea. So manipulative and contrived.The two leads are fine. Ms. Streep plays Ms. Graham as a cautious and savvy lady. The actress looks the part and brings to her role interesting mannerisms, nervous tics and calculated stares, to show this woman to be more intelligent and courageous than expected. (In case one doesn't notice her bravery, it is expressed in stirring speeches by other minor characters. Again, subtle...not.) Tom Hanks plays his role effectively, but his screen persona as the All-American hero seems mismatched with the actual gruff and harsh-spoken editor, Ben Brantley. This character, as written, has been so homogenized and sanitized that it becomes a grave injustice to this great crusader of the First Amendment. Other actors lend their talents in supporting roles that spout the political views of their characters which come off as more grandstanding than believable dialog. Still, the fine ensemble includes Bob Odenkirk, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Matthew Rhys, Sarah Paulson, and Bradley Whitford. A talented A-cast, no doubt, but they are given B material.Still, The Post is a timely achievement, worth seeing as an historical testament to our much aligned press. The film has much to say, and much to be heard. But, for me, it remains too much talk and not enough genuine action."

--The Pace
--The ClimaxSummary: The Post is a movie that flows with the political warfare of today's modern Hollywood themes. It's a movie that has powerful representation of defending the freedoms many take for granted, and the deception big companies can hold within their secretive walls. Legendary director Steven Spielberg, proves he can make a strong, symbolic movie, working with talented writers to craft a script that is realistic and natural to sell the story. Those not looking for the magical finesse of Hollywood, will be pleased at the representation this story provides, entranced by the heat of this moment. And the award worthy performances of Streep and Hanks are certainly the strongest element that brings the movie to life, both having solid solo performances, but really shining in the end. 
 For me though, the movie suffers from pacing issues, with a few tangential elements getting more detail that didn't add much given the central topic of the movie. While important to character development, these divergent paths add more run time without more suspense, leading to boring marshes one has to tread through to get back on the central plot. Unfortunately, the climax does not reward the waiting, but is instead reduced to a montage of small testimonies and phrases that aren't up to Spielberg's usual standards. The ending was actually the one place a little magic could have been used, but at least it's got the history feel to it. 
 Overall, the movie felt overhyped to me given all the publicity it has been given. Certainly the performances are worthy of praise and the writing/realism gets props as well. However, these components need to a little more entertaining, at least in terms of pace, to warrant getting the best movie of the year award for me. This documentary would have found a great place on streaming originals, but in regards to theater visit, do it only for support of the actors and save this for a rent.

THE POST,16 January 2018,5/10,"In 2017's The Post (my latest review), Steven Spielberg opens the film with a combat sequence that is brief and all too pedestrian. It's patchwork stuff at best. That's surprising seeing that this is the same guy who shot the savage, beaches of Normandy battle in Saving Private Ryan. Anyway, cut to 1971 where the publisher and executive editor of The Washington Post risk their livelihood to put out the Pentagon Papers. These Pentagon Papers are classified documents chronicling America's involvement in the Vietnam War. In a hurried and glossed over two hours, I give you the true account of Steven Spielberg's underwhelming and underdeveloped ""Post"".So OK, wanna see Steve's most self-serious and most pretentious flick to date? Just pony up six to ten dollars at any local theater (or don't after you read ""Post's"" short rounded assessment).The Post, which has a sort of held back film score by legend John Williams, is clearly Steven Spielberg rushing to put out any type of material he can for the veritable Academy Awards season. He's clamoring and he knows that Oscar voters always surrender to his holier-than-thou groove.With his ""Post"", I was obviously reminded of 1976's All the President's Men (just look at Ben Bradlee's desk setting which appears to be identical). Here's the thing though: Spielberg fails to generate the type of numbing atmosphere and/or paranoid tension that Alan J. Pakula did back in '76.""Post"", despite failing to garner my utmost recommendation, still has one of the best casts of any movie this year. I'm talking leads played by Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, co-stars in the form Bradley Whitford and Bruce Greenwood, and side characters portrayed by Bob Odenkirk and Sarah Paulson. These are all decent troupers yet Spielberg doesn't handle them well. He lets everyone wink into the camera while they give off the sense of being increasingly irksome. There are too many unworkable, Spielbergian moments here and not enough workable, Hanksian moments. The whole experience of the candidly talky scenes is just plain awkward.In conclusion, Spielberg as always tries his darnedest to recreate a period of long days past. This is evident in The Post. ""Post"" has a sheeny look, an accurate attention to detail, and a 70's time setting that's just palatable enough. If the Academy does honor Steven next Tuesday, it will be because The Post is well, historically significant. For me, it doesn't matter either way. ""Post"" might be Stevie boy's weakest effort since 1991's Hook. That's not good. Rating: 2 stars."
THE POST,14 January 2018,7/10,"The Post is a film that gradually builds up momentum until it delivers its final punch. It also looked at significant period in American history and was an interesting look at the constitution and the freedoms it affords the press. Funny enough it marks a time when the press also stood for something and there was still some integrity in journalism unlike today. The film had certain feminist undertones that tried to reinforce which should have probably been left out. Some great performances from Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, especially Tom Hanks whose portrayal is effortless. 7.8-8/10"
THE POST,30 June 2018,7/10,"Back when newspapers were at their peak in terms of journalism and readership, an old woman by the name of Katherine Graham helped The Washington Post to become a household name in news media by uncovering the Pentagon Papers, a series of documents written by the government during the Vietnam war that Ben Bradlee discovers. It's a little slow moving but gets interesting as it gets better and better. At the end of the movie, we see the start of the Watergate break-in which precedes the events of All The President's Men, another good movie worth watching after you're done enjoying The Post."
THE POST,19 January 2018,7/10,"I have said in the past that 2017 wasn't exactly a stellar year for movies. I still stand by that, though I acknowledge that perhaps events outside of the movie theater have colored my perspective in the negative. 2017 was the year of the women's march and the travel ban, the year of Black Lives Matter and #metoo, the year of Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, of the anthem protests, of Russian election tampering, of DACA and of Charlottesville. So much has happened over the course of one year, I'm surprised more people haven't built bomb shelters in their backyards.So much has happened over the course of one year yet Hollywood is as slow as always to react. It's not their fault; it's the nature of filmmaking - years of pre-production, finding the funds, scheduling shoots etc. all but guarantees that once that first film that's purposely chasing the zeitgeist, actually appears at a cinema near you, the moment has already passed. And if you need evidence of this: watch/re-watch War Machine (2017) on Netflix.So it is with The Post, a movie that was rushed through production for the sole purpose of chasing a contemporarily vital spirit. The film stars Meryl Streep as Kay Graham the proprietor of the privately owned Washington Post newspaper circa 1971. She along with her hard-nosed Editor in Chief Ben Bradlee (Hanks) are taken for a ride when the infamous Pentagon Papers are published by the New York Times and The Post is given an opportunity to follow suit.Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, John Williams, Janusz Kaminski, Michael Kahn - if these names don't immediately pop out the page for you then you have no business watching this movie, let alone reading this review. On paper, this movie has enough talent in the margins to easily surpass Spotlight (2015) as the prestige newspaper film of a generation. Given the talent, The Post should be an over-the-moon achievement loudly knocking on the doors of Xanadu!Alas much like the Washington Post being billed as second banana to the New York Time's Supreme Court battle, The Post often feels like a missed opportunity. Not a missed opportunity to convey an overt political message mind you, the meta-text speaks so loudly it might as well be shouting ""Love Trumps Hate"" from the rooftops. I'm speaking of a missed opportunity to tell a human story that sticks.Much of the events in the film, as recorded by history are retold with a measured, inelegant dryness. Not much outside of the Editor's office hints that there's anything all that tangible at stake and any restatement of said stakes is undermined by (among other things) Bob Odenkirk sharing the frame with Mr. Show (1995-98) counterpart David Cross.
Meanwhile moments of character are handled almost entirely by Meryl Streep who somehow takes a bland ""greatness-thrust-upon"" character arc and turns it into yet another Oscar worthy performance. Literally in anyone else's hands, Kay would have felt bland; who she was and what she's going through episodic - but with Streep it's gold. Sadly the equally versatile Hanks is left in the stables, ambling around offices and home parlors, exuding prestige and little else. I don't get it, he's uniquely capable of taking the film's blunted messaging and turning it into something sharper but instead he's relegated to doing his best Jason Robards impression.This is turning into a much more negative review than it needed to be. Know that despite everyone in the film, both in front of and behind the camera are working at 75%, it's still a very good movie. One whose message, best summed up by Kay who says, ""News is the first draft of history,"" needs repeating. Yet I can't help but compare The Post unfavorably to something like Get Out (2017) or Wonder Woman (2017). While the later films latched onto a zeitgeist of the time without even trying, The Post is straight up tries too hard. If this were a freshman feature, I'd say ""good job"" and move on, but this is the Hollywood A-Team who by all accounts should have turned this concept into gold. Come Oscar night, they'll be lucky to win silver."
THE POST,24 February 2018,10/10,"Steven Spielberg has once proved how great and how decent he is as a filmmaker. In this very difficult and very compelling drama he managed to depict seemingly mundane and boring events and turn them inti solid gold. Of course, a marvelous actors' cast, with Streep, Hanks, Palson and Greenwood just to name the few, shines brightly and shows how excellently they can dliver very difficult topic and make it an exciting piece of thriller plus draa plus very precise and accurate depiction of tough political times of 1971.
I will not retell any of the events, as you have to see it yourself, I only say this is an incredible piece of serious movie, deep and smart work, very sensible creation, which entertains and delivers much food for thought.

THE POST,6 February 2018,,"The Post is Political Hollywood at its propaganda best. They're all there, the Press, Streep, Spielberg, the Academy, all shouting about the good deeds done by the press in the past (they virtually had to go back decades to Watergate and rehash a new take on 'All the Presidents Men'!) In the present climate, it could hardly be a more obvious attempt to squash the fact that the modern press has become a 'Fake' sham (and that President Trump remains fair game). Time to get over it - stop attempting to convince the voters that a possible corrupt system should be back in power - simply because it serves others selfish purposes. It's also a big push for the Washington Post, who only picked up on the groundbreaking hard work (already done ahead of them) by the New York Times. With the Post even using the same N.Y.T. informants leaked files.The Awards given for this rather ordinary movie need explaining - Streep was simply Streep, Hanks has done far better work (without honours) beforehand. Spielberg was in his usual by-the-numbers mode and turned in an overlong (often boring movie) consisting of a string of round table talkfests (ie; sometimes small table, other times a larger table or a typical party scene) nothing special here. In fact, it all looks too obviously like an attempt to fool some of the people all of the time. Maybe it's time to move on and consider working together for the betterment of all.....As James Goodale said on PBS News Hour during a summary of the movie:- with words along the lines of; ""If doing a movie now (about newspapers) you want to be sure you're being authentic"". Very good advice! 
Another insightful comment came from; Matt Bobkin, writing for Exclaim!, he gave the film a 6 out of 10 score, and went on to say; the film ""has all the makings of an awards season hit, but is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous socio-political climate.""

This was done before by All the Presidents Men and masterly realised here. Everything was presented so well with the multi layering of the role of newspapers in the state, the nature of truth, the family newspaper and the socialite become heroine. The directing acting and chemistry between the leads was fabulous. I didn't sense an Oscar performance due to the limited emotional palette but who am I. I loved it"
THE POST,19 January 2018,7/10,"Spielberg. Streep. Hanks. As far as cinematic team-ups go, this is the cream of the crop, the crème de la crème, the Dream Team. So it's surprising to exactly nobody that they've delivered a worthy, timely and weighty admission into the journalistic drama subgenre. Set in the 1970s, this film retells the story of how the Washington Post went head-to-head with the Nixon administration over the release of the Pentagon Papers - a Department of Defense study that proved the U.S. Government lied to both the public and Congress about the Vietnam War. Never mind the period setting, this politically charged tale is more about the present than the past. The media-vs-government theme has direct parallels to the first-amendment tussle occurring in the U.S. right now, whilst the story of Streep's Kay Graham, the first female owner of a major newspaper, puts female equality deservedly high on the agenda. Its incisive commentary on the current social and political climate is poignant to be sure, but there's also a sense it leans into it a little too much, mostly at the expense of fleshing out the backstories and motivations of Kay, her editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), and his team of crack journos. Although his bag of tricks are bigger than most, Spielberg instead employs an understated shooting style that foregoes flashy camera movements in favour of finding a smart angle and letting his cast-also including Bob Odenkirk, Carrie Coon, Bradley Whitford and Sarah Paulson-get to work. At this point in their careers Streep and Hanks are completely incapable of delivering a bad performance hence are eminently watchable here, yet they fall just shy of sharing the sort of electric chemistry you might expect from two juggernauts pushing each other to their limits. A topical, highbrow motion picture with talent to spare, The Post proves the old-school journalistic genre still has legs."
THE POST,20 February 2018,6/10,"It was pretty obvious what we were going to get with 'The Post', a conveniently timed look at the role of the press within American democracy. Based on the true story of the publishing of sensitive papers by the press, against the wishes of the US government, it hammers home the message of the importance of a free press in a democracy, complete with some not so subtle jabs at the current US administration.As you would expect for a film that boasts Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks as stars and Steven Spielberg as director, 'The Post' is a very well made and brilliantly acted film, difficult to fault in a technical sense. The problem is that it's obsessed with making a statement and pushing its blatant political agenda, glorifying the press and ensuring that its feminist message is heard loud and clear. 'The Post' is just another politically charged, self-admiring Hollywood production."

THE POST,19 February 2018,7/10,"Washington, DC, 1971: The Pentagon Papers are classified documents that reveal how successive US governments lied to their citizens about the Vietnam war. They are released to the New York Times and later to the Washington Post. It is a great risk for the Post to publish such papers as it is facing financial troubles. Dilemmas at the paper are faced by its owner Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep) and its editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks),While director Steven Spielberg is more renowned for his adventure-thrillers, his adept skills are clearly on display in this rather different project for him: a political film. The story not only reveals events already known but also shows Graham's personal story - wonderfully played by Streep (no surprise there). After learning more of Graham's life, her own story would make an equally good film: her occasional lack of confidence was the result of being catapulted into a major position - one for which she had not planned nor had any ambition to create.The screenplay by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer also delves into moral dilemmas of the ""friendliness"" between high-ranking politicians and equally high-ranking journalists. This results in two of the movie's best scenes of conflict: one between Graham and Bradlee; the other between Graham and her long-time friend Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood), a former Secretary of Defense.""The Post"" is wonderful nostalgia for those of us fascinated by that very volatile time in the US in the 1960s and the 1970s. And its conclusion is a superb nudge and wink to anyone familiar with the history of that time."
THE POST,20 January 2018,8/10,"Spielberg opens with a Vietnam war scene, automatic rifles blazing to a CCR soundtrack. That not only sets the period but reminds us this is a war film. Publishing the Pentagon Papers was a wartime act - to stop America's unnecessary wasting of lives in Vietnam. 
 More to the point, we are still in that war - resisting a Republican president bent upon suppressing the free press and stifling his critics, especially those who expose his lies. Of course the Nam lies told by the governments of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon pale beside Trump's 2,000 lies exposed in just his first year in office. The beat goes on.
 Like the best history, this addresses the time the film is made as much as the time in which it is set. That is, its truth extends beyond its period and catches a continuing verity: US governments - and they are not alone -lie to advance their cause, to protect themselves, regardless of the cost in civilian lives and the violation of America's famed democratic principles. In this respect the film is about 2018 as much as 1971. It makes Kay Graham and Ben Bradlee models for our time.
 The film seems accurate in its general plot lines. Nixon tried to prosecute the NY Times for publishing the secret papers smuggled out by the idealist Daniel Ellsberg. The Times thus silenced, the Washington Post stepped into the breach to publish more stories themselves. The Supreme Court supported the press 6-3, a split we can't reasonably expect of today's Right-biased Supremes. 
 The major characters - Graham, Bradlee, Robert McNamara, Ellsberg - also ring true. Whether or not they made the speeches given them here, their deeds and their significance are consistent. 
 Graham's isolation - a widow standing against a Board of smug white men, indeed a government of white men - may be emphasized to advance the current assertion of women's rights. That's fair. So too the little girl's initiative selling lemonade, the abused and admiring Latina intern, Bradlee's wife's separate life as an artist, and especially Kay's triumphant stride away from the Supreme Court through a mob of reverent women, tacitly thankful for her liberating example. Graham's valour justifies that elaboration. 
 The film draws on two other popular genres, as well as the war film. Graham's and Bradlee's stubborn idealism harkens back to the James Stewart standards, Mr Smith, Mr Deeds, and all the other earnest heroes struggling through a morass of self-service and corruption to reaffirm America's defining principles of freedom and equality. That's the America that has to be recovered to make her ""great again."" 
 Spielberg also revives the great tradition of the newspaper film. The montage of newspaper front pages, the mechanics of the lino-typesetter, the literal lines of lead prose, the whirring monster presses and the trucks lighting up the dawn streets with bundles of the latest word - all that warms the cockles of any newsman's heart. Papers may be dying, but their mythic heroism survives. Much like the theory of American democracy.
 Spielberg is a master director and here he's working with a first-rate cast and story. Sure, it preaches to the converted. It won't reform Trump or shoot a spine into any of his GOP enablers. But if it's screened widely enough perhaps it will enlighten and embolden enough of the Republicans' constituents to have some effect."
THE POST,10 February 2018,7/10,"What makes this movie work is not the Director, stars or supporting actors but instead the actual story of what took place way back when. That little piece of history is relevant today as it was back then and one can easily see the uproar by the people over being drafted and then sent overseas to fight for something that is not winnable (Viet Nam). That means lives were lost without giving it a second thought. The point then is as potent for the point to be made now. People don't mind dying for what is right, good and specifically for the American way but this episode had some holes in it. The fact that it was covered up is most disturbing. Along those lines that the fact that someone who had high clearance and access to top secret info could take it and do what they want is also very disturbing. Lots to digest here. Definitely worth a watch for the subjects matters sake..."
THE POST,24 February 2018,10/10,"Eisenhower, J. Kennedy, and L. Johnson all had positive contributions to the well-being of the United States. Eisenhower upheld the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate public schools in the South, Kennedy navigated the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Johnson signed into law Civil Rights Legislation. However, they all had one huge stain on their proverbial presidential suits: Vietnam. The United States' involvement in Vietnam was both a gross failure of foreign policy and a tragic military miscalculation with 10,000's of US soldier deaths and many more casualties from circa 1960 to 1975. Countless more Vietnamese, many of them unarmed civilians, were also casualties of the war. The story is rather timely because, at this writing, the current occupant of the White House disdains journalism and admonishes anyone in the Press who reports stories which are anything less than completely flattering of him and his administration. The main thrust of ""The Post"" is how the Washington Post obtains the Pentagon Papers, the secret classified report on the failure of Vietnam, and the decision-making process about publishing the story. A riveting story from beginning to end, and a wonderful send-up of the story which would follow shortly thereafter: the break-in of Democratic National Committee Headquarters at the Watergate Apartment Plaza in Washington D.C. Meryl Streep, in one of her most compelling performances, plays Graham as the house-wife turned executive owner who has to make some of the most crucial decisions about her company. Tom Hanks makes the best Ben Bradlee since Jason Robards played the role and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.US Presidents, particularly L. Johnson and R. Nixon, felt the public couldn't handle the truth about the war, or, far worse, would view the war as failures and, God forbid, may hold their politicians accountable. The administrations did all they could to keep the public from knowing first-hand the details of the US' grand mess-up in Vietnam. Interestingly, the administration under Johnson commissioned a detailed report of Vietnam, which came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. The report was not to be made public but was intended for scholarly research long after the fact. It was produced when troops were still in Vietnam. ""The Post"" is about how the New York Times and eventually the Washington Post were leaked the Pentagon Papers and their decision to publish excerpts, inciting the fury of President Nixon and his Administration. The film begins with Dan Ellsberg making copies of the Pentagon Papers in the mid-1960's, and then the film fast-forwards to 1971.The Washington Post operating in DC was a relatively small local newspaper which inadvertently fell into the hands of Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) after her husband (and Post owner) Philip Graham committed suicide in 1963. The Post is now poised to become publically traded on the stock market and evolve into a national and even international source of news reporting and journalism. While Graham is dealing with New York investor types, the New York Times had gotten hold of parts of the Pentagon Papers and were publishing them. Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) had smelled that their rival in New York was brewing some volatile story but failed to gather appropriate intelligence. Then the Justice Department issues an injunction against the Times prohibiting them from further publishing which is upheld by a New York judge. The ruling offers a window of opportunity for the Post."

THE POST,3 January 2018,7/10,"Steven Speilberg hasn't wowed me in quite some time so I was hoping for something more from this effort. His latter films have produced great performances but not really the wholly engaging films that I seek. I also think Ready Player One looks fairly atrocious, so I was hoping The Post would at least be good. After viewing the film, I will say that I enjoyed this quite a bit. In a similar vein to Zodiac and Spotlight the film is areally smart craft (although not as thrilling).The film is about the real life leaking of the Pentagon Papers, which detail the United States' involvement in Vietnam even prior to the Vietnam War. At the time the Washington Post is a small scale paper that gets a hold of the story and decides whether to leak the involvement or suffer the same fate of the New York Times who had their freedom of press threatened by then president Richard Nixon. Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and Steven Speilberg surprisingly all work together for the very first time.The film is detailed and there are little intricacies within the plot that you can miss if your attention wanders. The film actually has many talented performers which is nice to see. Everyone here is good. Tom Hanks (the nice cool uncle you always wish you had) is typically good, same with Streep. I'm quite a fan of politically based drama's if they are done with attention, style, and substance. I feel like The Post brings that after a lukewarm start.The film doesn't have the same knife edge tension like Zodiac, however there is strength in the script and delivery. Its intentional that this film is easily comparable to what is going on today and Trump's war on ""fake news"". I'm happy to say this is Speilberg's best film in a long time. Stay tuned at the end for a chilling reference to the Watergate scandal. And with that my pre-Oscar viewing extravaganza comes to a close. Good year in film.7.5/10"
THE POST,16 January 2018,10/10,"Meryl Streep is so very powerful in her quiet and repose in ""The Post"". Two moments distinguished the movie for me. Streep plays widow Kay Graham, publisher and owner of the Washington Post in 1971. Her family owned the newspaper for generations. Being a woman, indicative of that time, her husband became publisher of The Post. Tragically, he died in suicide. Then Kay took over as Publisher. At night before tucking her granddaughter to bed, Kay has her daughter Lally, played by bright gentle Allison Brie, read the notes she wrote for her Mom's speech about her Dad. Kay silently listens as she reads her written notes. Kay gets from Lally that she is stronger than she knows. After obtaining the ""Pentagon Papers"", the top secret study of the Vietnam War that Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, played by brilliant Bruce Greenwood, commissioned, managing editor Ben Bradlee, played by authentic idealist Tom Hanks, is adamant that Kay 'must publish this'. The ""Pentagon Papers"" detailed how the US had been losing the Vietnam War over several Administrations. In Ben's ""come to Jesus"" moment his wife Tony, wonderfully compassionate Sarah Paulson, reminds him what's so. As consequence of publishing, Ben could lose his job, and perhaps find another job even gaining in reputation. On the other hand, Kay could lose the Post, lose everything in the aftermath. She says that when Kay stands in a room of men, they look passed her just because she's a woman. In acknowledgement of Kay, Tony says, ""I think that's brave.""Director Steven Spielberg's ""The Post"" authentically captures a time when freedom of speech, of the press was so vital to who we are. That also resonates perhaps more so today. I believe Liz Hannah and Josh Singer's story echoes and exposes the culture where women were looked passed, as even less than. This is the #Metoo as well. Meryl gives her best performance in years as Kay, who never raises her voice, yet defines herself in courage and purpose. Her Kay embodies what is noble in humanity. Washington Post Board Member Arthur, played by righteous Bradley Whitford, lectures Kay of what past Publishers might have done in her position. Kay looks him in the eyes, ""I am the owner."" The hero, the leader arises with Streep as Kay. She discovers her calling. Tom Hanks is eloquent partnership with Streep on screen. His mastery is sublime understatement. His Ben is the ordinary man, who becomes extraordinary in defense of our very freedom of expression. He tells Kay, ""The way they lied. Those days need to end."" He challenges Mrs. Graham, ""What are you going to do?"" Tom's authenticity is to behold.In history the case of The Washington Post and freedom of the Press goes before the US Supreme Court. In the ruling: ""The Press was to serve the governed, not the governors."" Those words live. In these days of multi-platform media coverage and so-called ""fake news"", Spielberg's ""The Post"" powerful reminds that speaking and hearing truth resides with us. There is great power and responsibility in protecting the freedom of speech, of the press, of what is said. Power too, resides in how we listen to all that is said. That is eloquently ""The Post""."
THE POST,8 March 2019,8/10,"At this point, I just wonder if every movie Steven Spielberg makes that has anything to do with war (Schindler's List (1994), Saving Private Ryan (1999), War Horse (2012), Lincoln (2013), Bridge of Spies (2015)) is just automatically given a Best Picture nomination. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has made a lot of quality movies that should be recognized and awarded. The question is more about the state of Hollywood films. Is there nothing else out there by up-and-coming filmmakers that would supplant a Spielberg film in the nominee list? Don't even get me started on Meryl Streep's nominations, either.Of course, in part due to the all-star power of Spielberg, and the leading roles filled by Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, The Post (2017) is a movie that builds its tension right until the very end. Despite a somewhat slow start, the stakes are never higher when the ambiguity of publishing classified documents is taken all the way to its logical conclusion. The fact that the outcome isn't a foregone one (even with the knowledge that these events happened in the past), is merely proof of Spielberg's skill in connecting information to create a thrilling conclusion.It can be difficult to separate the events in this film from the obvious political parallels to today's society. From breaking through the patriarchy of business to holding the government accountable, much hasn't changed in over 40 years. That being said, the journalistic integrity to bring the truth to the surface seems to be different now than when Nixon was in office, being used as a tool to bash an opposing viewpoint without necessarily having all the facts to back it up. At the very least, using the actual audio from the White House in the lead-up to the Watergate scandal was a nice touch.A thrilling film with overtly political messages and themes, I give The Post 4.0 stars out of 5."
THE POST,10 January 2018,,"The Post is a newspaper and this move seems more like a play then a movie. It is extremely dialogue based. There are stand around talk scenes, sit and talk scenes and of course walk and talk scenes.Meryl Sreep gives an understated, subtle performance in the lead. It is so understated that she appears bored most of the time. Tom Hanks doesn' break a sweat. There's an ok nothing memorable John Williams score.The high highlight of the movie and the only action is the printing process. The type setting and papers rolling off the presses is about the only action.It may have a still timely message but it doesn't entertain. No need to see it on the big screen as it will play equally dull on all platforms."
THE POST,15 January 2018,8/10,"The Post tells the story of the emerging of a highly classified secret of the American government. Now, it is up to the country's first female newspaper publisher, Kay Graham(Meryl Streep) & her encouraging editor, Ben Bradlee(Tom Hanks), to publish this information in their newspaper. The Post is a brilliant film. Director Steven Spielberg has given us another engaging drama, after Bridge of Spies(2015). The first half, is a bit slow. However, the second half makes up for it. The performances are the highlight of the film. Meryl Streep is spectacular as Kay Graham. Tom Hanks is outstanding as Ben Bradlee. It is an absolute delight to watch legendary thespians Streep & Hanks, come together on the big screen for the very first time. Sarah Paulson is superb as Tony Bradlee. Bob Odenkirk is fantastic as Ben Bagdikian. Tracy Letts is great as Fritz Beebe. Bradley Whitford is excellent as Arthur Parsons. Bruce Greenwood is impressive as Robert McNamara. Matthew Rhys is good as Daniel Ellsberg. Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, Jesse Plemons, David Cross & Zach Woods are effective as Lally Graham, Meg Greenfield, Roger Clark, Howard Simons & Anthony Essaye, respectively. The Post is a must watch for fans of Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep & Tom Hanks. A wonderful start to the awards season."
THE POST,14 January 2018,8/10,"The new Stephen Spielberg film, THE POST, is a very good film telling the tale of the power of journalism to bring the truth to the American people despite long odds and a White House bent on silencing this voice. This movie has it all, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Spielberg's direction, but it has one major thing going against it...It's not ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.This is an unfair thing to do to a movie, not watching a film for it's own merits but constantly comparing it to another, beloved (at least to me) film. But, I couldn't separate the two films in my mind. Both films show the true story of the behind the scenes efforts of the staff of the Washington Post to bring some damaging information to light whilst fighting the efforts of the Nixon White House to silence them.So..what works in THE POST? Nearly everything. Let's start with the story itself. It tells the tale of the Post's efforts to publish a document known as THE PENTAGON PAPERS that showed that the Government, for years, did not believe the US could win the war in Vietnam, but kept sending troops to die in the region to ""save face"". This is a ""I can't believe this is true"" true story and is a perfect story for a film.As put in the very competent hands of Steven Spielberg, THE POST is a taught thriller, that unspools the action in a very professional way, spoon feeding the audience the information they need when they need it. He shows the hustle and bustle of a 1970's newspaper newsroom - something that (probably) belongs in a museum nowadays. It is a fascinating look at a bygone era. The power of the press (especially newspapers) were at the fore, with men leading the way. And...that's another point that Spielberg drives home - the growing importance of women in the mostly male world of the time.No character shows this growth of women more than Meryl Streep's character, Kay Graham, the publisher of THE POST. In the early stages of the film, she is treated with condescending acceptance by the male power brokers around her, it is her ability to grow and break through this glass ceiling that is at the core of this film. In lesser hands, this character could easily have devolved into melodramatic soap oper-y. But in the capable, professional hands of the great Meryl Streep, this is a real human being showing strength and uncertainty, the will to lead and the desire to sit in the background. It's good to see that Streep still has her fastball - she is fantastic in this role - and I wouldn't be surprised to see her name called when the Oscar nominations are announced in a few weeks.THE POST is filled with strong supporting players - Bradley Whitford, Tracy Letts, Sarah Paulson, Bruce Greenwood, Carrie Coon and Bob Odenkirk all fair well, it is a strongly populated world. Special notice should be made to Michael Stuhlbarg in another tremendous performance - this time as N.Y. Times publisher Abe Rosenthal, who's paper was brought before the Supreme Court with THE POST.And then there's Tom Hanks performance of Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. Bradlee is really the central character in this film and this is where I couldn't shake the ghosts of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. In that film, Jason Robards won an Oscar for his unforgettable portrait of Bradlee - and when I saw Bradlee in real life, I thought he was doing a Robards impression - that's how good the portrayal of Bradlee that Robards portrayal was. So...when Hanks came on the scene, I couldn't shake the thought that Hanks was doing his impression of Robards doing Bradlee. I know that is not fair to Hanks, but...So...THE POST is a very good film. The acting is top notch, the direction is sure handed and the plot is important (especially when laid upon today's political climate of ""fake news""), just try to keep ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN out of your mind.Letter Grade: A-8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
THE POST,1 March 2018,6/10,"This is one of those movies that more or less sells itself. When you have the names of Spielberg, Hanks and Streep on the poster you don't really bother checking the reviews. Whilst the post is a good movie, it isn't a great movie.Being from the UK I wasn't really aware of the main storyline. Anyway it tells the story of the attempts by the press to release classified information about the Vietnam war. The post that is referred to in the title is the Washington Post which seems to have been a much less influential in the 60's. Hanks plays Ben Bradlee who is the editor of the post. Streep plays the owner Kay Graham who Ben needs the support of in his editorial decisions. The movie is pretty entertaining and well acted, but you can't help feeling that all the major players are on cruise control. It's a good movie rather than a great movie."
THE POST,14 January 2018,10/10,"""The Post"" is so darn good I cried tears of joy and applauded as the film ended. I didn't much want to go to ""The Post."" I knew how The Post's publishing of the Pentagon Papers played out and I assumed the film would create no suspense. Post editor Katherine Graham, played in the film by Meryl Streep, lived in a different world from my own. She was a wealthy heiress who, until her mentally ill and unfaithful husband committed suicide, had never had to work a day in her life. When I used to see Graham on TV, her silk-and-pearls, hoity toity airs and la-dee-da accent, along with her flat affect, repelled me. Post editor Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks, always struck me as an arrogant, swaggering newspaperman, and I didn't want to sit through a movie with him as the lead. Bradlee, like Graham, was also born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was a Boston Brahmin and descendent of royalty. Bradlee's middle name was ""Crowninshield."" I thought ""The Post"" would be one of those fluffy Hollywood exercises in self-congratulation. Aren't we so politically correct. But I loved this movie. My eyes were glued to the screen from the first second to the last. I came to care about and invest in each character. Testimony to the power of Steven Spielberg's filmmaking. ""The Post"" is a rich recreation of 1971 America - the cars, the clothes, the music, the speeches. Each character, no matter how minor, is created as three-dimensional. Each significant action, no matter how small, receives focus. One example: The Pentagon Papers were 7000 pages long. How did Daniel Ellsberg, in 1971, manage to smuggle 7000 pages to the press? The film shows the workings of a 1971-era photocopy machine. Copying all the pages took Ellsberg and two friends all night. Later, Post reporters must struggle to piece together these thousands of pages that are not numbered and are not in order. Personnel at the New York Times have criticized ""The Post"" as focusing too much on the role of the Washington Post in releasing the Pentagon Papers. The Times was the more important paper, they say. The criticism is unfounded. ""The Post"" acknowledges that the New York Times was the first to carry the story. It was only after the government stopped the Times' publication of the Papers that the Post picked up the baton. Rather, ""The Post"" is Katherine Graham's story. She was a shy and insecure woman who was faced with a decision that rocked her world. She was personal friends with Robert McNamara, mastermind of the Vietnam War. Similarly, Ben Bradlee was friendly with John F. Kennedy, a president who escalated the war. Katherine Graham's son Donald served in Vietnam. Streep's intimate and fully realized performance and Spielberg's virtuosic filmmaking made me feel Graham's turmoil as she contemplated whether or not to publish papers that would change her life in several ways. The Washington Post had just had an IPO. How would investors react? Given that the court had already shut down the NYT, would she be a felon, and would she be sent to prison? Would she lose the company she had inherited from her father and hoped to pass on to her children? How could she publish such damning material about her personal friend, Robert McNamara? How could her personal friend, McNamara, allow her son to risk his life serving in a war that McNamara knew was unwinnable? Streep's performance allowed me to feel as Graham probably felt, and to care about her. Every role is excellently cast. Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian, a Post editor and survivor of the Armenian Holocaust, is every bit as compelling as the major stars. Sarah Paulson is onscreen only briefly as Bradlee's wife Toni, but she is given a key speech where she articulates for Bradlee - and the viewer - exactly how heroic Graham is being. I love smart movies and ""The Post"" bristles with intelligence. I love movies that focus, not on fast cars, explosions, or superheroes, but on people, and ""The Post"" is one of the most human-centric movies I've seen in a while. ""The Post"" focuses on people, primarily Katherine Graham, but also Ellsberg, Bradlee, Bagdikian and others. It depicts those people not as plaster saints but warts-and-all. It allows the viewer to get close to those people and to see what they see and to care about what they care about. It goes without saying that a film that celebrates the search for truth and the freedom of the press, and the heroism of a woman who had been told that she wasn't as good as a man for the job she held, is very timely."
THE POST,15 February 2021,7/10,"I was hoping it would address the aftermath of the publication and Watergate, but it ended abruptly."
THE POST,20 January 2018,9/10,"What a combination: Streep, Hanks, Spielberg, Kaminski behind the camera, Williams behind the notes. What could possibly go wrong?Nothing as it turns out. After, for me, the disappointment of ""The BFG"" here is Spielberg on firm ground and at the height of his game. It's 1971 and the New York Times is in trouble for publishing what became known as ""The Pentagon Papers"": a damning account of multiple administration's dodgy dealings around the Vietnam War, put together by Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood, ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") and meant for ""posterity"" - not for publication! Watching from the sidelines with frustration at their competitor's scoop are the Washington Post's editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies"", ""Inferno"") and the new owner Kay Graham (Meryl Streep, ""Florence Foster Jenkins"", ""Suffragette""). With immaculate timing, Graham is taking the paper public, so needs the newspaper embroiled in any sort of scandal like a hole in the head. But with the US First Amendment under pressure, will Graham and Bradlee put their business and their freedom at risk by publishing and being damned?Both of the leads play characters that are quite strikingly out of character from their normal roles. In a seamingly endless run of 'kick-ass' women in the movie driving seat, here I expected Streep to be in full ""Iron Lady"" mode, but in fact she starts the film as quite the opposite: nervous, timid, vascillating. For although the story is about ""The Washington Post"" and ""The Pentagon Papers"", the real story is about Graham herself (Liz Hannah's script is actually based on Graham's autobiography). In many ways it's about a woman, in a male world, overcoming her fear and finding her own voice. As has been demonstrated in many recent films (""Hidden Figures"" for example) the working world for woman has changed so markedly since the 60's and 70's that it's almost impossible to relate to these chavenistic attitudes. Graham is repeatedly downtrodden as ""not good enough"" by her underlings within earshot, and then thanks them ""for their frankness"". When the women folk retire at dinner, to let the men-folk talk politics, Graham meekly goes with them. Even her father, for God's sake, left the newspaper not to her but to her (now late) husband! It's no surprise then that she is coming from a pretty low base of self-confidence, and her journey in the film - as expertly played by Streep - is an extraordinarily rousing one.Hanks, normally the guy you'd most like to invite round for dinner (@tomhanks if you happen to be reading this sir, that's a genuine invitation... we make a mean lasagne here!) also plays somewhat outside of his normal character here. As Bradlee, he is snappy, brusque and businesslike. Although I don't think he could ever quite match the irascibility of the character's portrayal by Jason Robards in the classic ""All the President's Men"" - who could? - its a character with real screen presence.The similarities with Alan J Pakula's 1976 classic Watergate movie - one of my personal favourites - don't stop there. The same sets that were once populated by Redford and Hoffman are gloriously reproduced with Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski delivering great tracking shots through the newsroom. (Watch out for Sacha Spielberg - daughter of Stephen and Kate Capshaw - who also turns up there delivering a package).The supporting cast includes Sarah Paulson (so memorable in ""The Trial of O.J. Simpson"") as Bradlee's wife Tony, Bradley Whitford (""The West Wing"", ""Get Out"") and Tracy Letts (""The Big Short"") as two of Graham's board advisors and Jesse Plemons (""The Program"", ""Bridge of Spies"") as the lead legal advisor. Particularly impressive though is Bob Odenkirk (""Breaking Bad"") as Ben Bagdikian, Bradlee's lead investigative reporter on the case: all stress, loose change and paranoia in his dealings with the leaky Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys).In a memorable piece of casting Richard Nixon is played by.... Richard Nixon. Although a silluohetted Curzon Dobell stalks the Oval office, the ex-president's original phone recordings are played on the soundtrack. (There, I knew those recordings would be useful for something... thank heavens he kept them all!) The film also demonstrates in fascinating style the newsprint business of yesteryear. When I click a button on my PC and a beautifully laser-printed page streams out of my Epson printer, it still seems like witchcraft to me! But it is extraordinary to think that newspapers in those days were put together by typesetters manually building up the pages from embossed metal letters laboriously slotted into a frame. Brilliantly evocative.If Spielberg has a fault, it is one of sentimentality - something that is pointed out in Susan Lacy's superb HBO documentary on Spielberg (something I have yet to write a review on, but if you like Spielberg you should definitely seek out). Here he falls into that trap again, with an unnecessary bedroom scene between Graham and her daughter tipping the screenplay into mawkishness. It's unnecessary since we don't need the points raised rammed down our throats again. It's something repeated in a rather bizarre final scene with Graham walking down the steps of the supreme court with admiring woman - only woman - watching her. These irritations tarnish for me what could have been a top-rated film.But the movie is an impressive watch and older viewers, and anyone interested in American political history will, I think, love it. The film, especially with its nice epilogue, did make me immediately want to come home and put ""All the President's Men"" on again... which is never a bad thing. Highly recommended."
THE POST,3 February 2018,4/10,"The Post is another Spielberg miss-step like AMISTAD several years ago. Good intentions but no much more.
There are two outstanding actors in it; but none of them really shine; there two different stories both over extended to provide enough screen time for Streep and Hanks. None of them really carries enough force or emotion. 
Streep as a neglected very rich women is able to act as a victim most of the time. but is unable to elevate the character beyond just pity.
Hanks in the is miscast as the newspaper director. He looks too forced and perhaps uncomfortable.Spielberg never decides if the movie is about freedom of speech or to elevate women; in any case the message is too soft to even pay attention. Besides while the movie spent a lot of time setting up the characters; it basically resolve the main conflict too easily. We know the events are real; but more about the fight for freedom would have give the movie a bigger weight.The only important thing is remembering that in the seventies press, media and people were more interested in real news not in stupid gossip and fight for something instead of being corrupted by money like is happening in the lasts years; and I am not referring as the FAKE NEWS Mr. Trump keeps mentioning but to the lack of real information in the news today that only seems to intend confuse and drive people out of the reality."
THE POST,1 August 2021,10/10,I loved this film as I have such an appreciation of Meryl Streep and Tom hanks. Another Spielberg masterpiece.
THE POST,30 April 2020,7/10,"The Post immediately evoked memories of the 1976 film All The President's Men starring Redford and Hoffman about a similar 1970s era of U.S. media history at The Washington Post and a larger than life President of the United States, Richard Nixon.The film focuses on the revelations by the New York Times and The Washington Post about the Pentagon Papers of the deeply damaging Vietnam War that the U.S. was struggling with in 1971.Indeed the film's primary focus seems to be about the freedom of the press and the danger of Government interference in it. The liberal views of the film makers and the stars Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep seem a perfect combination in putting this message across.However even my Conservative views were somewhat tempered by equal criticism of Democrat administrations through the sixties. The film is not fake news perhaps this review is! The seventies era of typewriters, old printing presses and office culture are perfectly captured by director Steven Spielberg who comes up with these social commentaries every few years amongst his blockbuster films of killer sharks and science fiction. The end of the film indeed sets up All The President's Men and the Watergate scandal that lead to the impeachment of President Nixon."
THE POST,28 July 2020,7/10,"In 1971 'Washington Post' owner Katharine Graham struggles with her decision to float the former family newspaper on the Stock Exchange as it battles for its place to compete with the leading 'New York Times'. When the 'New York Times' is given legal notice not to publish the Vietnam War papers on the escalation of the war by successive governments, damaging America in the eyes of the Nixon administration. In support of the rival newspaper and 1st ammendment rights, as well as taking advantage of this situation, Editor-in-Chief of the 'Washington Post'. Ben Bradlee decides to make the bold move to publish the papers and risk all in a potential showdown with government.Interesting timing for this film when the Trump administration finds itself in conflict with mainstream media and specifically 'the New York Times' and the 'Washington Post' in the printed word as the government peddles that thesr are ""fake news"" while the government have their own ""alternative facts"". There are many flaws with the film as it clearly tries to posit Streep's Katharine Graham as a Hillary Clinton character and clearly Steven Spielberg and the filmmakers nail their own political colours to the cross, but neither Democrat nor Republican administrations particularly shower themselves in glory here. This is particularly true of Bruce Greenwood's slimy performance as Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defence across Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson's Presidency. For any flaws it has, this is effective filmmaking and political conspiracy thriller, but lacks the edge of some others."
THE POST,22 January 2018,9/10,"Steven Spielberg has been a household name for decades and you can always tell that there's a unique filmmaker at the helm when you watch his films. The Post is his latest outing and that statement hasn't diminished one bit. Once again putting the story and characters before anything else (even though that's all this film really needs), he has always proven to be the very best of the best. For such a slow-paced movie, having such a simple premise, The Post moved along at a brisk pace in my opinion. Using dialogue as the action of the movie has always been a love of mine when it comes to storytelling. While not as rapid-fire as a film written by Aaron Sorkin, The Post is a film that I didn't find myself bored by in the slightest. I was intrigued from start to finish and here's why I must recommend it.Following the uncovering of certain government secrets that had been kept hidden for many years, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) leads the Washington Post, as Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), the editor in chief of the paper, sets out to do whatever is necessary in order to be the first newspaper to publish this article, even if it means risking their empire altogether. The premise itself is really quite simple, but it really comes down to how well-acted this film truly is. Everyone involved was truly a revelation here.It goes without saying that both Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks are both legends when it comes to performing in front of cameras. Say what you will about certain films that either one of them may have done that you disliked, but there's no denying that they pretty much put all they have into every one of their roles. So, that being said, the supporting cast really needs to up their game in order to compete with the best, and each an every one of them also shine here. This movie is stacked with talent ranging from a Bob Odenkirk to Bruce Greenwood, to newcomers like Jesse Plemons, but if you're given the opportunity to act on the set of a Spielberg movie, are you really going to deny it if you have a free schedule? So, needless to say, this entire ensemble deserves an award.While watching this film unfold, I found myself looking back on the film Spotlight, which took Best Picture at the Oscars two years ago. This movie has the same form of pacing and dialogue that that film has and upon research after watching The Post, I realized that the same writer in Josh Singer had worked on both of these screenplays, which made complete sense. Joined by a fairly new screenwriter in terms of feature films, Liz Hannah definitely proves herself as a worthy writer as well. The calm atmosphere that surrounded this film was the one aspect that I found myself falling in love with.When a movie manages to keep a very slow pace and still suck you in, then it's done its job right. The Post, in the end, is an intensely-written drama that takes its time and uses your patience as a tool to have you feel inspired by the end. Not that this film has a story that's all that enthralling in terms of excitement, but if you read between the lines as each scene moves along, then the bigger picture will start to appear. From the wonderful direction by Spielberg to the outstanding performances by the entire cast, to terrific writing by Hannah and Singer, this is a fantastic drama that's held together by a solid score by composer John Williams. The Post is one of the better movies of 2017 and I highly recommend checking it out."

THE POST,13 November 2020,4/10,"I am at the latter stages of this film. Ms Streep plays the owner of the Washington Post (looking remarkably like Mrs Thatcher-save for the difference in hair colour). The lady has amongst her friends the ""secretary of state"" - the same one who wrote what her paper is wanting to make public in regard to the Vietnam War, a war which the USA could not possibly win. Hanks is the editor in Chief. The language is quite aweful including lots of Blasphemy. Ms Streep is always concerned more about herself rather than the true being printed in the papers regarding the obvious dishonesty within the White House, for most of the film at least. You could save yourself alot of time by simply checking the historical facts in respect to this story rather than watch it. Ultimately, this led to Nixons impeachment. However, Streeps character is rather weak, most of her time I found myself wanting to throw something at her from my sofa.

A Spielberg directed and produced movie starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, OMG!Some people can't get excited by a book or movie retelling of what everyone informed knows, but it's not the events or the people that made history that have me interested in such projects, it's the characters behind them, the things that made then tick and the enormity of the events themselves upon the legacy they leave behind.The cast, in addition to the two lead actors, both multi Oscar winners, as is Spielberg, is a virtual who's who of big screen and small screen alike. Bob Odenkirk of fame 'Breaking Bad', 'Better Call Saul' and 'Fargo', Matthew Rhys of 'The Americans', Bradley Whitford of 'The West Wing', Sarah Paulson, Tracy Letts, Bruce Greenwood' of 'Star Trek', 'Double Jeopardy', 'I Robot' and hundred and fifty more (plus he's from Quebec, Canada, and you thought we only had Donald Sutherland and William Shatner as big screen names from my neck of the woods), the cast was great and motivated no doubt working on this movie.For those too young to remember, the story is about how the Washington Post's rise in prominence when it carried on the story of 'The Pentagon Papers', from where The New York Times was forced to stop. Here's Kenneth Chisholm's (prolific IMDb reviewer) storyline; I didn't feel I could do a better job describing the movie, so here it goes.When American military analyst, Daniel Ellsberg, realizes to his disgust the depths of the US government's deceptions about the futility of the Vietnam War, he takes action by copying top-secret documents that would become the Pentagon Papers. Later, Washington Post owner, Kay Graham, is still adjusting to taking over her late husband's business when editor Ben Bradlee discovers the New York Times has scooped them with an explosive expose on those papers. Determined to compete, Post reporters find Ellsberg himself and a complete copy of those papers. However, the Post's plans to publish their findings are put in jeopardy with a Federal restraining order that could get them all indicted for Contempt. Now, Kay Graham must decide whether to back down for the safety of her paper or publish and fight for the Freedom of the Press. In doing so, Graham and her staff join a fight that would have America's democratic ideals in the balance.A few scenes of the movie were quite moving and just what I go see them for. When Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) tells her daughter about her struggle dealing with the change in her life to cope with a traditional role of 'the wife' to taking over their husbands work in a time when the perception of women was not what it is today and women had to be so much stronger just to be taken seriously; that was a moving scene indeed, and it's why Streep won so many Oscars. Then when Bradlee (Tom Hanks) meets Graham to explain to her that they both were risking prison for defying the courts' ruling on the US president's war on the press; Hanks conveys the gravity and is in awe of Graham decision to carry on regardless, for a greater cause, freedom of the press. Finally when Hanks brings a bag full of top newspapers from all over the country, following the Posts's lead to defy the president, we can feel a sense of both relief and victory, even before the Supreme Court ruled on the action of the press.As we know now, but tend to forget, it was a pivotal moment in modern American history. Famous people are quoted by the hundreds on the press, among them these two:
The press is a watchdog. Not an attack dog. Not a lapdogg. A watchdog. Now, a watchdog can't be right all the time. He doesn't bark only when he sees or smells something that's dangerous. A good watchdog barks at things that are suspicious.
Dan Rather
""A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.""Albert Camus
In a time when again a president of the United States goes to war against the press, this movie is a reminder of why it is important to protect freedom of the press instead of the ego or reputation of that president."
THE POST,25 November 2018,4/10,"Literally one hour goes by in this movie before things start to happen. The rich lady who owns the Washington Post decides to run a story that could cost her family the newspaper they've owned for generations. Meryl Streep is the rich lady. To show she's not stuck up she stammers every sentence and hems and haws worse than Jimmy Steward in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. You just want to slap her every time she opens her mouth.""Oh! Um, we must . . . we must . .. we must think about the paper and then . . . and then think about what's right. Does that . . . does that make sense?""Tom Hanks plays the tough guy, the editor of the paper. I saw him play a mob hit man in ROAD TO PERDITION and he was pretty good. Not this time. He has literally no credibility. All he ever does is growl four words at a time.""Print the goddamn story. Print the goddamn story. Print the goddamn story!""Gee, Ben Hecht never wrote dialogue half this good!Now for some serious thoughts. This movie is slow, boring and stupid. The acting is bad and the characters are lifeless. (Even the *three* television ringers brought in from BREAKING BAD can't save it.) But it's not quite fair for people to say the movie is just worn-out liberal propaganda. It's much worse than that. Yes, the movie demonizes Richard Nixon, and that's a very liberal, Sixties thing to do. But there is something very un-Sixties, very illiberal, and indeed very authoritarian and reactionary, about the way Steven Spielberg turns the anti-war movement on its head.The purpose of this movie is to erase the violence, turmoil, and disorder from the story of the anti-war movement. THE POST is written in such a way as to make it look as though the war stopped because a handful of rich, cultivated, charming people made a single courageous decision to tell the truth -- and then the childlike masses obediently took to the streets.Not quite. The people who led the anti-war movement for years before the nation turned against the war were nearly all-- for better or for worse -- young, angry outsiders who did not want to be a part of the Establishment. And since this movie maker, our hero, the gutless aging Steven Spielberg, very much wants to embrace the Establishment, is indeed obsessed with joining the establishment, the real history needs to be watered down, subverted, falsified. Let's all pretend that the demure, soft-spoken lady in pearls stopped the war. Let's ignore the dirty, smelly, foul-mouthed, doped up radicals who nearly scared this country to death -- let's pretend they only came into existence after the Nice People Did the Right Thing.THE POST falsifies the very history it pretends to celebrate. It insults the audience and moves at what Miranda Priestley would call ""a glacial pace."" And by the way, ""Green River"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival was a hit in 1969, not 1966."
THE POST,18 September 2020,8/10,"Oscar winners Steven speilberg, hanks and meryl come together for the first time in a thrilling award winning drama the post tells a 70s story and captures the Times very well of a incredible true news paper that story of an unlikely duo the Washington Post Katherine Graham the owner and a editor Ben Bradley as the strive to expose a massive cover up of devastating government secrets about Vietnam and risking their careers and very freedom in a fight for the truth this film captures the era brilliantly especially the office setting."
THE POST,23 January 2018,8/10,"Set in the early 1970's. This is an Oscar contender, based on a true story. The film opens with intense battle scenes from the Vietnam War and then takes some time to introduce the prominent news reporting characters and flesh them out. The Washington Post managed to obtain evidence of a government cover-up and was considering whether to publish a more comprehensive article about the war after the New York Times had been given a court order not to print any material obtained from the same source. We see the low tech 'clunky' newspaper production methods of the time, the print room is poised, will they publish or won't they? The middle onwards is filled with suspense, as the Washington Post gambles with their reputation, their shareholders and their employee's careers. We see the 'news' challenge the authority of the government, what we currently recognise as Trump's 'Fake News'. The film ends where the Watergate story begins."
THE POST,25 February 2018,7/10,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Being Portuguese, I didn't know the story beforehand. Having that in mind, Spielberg does a great job telling an interesting and very important story through long takes with a nice flow. The cast is as amazing as it is expected, but my standout is Bob Odenkirk instead of the obvious Hanks and Streep. Technically pretty great, but with some flaws.It ends up falling in the genre issues. The first half of the movie is slow and boring, even if the story shows signs of interest. Too long for me to be invested for two hours and the replay/entertainment value is low. However, the second half of the film picks up the pace and the screenplay goes forward, ending on a strong note."
THE POST,13 January 2018,10/10,"Many assumptions made about the freedom of speech in America were truly tested during the Vietnam War era, when it became evident to anyone watching the evening news on TV that what the press was telling us and what our government was telling us about that war were clearly diverging. But those differences became manifestly evident in June 1971, when the New York Times began publishing the first volumes of documents leaked by former defense analyst Daniel Ellsberg that became known as the Pentagon Papers. And when the Washington Post, a relatively small newspaper based in the nation's capital, published them in defiance of a court injunction lodged against the New York Times for doing it, this led to a collision between the need for governmental secrecy and the public's right to know. This is the story told by director Steven Spielberg in his masterful 2017 political drama ""The Post"".Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep star as, respectively, the Post's managing editor Ben Bradlee and the paper's publisher Katharine Graham, who are confronted with the reality that their as-yet-insignificant paper is losing out to the New York Times, even though they are located within spitting distance of the White House. When the publishing of the Pentagon Papers hits the Times, they seem to be caught flat-footed; but Hanks is determined to get those same papers published in the Post itself. But there are more than a few complications. For one, the Post is about to go public on the American Stock Exchange; and the publication of the Pentagon Papers is a potentially fatal move. For another, both Hanks and Streep have conflicting past loyalties to political figures, including former defense secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood), whose actions implicate them in those papers. And for still another, president Richard Nixon is out to squelch not only the publication of the papers, but seemingly also even the First Amendment completely. Weighing all the options, including the fact that Hanks, Streep, and everyone else at the Post could find themselves going to jail forever, the decision is made to call the bluff and publish what Ellsberg gave, resulting in a clash between the two great powers in America, the press and the government, that goes all the way to the Supreme Court.Spielberg had already finished one film (the futuristic ""Ready Player One"") when the Pentagon Papers script by Hannah and Singer landed in his hands in early 2017; and given the huge turmoil spawned by president Donald Trump's frequent attacks on the press at the time (which have continued practically non-stop), the director felt that he couldn't hold off and that he had to make ""The Post"" and get it out to theatres first. He did this in unusually rapid succession, filming it over a period of ten weeks in the spring and summer of 2017, and having it finished for release at the end of the year. Despite this seeming rush, ""The Post"" emerges as another huge masterpiece for a director who has had far more than his share of them. A great deal of this comes from working with a crew that he has been familiar with on a vast majority of his films from ""Schindler's List"" onward, and to the usual masterful performances by Hanks and Streep, both of whom have to look a bit rumpled and even bedraggled at times, fitting the tenor of the early 1970s. And it also doesn't hurt that he has one of the great political stories in American history to work with: the publication of documents that revealed to the American public that their own government lied to them about a war that proceeded to divide the nation in a way that it had not been divided since the Civil War. Spielberg's scrupulous attention to detail also includes the insides of the Post's printing presses, and the fact that actual typewriters were still being used in those days, as opposed to electronic word processors.Besides Hanks and Streep, Spielberg gets solid performances from Greenwood; Matthew Rhys (as Ellsberg); Bob Odenkirk (as the Post's main Ellsberg conduit Ben Begdikian), and Justin Swain (as Neil Sheehan, the New York Times reporter who broke the Ellsberg story first); and the film also uses a number of tapes from Nixon's own White House from June 1971 to underline the sinister nexus of secrecy and paranoia that would eventually undo his administration, and almost undo the United States as a country in the bargain. Add on a terse and tension-filled music score by John Williams, maybe the greatest composer of film music of all time, and what you have in ""The Post"" is a film that will likely remain timeless because, particularly in 2017-18, it couldn't possibly have been more timely."
THE POST,15 September 2020,6/10,"While I feel that its attemps at being more inpsirational and emotional than other journalistic dramas mostly fall flat, when it does focus on the journalism, it's pretty riveting stuff.It's impossible not to compare this to All the President's Men, especially since its ending makes this somewhat of a prequel to that movie.
All the President's Men is better because it focused solely on the journalism, while this movie tries to tackle subjects like feminism, censorship, family legacies and more. It tackles some better than others and while they add some nice layers to the story, I kept wishing to know more a bout the papers and the sources and all that stuff. I also wish it focused more on the court cases.Overall, I liked this movie and I cheered on more than one ocation, but I think its main problem may be that it's just too short. Had this been a slower, three hour long movie it may have been able to put more focus on all the details and kept it from feeling as rushed, but nonetheless, this was quite good."

She has inherited the business from her great-grand-father. Ben Bradley (Tom Hanks) is the Editor-in-Chief of The Post.They are one step behind The New York Times in getting the first lead of the Pentagon Papers - but when they too get illegal access to those paper - the dilemma is whether to publish them or not because the Government has come heavily on New York Times.This could jeopardize the whole business of The Washington Post which has just gone public on New York Stock ExchangeBut Merlyn Streep - stands tall and goes ahead to publish the story even after her Board does not agree to do so.The whole American Public including press, media back Washington Post and that changes the course of history - where USA has to end the war in Vietnam and call their troops back.It is a short and thin story line -but well presented with intricacies of what went in those weeks during publishing the papers.
The ending seemed much rushed up.After reading the script - Spielberg - postponed an existing movie shooting and shot this movie immediately without delay - stating that - there is not more appropriate time than this to make this movie.Spietberg had felt with Swonden and Assange events that rocked American State with stealing of secret documents, this movie is relevant to the effect of FREEDOM OF SPEECH and its relevance.When it is Spietberg's movie - the acting of most of the cast is good. Both - Merlyn Streep and Tom Hanks have acted their role well along with numerous other people in the cast.It got good critical reviews and did well at the box office - and got 2 Oscar nominations (Best movie, Best Actress) too with another 18 wins and more than 100 nominations.It was worth watching this movie - because it shows - that the one who governs us - just serves us.

THE POST,22 February 2018,8/10,"It was a solid journalism drama and fine work by Steven Spielberg but not one of his best and with that cast and crew I expected something more memorable and sharper. Don't get me wrong it was a very fine movie but did not reach my expectations.
Meryl Streep is great in the lead role as Kay Graham. Nothing less you would expect from her. Very much in control of her character, and giving her a very personal touch. Good job. Tom Hanks was fine, but nothing to write home about. In fact he was constantly in the shadow of Streep and although he gave his character unique mannerisms, he does not really do anything to outshine. Just a good standard Hanks performance. But thats at least more than most actors are capable of. Its a crime how much Sarah Paulson was underused. Bruce Greenwood gave the best and most memorable performance of the supporting cast. Closely followed by Bob Odenkirk. Alison Brie, Jesse Plemons also have good roles and some good moments. Always great to see Tracy Letts, he never lets you down. Bradley Whitford overdid his role a little. Carrie Coon was also sadly very wasted. The production design was good. The cinematography had some nice shots but also some that appeared a bit amateurish. Decent editing and a fine score. But all of the involved artists can do better and have done better. I did like the screenplay tho. Good film but not a masterpiece."
THE POST,10 January 2018,8/10,"The Post is a historical thriller starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by Josh Singer (Spotlight), it presents a fascinating and thematic look into an important moment in the history of American journalism.In 1971, highly classified information regarding America's involvement in the Vietnam War spanning four Presidencies is leaked to the public via The New York Times newspaper and because of this, the entire company now faces serious criminal charges. With this in mind, their rival newspaper, The Washington Post, led by their new publisher Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), decide to take advantage of the situation, and along with her chief editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), fight a lengthy battle against the US government over freedom of the Press.Topical and intriguing, The Post's subject matter feels just as relevant today as it did decades ago. We are shown a glimpse into the loopholes of America's First Amendment and what information their government were and still may be hiding from the general public, even to this day. Meryl Streep gives another memorable and convincing performance as Kay Graham, America's first female newspaper publisher, who is required to make snap decisions about the potential future of her company. Tom Hanks and Bob Odenkirk also shine, albeit, with less screen time to make as much impact as Streep. I must point out that the film is predominately dialogue and has very little action, so anyone who dislikes films with too much talking will likely be bored.I rate it 8/10"

THE POST,4 February 2018,9/10,"The issues of free press, democracy and women in power are dealt by Spielberg in a way no other director can handle. More than how the secrets of Pentagon Papers are found by investigative journalism the film tries to tell how the society and the system are in a constant struggle for power and freedom. What could have been just another whistleblower story has turned into a thrilling and emotional tale of humanism that feels aptly timed in this ""Trump era"". Strep, Hanks and Odenkirk are brilliant. Spielberg sure knows how to keep things perfectly balanced and satisfy his audience."
THE POST,11 February 2018,8/10,"I'm a sucker for any movie that involves close-ups of newspapers being printed, but this story was particularly well told - as polished as you would expect from Spielberg, Streep, Hanks and co. It was funny and enthralling and just plain solid storytelling. In fact, Spielberg even managed to tone back his over-the-top-ness. There are few moments where odes of love to the press could be more important. So while there are flaws here (in pacing and in storytelling devices), this is as entertaining and informative of a Saturday night as you could ask for."
THE POST,4 December 2018,2/10,Good grief what an epic failure to entertain the viewers. One sided at best and just boring from the opening scene. How Streep got nominated for an Oscar is ridiculous. She acted that's it. She did her job. Wasn't bad but wasn't great either. You could put a thousand other people in that role and they would give you the same performance. Watch if you must but if you want a good newspaper flick go with all the presidents men... this one is very forgettable
THE POST,6 January 2018,4/10,"The difference is...the latter wasn't about anything but the men trying to get a story.
I find it ironic that when a film desperately wants to tell people that truth should be available to the public, it fabricates a lot of details to service what amounts to a dull story. While beautifully crafted, this film falls very flat, mostly because the agenda was to link Trump with Nixon. Since this has been done to death, very little is as amusing as watching social elitist scramble to dig dirt. One is left with why Katherine Graham's husband (former editor of the Washington Post) had committed suicide.
But that's not the story Spielberg wants to shove down your throat. It is about freedom of press. And forgive me for saying...newspapers don't have that power the internet has today. Before they had to fact check and wait to get the story correct. These days (and the WP is the worst offender) they get the story out FIRST. SO forgive the public for not pumping their fist in triumph at the end when the Supreme Court agrees with the 1st Amendment (yawn).
That is the problem with this film. Had it been made in Obama's 8 years, we might have braced ourselves for the future. Which...it's even more odd that we are able, each one of us Americans to share our opinion such as on IMDB or on our own blogs. When was this really an issue other than to lay defiburillator paddles on...printed press?!
Look, I'm always in awe of Spielberg's talent. This is a beautiful movie (as usual). It's crafted really well. But the earnestness of his message is similar to a child telling you about his butterfly collection that you know doesn't do jack for society. And it beats the drum over and over again. Strong strong performances, but this was such a letdown from the energy that I know will most likely be in ""Ready Player One."""
THE POST,15 February 2018,7/10,"Grade: B+In a Nutshell: Spielberg, Hanks, Streep. Powerhouse combination that reminds us why they're the masters of their trade. Surprisingly, this is the first time all three have worked together on a film. Oscar bait? Yeah, probably. It has already received several nominations by the Golden Globes and National Board of Review. Is an Academy Award next? Probably not. We'll see. Tips for parents: Children and teens will be bored out of their minds.
Some profanity.
As more and more traditional newspapers die a slow death due to the internet, kids might think the film is irrelevant, but there is much to be learned about the Constitution as the Pentagon Papers are introduced to this younger generation. As talk of ""fake news"" has become a part of everyday conversation, director Steven Spielberg raced to finish this film with unprecedented speed. Clearly, he thought the content was extremely relevant. Spielberg thought it was ironic that the pendulum has swung in journalism from '71 to '17.
Uplifting theme: Women in business. The film is dedicated to a woman, Nora Ephron, who helped uncover the Watergate scandal in 1972.

THE POST,20 January 2018,7/10,"The Post was a movie where you clearly saw each act improve on the last. Despite starting very slowly, the crescendo was well-done, and Streep really shines through in the third act. The story itself was good, and event sequencing was quite strong at the end. However, I would've liked to see more substance in the central conflict of the movie - it felt like Spielberg was just showcasing the two sides at odds in whether or not to publish, while not going as deeply into biases, perspectives, and practical reasons for those on both sides. It really just felt like indecision from Streep while everyone else was rather non-dynamic. I also thought the Court decision and legal proceedings leading up to it were skimmed over and prevented me from feeling more emotionally invested in the final decision. While it was generally enjoyable and the good acting as tension built was fun to watch, I think The Post showed more absolute positions and simple resolutions than nuanced, dynamic, and substantive issues and development of characters and issues."
THE POST,11 May 2018,6/10,"In almost every shot of this film, Meryl Streep either has soft focus on her or she stands near a bright window so we can't see her age lol.

THE POST,20 November 2020,7/10,"The storyline should have been reasonably straightforward, but a lot of indecipherable dialogue started to get annoying. It's ok when the characters know what they are talking about in crossover conversations, but hey, there is an audience here trying to work out what is going on.It was never a thriller as it was obvious from history without knowing the story that the Washington Post was not going to go out of business et al.Stellar performances from all."

THE POST,19 January 2018,7/10,"Last week, a group of us at the Triangle went to see ""The Post"", and the general opinion of it as we walked out was positive. As a news-story movie, it's pretty good and does nicely in relating a complex political issue to the audience in a way that makes decent sense. There are a lot of names thrown around, but I was able to keep track of them without too much trouble. The legal stuff also is dealt with in a way that is easy to follow in the few points that it comes up.There were distinct pros and cons that I found with the movie, and I will start with the pros. I really enjoyed watching the struggle that the heads of the newspapers were going through with whether to publish their story and the nature of the lies that they were uncovering. In those scenes, it felt like I was watching a House of Cards episode and a pretty good one at that. I was also impressed by the performances from several of the smaller parts and even a few nameless characters. There were also a couple of visually appealing montages of newspaper production. Overall, the story itself was an interesting one to tell and it was told in a way that kept my attention most of the time, which was a major plus. Where I thought the movie fell off was where it tried too hard to be appealing and relevant. There were a few moments and lines that were more dramatic than I thought they needed to be, namely the opening Vietnam scene that had little or no bearing on the rest of the movie. Similarly, there were a couple of scenes where the whole Post staff is receiving news from another source that felt really unnecessary. One quick montage even shows the entire staff are all reading their own copy of the same New York Times issue, which felt nothing short of ridiculous. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks are perhaps too good for the parts they portray. I didn't think either of their characters were the sort that call for a hugely impressive performance, but for whatever reason two of the most respected actors alive were cast in it. There are several long takes of the two of them that seem to by trying to show off their talent, but all that the two are really able to bring to the movie is an above average stage presence. Lastly, is the movie's agenda. I won't go into what the agenda is, but there are a few scenes and shots that are not to subtly trying to call attention to some modern political issues. I didn't necessarily disagree with any of them, but I thought they didn't belong in a movie that was centered around a timeless political struggle.I want to take a little space and draw some connections to Spotlight. There were a few lessons that I think The Post would have done well to take from Spotlight, namely keeping the focus on the issue at hand and let that be the driving force. Spotlight also did a good job, in my opinion, of not glorifying the job of journalists, which is something The Post definitely falls prey to. From a less critical sense, I am fairly certain that Tom Hank's Ben Bradlee is the father of the Ben Bradlee Jr played by John Slattery in Spotlight. Lastly, the office worker that receives a package from the hippie girl is the same actor who plays Joe Crowley, the gay victim in Spotlight.One final bit of umbrage. I cannot get over how standardly Steven Speilberg directs his more modern movies. I forgot that he was the director of this movie until they showed his name in the credits, and I instantly understood where all of the things I thought were cheesy about this movie came from. Being a millennial, I'm sure I can't appreciate the ground he broke with his early movies, but I still think that he directs in a way that is old fashioned and frankly cheesy. If you like political movies, this should be enjoyable for you, but probably won't be a favorite. If you are a big fan of either lead actor, this could definitely be a let-down although neither of them are bad. In any case, be prepared to pay attention to what is happening and what the characters are talking about as you watch. You won't be able to keep track of every name or piece of information, but you can maintain a decent sense of what is happening in the plot if you try. Overall Rating: 7.1/10."
THE POST,2 March 2018,7/10,"The Post - Spielberg Directs, Hanks and Streep star.. It's an interesting film with interesting an important things happening, and some moments are quite tense, but unfortunately most of it is rather boring, I guess that's sort of inherent to newspaper movies, Citizen Kane is hardly a thrill ride either! it picks up towards the end, but too little, too late.. feels like a missed opportunity in ways."
THE POST,28 October 2018,7/10,"The Post was a very interesting story and a very good drama. I thought Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks did a fantastic job. Meryl deserves that Oscar nomination. I enjoyed John Williams score and the cinematography. As for flaws the movie had some pacing issues. The beginning and some parts in the middle dragged on and I thought they could've sped that up just a bit. Otherwise I thought it was a well done drama and Steven Spielberg did a good job as always.
My Grade: B+"
THE POST,14 February 2020,6/10,"The Post is a nice retro throwback with some tremendous acting and period set design. Spielberg directs with bold, striking angles seeming to perpetually look down upon its world and its subject, emulating perhaps the way one looks down upon the newspaper in front of them. However there's something alienating and a little flacid in this piece; it's dialogue is neither cryptic enough or clear enough to be interesting, and there never seems to be the tension held inherent in The Post's influential forebearers. Where something similar, Zodiac, succeeded in modernising the long tension filled slow burn, The Post utterly fails."
THE POST,19 May 2018,3/10,"Maybe I'm getting wiser, but this film was so directed that i was aware of it every second. Older Spielberg films didn't have this in your face direction. the other issue is making films about historical events that you know what happens. Never make the historical event the central part of the film, because it becomes a predictable film and quite frankly boring.The reason why titanic worked is because it was about a love story, not the ship sinking. Forrest Gump (although fiction) was about a love story between forrest and his mom and jenny, not all the historical events which were secondary.Then the acting wasn't good. felt so wooden and staged, every moment with a camera pointing to a dramatic moment from each actor.writing felt like a tennis ball match, back and forth, so carefully constructed, but not any resemblance of realism.Too bad."
THE POST,22 June 2021,8/10,"After the trailer came out in 2017, then NY Times reporters and managers gave interviews on how the movie reduces the roles of New York Times in publishing Pentagon Paper to the public in 1971. They are absolutely right, and if the movie was 'The Times' instead of 'The Post', it will be a great political thriller with more dramas, stories, risks, and ecstasy. However, Spielberg chooses to focus on the development of Katharine Graham as a journalist. Graham used to be a socialite who were excellent at throwing parties, and the role of the leader of the company was fall upon her shoulder unexpectedly after her husband's suicide. For the beginning part of the movie, she is described nice and kind but unconfident. Domestic roles suit her more than the responsibility of the company. However, while going through challenges and tough decisions, she matures as a member of society in the workplace where men are prevalent and dominant. It is a unique perspective of the very important historical event, and I can see the director approaches the matter with great respect to women.When Graham has to finally decide to give a go or not, she sits down at the left corner of the table wearing a white dress, being fully surrounded by five or six men wearing black suits. When she is making up her mind, stating her reasons of the decision, and finally becoming the strong leader the Post needs, she stands up, walks away from them, and stands beside Bradlee. That scene is like a sequence of ballet, beautifully orchestrated. Another scene of genius is when she is on the line with many stakeholders. Rather than having all men sitting at one table, they talk on the phone, Graham being all alone. It emphasizes it is her decision to make. Her own. Shots move from one person to another very quickly. Each person's conversation overlaps, but the camera shows her face, putting her at the center of all conversation without being actually at the center."
THE POST,26 January 2018,8/10,"The term 'fourth estate' was coined in 1841 by philosopher Thomas Carlyle when he said that the Reporter's Gallery was far more important than the 'three estates' of parliament. This titbit of history tells us the battle lines over 'fake news' are as old as 'the press' itself. It is also the context for The Post (2017), a dramatic thriller and civics lesson about the media's role in checking government power. The Post shows why the media is despised by despots and is thus essential viewing for anyone wanting to better understand today's shambolic attacks on the media. The facts of the story became world news. By the mid-1960s, most Americans were losing faith in the nation's prospects of an honourable conclusion to three decades of conflict in Vietnam. While various Presidents told Americans that success was assured, the top-secret Pentagon Papers revealed that national policy was based on a litany of lies. Former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg notoriously leaked the Papers to the New York Times, but publication was suppressed by court order. The rival Washington Post acquired a copy and had to decide whether to publish and risk the paper's future, or not publish and lose the respect of its journalists.A dramatic high-tension wire is strung between Post heiress and socialite Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep) and her hard-core news editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks). They are polar opposites: she is a darling of the establishment, uncertain of her ability and fearful of losing not only the business but her social standing. Bradlee is a truth-seeking journalist who mistrusts lawyers and would publish at any cost. Described as ""the most highly classified documents of the war"", the President commands an army of lawyers threatening Armageddon if the paper goes to print. The film's period set design is brilliant: the reporter's room is a galley of buzzing typewriters and the printing press a mechanical maze of oiled steel grinding out papers in a frantic atmosphere of unrelenting deadlines. Against this background, the pre-feminist newspaper owner must make a decision that could bring down a President. When the choice is made, the Post must then face presidential retaliation via the Supreme Court. This story requires no narrative embellishment, nor does it need dramatic performances to convey the high-stakes of an extraordinary moment. The casting of stars and support is excellent. Streep and Hanks give their most understated performances of recent times; no other contemporary actors could have filled these roles with their authority and authenticity. Spielberg's direction keeps the events unfolding at a brisk pace to leverage the tension curve upwards while sticking close to the facts. This is masterful storytelling based on an important event that resonates into the modern era."
THE POST,13 January 2018,,"I don't know why ""The Post"" suffers one-star attacks on IMDB, but I guess that a large percentage of the haters may be New York Times readers. They might think that New York Times is the first to publish those classified files, yet the film instead focuses on Washington Post and does not give enough credit to NYT. The title should be ""The Times"" rather than ""The Post"" in their eyes. Actually, the film is very similar to last year's ""Hidden Figures"", in the sense that both use a comedy approach to depict quite dark and depressing periods in American history. That's good news for the audiences, making their viewing experience fairly enjoyable. Not coincidentally, both films are distributed by 20th Century Fox and I'm pretty sure that ""The Post"" is going to achieve respectable box office in the United States, say at least 120M dollars. From the perspective of filmmaking, the film is absolutely brilliant. The original score is especially notable. I don't know who composes the music, but it's just world-class. The direction and acting are also remarkable. The taut pace keeps the attention of the viewers to the last minute of the film, and the veteran cast simply deliver an impeccable performance. The makeup, production design and cinematography are utterly fantastic, and make every scene look real. The film also conveys an important message: free press is the foundation to democracy and should serve the governed, not the governors, which still resonates today."
THE POST,7 April 2019,8/10,"Spielberg timed this movie to perfection & ensured its relevance to modern day events maintained its presence within people's minds soon after.
As you can imagine with the creative people involved both in front & behind the camera, the film is great - far from being a masterpiece or Steven's best work, but it has something to say & chose the moment to say it with expert precision - at a time when we needed to hear it."
THE POST,2 June 2018,8/10,"Of all the Oscar best picture hopefuls in 2017, Steven Spielberg's 'The Post' is the one that hit closest to home for many in the moviegoing audience. Not only are they familiar with the saga surrounding the Pentagon Papers with The New York Times and The Washington Post, but they actually lived it.But 'Post' goes further behind the scenes than anyone has ever gone before, examining the debating and infighting between the editorial and management teams of The Washington Post as they grappled with whether to do the safe or right thing in publishing leaked documents that detailed how the American public had been deceived over the course of four presidential administrations. Of course, the fact that the main protagonist is the country's first female publisher of a major national daily, Kay Graham, heightens the history of the episode. Meryl Streep has proven time after time that she can play almost any role and make it believable, and she does the same in 'Post,' as the audience can feel the strife and confusion she deals with as she decides whether to pull the trigger or sit on the sidelines. In this sense, a major reason why 'Post' works so well is because of the casting of Streep.That said, the supporting cast members are no slouches. Tom Hanks brings the bravado and brashness with his portrayal of Post executive editor Ben Bradlee, and Bob Odenkirk surprises by continuing to step out of his comedy comfort zone in his role as the fiery reporter Ben Bagdikian. There are also less pronounced appearances by the likes of Sarah Paulson, Allison Brie, Bradley Whitford and Bruce Greenwood, among others. Since this is such a character-driven story, it's great that the investment was made in bringing together these professionals. But it's not just about the actors, of course. The use of the settings, whether the newsroom or the homes of the executives who were calling the shots, is really well done and shows how something that may seem so simple actually can make a difference in how a film is perceived.It's also a little tricky to keep an audience engaged when most are familiar with how everything turns out, as is the case for many historical films. Spielberg is able to do so, more or less, as there are so many twists and turns caused by the legal challenges and other events that influence the decisions that are made. While we follow many twists and turns along the way, these are central to the story and do not take us off on an unnecessary detour. Something that is expected from someone of Spielberg's stature, of course.'The Post' may not have earned itself an Oscar for the film itself, it proves why its received so many accolades from critics and the general audience alike."
THE POST,10 August 2018,,"Walks in with yet another engaging spectacle, Steven Spielberg is hands down a master at filmmaking. The extremely gifted man once again proves with The Post Movie that he is peerless at what he does. His work never ceases to paint flairs of extraordinaire. He is the one man who could make a simple conversation stand out. And there is so much inscribed in his frames that you can't help but wonder how does he manage to pull it all off.
There's a story he tells even in long winding conversations. The Post Movie is full of such brilliant masterly koreros. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep with their Oscar-bait presence, make all those chats stand out. There's something about his direction that's instantly uplifting. Even when he is not busy painting fiction like last years The BFG, he is pouring meaning into the mundane, shaping it and moulding into something delectable.
In a world of power that's run by the corrupt, perches a voice that's broiling to do the right thing. The Post movie bases itself on that very run, the pointlessness of a war that had edged itself precariously on the parapet of ""let down"". The fact ""we can't show the world we lost"" smothers the superpower dream and the United States government was finding it difficult to come clean. It was The New York Times who took the first plunge but the victor - The Washington Post who saw it all the way through.
The Post Movie Plot and Theme (Spoilers)
The Post narrates the true story of the Pentagon Papers that shook the very foundation of the US government when they were made public in 1971. It is built around all that took place inside the head of all the decision makers and the turmoil they were in when something as huge as the truth itself came along.
The Post movie kicks off in the year 1966 with a prologue showing Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) accompanying US troops and documenting US military activities led by Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). When speaking to President Lyndon Johnson he expresses how hopeless the Vietnam war was, and yet publicly speaking McNamara says the exact opposite.
There was something about that blunt lie that shakes the very foundation on which Daniel was built. Unable to take it anymore he decides to let all the government secrets out in the open for the public to see. He photocopies classified reports that showcase the progress of Americans on Vietnam soil ever since the time of Harry S. Truman and then leaks it to The New York Times. Later he releases it to The Washington Post where a pissed off Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) was scouring for news.
Quality drives profitability.
It should be well noted the import of the papers. It is worth noticing how the director chose to run the camera literally with the Pentagon papers thus establishing the colossal importance of news. A world was about to go down for some really powerful people. You could literally feel the weight of the papers in that parcel that made its way to Ben's desk.
Meryl Streep as Kay Graham
Katherine Graham or Kay (Meryl Streep) found a world on her shoulders when she took the reins of The Washington Post in her hands as the publisher and owner after her husband died. She was overpowered by some really strong men, and it was hard for her to cope with those who condescended her at all times. Be it be her advisors or the men who surrounded her.
In the beginning, there was this apparent tension as clouds of doubts hovered over her. It was important to show that owing to the huge decision boiling in the eventuality of the flick. Meryl nails it giving an Oscar-worthy performance yet again.
There are some really ingenious shots put in by Steven Spielberg when he chose to show a woman entering a room full of men. It spoke of contradiction. Even though words weren't spoken, eyes spake 'em. There was an evident air of control that you could sense in that frame when Katherine takes her seat unable to speak herself out due to stress and hesitation.
News is the first rough draft of history.
You could sense her to be this vulnerable woman who was forced out of her way and flung into a room full of responsibilities. What people did not know was the undeniable fact that every person is totally capable of handling things once they get a hang of it.
There was also one scene where all the wives of men at great posts stood outside smoking, waiting and discussing trivial matters while this contrasting lady Kay Graham goes right through them all to meet with the 'men' to take a call. It is just truly inspiring for all those who thought there was a said place for women. She literally changed the very perspective people had about women.
Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee
Editor in Chief of The Washington Post is Ben Bradlee portrayed by Tom Hanks. He is rooting for a big news when the biggest of all news hits him in the face. A lot of shots are called by him in the flick but at the end of the day, the decision still stood with Kay"
THE POST,19 January 2018,8/10,"The is review of The Post is spoiler free**** (4/5)DIRECTOR STEVEN SPIELBERG'S latest film The Post comes brazen with political drama, war time mysteries and sets itself in the postal business taking part in one of the biggest feuds in American history: the infamous previous history between The Pentagon Papers (a.k.a The Washington Post) and the US government - in particular Richard Nixon. And how the paper delved deeper into the mysteries of The Vietnam War that had been leaked to the press. 
 
After a stunning opening section of the US soldiers fighting against the Vietnamese you are blitzed by political speeches said by several US presidents; Dwight Eisenhower and JFK to name a couple then the film shifts to Kay Graham (Streep), the owner of the Washington Post. She is immediately brilliant - no shock there, portraying the first female newspaper publisher - a job that she didn't really want and the men don't take too kindly of her being their superior. However negativity from them aside she does what she can to make the papers and not let them bring her down. On the other side in the newsroom is editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee (Hanks returning to Spielberg after 2015's Bridge of Spies), his job is seemingly simple as he has to decide the headlines yet he has one thing in his way of becoming a national paper the competition with The New York Times and it's sly editor Abe Rosenthal (Michael Stuhlbarg) as hard as he tries he doesn't come out of it very easily. It's a very smart movie and from just that opening The Post is first class printing. 
 
For that you have to give points to Spielberg, whom in the past has showed that he's no stranger to delightfully steering through the bygone era and so for him here timing is everything. The setting is pure '70s so throughout he offers the relevant props to make it as timely as possible; smoking in workrooms, typewriters on desks, paperwork making a mess everywhere and those old-fashioned payphones - you know the ones where you would lose all your change? Well that moment is here too. Mostly filmed in the compact newsroom presenting itself as a bustling arena during a sporting event - Spielberg still manages to steer his camera through people rushing to get the deadline finished. But his technique doesn't just apply here his directing is masterful throughout steadily moving his camera through darkly lit rooms, leaving no prop, no corner or a room untouched. 
 
The Post (previously known as The Papers) but then moved back after production was obviously shot and edited by Spielberg, yet he was quick to bring it out seemingly in time for awards season as it was shot and edited by him and his team in less than six months and that may earn the film a strike. However the story is hotly written by his intelligent duo of screenwriters Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, which doesn't just apply to the film's setting but it also hints at a timely setting to this decade. And this together with his techniques sees the master filmmaker at his most thrilling watch since Saving Private Ryan. It certainly is first class printing, yet the most points are awarded to Hanks and Streep whose performances are upholstered and some may see them as seemingly up-tight but they are brilliant ultimately bursting with relatability, painting their pathways with shiny gold paint. And gold it sure is as this is Spielberg's most subtly entertaining, his most charming and his most exhilarating film in recent years.
 
VERDICT Hanks and Streep are electric in Spielberg's smartly written, terrifically enthralling and charming press drama if this leaves you inspired - mission passed."
THE POST,7 February 2018,7/10,"Take the most prized director of the cinema, join a spectacular and Oscar-filled cast, mix it up with a super intriguing storyline, and have a super movie! unfortunately the recipe does not always work, ""The post"" is certainly a good movie, but that's it, it's like he does not gears, the cast does not impress and the direction does not convince. The movie script tells the scandal behind the information omitted by the US government regarding the Vietnam War, such a story is told from the point of view of the newspapers to which this information has been leaked, it is a mysterious, intriguing plot that builds a lot well its narrative, but it neglects to give development to the characters, mainly its protagonist, who cries for attention the whole length, besides verbalising the feelings of the personages always in the dialogues, thus diminishing their individualities. The script seeks to give importance to the woman, and to highlight it, this to a certain extent is very good and natural, after a time is forced, and the great message of the film is on account of democracy in the end always win (even if it is very slowly). The film has some very strange footage, it is very difficult to perceive the hand of Spielberg, because many scenes are common, and others even misdirected, the photography inão draws attention, not even the soundtrack, that are generally strong points of the films of Spielberg , but in compensation, the rhythm of the film is very good, just like its setting, the direction of art is good. Despite the super cast, for me, the biggest highlight of the film is Bob Odenkirk, the actor is very well, and delivers an intriguing, Machiavellian character and very interesting, and although little quoted, the main trigger of plot of the film. Tom Hanks, as usual, does a good performance, nothing to impress, but it's great to be amazed by the stage presence of the actor, if Tom Hanks was not brilliant, Mary Streep was a complete truck of emotions, at times she is fabulous, others are embarrassed, she gives a completely real interpretation and shocking, but sometimes it is forced, so if it is to evaluate the performance of the same, we draw a middle line and we conclude that it had a good performance , neither brilliant nor bad. With an intriguing script, a direction that leaves something to be desired but delivers something, and good performances, ""The Post"" is far from impressive, but it's a good movie."
THE POST,21 April 2018,8/10,"There was a Run on Metamucil at the theatre ......otherwiseVery Well Done Movie. Guess no one forgets about all the Lying, but well told story. Might appeal more to those of us born around 1960 ? A List Production"
THE POST,18 January 2018,8/10,"It's an odd thing to say about a film set in 1971, but The Post is a movie that sits very firmly in the here and now. The battle royale at its heart - a face-off between the press and the President of the United States that's almost half a century old - wouldn't have felt quite as urgent or relevant just two years ago. The Post matters today, at this moment, because - at its very best - the film manages to tie past and present together in a way that will chill and thrill the spirit in equal measure. The power of its message makes it easier to overlook the ways in which The Post falters, from an occasional lack of nuance to its tendency to tell rather than show.And what a lot of telling it does in its first half. We're introduced - via copious amounts of exposition - to the film's many puzzle pieces: Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), fretful widow trying to do right by her late father, husband and the newspaper she inherited from them; Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), her fiery editor-in-chief who's desperate to take The Washington Post into the big leagues; and the Pentagon Papers, classified government documents that reveal just how much has been kept from the American public about the country's decades-long involvement in the Vietnam War.In the hands of a lesser director than Steven Spielberg, the first act of The Post would have been an interminable slog. It's hard to conjure up tension when the narrative isn't being very cooperative - which it isn't, because, in reality, it was actually The New York Times that spent months cracking the biggest story of the year. For much of its first half, the film tries to find drama where there isn't very much of it on hand. The most subterfuge we see is Ben's decision to send an intern to infiltrate The Times to find out why his rival's top reporter hasn't published a story in months.But Spielberg is nothing if not a master craftsman, and he uses the quieter moments at the start of the film to establish and explore character. We bear witness to the way in which Kay is routinely dismissed, as a person and a voice, by all the men who sit on the board of her own company. We laugh as Ben takes a stand against the White House, even on an issue as trivial as The Post being barred from reporting on the marriage of President Nixon's daughter. We watch Kay and Ben interact - the former worrying about the bottom line, as the latter defends the paper's headlines.The film really comes alive when it shifts into higher gear about halfway through. Suddenly, it slips from amiable drama to heart-gripping thriller, as the big story finally comes to The Washington Post at a moment when the stakes for everyone involved couldn't be higher. In the very same week that the newspaper is about to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, assistant editor Ben Bagdikian (a terrific Bob Odenkirk) tracks down the source who leaked the Pentagon Papers. With The New York Times barred from further reporting by a court injunction, Kay must decide whether to defy the White House to publish - and risk irreparable damage to her family's company and legacy. At this point, The Post becomes an absolute thrill to watch. As The Post's team of reporters - played by a stable of fine comedians and character actors like David Cross and Carrie Coon - struggle to pull their story into shape, Kay sits in the eye of a hurricane of men's opinions: Ben urging her to publish on principle, as misogynistic board member Arthur Parsons (Bradley Whitford) and even trusted advisor Fritz Beebe (Tracy Letts) advise caution. It's a credit to Spielberg and his fantastic cast that they inject these defining moments with genuine doubt and suspense. Streep is marvellous, as always, radiating Kay's worry and despair while also hiding her character's quiet strength in plain sight. She's so good that you can almost buy into a completely unsubtle scene - in which she descends the courtroom steps before a line of young girls gazing upon her with unvarnished adulation - that anoints Kay as a feminist hero. Hanks is similarly effective as a brash, principled newsman who takes the value of truth so much for granted that he needs to be reminded - especially in a lovely scene with his wife, Tony (Sarah Paulson) - that integrity does not come without its own incalculable costs. Spielberg cleverly finds tension and hope, as well, in moments that no longer exist in this age of digital media, when just about anybody can toss words into the vast vacuum of the Internet. There is an almost hypnotic, hallowed magic to the sheer effort it used to take to tell the truth, which comes through clearly in the clatter of typewriters, the pressing of ideas into hot type, and the storm and churn of men and machines producing stories and newspapers that have the power to change the world. Taken altogether, The Post works precisely because it is a film very much made for and about this time. It's not perfect - you probably won't be able to completely shake the feeling that the final screenplay was a draft or two away from greatness. But, at this peculiar, particular moment in history when the incumbent President of the United States regularly challenges the very fabric of reality through his Twitter feed, there is a raw, incisive power to this film that allows it to rise above its flaws. In this world, at this time, The Post - and its spirited defense of truth, integrity and accountability - matters."
THE POST,21 January 2018,8/10,"'The Post' is Spielberg & Hanks' fifth film together, and it's another good one. Kay Graham (Streep) is the publisher/owner of The Washington Post newspaper, after inheriting it from her late husband in the 1950's, and Ben Bradlee (Hanks) is the editor, making the day-to-day decisions on what gets published. When the New York Times breaks the US Government cover-up of their failings in the Vietnam war and are silenced by the Supreme Court, the Post seizes the opportunity to publish the leaked documents they have also obtained. It's all very pertinent with Trump's America and ""fake news"" and while not exclusively about the press vs the government (there's no long courtroom scenes), it definitely gets across the freedom of speech angle. It also shows what Kay went through - a widow trying to uphold her husband & father's ideals, whilst being maligned as a woman in a man's world - as well as the nostalgia of proper reporting, journalism and newspaper printing, which will sadly be lost to the world soon.Great support cast - Bob Odenkirk, Carrie Coon & David Cross as senior reporters, Sarah Paulson as Hanks' wife, Alison Brie as Streep's daughter, Bruce Greenwood as the Secretary of Defence, Matthew Rhys as the source, Jesse Plemnos as the lawyer. It's almost as good as 'Spotlight', as far as newspaper films go! Has a very strong beginning and end and it's a pleasure to watch Hanks and Streep display their acting skills in between."
THE POST,2 February 2018,6/10,"I am a huge Spielberg fan and studied some American history at college,I am even old enough to remember news reports (on British tv,I am not an American) about all the stuff covered in this film.So I did enjoy this film,it was well acted and well made with a good period feel.
But while students of acting and set design and political history will love the film the average person not obsessed with history or the ideals of a free press might wish there was more drama.
Viewers of Darkest Hour will know how film makers can bend the truth to make a dramatic film of historic events."
THE POST,29 January 2018,,"29 January 2018
First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Post. This is the first time Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep have worked together on the film - they should do it more often. The post is another from the Spielberg stable, based on a true story this film benefits from a continued interest in American political history. Set in the 70s we are introduced to Kay Graham (Streep) owner of The Washington Post and Editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks) in a story of leaked documents regarding the Governments dealings in the ongoing Vietnam War and and the battle between the Washington Post and their rival newspaper, The New York Times to publish them all. I often find a film of this type slightly tricky to get into, but once I'm hooked, I'm in to the finish. Lots of dialogue and intrigue as we follow a story that covers at least four presidential terms. There was a good supporting cast both at the paper and those surrounding Kay Graham, all of whom were pushing her to to make decisions she wasn't comfortable with. Being a film set in the 70s we are presented with the usual treats of bad hairstyles, bad fashion, and rooms with a fuggy layer of cigarette smoke resting about a foot from the ceiling. Very well filmed and a good watch."
THE POST,26 September 2020,7/10,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the drama flick The Post (2017), directed by Steven Spielberg and starring two heavy weight giants, the queen herself, Meryl Streep and everyone's favourite, Tom Hanks. Both actors portray real life people who are on different sides of how to run a newspaper until an event helps them to form an unlikely partnership. Streep plays Katharine Graham, the first female publisher of The Washington Post and Hanks plays, The Washington Post's editor Ben Bradlee and both are trying to overcome their differences by risking their careers. The risk is to seek truth and to open government secrets, which has been under the radar for three decades and spanned four U.S. Presidents. The cover up?? The government's deceptions about the reasons behind Vietnam War, which is leaked by a military analyst. The documents which are leaked would become the Pentagon Papers.Now where does the publisher and editor fit in? Well Katharine Graham is still adjusting to taking over her late husband's business and the editor Ben Bradlee, a truth-seeking journalist who mistrusts lawyers and would publish at any cost. So when Bradlee and his colleagues find the Pentagon Papers, they face the risk of a Federal restraining order that could get them all indicted for Contempt, The Washington Post going bust and risking the democratic ideals around free speech. This film should be an inspiration to current media moguls and all things media around the need of freedom of speech and freedom of press however we as the general public need to expect the news media to give us the right information by uncovering those in power and expose cover ups and lies. True journalism should mean investigation and publish hard hitting truth even if it means to challenge the powers that be.Now back to the movie. Hanks does well as Bradlee, an old school balls to the walls type guy. Streep does an awesome job once again as she creates a character who doesn't have a known voice until she starts believing in what she is fighting for and finds it. She slowly learns that she is fully capable of seizing control and making the tough decisions, just like any successful leader. Her performance is very moving and when she does, she uses it. Her back and forth dialogue with Hanks is great in particular her confrontation around Hank's character, Bradlee whose relationship with the Kennedys is questioned. While JFK's time in office was inspiring to quite a lot of Americans, he did however get a pass on all of his extracurricular activities. In other words, regardless of your position, you need to be accountable of your actions.
The movie is well-made, both gripping and entertaining and the tone is handled well however there should have been more awareness of how the Vietnam War actually preceded the presidency of Richard Nixon by four prior administrations, dating all the way back to Harry Truman. Nixon gets most of the blame especially due to the break-in at the Watergate Hotel.The room of reports buzzing away at old school typewriters and the scene of the oiled steel printing press is a great trip to where there was such a thing as investigative journalism. Sources were double and triple checked before stories made it into print, while today all it takes sometimes, is a tweet, to send reporters into a frenzy. Overall 7/10"
THE POST,3 February 2018,6/10,"There are good Oscar (or awards season) movies, there are bad and then there are the ones that stay in no man's land between them.I consider ""The Post"" one of those hapless in-betweeners, created with the aim of grabbing glory but probably destined to fail. Because despite the socially relevant story and big names involved - starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, directed by Steven Spielberg - the result is just not that interesting.It's summer 1971 and the U.S. government secrets leak to the some newspapers, exposing a massive Vietnam war related cover-up spanning three decades and four Presidents. The editor and the publisher of Washington Post must overcome their differences as they risk their careers and freedom to make the long-buried truths public.""The Post"" is acceptable quality work in every major aspect but it has one big flaw which doesn't let it achive much relevancy - how anachronistic it all really feels.It would have been a great movie when ""All the President's Men"" was new or something. Now, it's just a throwback to times that audience has not experienced and has little chance to relate personally.It's basically not a movie but infotainment, a history lesson Spielberg made for himself and other old, intelligent, upper class Americans like him. There's not even much happening in the movie, only Serious People talking about This Serious Issue for close to two hours.It's true that movies based on lots of dialogue are not bad in itself, the most recent enjoyable example being ""Molly's Game"".It is also true that topics such as free speech, freedom of the press, and the basic accountability of the government remain relevant, both in the past and in democratic countries of today.
But I am afraid that Spielberg and his posse have seriously overestimated how interesting the story of ""The Post"" feels right here and now.I mean, interesting on intellectual level - sure. But people of today wouldn't know how relate to these topics on personal and emotional level anymore.Freedom of the speech and press have much different meaning on this day and age where everybody can set up a blog or YouTube channel, people get their news fix from social media and even chat apps, most of the quality of the journalism can't be compared to that of the pre-internet age, and the print press (or reading from paper, or even validness of the news story) has lost much of its importance.Of course, the history lessons in the form of entertainment can be cool too, but there's not much to ""The Post"" as just a movie. There are no interesting characters or events but only famous actors talking a lot. Everything but the dialogue is of secondary importance here, and hence gotten little attention in screenplay.Yes, the 1970's period detail is authentic and somewhat fascinating, but what exactly about this whole production is supposed to talk to nowadays audience directly? I found no connections personally although my long-time working in the field of journalism should have added some.Would you even be interested in seeing this if Spielberg and his cool actors were not involved? You'd maybe Netflix this on particularly boring evening, I say.""The Post"" was nominated for six Golden Globes but did not get any. It's been also nominated for best movie and actress (Streep) Oscar."
THE POST,15 December 2018,8/10,"The Post depicts multiple complex relationships centered around the owner of the Washington Post, Katharine Graham (Streep) in the 1960s during Nixon's administration and the Vietnam war. Graham's relationship with her family is tiptoed around, but reveals the truth about her husband's death, which helps you understand why she seems to always be carrying a weight around.The relationship between Graham and Ben Bradllee (Hanks), the chief editor, is examined in depth through multiple serious decisions. The relationship between Graham and her confidants is particularly telling, because they are all older white men, and she stands alone as the only woman, but the one with the power. Imagine the weight that that added to Graham's already heavy personal burden.The buddy-buddy relationship between Bradlee and his team was put to the test thru trial by fire around the war. There was also an examination of the inter-newspaper relationships, as the NY Times and the Post were really competitors back then. The Post was launching an IPO right around the time of the central event of this flick - the release of the Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsburg, an embedded journalist in the war effort who had access to top secret information. That IPO added another layer of complexity to Graham's life.So many relationships were examined that it got to be a bit hard to tell who was who, which is my only major negative for this fine film. Otherwise, you are taken to the heart of so many beasts, played so politely, but viscerally by nice, rich, white, powerbrokers who all tried to steer Graham to do nothing, back down, stay the course. What courage it took for Graham to take the decisions she did.Streep and Hanks deliver stellar performances, really diving deeply into their characters' feelings and emotions. Fritz, her key confidant, played by Tracey Letts, gave an outstanding performance too, being truthful at all times, but backing off to show her that he trusted her. The acting of other supporting characters was top notch too - Daniel Ellsburg (Matthew Rhys), Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood), and reporter Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk).The cinematography and costumes were also top notch. You really felt like you were back in the 60s, with hippies, bell bottoms, protests, newspaper printing machines, the old blood and guts reporting styles when not just anyone could write their own blog and pass it off as quality stuff. Reporters were respected back then, and you felt the blood, guts, and glory of what that was. Roll the presses, and the reporting room started to shake as these reporters worked on their tiny desks with typewriters and printed paper. It was amazing to see NO cell phones - people had to grab a paper to get info, or watch their B+W tvs. Smoking was also a key ingredient back then too.Spielberg was the Director, and he displayed his superb knowledge of that era by his direction and editing, plus his sense of building up drama. Similar to the Apollo 13 movie, where you know how it ended up, the direction still had you wondering how will this turn out? Will they go to press or will they cave to the enormous pressure brought by the President and the powerbrokers?Finally, my only other small negative was the barbs the film took at Nixon, which seemed somewhat unnecessary. His legacy of lying and deceit is well-documented in the American psyche. It seemed unnecessary to have short scenes to further smear him, while it was already depicted in the film how he smeared himself.Go see The Post. It's a terrific film on so many levels, and was highly nominated for the Academy Awards."
THE POST,27 January 2018,3/10,"This film plays like a parody of the parody soap ""Acorn Antiques"". Streep is a shoe-in for Babs, with stiff necked, robotic movements and speech without mouth movement, posed for minutes before 'action' is started. Very very very poor direction. In fact, there are too many 'tableaux' of posed actors waiting for the go sign and then spouting the most ridiculous crap of no significance. Hanks, bless him, plays the Mrs Overall character with aplomb. Perhaps he was conned by the importance of the story this film ought to be telling....you know, press freedom, democratic government...a certain amount of truth etc. But no, we get God-awful John Williams brass-blowing noise over an amateurish treatment of the very mature newsprint industry. Do you really think it takes a compositor minutes to create a line of type? The press rolls in readiness for the final pages folks...not as in this depiction where everything is stationary until the lead story is cleared. As for the script, no no no no no no no. Mrs Graham cannot have gone from fragile woman who seems like she'll wet her pants if she speaks up to determined upholder of press freedom in the blink of an eye. Crap film. Give it a miss."
THE POST,6 October 2019,8/10,"The background story is mostly true and it's fascinating to watch it unfold mainly due to Streep and Hanks who use all their skills to 'be' their characters, a very slick production and acting effort."
THE POST,2 January 2019,4/10,"It's hard to pin-point just what is going wrong, but, maybe that's just pretty much all of it is going wrong.The story is too political, obviously biased, not very interesting... Yes, it's Spielberg, he throws in a few lines about how these people were privileged in previous administrations (Tom Hanks having dinner at the White House every week) and lets you surmise that they have a hidden agenda to work against the current one, but, it's way too little to make for an interesting story. The attempts at creating drama feel forced and unreal (like when Streep decides to go on with the story, even though there might be commercial set-backs).The performances are, even for proven actors such as Streep and Hanks, pretty lifeless. It seems that the point was to make it with a kind of a documentary look-and-feel, but, it didn't succeed.The directions is also dull, often strange and unexpected, but without any noticeable effect. Yes, we have interesting takes, too, like viewing how papers were put together in those days (before computers and DTP). But, not many and miles away from being enough.Also, the timing of such a movie is way off. The whole ""holy press"" movement is gone. The press don't have that much influence, for both technological and corruption reasons. Yes, Spielberg spent best years of his life in the height of the movement (and on the _good_ side of it), so, he has fond memories and would like to preserve them somehow, but, this is the wrong way.It's a shame, it seems that a sharper Spielberg could have made a much better movie with this material many years ago. Suppose that, right after a scene in which Streep laments about her ""lack of feminist rights"", while obviously living a life of luxury and privilege, we were shown woman struggling to make ends meet, while having all the feminist rights she could possibly have on a farm (for example, she's the only child and her father has groomed her to take his place), but is not part of the privileged class. That would put perspective on things.But, as is, better avoid this movie, it will make you think much less of Spielberg."
THE POST,24 February 2018,7/10,"The Post had a stellar cast including the likes of Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk and more. It told a brilliant bio-pic with intense drama and compelling storytelling matched with great acting. With a cast like that, it's hard to make a bad film, although considering last year's ""The Circle"" which coincidentally also stars Tom Hanks it may not be that much of a surprise. However, this is not the case in The Post, but I did find that there were quite some issues in the first act of the film before it really picked up when the Washington Post guys acquired the hidden documents. In that sense I would argue that the film suffers quite a lot from issues with pacing, having the first act being a real drag to sit through. But when it picks up, oh, does it pick up! The sense of passion and intensity that came out of that second act was wonderful and begged the question: where was this during the first act? While Meryl Streep does a great job showing her strengths in a role that involved both acting vulnerable and small as well as strong and decisive. Tom Hanks isn't necessarily utilized to his full potential in my opinion, when that man goes he can really put up a really good performance of great warmth. In this case, obviously his role doesn't necessarily fit the 'Tom Hanks mold', but he does a decent job nonetheless. Bob Odenkirk however was made for this role, his sly character traits from ""Better Call Saul"" was greatly implemented here, making him one of the highlight performances. At the core of this film there is the debate of freedom of speech/press and national security. It was wonderfully summed up in the film and The Post reminds us of what it actually means for the press to be reporting on news that actually has implications and purpose. In a day and age of which 'fake news' is running rampant, it sure is a welcoming moving."
THE POST,24 April 2018,8/10,"""The Post"" is a political thriller about the editor and publisher of the Washington Post during the Vietnam War in the early '70s. It's based on a true story about a political scandal that spanned four presidents that Nixon attempted to cover up by keeping the journalists quiet once some classified documents were leaked. Tom Hanks plays the no-nonsense editor who brings his team of reporters together to get to the bottom of the classified study that was leaked to the New York Times. Meryl Streep plays the new publisher of the Washington Post, who has to make the decision whether or not to publish the story.For me, getting into the movie took a while. In the 116 minute run time, I'd say I was not overly interested in the movie until about the half way point. That said, once the action started to pick up I was on the edge of my seat. ""The Post"" is definitely a movie that puts things into perspective just how important the newspaper industry truly is. Without the people who go out of their way to find the truth, we'd be living in a world with a very limited scope.If you like historical movies, political movies, or just Tom Hanks/Meryl Streep in general you'll probably like ""The Post."" If you have kids and want to find a movie that the whole family can enjoy, I'd skip this movie. ""The Post"" is not for everyone, but if you have a passion for news or journalism then this is definitely something you should hit the theaters for."
THE POST,2 August 2020,8/10,"Not as intense as I thought but its good. I know theres two main problem that the story try to deliver, but the one that being face by kay didn't feels as strong as the her newspaper face. But both of them was executed very well.The background story take to much duration of the movie, they supposed to make the last ""supreme court"" part more intense tho. Why not just make the movie longer anyway..Great performance from all of the actor, since there's this much big name I expect more perfect vibe from story.Great detail set. Good script, can be great too tho."
THE POST,28 February 2018,7/10,"Steven Spielberg is a genius, that isn't a discussion about it, but not even a genius innovates everytime he does something (and that is fine, they don't need to).And this is really true, it seems like Spielberg is almost directing in the ""automatic"" (and this is fantastic, because this movie is directed better than most of the films out there. So, ok, he is a monster).The Post is a good movie, don't get me wrong, is well directed, well acted, has a beautiful cinematography, a simple but good story, and I guess that it does justice to the real event itself. However, the movie doesn't bring anything new, doesn't do that much in order to be more than just ""good"", as I already said, is a good movie, a competent one, but that is it. Is a bunch of really talent people kind of doing things in the ""automatic"". Even though, Spielberg camera work here is amazingly beautiful. They do almost everything that you would expect that a movie like this would do, and doesn't try to add something behind it (like develop some character - like Darkest Hour - or create a different approach to something serious - like I, Tonya).In short, the movie is probably better than the average of ""real event"" movies, but still, we expect always more from a guy like Spielberg. Again, is a good and competent movie in almost all the aspects, but, it really doesn't do that much of a effort to make a movie that is different from the ones that we already saw through the years."
THE POST,18 January 2018,7/10,"Can there actually be a more awards bait film than this one? Firstly you have the most influential director that has ever lived telling a story about the uncovering of the Pentagon papers. On top of that you have the greatest actress ever lived up until now in Meryl Streep and one of the finest actors ever Tom Hanks. The stakes and anticipation for this film should be at a good level and even high?? However dare I say it has Steven Spielberg lost his touch at bit these days?????Now maybe this is my own problem but when you have talent involved in a project such as this one did your expectations for the film are to a high standard, unfortunately for some reason it was a little disappointing. Now don't get me wrong I still think this film is good, there is a lot to like in the film. However everyone involved in this film definitely could have made a better product or are we as the audience over hyping these individuals power and allure. Just like with Bridge of Spies, Spielberg has given us a film that has a huge amount of potential to be a classic, but somehow has fallen short again. The main problem I see with both Bridge of Spies and The Post is the pacing of the films, which is very slow and uneventful. Its only until the third act of the film does, The Post, start to get interesting and enjoyable to watch. It feels as if the other two acts of the film are there just as filler to carry us along until the explosive and powerful final act. I just think this film needs a better introduction to the characters and their own individual back stories. Also a look into the running of the Washington Post would have been nice to set the tone before and after the release of the papers, to show a contrast. Thats it for the complaining.I don't think we really need to mention Spielberg's directing do we? It never has been bad and is always good! Its just his story that needs some altering!For me personally there is one standout in the cast and no it is not Streep, although I did think she was fine in the role but nothing amazing to note of, no the standout is Tom Hanks. He brings a sort of familiarity and charm to the character as if he is a member of your own family in a weird way, but also a fierce determination to do the right thing. One of the best performances i think he has done in some time and is definitely the best thing about the film. It should be noted also that all the other supporting cast members, I'm not gonna list them there is to many of them, are all really strong in there roles and there are no weak points!Overall this film is good 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, however I think from now on I'm going bring my expectations down for Steven Spielberg, ahhhh I know I said it! Tom Hanks is the standout for me with a really strong powerful performance. Unfortunately this film is extremely relevant today in America with the comparisons between Nixon and Trump and their dealings with the Press. Also it should be noted at the end there is a fantastic tease that will make want to watch ""All the Presidents Men"" straight away!!"
THE POST,4 December 2019,6/10,Tired of the republican bashing with nothing ever made about the left but i can still watch good movies this isn't one of them its just to slow and Streep is to boring and ugly to watch anymore.Do something original Hollywood maybe a movie about how Russia sent communist to the U.S.A to change its course
THE POST,21 January 2018,8/10,"Great acting by all, including some surprising faces I didn't realize were in the movie until I saw them! I actually noticed the wonderful cinematography and score, which was pretty cool! The costumes, props and scenery were perfect to set the scene for the time period and I loved seeing (and learning about!) the historical references! Interesting, entertaining and I enjoyed it more than I expected to!"
THE POST,25 January 2018,7/10,"Is it cliché to call this movie an Oscar cliché? Even if the answer is yes, that's The Post, in a nutshell. It hits all the right beats. Serious historical drama (it covers a newspaper contemplating printing government lies about the Vietnam War), mega-famous director (Spielberg), and beloved, award-winning stars (Streep and Hanks). To top it all off, this movie is timely. A movie about newspaper courage at a time when our nation's free press is under attack, it's almost too perfect. 
 
Delicately arrange all these ingredients nicely on a fancy dish, and we should have a five-star meal. But we do not. Instead, the result is something that is just fine. It's a lower-middle class version of Spotlight. That likely reads harsher than I intend it. Spotlight is incredible. Mentioning any movie in the same breath is an honor. The Post is a perfectly adequate, important movie, not a Best Picture winner. There's no shame in that.There's very little blatantly wrong with the movie. Grading via a high school-style rubric would result in an A for following all the instructions and including all the required criteria. Yet, it does not quite reach the level of ""WOW."" Figuring out why it doesn't ""WOW"" is tricky. Maybe shooting and editing a movie that quickly (reportedly completed in only a few months) is too tall a task even for a master like Spielberg. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep play the leading roles and do so fantastically. Streep is especially strong in capturing the hesitancy of a woman in charge who doesn't act like she's in charge. This is the other element that's important for 2018. Women can lead effectively and bravely. She slowly learns that she is fully capable of seizing control and making the tough decisions, just like any successful leader. The supporting actors all likewise play their roles well, without exception. Everyone feels a bit underutilized, which I suppose they understood when they accepted the parts. The inclusion of so many famous faces could be viewed as a statement emphasizing the importance of the film. While I mentioned that there is very little blatantly wrong with the movie, I did personally find certain parts troublesome. Specifically, I call attention to the beginning and ending. Without spoiling anything, they felt oddly out of place, or at the very least, they felt unnecessary. Perhaps Spielberg included them to make clearer the message of the movie. He wanted to establish the stakes. I didn't think we needed that. Movie viewers are smart enough to understand what makes this movie important. Thankfully, the movie avoided becoming overly preachy, aside from a couple sigh-worthy instances. If you're down for a textbook ""important history lesson"" movie, The Post is for you. Just don't expect to leave the theater in stunned silence, like you did after seeing Spotlight."
THE POST,20 April 2021,7/10,No great shakes here if I am going to be honest. An interesting story performed by genius cast. Streep and Hanks and Spielberg amazing as always. A decent watch.
THE POST,1 October 2018,8/10,"So I saw The Post in theaters last night. The movie has a very powerful goal of emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment and the role of the fourth estate. The movie also hammers in important themes regarding abuse of power and shifting gender roles. I loved the message the movie portrayed even if it was a bit heavy-handed. It is a particularly relevant film for our current socio-political environment. Yet I can't help but feel this is the weakest Oscar contender.Acting wise the movie is packed to the brim with talent. There really wasn't a bad role in the film. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep were solid as expected, but I don't think either performance were standouts. There is nothing about Meryl Streep's performance that seemed to deserve a Oscar nomination.The movie itself was well made, but seemed to have a pacing problem. I think Spielberg wanted to hone in on his message so badly that he dropped some much-needed character development from the film. There was never really a moment in the film were you felt any excitement or Intrigue regarding the plot developments.I can't help but compare this movie to Spotlight and All The Presidents Men, both superior films in every way.Again this wasn't a bad movie. I did enjoy it, but felt ultimately it was forgettable. I admired the message being told, but the execution left something to be desired for. Every year there's a movie that I feel isn't quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. It seems The Post has been nominated more for its message than its content. 8 out of 10."
THE POST,26 July 2020,7/10,"'Solid and important' makes this sound duller than it is. It's quite a departure though for Spielberg, who by nature is a teller of epic or magical tales, and although he reins in his usual style he does muff it a little bit. There's a quite unnecessary longueur of about 10 minutes, for example, where the characters navel-gaze about how difficult Meryl Streep's over-privileged life has been. All we need to be impressed at a woman doing what she does - if that's the aim of the game - is to see her doing it. And probably there's not enough detail about the actual contents of the revelations, and the fallout from them.Spielberg has never seemed to be a political animal, and - apart from a vaguely 1960s anti-establishment stance - maybe he doesn't care much about those things: what he cares about is the people, and their world of old-fashioned (if not imaginary) dedicated, public-service print journalism. Actually, what he seems most fixated on - and admittedly it is interesting - is the actual physical process of setting the print."
THE POST,18 March 2018,8/10,"You know you're a good director when a good film is seen as a disappointment. This can also mean that a director has made a film or string of films that are so highly regarded that everything they do next will be compared to it. This is the case right now for Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest American director of all time. He's made so many great films, Schindler's List and Jaws, that his good ones, The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, are undeservedly seen as lesser. Case in point, The Post, a by the numbers award luring film that is packed with about a metric ton of prestige talent within every department. The film tells the story of the Washington Post's role in the releasing of the Pentagon Papers. Spielberg focuses on two key figures, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) and Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), and how they played an important part in breaking the news. We see some good old fashioned journalism as Ben and his team follow leads, track down sources, and post stories at a rapid and stressful pace. Kay, on the other hand, is trying to keep the business afloat through financial management, all while being doubted on by her all-male board. Soon a decision must be made over the Pentagon Papers. Should they be published, which would risk breaking the law and losing the company, or should they be left for somebody else to deal with them, which could also ruin the company as it misses out on publicity.Since this is a true story, most of you will know how it ends. Spielberg gets down to the ground to tell this story. He follows individual journalists, specifically Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) on their hunt to track down and report on America's involvement in Vietnam. It's great to watch as each character feels important. Spielberg has also made a very timely film that parallels what is happening with our current presidency. Spielberg rushed to make the film, saying ""The level of urgency to make the movie was because of the current climate of this administration, bombarding the press and labeling the truth as fake if it suited them."" There's definitely themes of freedom of speech and the role of the press here. While Spielberg has made a timely film, he also made a film that overplays its timeliness. The message about the press and freedom of speech is overplayed and detracts from the enjoyment of the film near the end. There isn't really a balance as we are constantly reminded of how important this was for American history.Continuing his forty-year partnership with Spielberg, John Williams composes for the film. Williams gives the film a smooth feel with inspirational music. His music perfectly fills the scene when dialogue is absent, allowing for the film to not be trapped into doing only one thing. When you see Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks as the two leads, you know it's going to be a fantastically acted film. That is especially true here as Streep and Hanks do an outstanding job of portraying their real-life characters. Streep brings the authenticity and power to her character as she goes on a journey from a woman in a sea of men to a woman taking command of her ship. Hanks gives a down and dirty portrayal of Ben Bradlee. He talks like he has a cigar in his mouth and has a no-nonsense attitude about him. The supporting cast comprises of Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Matthew Rhys, along with many other notables. They each do well at sharing the spotlight in their smaller roles. They all feel like a real news team, bouncing off each other at a rapid pace and building each other up as the plot progresses. I fear that The Post is going to be lost in the near future, mostly because everyone involved has done greater things. My fears will probably be realized since I'll most likely forget about it a time goes by. But when you're Spielberg, Streep, or Hanks, your good material just doesn't compare to everything else you have done."

THE POST,16 May 2018,8/10,What does press use do? How should the politician be a journalist relationship? I would love to recommend the film very much.
THE POST,14 January 2018,9/10,"This is a great movie to watch. Steven Spielberg offers a tight and highly satisfying account of the Pentagon Papers from the point of view of the Post and its publisher, Kay Graham. It is an evenhanded snapshot of the fractious relationship between a deceitful government and committed journalists. It's the first time Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep have appeared together, and you won't find a better match than these two great pros, who are complementing and not competing with, each other. This movie made me also sad because the result is such a nostalgic, romantic view of the newspaper business that it makes you wonder where the love for newspapers has gone all these years later."
THE POST,19 April 2018,8/10,"The really scary stuff from this film isn't the story that was exposed, it's the fact of how cosy, influenced even biased some media proprietors are with leading politicians.Most serious stories break in newspapers if they think a rival may scoop it first. But now it's all changed, the papers can still be gagged by court order. So everyone goes to the net, whose this personality been doing such a thing with another couple. What are these papers concerning intelligence reports about Iraq. This of course brings problems not only to government but the governed, is it true or someone's propaganda.. Enjoy the film and remember McNamara was a bean counter in limited war. In a real war led by and fought by US army, navy and air force we'd not be discussing this anyway."
THE POST,3 February 2018,8/10,"Steven Spielberg is an accomplished master at taking a broad historical event (in this case, the Pentagon Papers whose release in 1971 revealed the lies and secrecy about the Vietnam War that the US government inflicted on the public) and putting it on screen in concentrated form through the experiences of just a few key people. Take something big and make it personal. The second, parallel, storyline is the way the Washington Post essentially used their coverage of the Papers to catapult itself from a local family paper into the front rank of newspapers in the country, a position it's had ever since.I'll say right up front that I love Spielberg's linear, patient storytelling. No frenetic jump cuts, self-consciously 'innovative' camerawork, rapid mumbled dialog. His actors speak clearly, the scenes unfold without rush and without waste, all in the service of the storyline. I liked this in Bridge of Spies, I liked it in Lincoln, and I like it here.Tom Hanks plays editor Ben Bradlee, and Meryl Streep the owner and publisher Kay Graham, and of course they're predictably excellent. It's got a great cast of supporting players though too; for me, Bruce Greenwood was a standout (as he always is) as Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara, who commissioned the report and was good friends with Graham in the ingrown high society within Washington. Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk,Matthew Rhys (as the journalist Daniel Ellsberg, who covertly got the Papers to the Post and the New York Times), and Bradley Whitford -- all good. And the ambience of the '70's is so convincingly put on screen that you can just slip right into it. When the ""media"" consisted of just print newspapers and journals, a few broadcast TV channels, and (!) black telephones on your desks, it was a great deal easier to hold big secrets and a great deal harder to uncover them.Meryl Streep is a top actress for sure, but in most of her roles I can't avoid getting the sense that I'm *watching* someone consciously acting, no matter how thoroughly she puts herself into the part. Somehow the machinery is showing. But this time, I was convinced. She's Kay Graham inside out, and that's all there is to it. You see her gradually growing in confidence and command in her professional role at the Post while still holding on to her other life as a kindly Washington socialite, mother, and grandmother. Oddly, the protean Tom Hanks didn't seem quite as convincing as Bradlee -- he's fine, but doesn't seem to suit the role as well as Jason Robards did in All the President's Men (1976).The film closes with a cute scene between Graham and Bradlee while walking through the print room; she says ""I don't think I could do this again"" lightheartedly, after which the scene cuts to the Watergate Hotel where the DNC is being robbed. The Pentagon Papers story was big, but Watergate was bigger and ended up bringing down Nixon's presidency. Those were responsible for a huge transformation in American society from a trusting, positive outlook on life into its now-permanent posture of suspicion, doubt, and conspiracy. Look where it's led us.The Post would be a great double bill for an evening's entertainment when coupled with All the President's Men -- a new classic right next to an old one."
THE POST,31 December 2017,6/10,"Much to my surprise, I found Spielberg's account of the Washington Post's constitutional battle with the Nixon Administration over the Post's audacious and impulsive decision to publish the leaked Pentagon Papers in 1971 to be mildly prosaic and detached. It definitely lacks the raw drama it was obviously angling for and key scenes came across as tentative and sloppy.Despite an impactful, committed performance by Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post who helped crush gender barriers in journalism and a lively turn by Tom Hanks as the brash and swaggering Ben Bradlee, editor of the Post, this film suffers from a lack of depth and a surprisingly scattershot approach to the story by Spielberg. A viewer would be forgiven for coming away with a flawed understanding of the Pentagon Papers because the film is more about how the Washington Post came into national prominence by defying the White House in publishing documents the government claimed as top secret and vital to U.S. military success in Vietnam.Some might argue that this film should be watched and evaluated more deliberately but when Spielberg himself rushed through the material and the filmmaking process, it's harder to claim that the viewer has missed something. With this much proven talent on both sides of the camera, haste makes waste. Not recommended."
THE POST,16 October 2018,9/10,The Post is about The Washington Post using a source that is illegal to show the truth about the U.S. The U.S doesn't like though so they go through many problems.This movie was great. The acting was really well done. Tom Hanks did a great job. In all of his movies he seems like a whole different person. Maryl Streep did a great job too. She was a nice gentle person in this movie. The writing made the story seem the same as it was in the seventies. The props in this movie were outstanding. They looked like they were all real printers. The scene in the printing area looked so real. The Post was a great true story. Probably one of the best.
THE POST,22 December 2017,7/10,"Spielberg's new drama about the controversial publication of the Pentagon Papers by the Washington Post and New York Times is a well-made and entertaining, albeit not perfect, film. Tom Hanks gives a thorough and enjoyable performance as Ben Bradlee, but it is Meryl Streep who truly stands out in the cast here through her role as Kay Graham. Bob Odenkirk's supporting role is also noteworthy in a very positive sense.The film is thoroughly gripping, although it sometimes feels paced slightly clumsily through omissions of details that could have been better to include as Spielberg presents the audience with the turbulent politics of the Vietnam era that lead to the intense legal and ideological controversies surrounding the Pentagon Papers. Additionally, a rushed--albeit still very enjoyable--third act makes the viewer feel that the film's running time is a bit too short. The film is an enjoyable watch in a way that other journalism films like ""All The President's Men"" and ""Spotlight""--while better films overall for sure--are not, but its tone is handled well throughout. If Spielberg's dramas have taught me one thing, it's that he clearly knows how to let a specific tone manifest itself throughout the course of a narrative and do that well. The film contains a few moments that feel a bit 'meh' (a very clichéd rather than powerful discussion of the importance of freedom of the press in the second half is one.) While it has neither the high emotional stakes and dramatic tension of ""Bridge of Spies"" or the clockwork precision of ""Lincoln,"" it is still a very well-acted and entertaining film that I do recommend. 7/10"
THE POST,15 February 2018,7/10,"The Post is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. I honestly didn't hear this film up until October. The trailer for this film intrigued me and I decided that I must give it a watch when available. After having watched the film, I can say that this is a decent film if not great or excellent.Plot: Chronicles the publishing of The Pentagon Papers in the Washington Post newspaper in the early 70s.Story and direction: Spielberg actually put this film into production while working on the film Ready Player One, due this March. He has been successful with his experimentation back in 93 when he handled productions of Schindler's List and Jurassic Park. Never during the whole runtime of this film the film felt rushed. But I do feel the writing was OK. The first half hour or so if this film didn't get me invested. But after that the film catches up and kept my interest going on. A film came back in 2015 called Spotlight which was somewhat of the same genre. So I kept going back to Spotlight for comparisons unintentionally which I consider a much superior film than The Post. Also some of the characterization for this film feels left off especially Kay Graham's character. On the technical front, John Williams produces a fantastic score as always. And it felt like we are living in the 70's era.Performances: Meryl Streep was good with what she was given but she can do better. Tom Hanks was awesome. he seemed to be the captain of this ship. Bob Odenkirk was also great. Bruce Greenwood excelled in his performance. Matthew Rhys delivered an earnest performance too. Sarah Paulson, carrie Coon and Alliosn Brie were great additions to the cast.I would say that I couldn't pinpoint on a particular scene and say that this was the scene of the film.Verdict: Spielberg has definitely given better films than this. But I would say that you can give this film a watch. You will not feel your time to be watsed.I am going with a 7.5/10."
THE POST,14 January 2018,1/10,"Wow, who knew you could magnify such banal events into an Earth shattering triumph of timely cinematic achievement. For a story that could have been boiled down to 10 minutes, Spielberg sure managed to stretch out those little insignificant moments between characters to the point that you'd swear they were constantly on the verge of inter-dimensional travel.Let me see if I got this right: Stolen classified government documents were spirited away and given to the Washington Post who planned on publishing them. Protracted legal battling and repeated noblesque cries of ""freedom-of-the press"" ensues. OK...I agree the Vietnam war was bogus and sure, it's a lovely idea that government would be transparent. And certainly, people should just be able to steal classified government documents any time they want and publish the contents. But what the children of America don't seem to understand is, the masses are better off not knowing certain things. As for the Washington Post... wow, what happened?!?!?!"
THE POST,18 April 2020,8/10,Spielberg's directorial starring Meryl Streep & Tom Hanks. I guess its enough to convince you to watch this historical drama. The movie has two plots at one side Katharine Graham played by Streep is struggling to run Washington post following the deaths of her husband and father due to her lack of experience but still she's trying her best also she's preparing for the public listing of the publication to gather sufficient funds. On the other hand there are some classified documents leaked from Pentagon having truths that how White House deceived the Masses about Vietnam War. The Editor Ben Bradlee played by Hanks constant push to release those documents via Washington post but it is not that easy to publish something against the state also with the classified information and that's where the real Drama starts how Katharine got convinced taking the bold step and how the legal battle has been fought emphasizing on the First Amendment is all the you have to watch for.

Steven Spielberg encapsulates all of this wonderfully in a riveting drama that had me on the edge of my seat..."
THE POST,16 July 2019,9/10,"The acting is superb, the movie is well directed, the photography is outstanding, and the story well told. The only reason I don't give the movie the highest rating is because of the profane and vulgar language which contributed nothing to the movie and was superfluous and inserted only for the purpose of avoiding a G rating.Personally speaking, Daniel Ellsburg was a traitor. Ironically, my wife and he were both working for Rand at the same time. I do not believe that the publication of the Pentagon papers at that time contributed in anyway to the ending of the war which was already in progress. If anything, it may have slowed the ending but indeed it made it much more dangerous for our military then in Vietnam.I strongly agree that once the Americans were out of the war, publication of the Pentagon papers was in order. And I don't disagree with the decision of the Post publishing the papers once another news source began publication.As a note based on my own experience, the US should never entered the Vietnam War the way it did because it was doomed to failure. When my battalion was pulled out of Korea in 1953 and put on ships headed for Viet Nam but then returned to Korea a week later, I began to suspect that Viet Nam and not Europe sooner or later would be our next battleground and I began to closely follow events there.By 1955, the Communist (Viet Cong) were engaged in guerilla warfare in South Viet Nam and I saw this as the next threat that would involve the US, particularly because the South Vietnamese Army was but a shell. So I began studying up guerrilla warfare tactics, particularly the success of the British in defeating the guerrillas in Malaysia, and how the Philippine and American Army succeed against the HUK guerrillas in the Philippines. I began working on developing tactics to defeat guerrillas. Because of my interest and because I spoke French, I was sent to South Viet Nam as a military adviser in 1957.Based on what I observed there, it was clear that the South Vietnamese Army was at least 10 years away from being ready to fight even a guerrilla war, much less an invasion by a battle tested and well trained North Vietnamese Army. Moreover, I also observed that the Viet Cong were being supplied by the North Vietnamese. This was important because one reason that my units were able to defeat North Korean guerrillas was because they were isolated from any resupply or assistance from the North.Thus, I concluded that the only way to defeat the Viet Cong was to completely isolate South Viet Nam from the North. To do that meant putting more than a million ground troops and establishing a fortified line along the border between the two countries from the sea and across the Mekong River in Laos and it would be necessary for at least ten years until the Viet Cong was wiped out and the South Vietnamese Army fully combat ready, something it never achieved.In 1962, I wrote a detailed report setting forth my recommendations, particularly that unless the U.S. and its allies were committed to this plan, the U.S. should stay out of Viet Nam. I submitted my report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Unfortunately, the U.S. government was committed to a policy of containment which began with Pres. Truman and followed by subsequent Presidents. I don't criticize the policy and to a certain extent, the fall of South Vietnam led to the communist takeover of Laos and Cambodia, but these nations had always been in the Vietnamese sphere of influence. Fortunately, the domino effect stopped there and had no impact on Thailand or Malaysia which the American government had feared would happen if South Vietnam fell.The irony is that in the end I was right - that the U.S. could not win without a full commitment to defeating the North Viet Nam. It had to be all out war or no war at all. The war was instead fought piece-meal and in the wrong way. So I feel badly for all my comrades who were thrown into that mess."
THE POST,22 December 2017,10/10,"""The Post"" arrives to remind us about the indispensable role of the press in a democracy, ours in this particular case. An historical fact that comes to illustrate the dangerous times we're living now. The story of The Pentagon Papers is not ancient history and yet people seem to have forgotten. Americans in their 20's don't know about it as they didn't know about the House Of UnAmerican Activities. Education is at the center of our future so thank you Steven Spielberg for contributing to the awakening. In ""The Post"" the economy of the retelling is part of its brilliance. Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee is not Jason Robards but a Hanks, profoundly human, version of the man and Meryl Streep - Oh Meryl Streep ! - gives life to a woman who was not used to be the center of attention. A daughter a wife never in charge. Her dilemma is the sort of dilemma that, artists, teachers, parents, often confront. Her process to arrive to her decision is immensely moving and real. One of the miracles that Meryl Streep manages to perform again and again is that one forgets that it is her a second after she appears on the screen. I know this is a film I see again and show to youngsters at every possible opportunity. Thank you for that."
THE POST,27 January 2018,10/10,"Steven Spielberg comes out firing on all cylinders with this epic film about The Pentagon Papers, the first domino that ended up exposing the U.S. Military brass' real views on the Vietnam War, and ends with the events that eventually brought down President Richard Nixon.The film starts off following Daniel Ellsberg (Played by Matthew Rhys) in Vietnam just before a mission. The mission goes south and many U.S. troops are slaughtered. We next find Ellsberg on a plane, where he is summoned by Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) to get an understanding on if Vietnam is a winnable war. Ellsberg gives his report, and McNamara and others argue while conceding that Vietnam is a lost cause. As Ellsberg leaves the plane, he hears McNamara do a 180 as he tries to sell the war to the American public. Taking things into his own hands, Ellsberg later copies top secret documents, showing the war to be a lost cause. These papers of course, go on to be the infamous Pentagon Papers. For the record, the actual Pentagon papers we learn we stored at the think tank The Rand Corp. This is from where Ellsberg copies the files.The story shifts to Kay Graham, played by Meryl Streep, in perhaps one of her greatest performances) and the editor of the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks, who almost plays the role better than Jason Robards did in the classic All The Presidents Men. Many in Kay's circle feels that she doesn't have the make up to be able to run the paper, and they remind her many times that the only reason she was in charge was because her husband took his own life, thus leaving the paper to her. Hanks' Bradlee wants a story that is going to help the post, tired of the paper covering trivial events, like weddings. The New York Times is the first to break the story, but President Nixon is able to get an injunction to prevent the paper from publishing the documents. A legal battle ensues, one that entangles the Washington Post. When it is determined that the injunction against the New York Times could include the post if the source is the same, Bradlee cast fate to the wind and opts to publish. Graham, who though out the film is depicted as being unsure of herself, finally shows an iron cast will, and tells Bradlee to publish the documents. A second legal battle takes place, this time reaching the Supreme Court. A fight the Post wins. They publish the papers, tide turns against the war, and the rest is history/The film includes actual audio from the infamous Nixon tapes, giving the film a more realistic feel. The acting is top notch, and the film itself never seems to have lagging points. This film is a true must see and should take home a few Oscars when that time comes around. The film makes you feel like you've taken a trip back in time, and you're witnessing the events first hand. And perhaps the greatest impact of the film comes at the end, when it finishes strong with the Watergate break, almost connecting itself to the film All The President's Men.This film really is a must see, especially given the current state of affairs. A true 10 out of 10."
THE POST,7 August 2019,8/10,"If there are certainties in life they could be that Maryl Streep and Tom Hanks can act and Steven Spielberg is technically impeccable and this movie proves them again. But 'The Post' doesn't rely only on its big players but also on the story narrated and the themes touched. The narration is very slow at the beginning with a lot of names and informations thrown to the viewers but in the second part it picks it up thanks to an increased rhythm and some critical chioces the characters are put in front of. And mostly in this second part are explored some themes like the freedom of speech and publication and also the female equity in a men-driven society.
Like I said Streep, Hanks and Spielberg were fantastic but all the cast in general gave some great performances and the same quality can be found in the technical department (music, photography, design are all on point).
'The Post' is a simple but interesting movie, which has its limitations like the very slow first part, but it is defenetly one to watch."
THE POST,10 January 2018,2/10,"Very sub-par Speilberg. In an obvious attempt to bash Trump vis-a vis the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, this propaganda piece plays like 'The Lou Grant Show' meets 'Spotlight'. Hanks fails to bring any life to his character, and Streep plays the now trendy 'empowered'woman who owns the paper. Since most of America , except for millennials knows the story, there are no surprises here. While the film does make a case for freedom of the press, massive liberties and too many fictional characters sidetrack it to practically an afterthought. The film does manage to capture the look of the early 70s with period accurate cars and clothing, but maybe this distraction will not hide the fact that this is just an average movie that plays more like a made for TV film of the '70s. See it if you will,but don't expect too much. Amazing how Speilberg, the man who once made 'real'movies like 'Jaws', 'Close Encounters', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark',and *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' can slip into mediocrity with a film like this. A money grab and Oscar bait rolled into one. Another PU movie review from Lou."
THE POST,6 March 2018,8/10,The Post - A Steven Spielberg film based on American Political Historical Thriller Drama. The freedom of the press versus Government secrecy. Always inspiring with Steven Spielberg films because he is doing something that other filmmakers are scared to reveal to the public. Meryl Streep as Katherine Graham (Publisher) & Tom Hanks as Ben Bradley (Editor) are fighting for the freedom of the press to leak the government conspiracy.
THE POST,7 July 2021,1/10,Maybe once it was a solid newspaper. Now it isn't worth the paper it is printed on.Just a piece of dreck!
THE POST,10 March 2018,8/10,"Spielberg seems to never get tired and continues to produce films at an impressive speed, so much so that we saw him in 2016 with his first failure, at least financially, ""The BFG"", a film that I personally liked; in 2017 with this ""The Post"", with which, as you already know, he was competing for this year's Oscars; and in 2018 immediately returns with ""Player One"", the film that I await with more curiosity and hope of this year.
So after a small misstep then seems to have wanted to defend himself with a film ""simpler"", in some ways, to be realized, ti then return again with something new and never seen before.
This change from one genre to another (from fantasy for families, to the Oscar biographer, to the sci-fi Blockbuster) demonstrates once again its great versatility that has allowed him to realize several cult films, successful films at the box office, the invention of Blockbusters and timeless masterpieces.
And if there is something that is always good for him is to be a pimp with the Academy, through films obviously born to be considered by them, mainly if they take a political position, even if not very veiled, they could also be defined film of denunciation, which is political or social. And this is the case with ""The Post"".
A very classic, almost canonical film, apparently, because of its themes already seen countless times on screen and on which it is based in an extremely, and rightly, convinced way; which, however, amazes for its sincerity and for its genuineness and good faith.
As some have defined it, ""The Post"" is a great and passionate love letter to journalism and journalists, a very well-crafted and developed letter, through which Spielberg decides to remember how certain rights and principles are fundamental and should be protected.
In doing so, here too, he does not worry about taking a position on the various topics covered in the film, but rather, after seeing it, he uses it and his thinking is very clear to me. This decision, of course, has two opposing sides: in the first one can not but consider courageous, even if it is a film not very ""dangerous"" but very important, it is almost a warning, or rather, a ""make sure you"" to the current US President; in the second I have to say that in the film it leaves little space for an idea or perspective different from his own.
In any case, the film works, certainly thanks to Steven Spielberg, who seems to have enjoyed a lot with the camera making unusual long shots and really extraordinary and with a strong visual impact close-ups. But also thanks to the effective, direct and mature script that exploits the skill of Josh Singer, Oscar-winning screenwriter for ""Spotlight"" (there are indeed some similarities between the two even if the latter is much higher), to offer intelligent dialogues and important phrases.
But there are also two or three really mediocre scenes and moreover avoidable, and if you have seen the film I think you know what I mean, it still amazes me how their presence is possible after the post-production.
What penalizes the film a little more is the fluctuating and initially uncertain rhythm that does not allow the viewer to be totally involved in the film, especially in the first minutes.
The two protagonists, two sacred monsters of the cinema, or Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, for the first time together. A couple that works, between the two there is a strong, persistent and gratifying chemistry.
Both interpretations turn out to be truly remarkable and therefore in the standards of the two actors who never cease to provide viewers with characters of which, thanks to them, they will hardly forget.
In addition, John Williams accompanies it with another of his great soundtracks."
THE POST,3 March 2018,8/10,"I wouldn't count Steven Spielberg as one of my favorite directors. My taste has always leaned towards the bolder, provocative, and more challenging filmmakers and Spielberg just isn't one of them. There's no denying, however, that he is a master of his craft and most definitely deserves his reputation as one of the best. The Post is yet another convincing argument for his talents. His direction here is fluid, commanding, energic, and muscular. It always serves the story, never calling attention to itself or becoming overly showy. His camera is dynamic and constantly in motion, giving a sense of vitality to what could otherwise be mundane dialogue sequences, and he thoughtfully blocks his scenes to further that sense of movement. He also has a great feel for the peaks and valleys of a film, expertly sequencing the scenes to bring out the dynamics of the story. You feel the tension and the weight of the pivotal scenes in this film all because of how well Spielberg conducts this symphony. And furthermore, the movie is quite timely and tells a true story of great relevance in our current political climate. I have to add as well that Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance and plays a character with considerable depth and an emotionally satisfying arc. As for criticisms, it takes a bit of time to really get going and can be a bit hard to follow before you understand who all the characters are in relation to one another. Do I think this is a film I'll be watching for years to come? Probably not. But it is no less an excellent, accomplished, and topical film that I very much enjoyed and would solidly recommend.4/5"
THE POST,23 January 2018,7/10,"I really wanted to love this movie. It has everything I like-a story about important principles, two impeccable stars and a terrific supporting cast, a newsroom setting. Director Steven Spielberg had much so much good stuff to work with-including a decent script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer-why wasn't it better?
One of the team's great decisions is to present Katherine Graham (played by Meryl Streep) not as a hard-nosed, successful businesswoman, but one growing into a not-always-comfortable role as publisher of the Washington Post (a position first held by her father, then her late husband). In 1971, when Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) steals the Pentagon Papers, thousands of pages of documents that recount the government's decades of deception about the Vietnam War, Graham faces a fateful choice of tremendous consequence: will the Post will publish stories based on these top secret documents?
On one hand, the paper's editor, Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), and the newsroom staff are pushing to publish. For them, it's a ""freedom of the press"" issue, a riveting story, and they're racing the clock to get in the game. 
On the other hand, her business advisors (notably, Tracy Letts as Fritz Beebe and Bradley Whitford as Arthur Parsons) and the Nixon Administration oppose publication, which is risky on several counts. First is legal jeopardy: already the Justice Department has taken the rival New York Times to court on the matter. Barring the Times from publishing more, at least temporarily, opens the door for the Post. Then there's financial jeopardy: the bankers who backed the Post's recent stock offering are threatening to pull out if the paper goes ahead.
Graham's personal relations further muddy the waters. She's been friends for years with people who the Pentagon Papers show participated in the war deception, notably former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). Is she respecting her family legacy by publishing or by holding back? In the end, of course, her decision sets the stage for the Post's becoming one of the nation's premier newspapers.
The newsroom Spielberg and the reporters create is an exciting place. As Bilge Ebiri said in the Village Voice, ""I started crying the first time I saw Tom Hanks's Ben Bradlee walk through a bustling, thriving newsroom . . . a whole world that's been lost."" It's also fun to see the newspaper produced the old-fashioned way: linotype machines and hot lead. Victory is in the air when the Post's trucks roll out of the printing plant in the early-morning mist.
So what's the problem? Why isn't this movie more satisfying? For me, it's because the central question-will she or won't she?-is one we already know the answer to. It's the scenes where we don't know the outcome, like the powerful one where Graham confronts her old friend McNamara, that are the most compelling. Given that, drawing out her dithering (despite how expertly Streep dithers) seems, finally, fake. For a contrast, consider the movie Spotlight. Again, we know the Globe reporters get the priest abuse story, but every interview had qualities of uncertainty about it. It was a puzzle painstakingly assembled in front of our eyes. 
I also could have done without the tepid and too-stagy anti-war demonstrations and the bevy of eager young women waiting for Graham as she leaves the U.S. Supreme Court building. The point about her pioneering in a male world had been already made, much more effectively. 
Nevertheless, in 2018, the story provides a vital reminder about the ongoing and urgent need for an unfettered news media to hold people in power to account."
THE POST,20 August 2018,3/10,"On the surface, this is supposed to be a movie about the good guys ( WaPo) against the bad guys (government). What is turns out to be is a reflection of the fact that the good guys are in bed with the bad guys. Ms. Graham is a great friend of McNamara. Ben loves JFK. They both facilitated their Dem friends throughout the Vietnam debacle. And, when push came to shove, they actually had to debate exposing government atrocity.Small wonder no believes in the press anymore. They have seen themselves as part of the government for decades, whichever party is in power. Pretty ironic that the heroes are actually the villains."
THE POST,21 February 2018,8/10,"The movie depicts the expose' of the cover-up of the Nixon government regarding the Vietnam War undertaken by previous administrations wherein they manipulated the public into supporting the waging of a war against Vietnam in the 60s. Streep plays Kay Graham, who has never worked a single day in her life and is suddenly tasked to run the Washington Post after her husband passed away, struggling to keep the family business intact while at the same time recognizing the need to go public in order for them to expand and make its mark in the newspaper industry. Hanks portrays Ben Bradlee, the paper's Executive Editor trying to wind his way through an unchartered territory: the publishing of classified government documents sanctioning illegal activities, under the tenet that it is of public interest what those in power are doing, sending off thousands of soldiers to war for the sole purpose of saving face. Upon seeing the newsroom, I remembered another movie with the same setting, 'Spotlight' which was about a Boston paper that reported of the child sexual abuse by catholic priests in an area deeply-rooted in the religion. Both movies were written by Josh Singer, the former now a best picture nominee while the latter won the award in the 88th Academy Awards. Another link between the two is the father and son Bradlees: Ben for The Washington Post and Ben Jr. supervised the expose' for the Boston Globe.Fast-paced, hard-hitting, and shows just the right amount of personal and professional conflict to make you question where your principles lie when forced to choose between survival and doing the right thing. Both movies made me appreciate the hard work and dedication by the editors and reporters who acts as a nation's watchdog against abusive people in power which is very relevant in today's media landscape especially with the proliferation of 'fake news' and influential bloggers that have limited understanding of what being objective and anti-propaganda is about. There is a need to underscore that before a news goes to print, leads are followed, facts are verified, sources are quoted, the article is proofread for accuracy and is within the limits set by law (if not it is being challenged for a good reason), sometimes there are threats to one's life or of loved ones included, seasoned editors decide if good enough to print and just then it is sent off for cascade. So no, not everyone can be a journalist and if you still think you can, I encourage you to watch both movies first. Favorite Quote: News is the first rough draft of history."

(I did warn you!) But by that, I mean it's all so painfully fake. I didn't lose myself for one moment in the narrative, or the moment, or feel like I am immersed into fiction. Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep... I feel like I've seen her doing this before, and she is so earnest in her delivery nothing feels natural. Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks, but oh he has a funny accent. That must mean he's acting. Multiple other actors are clearly made up to look different (hair pieces, greying etc.) as they are all acting. I bet they all got off the stage and applauded themselves, it felt it was bordering on self indulgent playtime for actors.What I'm trying to say is at no point did I buy into that I was watching the events of time gone by. It felt all very staged. All the events felt like they were delivered knowing the future and outcome. Music was bombastic to let you know the importance in case you didn't get it.No scene feels organic, it all feels like they have the script in their hand doing a rehearsal.It's all just very old school and as I was watching it I thought I bet this is an old school director as it's so old fashioned (I promise I didn't know it was Spielberg).It's an important story to tell, which is why I give it five... but in no way do I feel that it was compelling or any actor did anything memorable."

The Australian government has recently raided news organisations that exposed government failures.As much as I feel sorry for Americans and the state of their democracy. I admire their press freedom.It's difficult to make a story like this exciting, but Spielberg pulled it off.

THE POST,14 January 2018,10/10,"A quiet, subtle film about the starting of the Pentagon papers being discovered and the hopes by the government to keep them from being published and the newspapers fight to let the public know what had happened.
Martha Graham was a friend to many of the people in the government and also being in charge of the the Post after he husbands suicide - she had a lot to learn.
As the story unfolds she becomes her own person and more in charge of the paper with Ben Bradlee. 
A very real movie for 2017-2018 with the present president making attempts to only have the press praise him. Lessons to be learned still. The press is an important part of our lives.
The performances by the actors are good - subtle - and film tells the story."
THE POST,17 January 2018,8/10,"The Post is Steven Spielberg's latest movie and stars Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee and Meryl Streep as Kay Graham. This movie tells the coming of age story of how the Washington Post went from this small publishing station to one of the largest ones through exposing countless government secrets.This movie is based on real events in the 70s. As someone who was never around during the time of these events, I really enjoyed this movie. The pacing and story structure throughout the 2nd and 3rd acts were fantastic. Hanks and Streep gave phenomenal performances as leads. It is also pretty informative given the subject matter.This movie is very relevant to our current time due to the fact that it focuses on freedom of the press and the truth. As abundant as sources are in our present day, accusations of many sources are thrown around all over claiming that they're ""fake sources"" or ""fake news"". How does the government presented in this film react to news sources exposing the truth? They threaten to send them all to prison. In retaliation, The Washington Post obtains multiple files of government secrets and posts them in their newspaper, which grabs the attention of the public's eye and other news sources. With how the government is operating, it is likely that history would repeat itself, so this movie came out in a very timely manner.My biggest issue with the movie however is the first act. Even though the second and third acts are tense and thought provoking, the first act feels like it drags on for way too long. My main issue is that it dumps a lot of complicated exposition on the audience. As I said before I did not exist during the time period, so a lot of the exposition confused me. The exposition became too complex for me to comprehend and as a result, you would have to pay very close attention to it all if you want to understand the entirety of it.Despite my issues with the first act, The Post is still a great movie about the freedom of the press and the rise of The Washington Post.8/10"
THE POST,24 January 2021,7/10,"A bit tame. Been done before (All The Presidents Men) and with much more tension, drama and violence.
There was some drama, it's well-acted but the overall pace is weak. The film lacks punch too.
The ending is a little but cheesy but it's based on reality so it's hard to criticise. The Nixon sign off in the final frames is a very nice touch and a nod to ATPM.
Oh what a lovely war."
THE POST,24 January 2018,9/10,"Politics is one of the most intimidating, depressing subjects known to man..., I hate it, most people deep down hate it, add the media to the mix and you have the formula for an awfully boring and plagiarizing film, that's why I was so surprised that ""The Post"" was grossly entertaining and it certainly didn't follow that formula at all. Two of the generations greatest stars headed up the cast, heavyweights Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks lead the way under the watchful direction of the outstanding Steven Spielberg, you just knew that a film with that much clout wouldn't end up disappointing, and it definitely didn't. ""The Post"" chronicles the age long conspiracy concerning the Pentagon Papers, a conspiracy that spanned the reign of four presidents no less, leading up to the Washington Post newspaper publishing the documents and making them public, resulting in a supreme court win in favor of the media. There will be many feminists out there singing and dancing to Meryl Streep's, hard hitting, independent performance, yes she made her intentions quite obvious without the slightest bit of subtlety..., strong independent woman leading a huge newspaper corporation after her husbands untimely death, okay for all the feminists I'll stand up and applaud Meryl Streep, well done. As for Tom Hanks, the guy is a strong actor that can bring out the best in any character effortlessly, he doesn't need to try too hard, he just has natural charisma that shines through in his performance as Ben Bradlee, should've got an Oscar nomination for this but sadly he was snubbed. The final scene made me smile, like it was trying to set up a follow up film based on the Watergate scandal (American political shared universe anyone?)Don't let the premise of ""The Post"" put you off, it is a truly great film that will gradually get you more and more hooked the longer you watch, a very strange occurrence for a politically charged film, almost but not quite top marks."

The story of the Pentagon papers, Daniel Ellsberg, and the vile, corrupt, Nixon administration, is quite literally. an historic benchmark in American democracy. You would have to TRY to mess this up. And yet, this stew of Hollywood legends seemed to have made a serious attempt - at something. What?, I can't tell. Tom Hanks cannot have been serious as he growled through his lines like 30's cartoon mob villain. And Meryl Streep, well, she's been playing herself and getting rewarded for it for decades now. Her sputtering cadence of delivering one line three times lives on. It is weird that that doesn't bother people to the point where she's become unwatchable. The previews played before this snore-fest began announced that a ""Mama Mia"" prequel with Cher was coming. That'll be fresh...It is unfathomable how poorly this story is written, directed, and acted. The main principals, Spielberg, Streep, and Hanks, in the autumn of their careers, should have no ""f's"" to give and go balls out to make a statement to the world about something important - or just stay home. My three star rating for this epic fail is out of pity. For all of its inherent potential, this film is a zero."
THE POST,8 April 2018,7/10,"The Post centres round the true events from the 1971 Pentagon Papers scandal, a scandal later dwarfed by the Watergate Scandal that saw the eventual resignation of President Nixon.Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks this is 5th movie they have collaborated on, and the results are predictably a success. A political thriller the movie looks at the events that caused the scandal and how it unfolded, the viewer, in-turn, is taken on a journey that slowly builds upon the intrigue, suspense and thrills by carefully setting the scenes and developing the characters. The result is one what gives a gripping end.Meryl Streeps performance as Kay Graham is suitably played, a lady who found herself running the Washington Post after the suicide of her husband, and is eventually presented with a number of difficult decisions that may see the ruin of the company, and therefore for her children's future and late fathers & husbands legacy. Streep plays the role well and as the film progresses viewers will begin to see and feel the pressure Kay must have been under at that time. The result is a superb suspense that will keep viewers who don't know what happened guessing.With a star studded cast, true events and directed by Steven Spielberg, the The Post has many reasons why the discerning viewer should watch it. Spielberg once again attempts to bring his movie magic into the film, and towards the end of this movie this works, but it's a slow tedious build up to get there that leads to a degree of frustration that will undoubtedly put some viewers off. In truth, there is probably little that can be done to address this as to understand the end; you need to understand the cause which is a mildly confusing if you don't pay attention.The fact that this movie is based around the real events is what makes it thrilling. However, it will not be remembered as one of Stephen Spielbergs, Tom Hanks nor Meryl Streeps best work."
THE POST,9 February 2021,8/10,"Exceptional picture and world class directing, 2017's 'The Post' sees actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep take to the screen in a tense and nervy spectacle. Telling the story of two colleagues in the 20th century risking it all to reveal hidden truths about the Vietnam War. In 1966, during the Vietnam War, U.S. State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies American troops in combat, documenting military progress for Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the flight home, McNamara tells Ellsberg and William B. Macomber that the war is hopeless. Upon landing, however, he tells the congregated media that he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg, overhearing this abrupt turn-about, becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor/consultant working for the RAND corporation (a military/defence ""think tank""), Ellsberg photocopies hundreds of pages of classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in Vietnam, dating back to the Harry S. Truman presidential administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents first to The New York Times, through reporter Neil Sheehan. In that same year of 1971, newspaper heiress Katharine Graham tries to balance a busy social life with her responsibilities as owner and publisher for only eight years of The Washington Post, following the suicide of her husband and the death of her father. She nervously prepares for its stock-market launch, a move to help financially stabilise the paper. Graham lacks journalistic experience and is frequently overruled by her domineering financial advisers and editors, including editor-in-chief (executive editor) Ben Bradlee and board member Arthur Parsons. Meryl Streep's character - Katharine Graham - comes across as a minority in the boardroom despite her high profile within her work, this could be perhaps to the inferiority of women in the late 20th century but also emphasise her weakness in and outside of her job, suggesting she is unstable and ultimately struggling to cope with her emotions. McNamara, a long-time friend, warns Graham that an unflattering story featuring him will be published in The New York Times, another example of the Times' ability to get preemptive ""scoops"" while The Post languishes behind. The story is an exposé of the American government's long-running deception regarding America's position in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. However, a federal district court injunction halts the Times from publishing further articles on the subject. Post assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down Daniel Ellsberg, a former colleague, as the source for the leak. Ellsberg provides him copies of the same material given previously to the Times. Hand-picked Post reporters pore over mounds of pages, searching for additional headline stories. The Post's attorneys advise against publishing the material, lest the Nixon administration file criminal charges. Graham confers with McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted Post chairman Fritz Beebe, as she agonises about publishing. Bradlee (who is a close friend of John F. Kennedy) tells Graham that their politician friends (including JFK, as shown in the top-secret documents) abused their friendships by lying to them; her friendship with McNamara must not be a factor in a decision whether to publish. The situation intensifies when the Post's lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the Times's, possibly putting Graham in contempt of court and potentially destroying the newspaper and her family's ownership and legacy. Alternately, if the legal challenges are overcome in court, the Post could emerge as a significant journalistic institution and increase its reputation. Graham goes ahead and says ""let's do it"". The White House retaliates. The Post and Times jointly appear before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment constitutional rights. Meanwhile, other major newspapers start publishing on the secret war study in solidarity with the once isolated Post and Times. On June 30, 1971, the high Court's justices, in the case of New York Times Co. v. United States, rule 6-3 in the two newspapers' favour, vindicating Graham's decision to print. Shortly after, President Nixon demands that the Post be barred from the White House. The film ends with a sequence showing the discovery of the Watergate burglary, which led ultimately to the resignation of Nixon. Capturing perfectly the identity of 'The Washing Post', Spielberg alongside his fellow crew and respective actors create a film carefully and passionately, purposely leaving no stone unturned. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, boding well with the tense and uncertain atmosphere mingling with the inevitable breakthrough. The message overall is that risking it all for something you believe in is worth it, no matter how large that risk is. Slow at times, but, on the whole a strong screening."
THE POST,13 April 2019,9/10,"Strong believer in the freedoms we fought, fight and die for include the right to know what our government is doing. Denying access altogether by suspending White House press conferences somehow less manipulative than the calculated debasing of the hard working men and woman who investigate and then source the results with actual data and existing human beings. And who do not afford themselves the dishonesty with terms like 'alternative' for a constant facts. There's no alternative, only a convenient blurring of truth that prompted the concoction of such a ridiculous term. There's no room for nonsense at a time when reporting the truth about this administration could make all the difference in how quickly we recover as a country once Trump becomes a distant memory. We need courage in the press more than ever which happens be the film's message to me anyway. Ever since the 2016 Republican field of hopefuls debated hand size as a crucial issue, we knew that oversight by the remaining 2 branches of government would never be as important. Yet sadly we've watched a willful disregard in the form of silence from both the legislative and judicial branches whose oath to serve the public seems secondary to pleasing the chief whose oath to the Constitution seems secondary to pleasing Putin.
When those in power enact a wall of privacy as an entitlement of self-protection that tramples the right to the truth for every U.S. citizen they are sworn to protect and serve, then nothing short of heroes are those men and women who break down the wall and report the truth. This was true in the era of Nixon just as it is now."
THE POST,19 May 2018,7/10,"The Post (2017)
This is a historical, political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg. It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham, the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of The Washington Post. It also stars Sarah Paulson, Bob Odenkirk, Tracy Letts, Bradley Whitford, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Carrie Coon, and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles. Set in the early 1970s, The Post depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers, classified documents regarding the 30-year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War. The film grossed $174.5 million on a budget of $50 million. Critical reviews have given it universal acclaim. Audiences gave the film an average grade of A. This is a solid drama that may have just overwhelmed itself with talent. It would have likely faired better award season, if the script and direction could have been tightened up."

THE POST,19 July 2019,6/10,"Here's my review of the post. If you're wondering about the title then let me assure you that this isn't a literal post it's a story about the Washington 'post' newspaper . The movie is directed by Spielberg and from this he's working his way through making political movies like his last bridge of spies. The story is about a cat and mouse game between leading newspaper companies in the 60s and them releasing and withholding govt secrets about the Vietnam war. The characters in this movie were set up as the story went along and that made the phasing not drag down. There were no unwanted characters in this movie and everyone played their part right. Tom hanks was simply the best , he played a role similar to Jameson from spiderman 1 and Meryl Streep played something close to her miranda priesley role. It's a good movie but not really a popcorn flick . In the end I had fun ,it was a solid movie with great characters , an interesting plotline and a roast at the White House. If you have nothing to do and if you're a fan of Spielberg , then go watch it . Or you can just wait for it to come on Netflix or Hulu."
THE POST,29 September 2018,9/10,"This story is based on a real event, and has a slow start, leading to the centre point, the right to publish or not, US secrets academic intelligence of the futile war in Vietnam, which continued across three presidents. It was known in the higher echelons of power that the war could not be won by the US, but to the Arms industry, war was apparently profitable, more profitable than young Americans' lives. The film demonstrates that the role of the President as a dictator is ultimately flawed, and questions the legitimacy of the highest office towards corruption."
THE POST,30 December 2017,7/10,"The Pentagon Papers saga is a story worth telling. Unfortunately, it gets sidelined here so the film can heap (well-deserved) praise on The Washington Post. There is no question that the Pentagon Papers and the legally-stymied New York Times rescued the Post from parochial doldrums and vaulted it to national significance. And changing the title from ""The Papers"" to ""The Post"" reveals that the filmmakers' intent was primarily to tell the story of the newspaper and less the significance of the cover-up that spawned it. Because of that, however, we really never quite understand the over-riding importance of the clandestine operation The Post was describing. Without it, ""The Post"" is just a well-told story of how another liberal news outlet upheld the First Amendment. There's been no shortage of those.Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks dominate the film... well, the first half at least. Then slowly their own personae crept in. When Streep as Katherine Graham was the uncertain, conflicted socialite publisher, still in the shadow of her long-dead father and more recently deceased husband, she inhabited the role. We looked past Streep and believed in her. But as she slowly gained her confidence, she kept losing her identity, and the strong Meryl Streep came through. Likewise. Hanks as editor Ben Bradlee started out uncharacteristically conflicted as the man who stridently sees his mission, yet still must answer to a woman he clearly at once respects and still resents. As the film wears on, however, Bradlee's position becomes more desperate and even more manipulative; it was the familiar everyman-strongman Hanks who shines through. Considering the intent of the film - to herald The Post - this isn't necessarily bad, but given that we already know - historically - how the situation played out, it was hardly suspenseful. Streep was good, but she has been better - The Iron Lady, The Devil Wears Prada. Hanks was quite credible, but it wasn't Captain Phillips or Bridge of Spies. Special note goes to Bob Odenkirk, who turned a very nuanced, self-effacing performance. He could easily have been Jimmy (Better Call Saul) - there are so many parallels. But he wasn't. A good film - a very worthy effort - but not a great one. The liberal cheerleaders are slobbering all over this picture and rushing to draw comparisons to Trump vs the press (a stretch at best), and they aren't wrong in their critical assessments. Just overly exuberant."
THE POST,27 October 2019,8/10,"You can reference the Constitution which guaranteed freedoms but then you realise that in the over two hundred years since it was signed many of those freedoms have been ignored or eroded. The Vietnam War saw successive Presidents lie to the people in the pursuit of impossible military and political goals. ""The Post"" shows what happened when great newspapers like the New York Times and The Washington Post had the opportunity to reveal the truth about the War as recorded in what became known as the ""Pentagon Papers"". Daniel Ellsberg was not the first nor the last whistle blower but he was one of the most effective and the two newspapers took the courageous decision to publish.Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks play the Post's owner, Katherine Graham and Editor Ben Bradlee. It was touch and go whether they would publish - the lawyers advised against. We see conflict within the newspaper and we see how Graham fought and won. The fact that in the fifty years since we have learned via TV Series and books what really happened in Vietnam and Washington and the White House is directly attributable to her. She had the constitution on her side and in due course the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the freedom of the press.Stephen Spielberg directs a serious, authentic movie which should give us hope that despite there being evidence over time (and today) that power corrupts if good people fight the truth and freedom can prevail."
THE POST,15 January 2018,10/10,"I have always been a sucker for a good newspaper film, and 'The Post' is one of the best.Living in the D. C. area since 1987, The Post has been a fixture in my life.Being a moderate Republican married for 25 years into a family whose business is being elected every two years to the U. S. Congresss, I was privelaged to have a front row seat and sometimes a back stage pass to talk with Congressional leaders and 4 U. S. Presidents.In addition, I sat in on occasional press conferences, interviews, and off the record discussions.In my own business, I have been interviewed multiple times by the WP as a SME on business matters.I haven't always agreed with the Post's political editorial opinions, and I can attest first hand that reporters attempt to get the story right, but don't always quote verbatim when the subject matter is not of national security or similar level of importance.Newspapers still operate on a journalistic level in fact checking and verification - there are rare exceptions and those are likely discovered at some point, so imo the esssence of newspaper journalism as it's taught in school is still alive and kicking...Television and tabloid journalism on the other hand has for the most part, become an entertainment industry and is devoid of such checks and balances as two source verifications, etc. It has become an opinion editorial broadcast to a great degree. It's what brings in the advertising dollars - big bucks.PBS News Hour's Judy Woodruff and the late/great Jim Lehrer are perhaps the last TV journalist/news anchors to avoid coloring and opining their broadcasts, leaving the op ed element to panel opinion discussions where it belongs.That all being said, The Post is a throw back to the days when journalists were still driven by standards and ethics. What they taught in journalism school was to a great degree being manifested in the newspaper rooms.Katherine Graham inherited the paper and with Ben Bradley (the ""pirate"") running the operation, has a decision to make on running a story on the Rand Corporation/Pentagon 20-year ongoing research program of the viability of involvement in SE Asia, and U. S. chances of winning the Vietnam War.Top secret documents are involved and the right for newspapers to report on such leaked documents, showing that every President from Truman to Nixon knew that it would be, and was a war we could never win.Spielberg does a very good job of bringing the drama of this and the decision Graham must make to publish even at the risk of putting the then barely solvent paper out of business and those involved into jail.Her place as a woman who inherited this three generation family business that operates in the men's club of newspaper journalism is obviously the back story and Streep plays it totally low key and true to Graham's sense of the moment and transformation evolving by necessity from her insider Washingtonian socialite origins, to the power inherent in being Owner of a publishing center-of-influence that requires ""making the tough decisions"" (and despite those decisions sometimes being in disagreement with the paper's long-time male executive team and trusted advisors).As always a great performance by Streep, as was Hanks' and the entire cast - Spielberg's ability to communicate what he envisions and needs from the actor in each scene, backed by his intuitive directing style, brings out actors' best instincts - it always has.Spielberg holds nothing back in tapping into his deep refined set of film making skills, tapping his influences Hitchcock and Bergman in camera work and scene structure. It is a true work of art we are witnessing in 'The Post'. Like Streep is to acting, Spielberg is held to a higher standard than today's mere mortal film makers. This means Stephen and Streep are unlikely to take home hardware, but this film could easily win best ""everything"" if it were not for their stature (success-penalty alert).Was it good enough for the elite actors and director to win Oscars in a great year for film? Maybe, but I'm guessing Chastain or Robbie for Lead Actress, Oldman for Lead Actor, Plummer for Supporting Actor and Janney for Supporting actress take the hardware home. Streep put forth the best performance of the year though, regardless of who actually takes home the hardware. She is simply the best actor alive and this was a great performance.👏Haven't screened Phantom Thread yet by the way - that could change things, but unlikely regarding Streep.Should you see this movie? ABSOLUTELY! Of course, I LOVE newspaper movies! And this is a VERY good one. Not up to ""Spotlight"" (best-ever newspaper film), but equal to 'All the President's Men"" - it's a very good movie, with a share of thrilling moments mixed into it's successful mission to capture the moment when a local newspaper became an influential national paper, with a then unheard-of woman as it's Admiral making the toughest of business and journalistic decisions, and a pirate as its Captain to pull it off.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 👍👍"
THE POST,3 February 2018,10/10,"It's not just the fascinating true story behind this quintessential battle for freedom of the press - coupled to freedom for women - that makes this movie outstanding. Nor is it the knockout performances of Streep, Hanks and frankly most of the other actors. Not even the message that references the governments of this era and all their wrongdoings is what really struck me. Most of all it is Spielberg his directing in ultima forma that gave me the greatest thrill. Long yet exciting shots and sequences, a perfect atmosphere of the times and super simple scenes that he directed to become almost thriller-like suspenseful... even when we already know the outcome! Yes, it has some flaws, such as the Spielberg-sugar at the end. Sure. But ultimately, this is a masterpiece."
THE POST,27 February 2018,9/10,"Its an excellent movie. Its drama, its history, its human frailty in the face of power. And it asks important questions. The most important being where does the peoples right to know begin, and the security of our nation and the people who serve it end? If the knee jerk reaction after seeing this movie, is to say its the people, then you are doing a disservice to yourself and the nation. The Post was correct as far as the reasons surrounding the troops lives and the conduct of the war, which necessitated the release of the Pentagon Papers. However, in the hindsight of history, which is shown with Edward Snowden, this isn't always the case. Many will try to draw comparisons between then and now. But that only serves their own ideology. We now live in a very very different world today than then. What you do get with this is an entertaining and fast paced trip down memory lane. Fortunately for us, Spielberg is still around to take us there. Brilliant acting across the board here with Streep and Hanks, as we take a look at a time long since vanished."
THE POST,16 January 2018,4/10,"The Post stars in ""Streep Hanks,"" the latest film from visionary filmmaker Steven Spielberg. I suppose Spielberg's running out of material, as the story of The Washington Post leaking the government documents on the Vietnam War hardly holds up when compared to other Spielberg works, such as Schindler's List, Lincoln, or Saving Private Ryan. I'd compare ""The Post"" with the recent Ridley Scott film, ""All the Money in the World"" in that it's too bland a real-life story to make into a lengthy film. Perhaps a more intriguing story would be one more focused on the war itself with the media coverage being part of the bigger picture. There is absolutely no suspense in this historical recreation of what went on behind the scenes of a single newspaper company leading up to publishing these government secrets, but the movie tries its hardest to show the struggle in the decision to no avail - the choice is obvious when the alternate would result in quite literally a film about nothing.This film has not much point beyond virtue signaling and propaganda. Surely with such a bland event presented in such a dull manner, I was supposed to get more out of the film somewhere else, and the only ""thing else"" I can see is the political agenda. The timing is quite impeccable with the public's trust in mainstream media slipping constantly, it's a wonder that there haven't been more attempts at MSM PR vehicles immediately prior to this film. The film feels like a strategically calculated virtue signal, as the expositional dialogue lazily pushes for the approval of third wave feminists for its modest uncertain female lead, while the subject matter encourages comfort in news and disdain for the government, and despite being set over 50 years ago it's surely meant to echo today.Taking a step back, the movie is incredibly safe and calculated. There's a touch of diversity sprinkled in, but not too much as this film has the historical leg to fall back upon, allowing them to cast white powerhouses like Streep and Hanks without being accused of whitewashing and not overdo the diversity and be accused of blackwashing. It also is careful not to overstep its bounds and keeps itself confined to the story in question whereas a more emotionally driven director might have let their political beliefs overtake the film altogether. Spielberg seems to be trying to play both fields, which is a lot better than I can say about modern filmmakers, but it feels more like the product I'm getting is processed and phony.This movie feels like a concoction of great things blended into unpalatable goop. If you want a great Tom Hanks performance and a compelling real-life story that is just as short as it needs to be, check out Clint Eastwood's ""Sully."" If you want a great Meryl Streep film, check out ""Adaptation."""

However, fifty years from now, when the USA is an historical artifact; and historians argue various landmarks in its decline as a nation devoted to individual liberty and freedom to stand up to the crushing machinery of an indifferent bureaucracy, this film will stand out. Individuals who believe that government serves the people and should be opposed when it is destructive of that end are shown risking much to defy a pathetic wannabe tyrant - and winning!These same historians will be puzzled at what was lost in the years after the period of this film that -in the end - caused the collapse of this same county as shown in the film."

The film feels very timely in today's environment of women's issues and also with respect to the current President's relationship with the media. Streep's character embodies a woman who has taken a back seat in life and who is tested to do more.
This is perhaps my second favourite Stephen Spielberg movie to date, after Schindler's List. This train is coming into the station right on time (if I may use an old analogy for the political and social scene of today.)"
THE POST,7 February 2018,6/10,"Well done suspenseful drama about the publication of the top secret Pentagon Papers which delineated the history of US involvement in Vietnam from Truman through Johnson, but not Nixon as the film portrays is. Nixon hadn't even inaugurated when the papers were compiled--and Nixon never banned the Post from the White House. That said, he was indeed still a crook, but based on Watergate, not this. The films main indictment of the executive was 70% of the reason we continued to increase our presence there was ""to avoid a humiliating defeat.""The real villains were LBJ and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara. Kennedy, partly on the advice of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who'd told him it was folly to be anywhere on mainland Asia, had initiated an accelerated withdrawal from Vietnam to be completed by 1965. Johnson rescinded that a few days after Kennedy was assassinated. None of this is covered in the film, though it showed the Washington Post's owner, Katharine Graham, turning on McNamara at the end, but leaving the president he served, LBJ, unscathed.That's an egregious omission. The question is, did they not do their homework, or was it intentional?"
THE POST,6 July 2018,1/10,"This movie is only for the liberals who's just interested in one side of a story. Cardboard characters, stiff acting, boring script, and moralizing until your throat is filled. I never thought Spielberg, Hanks and Streep could do something so bad as this sleeping pill.
On the level of movie of the week, but with over paid actors and director.
Oh well, not the first time that money stands in the way of quality."
THE POST,1 July 2018,7/10,This movie is very well done and well worth watching but it is slow and takes a while to get going so stick with it. Would we watch it again? Probably but it would need a dark cold night.
THE POST,24 January 2018,8/10,"This is not Spielberg as usual. The subject is recent enough to hit raw nerves, distant enough to miss anyone younger than in their sixties, and timely enough to be praised or attacked according to the audience's politics of today. One can sense these thoughts in the way this film was directed.Hanks does an excellent job of paying homage to a character owned by Jason Robards and even expose a more human side to the legendary editor of the Washington Post. Streep, well, Streep who? was that not actually Kay Graham on the screen? The evolution and transformation of the character is beautifully handled. As for Nixon, he is treated exactly as the cartoon character he build for himself all by himself, with a brilliant ending of this film, no doubt a homage to Alan J. Pakula, and a homage to unchangeable, unquestionable History.Was there a motive regarding the timing of the making of this movie? Who cares. There can be no good or bad timing to reminding us that the press is there to serve the governed and not the governors."
THE POST,4 March 2018,7/10,"""The Post"" features the best starting lineup since the 2017 Golden State Warriors: two time academy award winning director Steven Spielberg, two time academy award winning actor Tom Hanks, the academy award winning writer of ""Spotlight"" Josh Singer, and 21-time Oscar nominated actress and three time winner Meryl Streep. ""The Post"" is this year's most try-hard Oscar bait movie, yet succeeds as a surprisingly non-boring film thanks to its veteran cast, timely themes, and tense second half. ""The Post"" leaves its best material for the second half -- the first half was boring and forgettable. The second half is where the story takes off, performances shine, humor seeps through, and the themes of the power of journalism come to fruition. ""The Post"" provides a very good message about journalism, and how it's up to the criticisms of the media to provide a checks and balances for the government. The film sheds enough insights on the fact-based history of the pre-Watergate Nixon scandal without slowing down for tedious exposition. ""The Post"" celebrates courage, and that when people remain true to what's right, good will result.Steven Spielberg and company make another feel-good, informative and entertaining film that does just enough to be good, although can't help but feel a little disappointing given the legendary lineup present."
THE POST,12 January 2018,8/10,"In 1994 Ron Howard directed a movie called ""The Paper"", and in 1976 there was a little film directed by Alan J. Pakula called ""All the President's Men"". I think ""The Post"" could be considered a mash-up of the two movies, with a heavy emphasis on the latter movie (even the newsroom set looks identical).""The Post"" takes place in mid-1971, weeks before The Washington Post's initial public offering on the ""American Stock Exchange"". At the time, the company, headed by former publisher Philip Graham's widow, Katharine (played exceptionally well by Ms. Streep) was more or less considered a ""small community newspaper""; constantly being one-upped by the golden child of newspapers: The New York Times. Just after Katherine Graham took over as publisher, she appointed seasoned newsman Benjamin Bradlee as managing editor, played here by Spielberg favorite Tom Hanks. When the ""Pentagon Papers"" were leaked in early 1971, The Washington Post found themselves, once again, on the outside looking in. For three months, The New York Times sat on the massive story while they researched it, putting all their ducks in a row until they published part one of a four part series on June 18, 1971. Thousands of pages of a top-secret, commissioned report that proved a mass government cover-up, spanning at least four presidents was going to be, without a doubt the biggest story of the decade. To Bradlee and the rest of his staff, not being apart of it was unacceptable: they wanted in on the scoop and were willing to risk their freedom, and the future of the newspaper, to report on it. Ms. Graham, however, wasn't as gung-ho. She had plenty to worry about - investor relations, her family's legacy, and badmouthing her ""friends"" inside the government, namely former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (played by Canadian Bruce Greenwood) who had a big role in the cover-up. This is a fast-moving film that, in just under two-hours, covers weeks of back-and-forth conversations and research and a back story we may never completely know or understand. Does it really matter here? No. This is a great film, and and entertaining film that depicts how The Washington Post played a strategic role in one of the biggest news stories in the 1970's, and earned itself acclaim as an important national newspaper. As a former member of the media I am a strong supporter of, and a true believer in the First Amendment, and in Canada, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So I enjoy depictions of such in movies (The People vs. Larry Flynt, 1996, is another one you could see). I don't care how historically accurate the story is or isn't (in this case it's debatable, however they do use some of the real recordings of President Nixon's phone conversations). I'd watch hearings on C-SPAN live if I wanted historical records. ""The Post"" is a movie and gets the point across. There is, and will forever be, dramatic elements added to true stories - this is the entertainment business. As we see in the movie toward the end, The Washington Post (the company) is a large part of the reason why the media industry as a whole can continue to report on similar stories, or even why IMDb can publish this little piece by little 'ol me. Free speech. So true is The Washington Post's motto today, Democracy Dies in Darkness."
THE POST,18 September 2020,7/10,When you have Tom Hanks in the film then automatically no matter how the film is you want to watch . This film tells you how journalist come to an extent to risk their job & uncover the harsh realities that are happening in the country . It's not because they want popularity but because they want to let the public aware of the truth even if the fight is against government. Great acting by Meryl Streep who wants let the people know about the truth being covered by the government despite risking her business . Tom Hanks it seems was acting more like Arnab Goswami in this film & why not as he is the CEO
THE POST,22 March 2018,6/10,"Steven Spielberg's otherwise honorable ""The Post"", the story of the Washington Post's struggle to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, suffers from a rather polite, academic film treatment that lacks the rough edge the story deserved (check out ""All the President's Men"" again!). It needed more adrenaline.Moreover, a miscast Tom Hanks seemed to be playing 'Tom Hanks' rather than Ben Bradlee -- although Meryl Streep's nuanced and brilliant performance as Katharine Graham made the film really worth seeing.Although this is the kind of film non-cineastes mistake for great, ""The Post"" shows Spielberg directing on autopilot. Still recommended for being a record of an important moment in the political history of America."
THE POST,5 January 2020,5/10,This was not my favourite movie but I'm not going to say don't rent it. It really isn't my kind of movie to begin with. My wife loved it.

THE POST,24 January 2021,7/10,"(Imagine Ben Bredlee meeting Forrest Gump) Honestly, a movie that has the trinity: Spielberg, Hanks, and Streep just can't be bad. A really textbook and neat film, precise performances of every individual characters, epic story, and directory style. The movie requires some certain background knowledge and the plot development at start was a bit unclear. Overall, this a great example of narrating historical event with contemplation towards current day incidents."
THE POST,2 June 2018,6/10,"'The Post' may have strong performances and great direction, but it never really reaches greatness simply due to the way the story is handled. When a film is centred around a news team exposing political corruption, it has to be done in the right way to keep it's audience engaged. It's certainly not the most exciting plot line, and I must confess that had it not been for it's Oscar nominations, I wouldn't have bothered to see this in cinemas. Alas, I was still somewhat excited to see it due to it's promising cast. The film was obviously in good hands with acclaimed director Steven Spielberg in charge and while he certainly doesn't disappoint, the movie stays just average. The first hour of the film is quite convoluted - it's rather difficult to follow and overly complex with not enough being explained and it makes it difficult to stay invested in the film. The film starts off in a war scene in Vietnam, which is of course sets the wrong tone of the film as the entire remainder of the film has no action, but rather political drama. While there's nothing wrong with that, I think that starting off with an action scene wasn't the wisest decision. It's only in the second act that the film picks up and becomes a delight to watch. Seeing two brilliant actors, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, work together on screen is a delight and both of them are phenomenal. However, I would have liked to have seen Streep's character explored a bit more, as she ultimately had more importance then Hanks character yet the latter got more screen time. It was also great to see other great actors on screen, such as Sarah Paulson, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jesse Plemons. Spielberg's direction is certainly masterful, as expected, with brilliant shots and different angles that can bring unstimulating scenes to life. When compared to his other great films, such as Saving Private Ryan, E.T. or Catch Me If You Can, The Post doesn't really measure up. However, it's still not a bad film - it's good, thanks to the brilliant cast."
THE POST,11 March 2018,7/10,"The Post shows once again great acting from Tom Hanks and if you liked 2015s Spotlight, then you will not have a hard time to get into this one as well. Especially in times like these, where censorship and lies are pretty much everywhere, a free and independent press is essential for the public. This movie is not about action in any sense. In fact, nobody get's even hurt. It gets you with its sheer threat of the government trying to hide the truth from the public and use the press rather as a marketing tool for themself. The question basically is: are you willing to do the right thing or tag along with the system and enjoy its benefits?"
THE POST,8 May 2018,6/10,"After the recent and ongoing debacle with the complete collapse of of any illusion of truth in institutional media, with all major players revealed to be nothing more than handpuppets for a frighteningly small group of deeply insane rich people, it was certainly refreshing to go back to a time when journalistic integrity actually mattered for something. Certainly having Mr. Show in wigs was not at all distracting, and the dopey cameos from hipster bit players was also entirely an expert move, Sarah Paulson making sandwiches and five or six lines of dialogue, bet that filled the seats, and the sparrow from Community, man the publicists and agents really made some big deals and bold moves to get this story to daylight. And of course, La Streep, playing the part of Meryl Streep in a Major Role*, suspension of disbelief I hear your siren call, so near, yet so far. I really liked the big presses with all the paper and ink and I think I saw a couple of black people, not sure. The guy tying the newspapers had a toupee.Of course, not long after this, Reagan was the match that lit the fuse to the end of the world, and the Telecommunications Act rendered this entire movie moot, and now the Post is just another dutiful tool for the pathologically rich. But the nostalgia was sure nice.* (what next, Babs Bush? Tall Hillary? Fictional Feinstein/Pelosi golem hybrid? did she do an IPO?)"
THE POST,25 January 2018,8/10,"The Post is the newest project by veteran Steven Spielberg. The picture revolves around the head of the Washington Post, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) who finds out about top secret government files that prove the US involvement in Vietnam back into the administration of Harry Truman. She must face the difficult choice of either offering protection to her old friends or listen to her partner Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) who wants to release the files to the public. All while Richard Nixon tries to prevent any news outlet from publishing these information. When director Steven Spielberg read the screenplay, he immediately wanted to push the film into production. Spielberg wanted to tell this story especially in today's world when President Trump tries to shut down the media that criticizes him. The message of bringing out the truth, even if it stings is realized beautifully in this film. This is done in particular through the character of Kay, she was a supporter of John F. Kennedy and a good friend of Robert McNamara who worked closely with Kennedy and Johnson. She struggles with the choice of sticking with her friends or bringing out the truth, Streep handles those torn emotions very well and plays this character very believable. Bradlee is a very rough character. He has the morals of telling the truth, often being brutally honest around other people. The chemistry between the actors is very authentic and helps to elevate the story. The camera work is very simplistic, some scenes have very long stretched and moving shots which is typical for Spielberg. It moves the story forward but isn't as effective in building tension like Munich, Jurassic Park or Raiders of the Lost Ark. John Williams does the score for this film and makes a very John Williams like score. It once again moves the story and characters along but isn't very outstanding. The writing on the other hand has to be praised. The dialogue is realistic and interesting, even packed with a few gags. Overall I really enjoyed this film. Steven Spielberg's direction is once again very good, the actors are brilliant and play of each other well. The writing is spot on and is the element that keeps the film interesting. I would recommend this film for a one time viewing at the theatres, or maybe on cable/netflix. It is a movie that's well made and that has an important statement but I honestly can't see myself rewatching this film."
THE POST,23 January 2018,4/10,"This 2-hour mess smacks of simple money-making sprinkled with preachiness. Even two big-name actors cannot save it from itself; Hanks' role is awkward, beneath him and his character, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. Streep?

And Meryl gets to be Meryl . . . yipee! It was way more fun to hear her sing like Florence Foster Jenkins . . .

Kay Graham : Do you have the Papers?(pause) Ben Bradlee : Not yet. Not exactly nail biting stuff.This movie will literally put you to sleep, especially the beginning which is a cobbled up montage of unidentified characters, doing puzzling things, for reasons that only an insider of those years could fathom. By the time any of this is made clear it is too late. With the technical prowess of Hollywood at his disposal, Spielberg has made a stage play . . . yipee!Other characters. Who? Where? Oscar talk.

THE POST,11 April 2018,2/10,"Lots of things make this more political than honest.
WaPo has been getting hammered for publishing fake news lately. They've been caught at it on a regular basis.
This feels like an attempt to make them relevant by going back 40 years to when they did something relevant and revealed all the lies from both sides about the Vietnam war.
It felt like it was pretending that only one party was behind the whole thing, especially with the attack at the end...pretending Nixon was the only one wanting to keep this a secret.
It wasn't honest, it was very one sided with multiple references to Nixon even though there were many trying to keep secret documents a secret.The sad thing is they had to go back 40 + years. With all the scandals under Obama and others they couldn't find a better or more recent and relevant story.
No, the current President isn't trying to silence them. Yes, it's fair to call them out when they lie. No, I did not vote Republican this last election (it's what people assume when they can't discuss facts) and yes, I found this to be a story that was too filled with bias and politics instead of facts to truly enjoy.It really felt dishonest on many levels, including the relevance of news when they are dishonest...especially when you remember that 8 years of the war were under 2 different Democrat Presidents without it being stopped. Their political attacks seem so biased instead of intelligent when you realize both parties were involved in the scam but the movie only pushed the blame on one."

Live the free press here and in the world, so we can have justice more clearly and understand the truth.The film deals with an era that is being transformed, it was a time when the written press reigned, now with all the existing electronic resources loses its force.

He wasn't running the DOJ or State Dept. nor was President. His 'report' was his opinion for whatever it was worth ... really very little or nothing. And is was correctly ignored as a waste of our tax dollars.This movie is just left wing fiction elevated to the left wing equivalent of religious coda and myth."
THE POST,18 January 2018,7/10,"It is kind of ludicrous to call a movie this good a disappointment, but when the director is Steven Spielberg, one resets the scale.This very well written, solid, topical chronicle could be viewed as ""Spotlight 2"", as the two movies even share a common writer. It could also be characterized as ""Spielberg on auto pilot"".""The Post"" tells the story of the so called ""Pentagon Papers"", a landmark case of investigative journalism and whistle blowing. Basically, the leaked documents revealed that the government of the USA had lied to the public about the ""Vietnam conflict"" for 30 years. The two papers caught in the spotlight were The New York Times and The Washington Post. The focus of the film is on the latter.And the picture is very focused indeed. Clarity is one of the major strengths of the movie. However, the downside is a lack of visual imagination and richness. From Spielberg - and in contrast of the superior ""Bridge of Spies"" - this is a surprise. Hence, the disappointment.None of the above, though, has to do with the point of the movie. If the execution is more or less by the book, it is because of the rushed production. It is well reported that the whole thing was created in under a year. The reason for this is, that the ""The Post"" was meant as a topical movie, despite its events happening four decades ago.""The Post"" sharply addresses the current political climate, where the U.S. government is doing everything it can to undermine the integrity of the media. ""The Post"" does an uncanny job in commenting the corrupt and perverse reality. Actions and lines of dialog of the film's characters echo in surprising ways in the 21st century viewer. Coming to the conclusion that the media has to be the watch dog of the political (and commercial) power. ""The Post"" comes to this conclusion via considerable eloquence.""Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down"". In the case of ""The Post"" the sugar is the massive star power of its two stars.Of the two, Meryl Streep is...just fine. Fine, but unsinspiring. The problem with this virtuoso is that she can't help but put on a performance. Even when she does it as subtly as she does here. She has chosen to play Kay Graham (as she often chooses to do) by accentuating one key aspect in the character, in this case the character's insecurity. Streep doesn't so much play Graham as she demonstrates her. That may be a bit harsh, but it is something Streep's critics have talked about since the 80's.Tom Hanks fares better. His acting is sharp, robust when needed, and comes with considerable gravitas. When Hanks is on the screen, one's eyes don't wander around the canvas.One shout out: to Neil Sheehan (now 81 yo), the NYT reporter who wrote the original series of stories concerning the Pentagon. There was another story hidden within ""The Post"", and one is left wondering if the one told here was the more interesting of the two."
THE POST,15 January 2018,6/10,"I have noticed a pattern when Steven Spielberg approaches any movie that falls into the category of social commentary. It gets dull. He thrives when he directs escapist entertainment and action, but when a cultural affair becomes the centerpiece of his film rather than a situation, he seems to miss his dramatic timing. Other examples include Amistad, Munich and Lincoln. The Post falls into that same group.However, unlike Oliver Stone and other directors who enjoy these topics (and who can be arguably more entertaining with it at the movies), I give Spielberg credit for not straying knowingly or unknowingly into propaganda and conspiracy theories in his treatment. If I were to extract his personal philosophy out of these movies I would guess that he would say, ""My comment is not to cast blame, my comment is to surface the wrongness."" The Post is no exception: he made sure we knew that the cover-up on justifying the ongoing war in Vietnam spanned presidents of both major political parties, and that not only was the justification unacceptable, covering it by any president was wrong and attempting to strong-arm the press from revealing it was worse. But the movie also accurately reflected the anti-feminist attitude of the time period, and Meryl Streep brilliantly played a character who struggled with her confidence in commanding decisions in that environment, especially when freedom of the press was under fire.In case you missed it, my message above is that I prioritize movies that are entertaining, not historically accurate. And what I find entertaining is dramatic conflict, action and escapism. What I liked about the movie JFK, for example, despite its exploitation of conspiracy theory that ranged from believable to not, is that problem-solving was the engine that drove the movie forward. The audience was engaged to help the characters unravel a complex situation. The Post could have taken that strategy and would have been much improved, but instead it gave us characters who just reacted to pressure and made decisions. And that bored me.Tom Hanks was once again at the top of his form, however. Even now, late in his career, does he show new range in his talents. In both this film and in The Circle I saw him play clever new characters that were exciting to watch.Lastly, a comment not on the movie itself but on reactions to it, I am noticing that reviewers are motivated to draw a tenuous line between this film and current affairs. While this property almost certainly predated the Trump Administration, it was probably green-lighted by the studio specifically because the theme would arouse interest in the public who is today acutely aware of the conflict between government and the press (which is not new - in fact it's a cliche). But today's type of conflict is unprecedented. Suppression of the press was the issue in The Post. Today's issue is press partisanship and finding ways to circumvent it and discredit it, rather than suppress. The president today is directly accusing the press at manipulating public opinion rather than reporting the facts as they are pledged to do. The irony is that his method of circumventing it can also be argued to be both partisan and manipulating public opinion. The truth is probably that both arguments are true, but the public is left to either take sides with a political party like cheerleaders at a football game (much to the delight of the party activists), or back away from all of it with dismay, distrust and confusion in both the press and the government. Both responses are very troublesome, but I find no parallels with The Post in that way at all.At the end of the day, I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but The Post is not one of my favorites. With movies like this, the BFG (2016), Bridge of Spies (2015), Lincoln (2012), War Horse (2011) and The Adventures of Tintin (2011), he seems tired. I am not as engaged in his films over the last decade as I used to be. The last group of films that hooked me were War of the Worlds (2005), The Terminal (2004), Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Minority Report (2002), and many more going back in time, with his masterpieces being Schindler's List (1993), E.T. (1982), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Jaws (1975) - which are not only his best but among the best films in history. I doubt he'll ever return to that power, but on the other hand, I can always trust him to know what he is doing and I will always see what he puts out."
THE POST,12 January 2018,9/10,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest American filmmakers ever, and if people have forgotten this then this film will surely remind them of it. it should be stated first and foremost that 'The Post' is directed to near perfection. The cinematography, color grading, set designs, and even costumes are all incredible. Spielberg's camerawork in this film is absolutely incredible, and he absolutely deserves to be at least nominated for best director (not that the Oscars really mean anything). The camera seemingly has omnipotence in this film, panning and moving throughout each and every scene until it decides to stop and rest on whatever Spielberg feels like focusing on. His scenes either seem to consist of short close ups, or long takes where the camera subtly but effectively moves throughout the set. His camerawork is matched by the skill of the actors and actresses working together for this movie, as 'The Post' undoubted has the most impressive cast of any film this year, with each and every role being played masterfully. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, as always, are perfect. The story of this film starts off confusing, filled with strange jargon and mentions of people who I personally did not know, but eventually it settles down into somewhat of a thriller mixed with a very compelling drama. If it isn't obvious yet, I love this movie to death. It does have issues: one that is the worst offender is the terrible photoshopped pictures shown throughout the movie. The worst being one with Streep's character hanging out with the Kennedys. The fact that 'Forrest Gump', which came out over 20 years ago, can make it seem like Forrest was in archival footage flawlessly yet this film can't even correctly photoshop pictures is pretty embarrassing. The only other technical problem I have is a scene that takes place in a courtroom uses some really bad CGI and CGI lighting that reminded me of the Star Wars prequels. Besides these issues, I think the film gets a little cheesy near the end, and this cheesiness is eccentuated by an even cheesier score. Still, this is without a doubt my favorite Spielberg movie since 'Munich'. It's compelling, funny, and overall gives you a sense of faith in the principals and heroes of this country, even to a cynic like myself, which is an entire accomplishment all on its own."
THE POST,22 December 2017,10/10,"After finishing the movie the first thought came to my mind is that it is another masterpiece from spielberg and his co. I have seen almost all the movies of spielberg and all those are always included in my favourite list. So i was eagerly waiting for another spielberg film as i know his ability and creativity . But this movie is far beyond the spielberg factor. Because the plot is a true event that discloses the original power and responsibility of press and mass media over our political and state life. It is a conflict that reminded us the true colour of anarchy and democracy, it's central effects in all sphere of life. It is a true inspiration of win of truth over power and bureaucracy. And who but Spielberg could have given this true motivational conflict into a proper dramatic figure along with Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. Many will find this movie as a slow and old pattern movie but you have to keep in mind that these movies are to be opened slowly and steadily . The movie has gathered perfect pace with every minute and has created enough interest for audiences to keep them on their toes. This is a very furnished spielberg movie ......like many other classics he has delivered....this one is a classic."
THE POST,24 December 2019,4/10,"This feels like a movie made to embellish the reputations of those making it, rather than one made for the benefit of the audience.The story is exceptionally simple, with the same dramatic points being re-told several times to pad this out to a two hour running time.Streep over-acts dreadfully, and seems to dare Hanks to chew as much scenery as she does when the two are on screen together. The other characters are so thin that you cannot engage with them - the overall sensation is of tiredness, barely helped by the washed-out cinematography. There is no sense whatsoever of the dynamism of a newsroom.There are also some exceptionally clumsy references to ""the changing role of women"", with one of the final scenes feeling far too artificial for what is supposed to a ""true"" story.Not even close to ""Spotlight""."
THE POST,21 February 2018,9/10,"The Post is tight, dense, and suspenseful. This is particularly noteworthy since it sticks close to historical facts, and we already know the ending. The cast includes some of the best in the business, and it shows.Some carp that The New York Times deserves first and top credit for publishing the story. Sure. Someone should make that movie. This is a different story.Others carp that the defense of freedom of the press relates to current events. Though the release timing is certainly related, I did not detect anything in the movie being adjusted to make it more currently apropos. The relation is real and natural, not forced."
THE POST,15 February 2019,6/10,"One of Spielbergs history films. A fascinating true story which should have been gripping instead, seemed very slow indeed."
THE POST,7 March 2018,5/10,"In a movie that could have been about Katherine Graham, and COULD have been a very powerful message that women did things of importance before now, Spielberg defaults to Hanks and trumpets. What a waste of a good idea. Plus, nothing changes as a result of what they did. So what was the point, when told in this way as an anti-war movie? Should have been told as a woman's story. There are fascinating stories about Jackie Kennedy and Tony Bradlee, for example, and the way K Graham conquered the news business in a man's world when her husband killed himself. These points fail to hit, because... Trumpets and Hanks. Fail."
THE POST,20 January 2018,7/10,"The Vietnam War was a 20-year long war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia from 1955 to 1975. In 1965, American military analyst Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys) reported with disgust to U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood) that no progress was being made. McNamara commented that his findings meant that things were actually getting worse. Almost immediately after their conversation, McNamara spoke with the press reporting falsely that the situation was getting better in the War.
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C. in 1971, Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) took over operations of The Washington Post newspaper after her husband Phillip died. Their competitor New York Times published reports on cover-ups about the Vietnam War and were quickly silenced by President Richard Nixon. Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk), a journalist for the Post got a meeting with Ellsberg who gave him 1000 copied classified documents confirming the cover-ups. 
The Post is the true story about the first U.S. female newspaper publisher Kay Graham as she and her Chief Editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) struggle between their duties as journalists to expose the truth about the White House cover-ups about the Vietnam War and their responsibilities to their employees to keep them safe when they are threatened by the White House to stay away from the story. 
The Post was nominated for 9 Golden Globes, though it didn't walk away with any wins. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri beat The Post for Best Picture Drama, Guillermo Del Toro took home the award for Best Director for The Shape of Water, Gary Oldman beat out Tom Hanks for Best Actor for his role as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, and Frances McDormand beat out Meryl Streep for her performance in Three Billboards.
 
Most are familiar with the story, at least with the highlights. But The Post goes deep into the behind the scenes efforts and struggles that went into exposing the lies being told by the White House spanning 4 Presidents about the Vietnam War. But it was about more than just the War. It was about one of the core tenants of what makes America unique: the freedom of the press. Journalists have both an obligation and a responsibility to share the truth, and they have a right to do so without obstruction. Streep and Hanks were both brilliant, as you would expect. I have yet to see Hanks in something I haven't enjoyed and both should be nominated for an Oscar for their performances. The Post was directed by Stephen Spielberg and the music was composed by John Williams to round out the posse of Hollywood A-listers involved in this film. I anticipated 4 solid Stars from The Post. It looked like it would be exciting, intense, upsetting, infuriating, inspiring and rewarding as we were given an inside look to a pivotal time in our nation's history regarding politics and the press, something that is as relevant as ever in our current political climate. 
 
I am lowering my rating slightly. Spielberg did a great job keeping the story moving. Not staying in one scene too long, keeping the characters straight so the viewer can follow along with all the players involved in the cover-up and the exposure, using angles to help emote feelings of power and doubt and inferiority. Hanks was fantastic as Editor Ben Bradlee. He was equally dedicated to his boss Kay Graham as he was to his employees when threatened by the government as he was to his paper The Post and getting the truth out there. Streep was brilliant as the first female newspaper publisher Kay Graham who struggled with the transition from the wife of a publisher who hosted parties and lived on the sidelines to taking over complete control and having to make important decisions on her own, decisions that impacted her family's legacy as well as the many people who worked under her. You definitely felt the anguish over her decisions, the doubt in herself, you cheered when she mustered up the courage to stand up for what was right and not cave in to what was safe. 
 
This is one of those difficult films to rate based on my personal ranking scale. Remember, there are three main facets to my rankings. First, how accurately does the preview lead you into the film? In this case, you get exactly what the preview sells. Second, the film itself. This is a great movie, well told, superbly acted and deserving of nominations and awards. And third, and most importantly, the likelihood of me owning the movie in my personal collection. And this is why the rating drops slightly. For me, The Post was entertaining, insightful, and extremely well done from directing to acting to story-telling; however, seeing it once was enough. While I may watch it again when it comes to the pay channels, it most likely won't be something I'm rushing out to own. Therefore, I'm lowing my rating to 3.5 Stars. So, movie will be on my mind next? We shall see."
THE POST,14 March 2018,10/10,"The Post (2017).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.In 1971 during the sixteenth year of the Vietnam war, The Washington Post obtained a study, later dubbed the Pentagon Papers from a confidential, government-insider source. The study was secretly commissioned by the United States Government, and concluded that the war in Vietnam was unwinnable, and that the war's objectives could never be obtained. Under the threat of injunction and criminal indictment, The Washington Post and its senior staff must decide whether or not to defy the government by publishing the contents of The Pentagon Papers and exposing the awful, bloody truth to the American public.Meryl Streep delivers an incredibly nuanced performance as Kay Graham, owner of The Washington Post, while Tom Hanks electrifies as Ben Bradlee, Graham's Chief Executive Officer. Together, the two stars deliver one of the greatest historical dramas of this modern age as the freedom of the press is challenged by the United States Government.Director Steven Spielberg, along with writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, manage to inject urgency, timeliness and a desperate sense of purpose into a story we thought we knew. The dialogue never sags, and as we slowly connect the dots in our brains we recognize exactly why freedom of speech and the power of the press are absolutely essential to safeguard our democracy.The modern-day parallels of current events make this film important - but it is the fine work of the stellar cast which makes this film a triumphant, glorious feast for the eyes, mind and heart."
THE POST,8 June 2020,4/10,"This movie seems like something made in the Oscar bait factory. Grab two of Hollywood's top best actors, grab one of the greatest directors out there, re-tell the events of a historic political event/taboo subject and BOOM! Get that Oscar nominations. Could this movie be any less special or boring as a matter of the fact? I just KNEW by looking at that this was such an Oscar baity film. I almost fell asleep watching this, and honestly, I left not caring. Sure Streep and Hanks were great but ehhh. Some bits here and there that were decent at best, but all I could think the entire time was how pandering this movie was to the critics that were bound to give this nominations for awards just based off who was in it, who directed it, and the subject matter. It's one of those whatever films."
THE POST,24 January 2018,8/10,"It's a wonder that Steven Spielberg is still out there making movies that quality never decreases, and still with the same formula both form and style, and most importantly, still killing the game! in this film he worked with also a veteran that even stronger than ever that is Meryll Streep and Tom Hanks who delivered a great performance. Meryll played The Godfather (or Godmother) in a newspaper company The Post. she have to make a very difficult decision in a time where to be a woman alone is difficult enough. she have to make a decision between saving her family and staffs or saving not only the boys that are sent to a deceitful war just to die, but also saving the moral value of newspaper integrity and moral value as a human as well.The film is not only about woman power, corrupt and deceitful government, and being an egg on top of a dagger. it's also about the balance between masculinity and femininity in running a company and making an important decision that could change a world event."

THE POST,13 October 2019,6/10,I usually love a nice Tom Hanks film or a film that is based on true events so I really thought this would be for me. Sadly it falls far from the mark as I couldn't seem to form a connection with any of the characters and that is why you don't really care what happens to them during the film.

They will get their nominations but I doubt they will get any wins. I lived through this part of history and it seems odd that they did not cover what Nixon tried to do to the New York Times. This movie seems more concerned with how great the News Media is. If they were as great as they claim there would never have be a question about publishing the information they had. I watched the main star (Meryl Streep). She didn't seem to do anything that would warrant an Oscar nomination. It seemed as though any woman her age could have played the same part. It was the same way with Tom Hanks, there just wasn't anything special going on. Watch it and make up you own mind. try not to pay for it. Check your library or find a friend that already has a copy."
THE POST,21 January 2018,8/10,"The Post is the latest collaboration between the highly talented duo of Tom Hanks & director Steven Spielberg. With Meryl Streep added to the cast, the expectations were obviously sky high. 
When you think of the best actor-director duos of Hollywood, Tom Hanks - Steven Spielberg are right up there with Leonardo DiCaprio - Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro - Martin Scorsese & Johnny Depp - Tim Burton. These actors seem to give their best performances with these directors at the helm. They share a certain level of comfort, trust & understanding. It is very unlikely that films with these actor-director combos will disappoint.
The Post starts off in the year 1965, when Daniel Ellsberg accompanies US troops in war torn Vietnam. He comes a pile of highly confidential documents which can harm the presidency & make Americans lose trust in their President. Years later he photocopies all the sensitive documents & leask it to the New York Times. The New York Times decides to publish these documents & is taken to court by the Attorney General, by President Nixon's orders. Elsewhere, Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) is finding it difficult to take over the reins of The Post from her husband, who recently committed suicide. She faces cynicism from her male dominated sexist board, who doubt her capabilities. Ben Bradlee(Tom Hanks) is the editor-in-chief, who wants to give NY Times a tough fight when it comes to reportage'. While the NY Times, is taken to court for publishing first set of sensitive documents, which the government feels can harm the national interest it is up to The Post to publish the remaining set of those documents. While her editor-in-chief strongly believes that the documents have to published for the sake of the nation, her board feels otherwise. Will the under confident female boss of The Post give the nod to a decision, which could shut down the company her father built? Or will her dominating board members prevail over her & make her toe their line? Watch the movie to find out.
Meryl Streep who won a golden globe for her role, is good. Her performance in the second half is noteworthy. Although we did not find it to be a Golden Globe winning performance. We think her perception worked in her favor & helped her win another Golden Globe for her performance. The movie stars an ensemble cast which includes Bob Odenkirk, Matthew Rhys, Alison Brie, Sarah Paulson. Bob Odenkirk is good, but this role doesn't do justice to an actor of his calibre. It is largely a Tom Hanks movie & he doesn't let you down. He is superb in his role as the driven editor-in-chief, who wants to make a difference. The movie will strike a chord with people across the globe, who have worked for a media or rather a news reporting organisation. The tussle between editorial & management is brilliantly picturised by director Steven Spielberg. The supporting cast does its job well. The second half is gripping & is way better than the first half of the movie. Director Steven Spielberg brilliantly captures the sexist, fascist Presidency of America in the 70's. It will strike a chord with Americans who are reeling under the effect of President Trump's attacks on the media. 
There are no glaring flaws in the movie. Although, we did think that the first half could have been more impactful. The first half makes you wonder whether the heroes are at NY Times & not at The Post! But the second half makes up for it. 
Is it the best movie which is dedicated to the first amendment of the American constitution? No. Is this Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg movie as good as one of Leonardo DiCaprio - Martin Scorsese ones? Not really. Should you go watch it? Hell Yeah. Although it is not the nest movie ever, one cannot deny the fact that it is a well made, entertaining movie based on true events."
THE POST,23 May 2019,1/10,People always talk about how great of an actress Streep is but she's pretty awful in this film. Hanks is not very good either. It feels like they are just reading lines and not even making an effort to interact with others on screen to make the lines seem natural. And Streep's accent and mannerisms are odds and change constantly throughout the film. Might have been a better movie with a better actress.
THE POST,12 January 2018,1/10,"This movie is a real snoozer.It will not perform well, and I don't care much for the cast. Terrible job all-around by Streep.Everytime I see Meryl Streep on the screen, I just cannot take it serious.Now that America is on it's way to becoming great, let's make Hollywood great again and get away from these horrible snowflake actors/actresses.It's like every time I turn on my TV, all I see is a Blizzard of snowflakes. More acting, less snowing.0/10 stars...oh not allowed? 1 star it is."
THE POST,13 May 2018,9/10,"First, I don't care for Meryl Streep (blasphemy) or Tom Hanks (""How could you?"") but this is a damn fine movie. History can be drab without a flamboyant character as the subject so how does Spielberg bring to life the unsure, inexperienced Katherine Graham (Streep) and her transformation into an iconic proponent of free speech? The man can tell a tale. Hanks seems like a cross between Lou Grant and an arrogant carnival huckster. His quotable line, ""What do you think we do around here kid?"" will live on in movie lore forever."
THE POST,27 January 2018,8/10,"This movie gives an insight about the high end journalism we have been respecting for so long.. The depicted characters are not intellectuals at all..If you feed them with the news then they can make some impact but they are unable to analyse the situation by themselves. They can be easily manipulated by the politicians.. These dummy people believe everything that the politicians tell them and think that the US is winning the war in Vietnam. And when someone leaks a top secret report from a government institution and they discover that everything was a lie..This is a great movie about the fundamental institution of democracy.. Unfortunately the free press we know is actually is nor free..They are not objective..They are not reliable..They protect their political friends according to their ideology..They are manipulated and they manipulate the society..They are inept to play the role the society expects them to..This movie substantially serves to the ideas of Mr. Trump of ""fake news"". Media creates a perception and they believe it and expect the public to believe that. How about the facts? They are lost in the social relations.Thank you Mr. Spielberg and congratulations to the great cast for realistically depicting the real world of journalism..We understand that politicians can easily use these guys if they get along well with them.. I feel less respect to the journalists after watching this movie..."
THE POST,15 March 2018,4/10,"I cannot believe that this would be nominated for an Oscar. It's a slow story dominated by Streep playing her who-hasn't-seen-it upper class rich woman character and Hanks being the cranky counterpart with a distracting fake Boston accent.It's also the kind of movie that attracts an older audience that likes to talk out loud during the film... What'd she say? How are we supposed to understand that?It's set in 1971 --- so an early scene shows people smoking (which doesn't occur much when they are actually working). We also get pounded over the head with womens' roles in the workforce, the cheesiest being after the Supreme Court hearing. The movie hints at Ellberg's being traumatized as a reporter in Viet Nam but then virtually drops him from the movie. Would have been more interesting.The Post was a second tier newspaper at the time; the NY Times was the paper that took the real risks in the entire Pentagon Papers story. But there's no Meryl Streep role in ""The Times"", so we get ""The Post""."
THE POST,4 January 2018,2/10,"Yawwwwn.... so bad I almost fell asleep. It is a bit confusing to me since historically the NYT uncovered the story. They were prevented from publishing by Nixon's machine. So The Post wound up publishing it. Personally, I would have preferred for this film to be made of the story behind the NYT's story. That initial research, digging deep into the DC machine would have been as good as the Woodward/Bernstein story. Such a shame."

If I were rating the 1st half only, I'd only give 2 stars because it's incredibly boring and uninteresting. I dont need action or tons of excitement, but the writing and acting wasn't even interesting in the 1st half.

Magnificent production design, cinematography, and direction encompass this wonderful film.While the film entertains, ""The Post"" struggles to raise the dramatic stakes and remains predictable and slightly somber.

THE POST,14 January 2018,,"Watching Meryl Streep act is like watching a virtuoso performer. She just lights up the screen. Tom Hanks rarely gets second billing to anyone - but he does in this movie. She plays the role of Katharine Graham as a person with mix of vulnerability and fortitude (not sure whether the real Katharine was that sort of a person). ""The Post"" couldn't have come at a better time - given the challenges the fourth estate is facing within itself and with political pressures. Time to remember and thank the courage of papers like Washington Post and the New York Times for standing up to President of the US to ensure freedom of speech and government accountability. Not sure if the same courage exists today."
THE POST,4 March 2018,7/10,"The Post is not just about the publication of The Pentagon Papers in 1971. It is also about one woman finding her place in the world. Meryl Streep plays Katherine Graham the publisher of The Washington Post, she has inherited the paper due to her husband's death. Graham is lost in this world of men, who patronize her, today we call it mansplaining. To add to her difficulties, the Post receives a copy of a secret study commissioned by the Pentagon into the conduct of the Vietnam War. The paper's editor, Ben Bradlee ( Tom Hanks) wants to publish even though he knows that the Nixon Administration will come after the paper. The papers were taken my Rand Corporation official Daniel Ellsberg and copied. Ellsberg wanted to expose the fact that previous Presidents had lied about the reasons for and conduct of war in Vietnam.Graham is hesitant as she is about to go public on the Stock Exchange. She could also go to jail for publishing classified documents. This is an engrossing film that shines a light on the internal struggle between Graham and Bradlee, both of whom do not see eye to eye. One of the telling scenes in when Graham is told that she is compromised by her friendship with former Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara , and Graham reminds Bradlee that he was once buddies with JFK. There are moments when the film starts preaching about the freedom of the press, and how government must be accountable. I'm sure this film is using the past to tell us about the present, but what the hell? It's never dull, and there are moments of humour. The Post is told that it will not cover Nixon's daughter's wedding due to their coverage of him!Director Stephen Spielberg has assembled a great cast which includes Matthew Rhys, Sarah Paulson, Alison Brie, Tracy Letts, Bruce Greenwood, Bradley Whitford, Bob Odenkirk and Jesse Plemons.

THE POST,18 January 2018,6/10,"Meryl Streep, blah, blah, blah. Tom Hanks, blah, blah, blah. Although the acting is well done and the direction supersedes all other aspects of the film, it's clear that instead of simply telling a story of a significant time within our past and the cover-ups done by past Presidents, Hollywood is only interested in slamming the current one. That is where the real plot lies. If you want something more real and grounded, watch ""All The President's Men"" about Woodward and Berenstein. Redford and Hoffman are far more engaging and it's not about elites with job security well in place. Most of this film revolves around the integrity of the Washington Post and the people running it. Although noteworthy, Hanks and Streep fail to make waves, and you end up pining for more of what was actually covered in the court case, which was only featured for about 5 minutes of the film. Instead of focusing on the elites and how they feel, Hollywood should aim more for a layman's perspective, someone whose job actually on the line and could be severely affected by the fallout. The ending....Watergate....blah, blah, blah. 6/10 only because the acting and direction carried a lackluster story and point of view."
THE POST,1 February 2018,6/10,"Hi.Remember when I praised Three Billboards for feeling more like a true story than the overly romanticized films we usually get with movies that actually have ye old ""based on a true story"" moniker?Exhibit A.I begrudgingly went into this movie based on a recommendation after having been completely unimpressed by the trailer. And I will say this: it is way better than the trailer made it look.I swear, it's almost like the company that put together that trailer had some kind of beef with DreamWorks and wanted the movie to flop. The trailer made it seem like a movie beating you over the head with a feminist message with the whole ""Pentagon Papers"" story being a small backdrop. I don't have any issue whatsoever with a film having a feminist message as ""women can do jobs that men can do"" should not be some kind of radical idea, but much like any film with a message, if you are lazy and heavy handed in your presentation of it, it's more of an annoyance than an inspiration. The trailers made it seem like it would be that. It's not. This is a representation of the true drama that unfolded during the publishing of the Pentagon Papers. The fact that the lead is a women for the most part is treated totally tactfully and respectfully. So the movie itself: it's fine. It's not too long and at no point is it boring or uninteresting. It's fine. There were no scenes where I wanted to leave the theater. There were no scenes where I was on the edge of my seat and entirely enthralled. It was just... fine.The story of the Pentagon Papers is an interesting one but it's not the most interesting one. If I were to describe the subject matter, it would be... fine. Tom Hanks is a great actor but he never really grows as a person or excells beyond caricature status in his role. If I were to describe his performance, it would be... fine, as were most performances in the film. The movie wasn't too long but there were definitely entire scenes that could be cut and felt like they were just in there for the trailer, such as the scene where Tom Hank's wife describes the bravery of Streep's character. If I were to describe the pacing of the film, it would be... fine.The story for the most part is well told but I could never shake the fact that if they just didn't shoot their load in some scenes by trying to over-dramatize things in order to foster a feel-good moment, it would be far more intriguing. This isn't the kind of movie that needed to end with jubilant music after a ""we won"" moment. If I had to describe the way that the story was handled, it would be... fine.Most of the camera work serves the film very well and wasn't distracting, but there were some shots that were a bit jarring and seemed to be less of a story building tool and more of a ""look what I can do"" moment. If I were to describe the direction, it would be... fine.The only part of the movie that rose beyond the realm of ""fine"" was Streep's performance, who was completely engrossing and believable in her role. She is a mid-20th century woman who never imagined being the head of a company, but after her husband passed away she feels obligatied to head the mantle of the company she loves. Already in over her head, she now has to deal with the impending IPO of her company and the potential company-ruining decision of publishing the Pentagon Papers against the obvious wishes of the Nixon White House. This is a woman who is in a constant state of stress and Streep wears it all on her sleeve. She was her typical brilliant here. Unfortunately one fantastic performance, especially one from someone we just expect fantastic performances from, isn't quite enough to lift the simply okay nature of the rest of the movie.It was fine."
THE POST,2 April 2020,10/10,"This movie has a very simple plot but the story telling was superb. The acting is extraordinary. The dining room scene was my favorite. Meryl street is a treasure, always."
THE POST,13 August 2018,6/10,"Does Meryl Streep need yet another Oscar? She's been nominated 21 times since 1979, three times for supporting performances, the rest for leading actress. And she has won the Oscar three times for Iron Lady, Sophies Choice, and Kramer v. Kramer. Streep has been hailed as the world's best living actor and will surely rank among the all time best. It seems that all she has to do is appear in a movie and she becomes an Oscar favorite.And so it was this year with The Post, Steven Spielberg's drama detailing the second chapter in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in the early 70s. After the Nixon administration successfully brought an injunction against the New York Times for starting to publish the massive Pentagon study of the Vietnam war, the Washington Post obtained the papers and then the paper's new publisher, Katherine Graham, had to make an existential decision about whether to pick up where the Times and left off and risk the legal hell that the Nixon administration was sure to bring upon them. We already know the outcome, of course, as history tells us that Ms. Graham did indeed approve the publication of the papers. And, of course, Nixon did threaten her and the paper with treason charges. However, shortly after the government began their crackdown, newspapers all over the country picked up the ball and began to publish their own stories based on the papers. At that point, the toothpaste was well out of the tube and wasn't going back in. Shortly after, the Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, determined that the rights of a free press transcended the privacy rights of the government and that the first amendment was not to benefit the governors, but rather the governed as a necessary and important way to counter the improper use of government power.The reason to see this movie is not because it is exceptionally well done. In fact, although nominated for Best Picture, it definitely does not deserve it. But the picture should be seen because of how relevant it is to today's political world. As our unfit President labels any press institution that remotely criticizes him (or has the audacity to actually report his bad behavior) 'Fake News', the first amendment rights to a free press are under attack. I never anticipated that in my lifetime I would be witnessing the systematic destruction of one of the few institutions capable of stopping the accumulation of fascist power. And yet, Trump, and his mindless minions actually claim that he has the power to shutdown those news organizations that he does not like, simply because he is the President. That this is frightening is an understatement. But the value of this movie is that it shows what can, and should, happen when a President claims undue power. Nixon's attack on the press was halted by the Supreme Court. Forced to adopt other means, he sent third rate burglars into Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist office and the Democratic Party Headquarters in Watergate. Those actions eventually brought him down. We can only hope that Trump's assaults on the press will have similar effects.So, the reason to see this movie is because it is astonishingly topical. Some of the lines used by politicians on both sides are almost verbatim quotes of statements heard today. The arguments are not just similar, but nearly exactly the same. The good thing about all that is that, 45 years ago, the press survived and corrupt power fell. The bad thing is that we seem not to have learned a damn thing and, miserably, we are letting history repeat itself.But having said that people should indeed see this movie because of its relevance to current day politics, I don't think it is a particularly good movie for several reasons.In the first place, I don't understand why the movie is about the second chapter in the story, the Washington Post story, instead of the original publication of the papers by the New York Times. I get the fact that there is a gender story underlying the Washington Post story. Katherine Graham had just inherited control of the Washington Post newspaper because, after both her father and her husband died, she was the senior family member available. And I understand that she had a horrendously difficult, and risky, decision to make in picking up where the Times had been stopped. She was likely exposing both her family and her employees to potential treason charges that could have destroyed everything she and her family had built up. But the decision by Sulzberger, of the New York Times, to originally begin the publication and then to fight the Nixon administration for the right to continue, seems to me to be an even bigger decision. The Times took the initial, very risky, step, and yet, aside from a mostly irrelevant 2003 television movie (The Pentagon Papers), there has been no movie describing the family and business crisis that had to have happened at the Times. Theirs was the riskier decision, so where's the movie about Ellsberg and the New York Times? In short, I think we're not seeing the best and most interesting story here.And then, there is simply the problem of Meryl Streep's fame. Graham is new to her role as leader of the Post and there are many scenes in the movie where she shows indecisiveness and inability to speak up, especially in a room full of men. Meryl Streep, on the otherhand, we know has no problems taking on nearly any situation. Whether it is the British government (Iron Lady), the fashion world (Devil Wears Prada), or deciding which of her children should live (Sophies Choice), Streep moves her characters forward forcefully - they are not weak. So when she plays a character that has difficulty making decisions, it is not convincing. Not because the character couldn't be weak, but because Meryl Streep doesn't play those kinds of characters! In the movie, there is a critical, climactic scene where she, as Graham, makes the immediate and final decision to go ahead and publish their story in the morning's paper. She is in a room full of men, dressed in what appears to be her bathrobe. They have just had heated conversations about the importance of the decision and the possible consequences which include the complete loss of the paper, jail sentences for the leaders, and unemployment for hundreds of workers. Graham, on the phone, pauses for just a few seconds, furrows her brow, hesitates a couple of times, and then says to publish. She hangs up the phone, and announces that she is going to bed.The scene may or may not be accurate, and it very well may be what Katherine Graham did. But it is not what Meryl Streep would do. We would have more understanding of what went through her mind to get to that decision and, here, we have nothing. It is unfortunate that actors end up getting typecast, but they do. And it is difficult, often, for the viewer to separate the character from the actor. In this case, though, Streep shouldn't be playing Graham. As fine a job as Streep did, this isn't best actress material for her, because it isn't the right role for her. I don't fault Streep so much as Spielberg for casting her.So, there you have it. The movie is worth seeing because of its relevance to contemporary politics. But it is a highly flawed movie because it is the wrong story with the wrong actress. All of that makes it difficult to rate, but I'm inclined to give it just 3 stars."
THE POST,19 April 2019,5/10,This movie wasn't as good as some of the other movies we have watched in this class. I did like how enthuastic this movie was. The filmmaker is telling us not to always trust the journalists because they don' t always tell the truth. I knew that the watergate burglary was a big deal in this time period. This part of history is something that does interst me. I have seen other movies in this time period. I have not seen any other movies by this director. I have not seen these actors in other movies. I do think the actors in this movie were not great. I didn't like how energetic the actors in this movie were. This is not a movie I would have watched on my own time. I would not reccomend this movie to any one.
THE POST,19 January 2018,9/10,"I agree that the casting of Katharine Graham as a gentle ingénue to the hard world of newspaper publishing was not historically accurate, but since when are movies pure history?Having Meryl Streep grow into her battle armour was much more interesting.I hope this movie encourages whole generations of smug millennial know nothings to discover why the hard fought battles of the ""boring"" past were fought, and why they still need to be fought.The historical subject matter on the face of it is not substantive, elaborate or particularly riveting in its execution, but Spielberg is as ever the master storyteller and his writers were brilliant. Ah. the magic of a bygone era of not just the smell of hot type, the clatter of Linotype setters and thundering presses that would shake entire buildings when they started up, but of the people who could actually read, spell, knew grammar, research and (unbelievably) check facts! Facts they did not have to perpetually ask someone else to confirm or guess at, but who had a breadth of knowledge that came from being interested, curious and aware. No putting on a huge act of knowing, because you could rely on an audience to know nothing and believe anything delivered with confidence!Lets not forget the long lost audience that also understood how important education and free speech is to a real (not faux) democracy."
THE POST,19 April 2019,6/10,"It seems somewhat surprising that 2017's The Post marks the first time that Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks have all collaborated together. From this triumvirate of living screen legends, one expects near perfection, even in a project whipped up in as quick time as this political drama, a watchable if slightly more staid Spielberg production.
The Post acts almost as a precursor to Alan J. Pakula's All The President's Men, telling the story of the Pentagon Papers and how The Washington Post battled with Nixon's White House to uncover shady government secrets over the Vietnam War. Meryl Streep is Kay Graham, the first female owner of a major American newspaper, whose job, we are led to believe, mainly involves high-class socialising and cagey board meetings where her gender is looked upon with raised eyebrows. The Post charters Graham's legal battle for the freedom of her paper, helped by her boisterous editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks).
In many ways, The Post left me feeling slightly disappointed. Here, Spielberg is very content in his craft, almost to the point of complacency. The film is entertaining enough but lacks the edge of some of the director's better political dramas like Lincoln. Though The Post is very much a period piece (the attention to detail of the era is satisfying), its commentary is clearly intended to echo the climate of today, where the office of the President of the United States stands even more overt in its quashing of the free press. Whilst there is no denying the importance of the message, it's one dealt with little subtlety in this film, with characters frequently quoting the First Amendment and uttering melodramatic statements of responsibility. The Post feels far too much like it's trying to say something, weighing the film down even amongst the capable direction and talented ensemble.
I also found Streep's performance to be underwhelming, her understated delivery bordering on passionless. Hanks is far more impressive, giving Bradlee an enjoyable level of gravitas. Even then, however, the characters in The Post never feel particularly convincing, mere products of the plot rather than engaging figures in their own right. There is also a distinct lack of tension, where even at points of climax in the narrative, the film feels stuck in a sedate vacuum, finally ending in a cadence that seems to come all too quickly and with a little too much Amblin-schmaltz.
That being said, The Post is still a very competent drama that, even in the face of its problems, remains voraciously watchable. There is no denying the talents of the team behind this film; whilst the subject matter never quite convinces you that it wouldn't be better as a documentary, Spielberg still has a good hand on the storytelling and there are some great turns by members of the ensemble cast (Bob Odenkirk's performance feels the most genuine the film gets). John William's score is a complimenting addition, as is Janusz Kaminski's camera, littered with wide shots of muted colours that nostalgically remind one of vintage Spielberg work.
In the end, The Post is no masterpiece; it's standard, uninspiring drama that always falls slightly short of the skilful team behind it. The points it raises boast relevance; perhaps The Post needs a less clumsy and rawer delivery, but it's a message that still feels important when told even with middling capability. Though it certainly won't be remembered as a Spielberg, Streep or Hanks classic, The Post is still an able piece of filmmaking that could be a nicely unchallenging evening watch."
THE POST,10 January 2021,8/10,"It's rare to find a good movie that feels so realistic and not dramatized. It's slow paced but has its own intensity and a great story.I must say - there's a couple cringe moments that feel fake and awkward... like the part after the SC hearing where Kay is walking down and there's a bunch of women coming to meet her and kinda just stick their faces toward her. We already got the message naturally through the placement of Kay at the top, and this scene just feels exaggerated."
THE POST,25 September 2018,8/10,"""The press is for the benefit not of the governors, but of the governed...""Never a truer word spoken, though a hugely debatable sentiment within today's rather one-eyed, less than transparent media, I'd suggest.I'm sure I'm not alone in welcoming the return of the master of popular story telling, Steven Spielberg.His latest piece, The Post, chronicles the uber-tense set of circumstances leading up to the enormously brave decision by the 'Free Press' to publish a huge number of leaked documents revealing successive U.S Governments' cover up of the truth behind the Vietnam War.Daniel Ellsberg, an American military journalist stationed in the thick of the combat, returns to his homeland determined that the U.S Government's on-going thirty year deception of its public should no longer be allowed to continue, and makes the bold decision to make available reams of classified national defence information to The New York Times, who in turn proceed to publish many of the files.This is indeed a courageous move for both Ellsberg and The New York Times, but one which will soon be closed down by way of a court injunction.Meanwhile, the new Editor of The Washington Post, Ben Bradlee (a slightly darker role for the usually squeaky clean Tom Hanks), is determined to make a splash for his paper, and despite the injunction hanging over all of the country's press, when opportunity presents itself, he is undeterred and decides, against much legal advice, that The Washington Post will show no reluctance in publishing more of this classified content.This is all well and good, but Bradlee's decisions must be approved by not only a board of directors, but more importantly, by the paper's slightly reluctant owner, Kay Graham (a top drawer performance from the ever reliable Meryl Streep).Such a predicament will inevitably lead to much hand-wringing and soul searching.Set to the backdrop of civil unrest and a rapidly swelling anti-war sentiment amongst the people, Spielberg's film is an absolute masterclass in tension and suspense. Not only is this a race against the clock, but a test of nerve and one big collective wrestle with morality. Very much a case of the people versus the State.We only have to look at the more recent actions of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden for their 'so-called-treachery' against their respective Governements, to know that anarchy, the distrust of authority and the quest for justice are very much alive and well in modern society, but the revelation of The Pentagon Papers (as the leaked Vietnam files were to become known), was, in 1970, a somewhat unprecedented action, and one that raised the moral dilemma: To whom must one be more dutiful? To the people, or to one's own Government?This painfully awkward scenario is quite brilliantly captured by the cast, but in particular through the performances of Hanks, and especially Meryl Streep.Streep's portrayal of Kay Graham is one of a woman who initially, despite being the Paper's owner - albeit by default - seems to lack authority amongst her peers, and the courage of her own convictions in such a male-dominated environment. However, over the course of the film, she gradually grows into the role and the responsibility that it entails, and in the face of huge opposition by much of her paper's board of directors, she wrestles gamely with her own conscience, all too aware of the potential implications, to ultimately come to what she feels to be the right decision.It's a superb, nuanced portrayal of a gradually empowered woman who never sacrifices principles to gain authority.Spielberg once again teams up with legendary composer John Williams, whose score is bold and influential, yet never overpowering. Just another example of the pair's perfectly complimentary partnership in film.The Post is a piece that examines morality and just what it means to uphold the Constitution of the U.S.A in the face of potential severe national threat, and it's all done with Spielberg's trademark energy, heart and quite brilliant characterisation.A must see.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WarwardWolfBlog"
THE POST,17 September 2020,9/10,"As a journalist, what I liked most about The Post (2017) is that it portrays very well the relationship between the managing editor of the paper, the owner and the other members of the Board of Directors. There is a constant tension between the journalists' need -and lust- for good, important, information to give to the public, and the fact that newspapers are businesses who need revenue and are usually owned by people who have also connections and loyalties to part of the political stablishment.
This tension is what makes newspapers both useful to the status quo and necessary for democracy, specially if it is solved in favor of the public interest, and it is well described in the context of the release of the Pentagon Papers.
I also liked that, unlike other films about journalism, who seem to exaggerate the role of the reporter, this one does right to other members of the collective affair that is the making of a newspaper, from the intern, to the style corrector, to the printing and packaging staff,
It also conveys the thrills and excitement that feed all of those who are lucky enough to have the best profession in the world.
I didn't give it a 10 because of the somewhat confusing first 10-15 minutes of the film, when for the most part you didn't know who was who. Not a great intro.
Otherwise, I found it flawless."

THE POST,19 April 2021,1/10,"Back then it was just the Pentagon Papers floating around out there. Now we've got the IRS Papers, The FBI Papers, The DOJ Papers, and The State Department Papers...all kinds of classified stuff that's been unclassified, floating all out there but you can't get these liberal liars to notice. (They lie by omission.) Bet you couldn't get any of these artful thespians to make a relevant movie about what's really been going on the past few years, because it would land their liberal ex-presidents and other elected representatives in water. They like pretending that their actions during the Trump Presidency didn't exist...and they'd rather focus on what was (to them) some sort of 70's glory days instead. I wonder if we could get old Hanks would to play Christopher Steele, or maybe Peter Strok? Probably not. And maybe Meryl could play Lisa Page. You think? Time to force both Spielberg and Hanks into retirement. Those two are done IMHO. Now they're nothing but a couple of glorified retreads. And Meryl's a nonentity these days. She can come or she can go. Doesn't matter. I just think one set of liberals making a movie about another set of liberals in redundant. Kinda like the math equation (liberals x liberals = liberals/squared). Both the Post and the Times have outlived their relevancy."
THE POST,26 January 2018,8/10,"'The Post' is written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer (who both also wrote 2016 Best Picture winner 'Spotlight') and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is based on the scandal that surrounded the publication of the Pentagon Papers by both The New York Times and later The Washington Post in 1971. This all begins when Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), a military analyst, copies the classified documents on the US involvement in Vietnam when he realizes the government has been blatantly lying to and misleading the public for decades. As a result, he gives some of the papers to The New York Times to publish which leads to the Nixon administration prohibiting them from publishing any further documents regarding the Vietnam War citing violation of the Espionage Act as the reason. This of course leads to uproar over the fact that the President is essentially violating the First Amendment rights of the press. Due to this, Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep) and Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) of The Washington Post decide that in order to uphold Freedom of the Press and keep power in check they must get hold of the Pentagon Papers and publish them themselves even if it means they go to jail. Perhaps the most impressive thing about 'The Post' is that Spielberg and co were able to get it made in just a few months ans still have the final product be this good - That's not to say this film is amazing but the fact that it's at least good is quite an achievement given how swiftly its production was. The most impressive aspect of the movie itself is the lead performances by Hanks and Streep. Although Hanks gives a commendable turn this is Streep's movie who gives a very nuanced portrayal of the first woman to own a major US newspaper. Graham not only reluctantly inherited the paper, which was a big undertaking in itself, but then had to contend with the prejudice that came with being a woman in a position of power at a time when it was very rare and frankly frowned upon. Meryl manages to depict all of this perfectly.The massive ensemble cast is full of talented familiar faces including Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Bradley Whitford and Carrie Coon who all give noteworthy supporting performances here. The only flaws the film has are a lack of emotional involvement in the story and the pacing which is rather slow sometimes. These both could be due to Spielberg rushing to get the film out on time due to it being timely which it definitely is when the current President constantly tries to undermine the integrity of the press. One thing I did find amusing about 'The Post', in a good way no less, is how it ends with the break in at the DNC as if setting up 'All the President's Men' a la modern blockbuster franchises when setting up cinematic universes. This works brilliantly because 'The Post' is essentially a prequel to that classic film."
THE POST,23 January 2018,7/10,"There will always be issues regarding stories based on historical facts and/or events, no matter how well told. The more details from the past there are, the more difficult the task. That of course if you decide not to do just a re-enactment for a documentary perhaps. There's always a threat of over glorifying the main characters because they're the good guys. So there is a forced perspective. Now. If they'd made the film from a different perspective, say, Robert McNamara, there would be completely dissimilar feel to it. However, leaving that aside, no matter the historical accuracy, the story itself was well told. Though the beginning seemed to lag a bit, it gained and kept the momentum later on. Acting was, for the most part, in check with the reality, though perhaps not necessarily realistic per se. Not to say the acting was bad or even mediocre. No. The team, most all decorated veterans, are professionals in the field, to say the least. There are some moments of greatness, but those are maybe too fleeting, because though the situation is tense, it's still somewhat mundane considering the job of being in the news business. The main problem with the characters seem to be that they're all somewhat chameleons and everyone is a little bit of everything - a bit of a common person, a bit of a celebrity, a working person, an idealist etc. And they shift within those parameters and therefore become bit of a blur so that even though they're the good guys, you still perhaps don't quite root for them as one should. There are still a few somewhat more emotional scenes which come out thanks to the prowess of the cast. Visually there's very little to complain about. The setting and costumes and props are all authentic. Colour grading is very well done and the overall texture of the film helps to get into the feel of the period. The musical score supports the scenes and adds to the atmosphere and tension. It's not over done though isn't necessarily to my liking in the sense of style.Spielberg's done great job, but it ain't 'Schindler's List'. Then again you can't really compare these two in that sense. You watch it and most likely will enjoy it and perhaps even learn a thing or two, but I do not see this film as one that will be brought out as a great example for the generations to come. As a film I mean. What concerns history, we are damn quick to forget. It's even somewhat ironic that 'The Post' and '12 Strong' are both in the cinemas right now."

A small local paper picked up the torch, exercised its freedom of the press, its owner and editor risked going to jail and history turned on its heels.""The founding fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors."""
THE POST,9 April 2018,8/10,"This plot of ' The Post ' follows the exposing of the pentagon documents related with the US governments correspondence about the Vietnam war which exposed the secret real information the governors hid from the governed public.
The film is enriched with great acting performances by Meryl Streep as Kay Graham the publisher of The Post who carries the burden of taking probably the most important and game changing decision for the Washington Post and on the other hand Tom Hanks the hard headed chief editor of the paper who'd do anything to influence Kay Graham to get the ultimate decision depicted in the film.
At times you may feel a bit of repetitiveness in the flow of the story of the film and also a bit less energy charged momentum in the unfolding of the story.
But you'd easily get through it thanks to the leads.
Specially Meryl Streep whose pain and stress in front of a great decision which is kept on a balance where she has to choose between saving a great friendship that she has had with the former secretary of defense and the crucial decision of exposing incriminating and scandalous government secrets is frequently reflected from her body language and her eyes..
Watch this expecting a great film by Spielberg yet again."
THE POST,19 March 2018,7/10,"There was so much right about this movie, especially the amazing attention to period detail, that I was left wondering what went wrong and why did I feel something wrong? In the end I read another review and they hit the nail on head, it was just too heavy handed and ham-fisted. In the first few minutes the 'Moral Dilemma' was being put in place like gigantic chess pieces being set up on one of those gigantic boards. And if you didn't notice this they kept nudging you to remind you. I wanted to stand up and shout 'OK, I get it!'
It is worth watching of that there is little doubt and maybe the 'take away' from all of this is that a free press is hard to obtain and easy to lose but vital for a democracy to function. I suspect watching this movie many people might think 'oh this portrays the battle between Trump and the press' but I think that interpretation could easily be turned on its head. It could be argued from the other point of view i.e. do the media personally dislike Trump enough to skew their values to try to 'get him'. I don't know but maybe everyone should watch it with a broader view on the whole matter."
THE POST,24 January 2018,10/10,"Great movie! Excellent well-rounded story telling, nuanced depiction of the characters, in particular McNamara, possibly Spielberg's best movie. Even though I knew how it ended, Spielberg managed to build suspense. Very valuable telling of an important chapter in our history. I remember hearing about the Pentagon Papers as a child, but I never knew what they were until I saw the Ken Burns Vietnam War series. In 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had a study done chronicling all of the executive decision making regarding Indochina/Vietnam going back to the Truman administration. It covered 1945-1967, the reports were marked classified, and filed away. Then in 1971, when those reports were leaked to the press, it became known as the Pentagon Papers. I didn't realize, until the movie came out, that this was a historical record, several years old, not current. It was about the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations. None of the leaders covered in the Pentagon Papers were still in power. I did some fact check and context sleuthing of the story and found these tidbits. The leaker first went to several congressmen with the information. None wanted to get involved. This was not in the movie, but the movie was not about the leaker. I wondered who Judith was, who was mentioned at the beginning. She was Judith Martin, whom now we know as Miss Manners. Events at the end of the movie appear compressed but weren't. Here is the timeline. The Pentagon Papers started appearing in the press in June of 1971. The burglary was in June of 1972. Nixon was re-elected in a landslide in November of 1972. The conversation on the phone took place in December of 1972. What I missed in the movie were the words ""except press conferences."" The ban applied only to social events.One aspect of the movie I found particularly interesting was the cozy relationship between journalists and the leaders they were covering. Can journalists do honest reporting on close friends? At the same time, it's easier to vilify people one has never met."
THE POST,2 February 2018,7/10,"Perhaps this isn't Spielberg's best film, but it makes a powerful impact, based on a true story, and has elements of a thriller. It might, however, be more critical of the ""Washington Post"" (WP) under the surface than he or the screenwriter Liz Hannah realised. ""The Post"" seems widely regarded as a defence of the mainstream media in response to Donald Trump. We're told as it goes on that the Press should represent the people not the powerful, but it really dramatises the rival claims of moral principles and business pragmatism. This is what puts WP in a critical light.The story's turning point doesn't in fact arise from commercial calculation but seems oddly arbitrary, maybe even mischievous. Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee don't seem particularly interested in discrediting the Vietnam War.Graham, engagingly played by Meryl Streep, is shown inhabiting the different worlds of high society, hard-bitten journalism and business. Her primary role is that of businesswoman: she has to compete with 'men in suits' (she says their talk is like a foreign language) and prove herself despite their sexist attitudes. She's most concerned, though, to save her flagging paper - it's all about 'the bottom line'. Hence WP's desperation to outdo the ""New York Times"" (NYT) in reporting the Pentagon Papers (one journalist refers to the journalist Neil Sheehan, who's obtained them at NYT, by a very rude word). Incidentally, it seems WP's management didn't show its staff much respect. Bradlee is offhand with his wife (Sally Quinn, a writer), too: she looks like a maid serving refreshments when he makes their home an outpost of WP's offices.Being necessarily schematic, the film simplifies. Bradlee is portrayed by Tom Hanks as a dynamic, hard-bitten hack; he was in fact a scholarly educationist. Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), without whom there'd probably be no story, is reduced to a mere device for releasing the Papers. We get no insight into his role as an experienced activist. As the reviewer Peter Bradshaw has said, this is a fault in the film.It's hard to believe that WP journalists 'gutted' the Papers, and rattled off their copy, within 12 hours, but evidently it's true. Their old-fashioned office typewriters are a nice period detail, as are pre-computerised rows of desks and printing presses, and dial-operated phones - but we see that the USA already had hands-free phones by that time.Perhaps above all, WP's role regarding the Papers appears more significant than that of NYT. This isn't true to the facts, nor, it seems, did numerous other newspapers take their lead from WP as Katharine Graham asserts in the film. Ellsberg circulated them very widely. However, he has personally downplayed NYT's role.""The Post"" does, then, have some flaws and perhaps brings out the mixed motives of Graham and Bradlee unintentionally. Yet this reveals their complex, and real, humanity. In reality too, through the WP and NYT among others, the Papers exposed the lies of successive US administrations in defence of the Vietnam War."

THE POST,30 January 2018,,"In the era of the Nixon Presidency The Washington Post Newspaper has a choice to publish papers indicating the government has been misleading the public over the Vietnam War with the punishment potentially being prison and bankruptcy. Meryl Streep plays owner of the family newspaper opposite Tom Hank's no non sense editor in the pursuit of the truth and cost it could have on them both. Such a important interesting story is bogged down by a lengthy screen time due to clunky slow narrative from the script that unfortunately dose not use it's time entertainingly enough to engage the audience at all times. 
The first act contains many elements that no matter how interesting aren't that essential in the moving forward at any exciting pace. The film directed by the master Steven Spielberg suffers from a lack of excitement from someone so achieved with the first hour made of countless dolly pan shots and simplistic coverage. Later on some more interesting shots in the crucial dialogue scenes get nice subtle direction and impressive mood setting angles which helps the emotion and flow of the film. Many shots you could have envisaged Hitchcock using in many of his closed intimate scenes back in the day. Streep and Hanks hand in engaging performances but never have the goods in the script to deliver stand out or memorable roles. The film in itself is extremely important in reminding us all of the importance of the free press in era of time that looks in many ways to have come full circle in Washington in terms of suppression of the media. 
A nice touch ending also indicates the irony of the film's message that is imprinted in history."
THE POST,29 January 2018,8/10,"I walked into The Post not knowing anything about it except that Meryl Streep and some other stars are in it and that a Facebook friend had complained earlier that day about how bad it was. Had I known that it was a film about a newspaper, I probably would have skipped on it, but in my ignorance I sat down and came away thoroughly impressed.The film follows the true story of Kay Graham (Meryl Streep), publisher of The Washington Post in the lead up to and publishing of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. When an unknown source delivers the leaked documents to their office, executive editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks) springs at the opportunity to make a name for the Post.In a film filled with good acting, our two leads stand out with engrossing performances: Streep's tentative conviction offsets Hanks's frenetic passion to wonderful effect. Their ""unromantic love story,"" as writer Liz Hannah described it in an interview with IndieWire, forms much of the heart of the story, and I expect the upcoming award season to treat them well. I will note, though, that many of the other characters in this story are fairly uninteresting, as aside from the two leads, the cast is primarily men in suits sounding yeas and nays to this and that. While the story often does not need them, I would have preferred a bit more from them.I must commend the consistently inconsistent Spielberg for his work on the film. This man moves between masterpieces and schlock with disturbing frequency, and The Post is likely one of his better accomplishments. Shot on film, The Post has a firm sense of time and place: from the opening shots of a stormy Vietnamese jungle through scenes of board meetings and newsrooms, I was thoroughly convinced that the events were taking place right in front of me. On a more technical level, The Post makes good use of colors, blocking, and of light and shadows to help tell its narrative, and it accomplishes quite a bit through its visuals.The real-life Kay Graham was the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and The Post takes full advantage of that fact to address workplace sexism. Throughout the film, men offer Kay condescending smiles and agree with her as if speaking to a child; other women are often talked over and disregarded. Beyond this, much of the film's tension arises from the New York Times Co. v. United States court case which threatened the freedom of the press in 1971. Given today's political climate, I don't know that this film could have been at a better time.The Post is not a movie for everyone. There are no fight scenes or tearjerking deaths and barely any music to rouse the audience. Much of the film consists of beautifully shot scenes of characters talking, and viewers are likely to sour from its ambitious-yet-lethargic setup. Regardless, I recommend it for people who can enjoy slow movies, as it has plenty to offer - perhaps more than we can even know right now."
THE POST,27 July 2020,2/10,"I was interested in seeing what Spielberg would make of the Pentagon Papers - also this had Tom Hanks (good) and Meryl Streep (whom I have just seen too often!).
The start was fine - war in the jungle - then we meet Robert McNamara (the guy with the stacomb, in the words of LBJ). The Ellsberg (for yes, it was he who was reporting in Vietnam!) takes some documents to be photocopied in what appears to be a hippy cell. We know he shouldn't be doing this because the music tells us so.
Then we move to a bedroom where some woman wakes up with a start!! The foot of her bed is covered with heavy documents - best place to store one's reading matter. After some telephone calls and a chat with a young man (who he?) she goes to a restaurant. She is so distracted she walks into a chair and knocks it over. In my entire long life I have never seen this happen - but it's our Meryl so it must be true.
She then has some class of a conversation with some fellow who is reading a newspaper - THE END - for me at least. Couldn't understand a word they were saying - everything is spoken with a dying fall...and really couldn't care less."
THE POST,7 September 2020,7/10,"A couple of the movies I have rewatched recently, in part because I enjoy them, but in part because they are just so good, have been ""All the President's Men"" and ""Spotlight."" I'm sure if you are interested in this movie, you either already have seen the others, or know about them. Thus, I won't get into them, but I will say that with those movies, and knowing that Meryl Streep (Kay Graham), Tom Hanks (Ben Bradlee) and Stephen Spielberg (director) were all involved amounted to high expectations. (Also, it should be noted that Josh Singer was is a credited writer, and he also wrote Spotlight.)With all of that weight, this should be a good movie. It was, but mostly because of Hanks, as should be expected. It was difficult at first to have Hanks being Ben Brandlee as I have Jason Robards etched into my mind as that character. But such is Hanks ability that he was able to excise that memory, if only for the duration of the movie, and did so superbly. Hanks does an excellent job driving his team forward, not quite unrelentingly, but to put out news and to see that The Washington Post was in the position to become a national paper, not just a city paper.Meryl Streep also does fine work, but unfortunately is given less to work with. While the time period of this movie is focused around ""Graham"" taking The Post public (was it really her idea? The movie never really explores that question), as well as printing the Pentagon Papers, she is given material in which she is little more than a socialite as a figure-head of the company. While the obvious sexism is present from as early in the movie as possible, it is written in such a way that she relinquishes almost all decisions until they need to be made, which only occurs in the last 15 minutes or so. Another way to say this is the movie gives us plenty of opportunity to see her make a choice, but she never really indicates that she will until she does. And that is just not human nature. So while she does well being the woman who no male really respects at that company, there is little the script gives her to allow her to change that perception.That that is where my ""not quite"" part of the title comes in. Beyond the range Hanks is given with Bradlee, and the fight his reporting team is given (there is a wonderful scene Bob Odenkirk has making a phone call to a source), the overarching topics of what government lying to the public does and as well as the pervasive sexism even to women in power are never deeply explored. In the currently political situation we find ourselves in the US (and other countries), this would be a worthy exploration. Sadly this movie shies away from that exploration, and it lesser for it.With all that said, this movie does end with a nice nod to ""All the President's Men"" which I found enjoyable. I am also glad I got to see Hanks play Bradlee, though I continue to think of Robards as Bradlee on screen. I think that is more a testament to the script than it is Hanks.Overall, this is a good movie and worth watching, but it lacks the drama of the other two mentioned movies. I would give it a 6.5, but will round up. A"
THE POST,9 August 2020,7/10,"Some have fairly criticized the downplaying of the NY Times role in the publishing of the Pentagon Papers. But this is a story about the Washington Post, not a full telling of the Pentagon Papers. As such, it gives an interesting view of the inside of the decisions being made and what was at stake for that paper.Meryl Streep of course does an excellent job in portraying Catherine Graham at a pivotal point in her life. Only having recently taken control of the paper, Streep displays the level of self doubt and resolve that Graham struggled with in a male dominated world. Although certainly not a coming-of-age story, it does show Ms Graham becoming the woman she would be known to be.Personally, it's difficult for me to watch these films that champion the role of the press press in democracy, having watched what news agencies have become in the world of 24 hours news cycles and the substitution of retweets for investigative journalism. But it makes a good argument for the importance of the press and the necessary courage it takes to truly make an impact. The degree of accuracy with which it does so, I will leave to other arm chair researchers."
THE POST,10 February 2018,9/10,"This movie was Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep close to the top of their respective games even if the story did write itself. In addition to being suspenseful, despite knowing the ending since 1st grade, The Post was a poignant reminder of how important the free press is to a democracy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a movie, but it should be mandatory fare for every American deluded by the notion of fake news, especially to those who have forgotten how important the First Amendment is to keeping unprincipled would-be despots in check."
THE POST,17 May 2018,8/10,"Director Steven Spielberg and actors Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep stand out in this intense, and politically relatable film. But how long will this film last as relatable?"
THE POST,13 February 2020,7/10,"I thought this was a nice film with excellent acting accompanied by an engaging political/journalistic story. A few observations if I may...
1. The film starts off a bit slow with a few scenes of drawn out uncompelling dialogue featuring both Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Surely context and character introduction are the play in doing this, but early on the The Post feels like a weighted down 747 that is using every last ounce of power to get off the runway and its nose up to cruising altitude. Though it does accomplish this eventually at about the 35 minute mark, to actually get to the film's point of lift off, requires a strong attention span and massive pre-interest in the subject on the part of the viewer.
2. To be honest I had not known much about the Pentagon Papers and the ensuing scandal that followed their completion and leak to the New York Times and Washington Post before watching this. Spielberg does an excellent job of reenacting history and displaying the weight felt by both the New York Times and Wa Post in making their decisions to publish said critical documents to the public while facing the potential consequences that could follow. Furthermore, I appreciated that it was shown how Presidents throughout history have criticized the press sharply and have had bitter disagreements with certain reporters who cover them unfavorably and dishonestly. This isn't a new practice by either the press or the President. In watching cable news today you would think this is the first time in the history of the USA a President speaks illy towards the press and that we are mere seconds away from transforming into North Korea!!... Idiots! Glad Speilberg showed some context and history regarding our current situation with the finest President in the history of America who is currently in office (the year of this writing is 2020)!
3. The film faces a small dilemma in its identity as being either a historical political thriller about the Pentagon Papers or a sneak peek into the back rooms of the then modest Washington Post and the decision of Katharine Graham to publish the leaked top secret documents or not. There are two big stories in competition with one another here: shall the Pentagon Papers be published and the history and rise of relevancey of the Washington Post. I suppose having both stories running parallel to each other works fantasticly. Upon further reflection you can't tell one of these stories without the other. So perhaps this aspect of the film succeeds greatly and keeps the viewer absorbed with the story quite aptly.
4. I'm sorry, but Meryl Streep is very strange looking. She's obviously had some work done to her face and it's quite noticeable. There's just a particular artificialness to her appearance that is rather conspicuous and memorable (not in a good way) that is difficult to look past. In addition to this, Streep in recent years has come across as incredibly snobby, condescending, and out of touch with common people. With that, I find it terribly challenging to relate to her as an actress on any level. The Post is no exception to this. Throughout this film you can sense her nose high in the air as well as the belief in herself that she is one of the most sophisticated and important people in the world today. Sure she has lots of accolades and is a gifted actress but to Joe Six Pack hanging out at Starbucks or the local watering hole, nobody gives a rat's ass about her nor her political opinions! Streep is simply an unlikeable human being.Overall I enjoyed the Post. Maybe if the early dialogue was a bit more interesting and clearer explanation were given to the story, it could've reached and 8 or a 9. It's a good film and worth a watch."
THE POST,14 January 2018,8/10,"With all the action centered on the process of obtaining and printing the Pentagon Papers, we find scion of the .01% rich (Streep's character) struggling to find direction after her father and husband both leave her in charge of a major newspaper.
We all know from history what the outcome of the political battle will be, but the conflict she faces when people she has personal relationships with (like Robert McNamara) are the very ones who will be damaged by printing the ""papers."" Will she ever be able to enjoy those relationships ever again?
Clearly that life she lived is over now. If anything this movie offers us sympathy for this ultra rich publisher."
THE POST,11 February 2018,9/10,The story is incredible. Meryl Streep was incredible. Don't miss it.
THE POST,15 February 2018,7/10,"This movie lacked the inspiration of the other historical accounts of events released for the 2017-18 Oscar Season (Dunkirk 10/'10, Darkest Hour 9/10 and I, Tonya 9/10). Bob Odenkirk added a little life to this film, but the rest of the cast was less inspired. Overall, it was pretty stiff and stodgy. Don't expect anything to wow you. Don't expect the story to be told in a cinematically inventive way. Yet, expect an accurate recreation of important events from the 60s and 70s by a still masterful director. Even Spielberg's middling efforts, such as this film, are well-staged and filmed and generally entertaining. Still, don't expect anything as good as ""All the President's Men"" 10/10 or a film that is among this director's many classics (Jaws, Schindler's, Close Encounters, ET . . .) One big mistake for those of us who lived thru the era: a scene early in the film from 1966 has Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Green River"" as its soundtrack. Now, it's a great song, but it wasn't even released until 1969!!!"
THE POST,6 May 2018,6/10,"I feel like this film was made in a hurry. The actors were eating the set most of the time, the humour fell flat and the directing was very heavy-handed. Was the movie based on a play, as the performances were very theatrical and caricatured. A lot of the shots were staged and the overlapping dialogue didn't work, at one point I thought holly Aspergers Batman why is this guy still talking it going nowhere. The rubbish about the press speaking for the people was corny and fitting from the director of ET and creator of the Indiana Jones franchise, how many billions is this guy worth? A cosy pop corn flick not worth the price of a cinema tick n should be available on Stan."
THE POST,9 April 2018,8/10,"Obviously timed to be released during a time period in our country where the freedom of and integrity of the press is under attack in ways it hasn't been since, well, the Sedition Acts perhaps, Steven Spielberg's new film is a small scale, contained masterpiece, almost more of a play than a film in many ways but nonetheless riveting and honorable in a way we could use more of in public office nowadays. Tom Hanks is compulsively watchable as editor Ben Bradlee, struggling to keep up with rival The New York Times and with the new reality of how the press and government are at odds with one another sweeping over the town he has reported on for decades. Meryl Streep is even better as Kay Graham, and her character truly has a great arc, going from feeling the shame of constantly being told she shouldn't be running this great paper to the confidence in doing what is right no matter what the personal cost.There are many notable scenes of great acting in this film, it is one that will probably be shown in classes for decades to come, but the phone scene towards the end of the movie, as well as the conversation between Graham and Bradlee where Bradlee discusses the events of the day JFK was assasinated that truly made the most of the abilities of two of our great actors. Ones made even more great because they are no longer Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, but Kay Graham and Ben Bradlee, truly, this transformation into a character and not just a projected persona of themself is something that many of our other great actors have had trouble with as their careers progress, and something both actors could easily coast on for many years, as likable and talented as they are. It is a testament to them both, Spielberg, and the material that they do not here.Spielberg is interestingly restrained here as well, from the non descript opening credits to not using the cliches of landmarks either in Washington or New York, instead letting the papers themselves be the star of the look of the film. The sequences showing the typesetting and printing of the paper itself are truly beautiful, and made me for one want to run out and buy a print newspaper for the first time in a long, long time, and that is proof positive of the power of this film.Obviously, the target of this film in a not so subtle way is the current administration, and it makes those points in a classy and not over the top way (although fans of that administation may feel differently) so that this film will not just be a product of its time, but can truly resonate as long as the press needs to report on the misdeeds of the government. Something of a modern day ""Crucible"" in that sense. Overall, this isn't a movie that will make you stand up and cheer, per se, but it will make you admire it, and I certainly did exactly that.Rating ***1/2 out of ****"
THE POST,27 February 2018,7/10,"Back in the 1960s, while the fruitless conflict in Vietnam raged on, newspapers discovered a massive cover up of government secrets that spanned four U.S. presidents. The Washington Post, lead by Katherine Graham (played by Meryl Streep) and her unyielding news editor, Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), takes on the reins to inform the public, despite challenges imposed by President Nixon, legalities, and... deadlines.The Post comments on a time sadly not so different from our own and draws connections to the importance of real news in our democratic society. The film avoids turning out too dry while dealing with complicated laws and self-important bureaucracy by trusting its characters to carry a large weight. While preachy at moments, The Post exemplifies Steven Spielberg's innate skill at storytelling, and succeeds where Best Picture Spotlight falters: displaying a thrilling drama about news reporters doing the right thing, and acting as a visceral reminder of the nostalgia that the printing press holds.The film is nominated for two oscars: Best Motion Picture and Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Both nominations have a fair chance of winning, but when considering the opposition, it is definitely not a certainty. Although upon watching The Post, one thing is for certain. Meryl Streep is an artistic master at capturing a character and performing faultlessly in their skin. Katherine Graham does not have a particularly eccentric personality. She is fairly orthodox where acting roles are concerned (not your typical Oscar role). Yet, Streep is able to spin gold from Graham's hesitant demeanor and carry a full, satisfying character arc.Tom Hanks gives a showy performance that rounds out the film with fiery passion and humor. With Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and Steven Spielberg-three cinematic powerhouses-the film is expected to be exceptional.But is it as untouchable as its top talents?Not entirely.The film is regrettably forgettable, which is especially unfortunate considering the historical content and timeless message of free speech that it celebrates. The acting is superb, the characters are somewhat interesting, and the well-paced story is captivating in the moment, but there's nothing grand to hold on to. Perhaps this has to do with the film's ending. Or perhaps the corny boastfulness that calls out in triumph as if it's the movie's own dampers the spectacle built from earlier conflicts and developments. Or perhaps it's just me.Whatever it is, let's see if The Post will last in the minds of viewers until the next Oscar bait film decides to portray a team of news reporters."

THE POST,19 January 2018,7/10,"There are 2 central story lines: First, the political and financial risks involved in publishing documents prohibited by the government. Second, the difficulties that Catherine Graham, the paper's owner, faces as a woman and a neophyte to the running of the newspaper. Where the script fails is the absence of backstory exposition about the suicide of Catherine Graham's husband. Phil Graham was a larger-than-life character, one of those people that the gods have decided to bless unfairly with a brilliant mind, dashing good looks, and a charismatic personality. He was blessed by the gods, but whom the gods destroy they first make mad. Phil Graham was a manic depressive who committed suicide. This was a soul-crushing episode, both for the Post but far more for Catherine. This needed some early backstory exposition. There was an attempt in a scene with her daughter, but it really doesn't do very much. Despite our President's estimation, Ms. Streep is not overrated. Tom Hanks is good, but I ultimately think he was miscast. He's a little too Jimmy Stewart to play Bradlee, who could order a meal in flawless French and proceed to use language that would make a sailor blush. Jason Robards in All the President's Men was a lot closer to the man. Good movie, but not great"

It could have been better if it had delved a little deeper into the basic issues - the freedom of the press and whether governments are right to tell lies in some instances. These were never really broached and the set up from the start is press good, government bad. Well things are a lot more nuanced than that. Press freedom was touched on when a supreme court judge asked whether the press would have been right to have published D Day plans before D Day; but the whole thing was disposed of in about ten seconds.We all know or could find out what the end result was here - and although the film gives us some insight to the personal decisions involved it does not provoke any real discussion of the issues involved."

Do I believe the story? Somewhat
Do I care about the story? YesMeryl Streep shows herself to be in an entirely different league than the rest of the production of ""The Post"". Her performance as Katherine Graham was nothing short of excellent, in contrast to an otherwise ""OK"" film. In particular, I appreciated the subtlety with which she showed Kay Graham's struggles in such a pivotal moment in her life, artfully displaying that character's attributes, strengths, and weaknesses as a person.As for the rest of the production, what annoyed me most was the flagrant contemporary feel of the film, with little or no attempt to capture the spirit of the 70s. The other closely related films, ""All the President's Men""; ""Frost/Nixon""; and ""Mark Felt"" all had a 70s feel, by contrast.In contrast with Streep's excellent, subtle performance, the Spielberg production was superficial, obvious, pretentious, and probably just a bit too much, with all the clever trivia that produces a visceral reaction, as opposed to a deeper reflection evoked by Streep.Still, I did go back and watch All the President's Men again -- Tom Hanks's portrayal of Ben Bradlee is not bad, but I just couldn't stop thinking I was watching Tom Hanks play Ben Bradlee. Jason Robards, on the other hand, made me feel like I was actually watching Bradlee himself.Young people in ""The Post"" had the strong look and feel of millennials, not boomers. In particular, the protest scenes looked and felt like mise en scène, with neo-hippies playacting, anxious for breaks in filming so they could run to their smart phones. By contrast, I did not have such feelings while watching another 2017 film, ""Mark Felt"".In summary, Meryl Streep is clearly in another league than her contemporaries in The Post. I do like Spielberg & Hanks, but the former is so visceral, obvious, and pop -- perhaps I like him a bit less than I did before watching The Post. And while Tom Hanks is likable, for years I've felt he was just a notch below such greats as Meryl Streep, Daniel Day-Lewis, Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johannson, and Denzel Washington. I consider Tom Hanks to be a very good actor, capable of some great performances, with the right story, script, direction, and supporting cast. With that in mind, I hope Hanks and Spielberg never work together again, as I feel their best collaboration is behind them."

Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks give their expected creme-de-la-creme performances as Washing Post Publisher Kay Graham and Editor Ben Bradlee. The film is a slow moving drama (not a lot of action or thrilleresque qualitites) but suprisingly captivating nonetheless.
The core of the plot is Graham's decision whether or not to publish a story about leaked Pentagon Papers implicating four US Presidents in willful negligence and duplicity regarding the War in Vietnam. While this decision would be enough of a challenge....add in the fact that Graham was the first female publisher of a major newspaper AND that her family-founded newspaper was experiencing financial instability at the time.
Part of Justice Black's opinion: ""In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill it's essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government"". [4.5/5]"

I have never understood why anybody ever makes any character in any movie or show a writer, because I can't think of anything less interesting than watching somebody write. I'd rather watch people play poker on TV. There's more action in card games than word processing.Then there's Meryl. Something else I have never encountered in this life is a movie with Meryl Streep that doesn't put me to sleep faster than NyQuil. I knew going in this movie would move the speed of continental drift, and I don't feel like I was in the slightest bit wrong. It's another movie for award season and people who had their personalities shot off in the war. If you enjoy staring at walls, you'll love this movie.

No, no, no. Next long hair (sure, the film's depiction was short and average length for these times, but not for then.). The 60s early 70s was for the youth long hair vs short. 99% of older guys didn't have ""long"" hair. For example, during those times there were Beetle wigs (Beetles: John, Ringo etc, style hair) and the wigs hair was short compared to now.Frankly I'd sooner read historical documents on the subject than be insulted by this shoddy effort of a film."

I'm loathe however to slate Speilberg who in a strange way has been like a guiding oracle for me since childhood and I prefer to view this as a worthy entry in his amazing career. 
The movie is very good, I mean it's attention to period realism in splendid. Solid performances all round apart from Hanks' throaty growl at times. It has Speilberg written all over it and boasts a minimal John Williams score. Can you believe they're still doing this together? God I dread the day when this partnership ends. Take this as a moment in time and try not to see the parallel with the snowflake movement of the modern news machines. It's hardly one of the greatest movies of all time as I read in one review. I suspect there was an eager beaver liberal penning that review. But it's classic Speilberg although I cannot help feeling it had a touch of Fincher's Zodiac sprinkled throughout."
THE POST,21 February 2018,1/10,"This bland account of the Pentagon Papers story is rushed and does not do its subject matter or characters much justice. There were so many angles to approach, but it ends up a muddled piece of moralizing. 
The script is over-stylized and at times unintelligible. I found the directing bordering on frivolous, even irritating. The saccharine score almost made me laugh at times. However, very nice printing press scenes provided occasional welcome breaks from the rest of the action."
THE POST,19 February 2018,7/10,The Post is a very good movie and deserves it Best Picture nod. It had a slow 1st act but the 2nd act was great and kept you very much captivated. Meryl Streep is deserving of her nod but I am surprised that Tom Hanks did not get nominated nor did Spielberg for Director. It also a a very well known and talented cast and I was surprised that more people kept popping up that I knew. It simply is a great story based off a true story.

THE POST,15 January 2018,10/10,"I see that the Trumpsters are rushing to diss this movie; apparently having not lived through the events depicted, or having swallowed current right-wing myths hook, line and sinker. Never mind, they are the minority and are completely unconcerned that their man continues to spout hate, vulgarities and nonsense. The movie is well-acted, fast-paced and completely truthful -- take it from those of us who were around at the time. The 1st amendment is the FIRST amendment for a reason; to protect us from corruption and lies in government. This is the beating heart of this wonderful film. Hanks and Streep are completely believable, and Bob Odenkirk's performance is particularly compelling."
THE POST,19 January 2018,5/10,"About the time Trump entered office (October 2016) the script was awarded. Nixon's blocking The Post reporters and photographers from covering White House events in the movie is clearly inserted as a parallel to Trump's singling out of CNN.That said, there was a lot of good talent that participated in the picture and I really enjoyed the build up, via the paper production process and music, that heightened the importance and drama of the choice to publish."
THE POST,18 March 2018,7/10,"Steven Spielberg's new movie is not for everybody, that is certain.It's one of his most dialogue-heavy works, the entire movie is basically made up of only dialogue. Even the music is used very sparsely (John Williams didn't have that much to do here), making most of the movie very quiet. I liked production design and direction. Steven Spielberg is a filmmaking veteran and you see that very clearly. For a dialogue-heavy drama, we have advanced, yet fitting cinematography. Entire scenes (e.g. the first time we see Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep together on screen) are made out of one camera position just watching what happens. What you see goes hand in hand with what you hear: It's calm, yet focused and incredibly well executed. Sound editing and mixing are also very high-quality; you almost feel immersed by the simple offices that the movie plays in.There's not too much to be said about acting. It was brilliant, at least inside the methodical cage that is mainly offices and serious business talk.What I didn't enjoy that much was the first half. It was lengthy, boring and didn't really have too much impact on the main plot. Loads of back stories and (what seemed to be) preparation for the exciting second half, except you would perfectly understand that second half if you had just tuned at about 45 mins into the movie. I would have preferred movie that stretches some parts I found more important but is shorter overall. The prologue for example was amazing and it did a good job setting the scene and tone, I wouldn't mind it having lastet a little longer.All together, it's a great movie because of Steven Spielberg's technical expertise, because it doesn't completely fail at making a dialogue-heavy drama entertaining and because of a nice cast.
The story is layed out unevenly, the second part is exciting and suspenseful, the first half is a bore."
THE POST,28 February 2018,7/10,"The film is weak in the beginning, not by the rhythm but by scenes not so important for the history, bringing some confusing dialogues and exaggerated information. Script is a problem because of it. As Spielberg's techniques continue, I think it's getting a little annoying to the soundtrack along with unnecessary suspense close-ups. All the actors are well, have their spaces in the film, do not just stand between Meryl Steep and Tom Hanks, which I think very, cast very well chosen.
It's not the best Spielberg movie by far, nor the best movie of the year, it's a movie with good and bad times. For those who like Spielberg they will like it."

THE POST,12 January 2018,7/10,"I enjoyed this movie. It must be kept in mind this is a movie, a drama and not a documentary. As such, this is a good movie. The pace is good and we follow the events and decisions that had to be made. Meryl Streep shows why she wins Oscars, the self-doubt and hesitation that she portrays was a masterful performance. Tom Hanks' character was serviceable and pretty one note, and the only nice character turn was near the end after speaking to his wife about the heroics of Streep's character.A number of people said the movie was too preachy and was worried about that before seeing the movie. I didn't find that at all after watching the movie. Yes, verses a documentary, this movie did have a theme and message, but I knew what this movie was about freedom of the press before going to see it. I grew up in that time period, so I knew the outcome also."
THE POST,20 April 2018,4/10,"The problem with this film is that it contradicts itself.

THE POST,1 August 2018,10/10,"Spoiler alert -- for those old enough to remember when this story, and the story the Washington Post would break soon after, it's not a spoiler. For those of you who weren't born yet, it is.Spielberg ends the movie with an allusion to the Watergate Hotel break-in. I remember Watergate. I barely remember the Pentagon Papers except that their publication was mentioned on the evening news.The attention to period detail is impeccable. As a former typesetter (offset/phototypesetting) I was amazed that the linotype machines got to play a significant part. Yes, I did see them in action when I went to a job interview, and learned the typesetter needed to be able to proofread on the fly reading something upside down and backwards (like Snell shorthand, a job skill that isn't appreciated anymore).Hanks, Streep, Rhys, Paulson, Whitford and a cast too long for me to name were all spot on. The juxtaposition of Kay Graham's battle for her newspaper and Daniel Ellsberg's battle to get the truth out about the Vietnam War being a failed cause (I had no idea Ellsberg was actually in combat in Vietnam), along with the legal machinations preventing publication are riveting.If you think what we see on televised/cable news, or on the internet news, is true reportage, think again.This film portrays what the Fourth Estate is all about, and it's so timely to watch it now.And for those born after these times? After you watch this, watch ""All The President's Men"" with Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, and Hal Holbrook among others.Both of these films are required viewing for anyone who is a journalism student, teacher -- or a journalist who is below the age of 50.Isabeau Vollhardt

THE POST,8 February 2018,8/10,"It takes a slightly bigger pair than the one I'm working with to say revolving this movie around the release of the pentagon papers was ""burying the lede,"" but still I can't help but wish they focused this story on the the inner workings of the Washington post across the 60's-80's (if not just making this a straight biopic on Katharine Graham - one of the most interesting figure of that time!) as opposed to centering it around the release of this single publication.As powerful as this movie was, it only fueled my appetite to see the rest of the story told. The times and subject matter is far too vast for a single movie format, and would have been ideal as a mini series (a medium in which we already know Spielberg and Hanks' excel). Fortunately, the movie ended in a way that left things open for the option of a sequel and perhaps even trilogy. The possibility alone is enough to skew my judgment of this film favorably.The acting was masterful and the story was thoughtfully shot - but it was directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks so lets face it, we already took that for granted. Though, it's worth mentioning that the most emotionally engaging and possibly best performance was surprisingly from Bob Odenkirk who is dangerously close to earning the prefix ""my boy.""At its center, this movie was about freedom of the press and the price we must be willing to pay for truth. Early in the beginning of the film, a reporter was asked about the war - which he had just seen first hand - in the context of 'is it getting better or worse?' and his answer was ""mostly I'm surprised at how much it's stayed exactly the same."" In a movie that's about a battle fought 40 years ago, it's poignant how relevant these themes and struggles still are today.Prescriptions

THE POST,25 February 2018,,The opening song has been used so many other times before so not sure why Spielberg used this particular song which takes the audience to remember all the other movies it was used in. Not real sure why this movie was nominated for a Oscar for best pic as there is nothing special about it compared to the other nominations. Merly Streep while good really did not have very many lines and did not play any particular character we have not seen before.

I'm a European, journalist and a devoted follower of the truth.With the recent news developments on the glorification of the Afghanistan war, this film couldn't have come soon enough. It depicts the true power of the people in the high towers and the urge to keep the truth away from the public. A well needed watch on the essential meaning of freedom of speech. Streep and Hanks are good in their roles and with the unique directing touch of Spielberg, this film is an historical depiction of something we should never forget. The true power of the people of the press.I've always wondered how the American people could believe so easily all the nonsense said by those old, shady criminals in suits, with their manipulative speeches, promising a peaceful world while they where waging war behind the curtains.

We can't ignore the fact imposed by the historical moment we're living right now. The press under attack. Belittled, insulted but not ignored. No, never that. Steven Spielberg puts everything at the service of the story and the magic stroke is Meryl Streep. She creates a real life woman again, after Margaret Thatcher, Julia Childs, Lindy Chamberlain and once again she creates a fully fledged human being and this time she plays a woman without a known voice until she finds it and when she does, she uses it. I'm absolutely transfixed and moved very moved by her performance"

Yes, there are some cliches thrown out. Still, I thought the film was engaging from the very start. And, as this film poignantly pointed out, it is important that in a democracy the press must be free. Take a look at what happens to the press in a dictatorship, where the press is the ruler's sycophant. This film shows the anxiety we feel when we have to make difficult decisions that put ourselves or our family and friends in harm's way because we must choose to be ethical.We need to do what is right; however, such decisions are not always so clear cut."
THE POST,16 April 2019,8/10,"Steven Spielberg has nothing to prove as his name is synonymous with classic films with great messages. The Post is no exception to this pattern, as this film is a very gripping adaptation of this real life event. Another point that cannot overlooked is the sheer presence both Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep bring to the screen along with their interactions."
THE POST,2 February 2018,10/10,"They say life's two assurances are death and taxes.I've got a third-the acting of Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Think about it: you may not like every one of their movies, but have you ever criticized one of their performances?It comes as no surprise, then, that they each knock it out of the park in Stephen Spielberg's The Post. What is a bit of a shocker, though, is how little you notice. For, like other Hollywood gems detailing the world of print journalism (Spotlight a few years back, All the President's Men a few decades before that), The Post is more concerned with the entire front page than a single by-line. The story is the star.That story is a doozy, all the more so because it's true. In 1966, a RAND Corporation employee, Daniel Ellsberg, smuggles out an extensive, classified report showing that the U.S. Government-dating back to the Truman administration-has been lying to the American public regarding the Vietnam War. Some of the secrets have cost the lives of American soldiers. Five years later a New York Times reporter learns of the study and the paper begins running articles. They've just scratched the surface when the government, led by current president Richard Nixon and claiming the leaked information is a threat to national security, effectively sues the Times, temporarily barring it from publishing further articles on the subject.Shortly thereafter, Washington Post reporter Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) finds Ellsberg and retrieves a copy of the full report. But what does the paper do? Executive Editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks) wants to defy the government and publish more stories; everyone else wants to avoid going to prison. But the ultimate decision rests solely with the publisher herself, Katharine Graham (Streep). How does she weigh preserving national security against preserving the will of the people?This is a lot to digest, and it's not the half of it. But in Spielberg's capable hands, it all goes down easy. Thank also the smart script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and editors Sarah Broshar and Michael Kahn's ability to streamline such a dense story. At just under two hours, The Post gives you everything you want and nothing you don't. Some films about the press, including the two previously mentioned, are riveting mysteries. Their reporters investigate like detectives, peeling back layers of an ominous onion. While The Post has these elements, it hinges more on the drama of historic moments. Every impossible decision, and each grave consequence, is felt with singular force. We are constantly reminded, and amazed, that all of this really happened.Of course, we get just one side. The only government perspective, beyond the twilight threats of an appropriately creepy Nixon, is from former Secretary of Defense Bob McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). Yet this is par for the course. Spotlight never touted a clearheaded viewpoint from inside the Catholic Church.That's because films don't play by the same rules as newspapers. For a movie to be unbiased, it doesn't have to be comprehensive, just fair. And that fairness is determined, in large part, by tone. You can sense it early, even from a trailer: are the filmmakers letting you, the audience, think for yourself, or are they force-feeding you heavy-handed platitudes?The Post is principled, but never preachy-a lofty tightrope to master. It is probably Spielberg's best directing job since Munich. I'd previously thought him a bit too melodramatic for the twenty-first century; today's awards contenders are typically marked by unadulterated realism (see Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, etc.).But here, he somehow manages both styles. With each passing frame we can smell the sweat, the ink, the stress of the players; we are reliving this tangible history. At the same time, we receive subtle, cinematic pinches: actors framed to maximize drama, clever camera movements, lines delivered with theatrical conviction. We never quite forget, in the best sense, that we're watching a movie.So, what can be said? Streep has been nominated for an Oscar, Hanks should have been; the rest of the supporting cast, including Sarah Paulson, Tracy Letts and Bradley Whitford, fits like a glove; Spielberg has, yet again, rewritten his splendid career. Once more, no surprise.Which is the greatest compliment. For expecting a masterpiece is almost as rare as getting one."

THE POST,25 February 2018,8/10,"Everyone hates the press. People even hate me a nobody who feels like writing a review for a movie that at time of writing already has 233 user reviews and 344 critic reviews. Despite those feelings, despite if you follow Trumps march against ""Fake News,"" despite if you stand steady with the like of the modern press, Steven Spielberg has managed to share a suspenseful dramatic story that shows what the press should be. Meryl Streep is outperforming everyone again but this time it is very different. The character of Kay Graham is built up to be one who lacks confidence. Meryl Streep is able to radiate this lack of confidence without bringing a hint of her normally strong personality. That is until she needs to show it. Which is rare but always just at the right moment. Tom Hanks portrayal of Ben Bradlee was also very well done. While I cannot share with you the accuracy of his portrayal, can say that the energy he brings to the screen helps to balance and offset Streep's moments of shakiness. They are both followed by a wonderful group of supporting actors such as Bradley Whitford, Bob Odenkirk, Bruce Greenwood, and Michael Stuhlbarg. One man to watch out for is Jesse Plemons who portrays Roger Clark. I thoroughly enjoyed his shorter time on screen as one of the main lawyers for The Post. He has moved a long way since ""Friday Night Lights."" Time will tell how far he will go.This movie had very view bad moments. The only 2, that I felt, were at the end and had to do with Meryl Streep and her character. Both were very obvious nods to the anti-trump movement and feminism. They were small and didn't affect the overall film. But it is for that reason I question if they should had been present. Why must the platform that people use to escape the scares and frights of the world be used to shove those same concerns back into their faces? I understand that most of Hollywood and specifically Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks have been very vocal about their feelings to the current ""state of the union."" But must you force those feelings towards people who want to be entertained? While I might not think modern political commentary belong in a film of this style, the truth is I was watching a movie about freedom of speech and so the entire cast and crew are allowed to do and say what they want because it is their movie. It is their right to tell the story they want. You could also say I was watching a movie that mirrors the exact struggles we face today and that the comparison was a wakeup call.Either way I congratulate the cast and crew of ""The Post"" for making one of the best movies put to screen in a long time. This film deserves more recognition then it is currently being given. The acting, directing, cinematography, and story were all very much enjoyable and worth the watch."

Based on the events of US government's deceptions about the futility of the Vietnam War, the film composes a fine mixture of personnel involved in the office of the Washington Post and elevates their trouble as to same as the fate of the Nation. The character of Katherine Graham is excellently portrayed by one and only Meryl Streep which makes one often realise that the real protagonist of the movie is a female lead. Steven Spielberg has not only captured the fine details of the 70's but also cleverly did the montage and sequences from the tapes of the event. The film also introduces a major teaser at the end of the movie hinting the Watergate scandal. As audience, we may or may not get another movie of same sorts by Director Steven Spielberg.

Just look at the imdb score, and the many 10's, 9's and 8's it has. It really was a masterclass in hype, media bending mind control and, as ive said, pushing political narratives.

The movie requires your patience and attention in the first half where everything was built well and this will lead you to the second half which was very powerful.Steven Spielberg directed this movie beautifully. He made me care about journalism. He made me feel I was working with them. The camera movement, the lighting and the editing were perfect. Every scene is perfectly calculated & perfectly executed. There is one particular scene where 4 people are talking on the phone that I think was brilliant! Also, he built the tension well here and utilizes John Williams score in very good way.The Post is not just brilliantly directed and beautifully acted but also it is very socially relevant. It is a very important movie to watch! I can't describe more how much I enjoyed this movie. One of the best movies ever made? No. Is it one of Spielberg's best movies? I can't decide that right now. All I can say that it is one my favorites of 2017."
THE POST,7 February 2018,10/10,"I love the 'finesse' of Director Steven Spielberg in that movie. You really feel the hand of a master of cinema in the interactions, the storytelling, the ambiance, and the music choices. Well it is not a big blockbuster Hollywood action movie but it is strong cinema and a strong story with an important message.
A parallel movie to this is 'Darkest Hour' which is really related to the theme."
THE POST,22 December 2017,10/10,"The Post is a solid Hollywood retelling of the events surrounding the landmark Supreme Court case of New York Times v United States (1971), in which the Nixon Administration sought to prevent publication of documents detailing the secret history of U-S involvement in French Indochina and Vietnam. Those classified documents - the so-called Pentagon Papers - made it clear that multiple administrations were untruthful with the American public about growing involvement in a land war in Southeast Asia. The New York Times had first access to the secret papers, and Neil Sheehan wrote a blockbuster front page series that rocked political Washington to its core. But after the first part was printed, the Nixon Justice Department went to court and got a federal judge to issue an injunction forbidding the Times from printing additional stories from the classified Pentagon Papers due to national security concerns. Times executives and reporters were threatened with possible criminal charges under the Espionage Act.The Washington Post played second fiddle at first. The Times had the story, and the Post was playing catch up, but with the Times stymied, Post staffers were all hands on deck trying to gain access to the Papers or find the source. Some of the Papers were literally dropped in their laps. ""The Post"" tells the story of how the Washington Post got the first sampling of documents, how they tracked down the source, how they got the Mother Lode of documents, and how Post publisher Katherine Graham faced the decision of whether or not to publish the documents at a time when the future - indeed the very survival - of her family's newspaper was very much in doubt. Having lived through this myself as a very young Washington reporter at the time, I can assure you that the movie accurately captures the high drama of those few decisive weeks. The First Amendment really did hang in the balance. And reporters really did face the very real possibility of going to jail.Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks co-star as Graham and Ben Bradlee, and they are perfect in their roles and even better in their chemistry. Katie Graham was the owner of the Post and she made the major decisions, but Ben ran the operations. Streep captures Graham's initial doubts, indecision, and her strong will. Hanks is just as solid in his portrayal of Bradlee, who may have been the day-to-day boss at the Post, but still had to take orders from Graham. I'm not sure if Streep or Hanks ever met Graham or Bradlee, but they seem to have known them. The on-screen interaction is as good as anything Hepburn and Tracy ever did, She's the strong woman, and he's never once emasculated. Meryl Streep is going to win the Oscar for Best Actress for three reasons. First, because she's that good and deserves it. Second, because she's Meryl Streep and she's always that good. And third, because the message of this movie is a message that resonates today. When Streep accepts the award, she should thank Donald Trump and the ghost of Richard Nixon for making it all possible. There are times when the script gets a little preachy, but that's probably because it's meant to be. It's all done in vivid colors, because there's nothing subtle about our First Amendment rights and freedoms. Not back then, and certainly not now. It may at times be a bit over the top, such as one scene when Graham is leaving the Courthouse and passes what seems to be an endless line of young women who are looking up to her in hope and admiration. While that rope line of young women was an obvious exaggeration, Graham was and remains an iconic and inspirational figure and, as one famous conservative once observed, extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. Graham put herself, her fortune, and her sacred honor on the line in defense of freedom. This movie is meant to be a movie for our times, but it's a classic American tale. It's about a great metropolitan newspaper, and the fight for truth, justice, and the American way. It's about the values some of us still cling to. And high among the hierarchy of those values is that of a free people informed by a free press in an open marketplace of ideas.The message of this movie is as clear today as it was 46 years ago, in Justice Black's stirring opinion when the Supeme Court affirmed the right of the Times and Post to publish the Pentagon Papers.""In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.""This is, indeed, a lesson for our times, and for all times."

THE POST,9 August 2018,3/10,"I wanted to enjoy this film, but the forved suspense and constant scenes of thrownpaper was too distracting.The cast is incredible in this film, and watching Meryl Streep or Tom Hanks is never hard. Yet, Spielberg fell apart on this film, and took the focus away from the large issue if the film. The amount of unnecessary aggressive staredowns and cliche movie quotes became uninteresting, and the lacking display of a full story becomes clear. The plot develops well, but still I found it hard to remember that the Pentagon Papers are the real focus. Filming and overall viewership is as expected, but the director could have pulled out the stops to fill in the gaps for uninformed watchers.Overall, this is amazing for a movie fan that enjoys concerned yelling and serious adult conversations for 2+ hours. It might have been a famous historical moment for the government,but you would never know with ""The Post"""
THE POST,17 April 2018,7/10,"Well its not the best movie of the year but worth to consider. Acting is great, with that cast you can't go wrong. Its a movie that flaw from beginning to the end and you don't understand the time passing. i really enjoyed it."

In the end, it is quite a year jerker.We all know the Washington Post goes on to become a very successful national newspaper, so it's no surprise that the movie has a happy ending.It makes me want to learn about the events that occurred prior to, and after, this movie.Definitely worth your time."
THE POST,10 February 2018,8/10,"The Post was more than a normal movie directed by the amazing Steven Spielberg, proves how talented this man is in creating what no one even thinks of its success possibility for a second. Great way of putting pieces together and forming a whole, results in an unforgettable masterpiece from a brilliant story! The Post is not only a great movie but also a brave one from different aspects. The screenplay is the one makes it possible to be discussed in various fields. Identifiable characters, acceptable dialogues, understandable plot and the good one to encourage those who are interested to get involved in the story, for more involvement! That is what I call it a great way to anecdote an abnormal story as a routine, fantastic and memorable one. In some points the movie turns to be drama, with a slight piece of romance, while mostly acts like a fabulous drama/ thriller, outcome of which is a great form of cinematography and breathtaking editing. The cast performance is beyond expectations, though nothing else could be expected from the legendaries Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. John Williams's music is charming and in points you need to feel the fear, stress, joy, love, etc. his music is gonna be a good fellow for you. Through this movie you will find out what the exact position of the media is, and that is what I consider it as reason to say, this movie has been made properly, indicates what the writer and or director has had inside his mind. A good one to watch, one of the most successful movies of the year! The Post by Steven Spielberg! Written by: Amin Ghanbari"
THE POST,24 August 2018,2/10,Thank God for fast forward. Yes I understand the significance of the story but this film seemed to be more about the agony that a few rich people endured while wrestling with the idea that to publish was the morally correct thing to do. No where in this movie did it sufficiently drive home the fact that millions of people died while rich people got richer and politicians complicity lied to the people to save face.Bob Odenkirk was brilliant in the portrayal of his character. Otherwise boring performances all around.
THE POST,12 May 2018,1/10,"Painfully overacted. Streep made it annoyingly obvious that we were watching an actor. Her signature snootiness and dragged out inflections, pregnant pauses, hitched sentences, glasses fidgetting, head-in-hands dismay, stare-downs, etc etc etc...ugh, ugh, ugh....all contrived. In dusting off all her trademark-isms, she sinks the ship.Dialogue so dull it can't be resurrected...not even by Hanks. Even the suspenseful music felt contrived. A movie trying so hard to be important....thinking it was making a big difference....taking itself so seriously that it was almost humorous.Can't blame the film technique because ....well...Bob Odenkirk. He overcame all the bad cards he was dealt and rose above the abysmal film emerging as the best performer in the group."

THE POST,8 November 2019,10/10,"Thomas Jefferson said ""When the speech condemns a free press, you are hearing the words of a tyrant."""
THE POST,7 January 2018,9/10,"It should come as no surprise that Spielberg decided to put this film together quickly with Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and writers Liz Hannah and Josh Singer. In the era of Trump, the most dangerous man ever to hold the office of President of the United States, and who has declared war on all media that does not wrap him up in utter adulation or (worse) question or criticize him and his administration that seeks to turn the country into a corporate theocracy, a free press is needed more than ever before. Here is an administration that has slashed every agency created to protect our environment and the population; replaced scientists with big oil executives; replaced the head of our public school system with a woman who despises the public school system and believes in ""Christian indoctrination"" for our children (not to mention vouchers for private Christian schools); alienated our allies in the UN and NATO; called all immigrants ""a danger to society""; demands Mexico pays for a useless wall on our southern border; calls voters and states who did not support him ""the enemy"" (how many times has Trump visited California during the wildfires? Hint: Zero); declared Jerusalem as the capital of one of our only two ""allies"" left (that and Russia), thereby kicking the hornet's nest and unleashing the possibility of terrorist incidents abroad and in the US, which will be a lead up to a Middle East war that his VP and many in Congress want to allow Jesus to return; sought the end of net neutrality as the cornerstone in media control (the elimination of all media that does not allow him to run the country like a King or Dictator will surely follow); and is our very own Greg Stillson (for those familiar with Stephen King's novel) toying with nuclear weapons (""what's the use of having them if we can't use them"") and getting into countless pissing matches with North Korea. There are mornings when I am surprised to wake up. The election of Donald Trump in November 2016 will go down as the biggest stain on the history of this country.Back to the film: All involved with this sensational ""small"" (in Spielberg standards) film clearly saw the danger Trump presents to the non-right wing nut media, and the country and world, and put their hearts and souls into the project. Streep once again has mastered the mannerisms of her character in her portrayal, and Hanks fills Jason Robards' shoes as Ben Bradlee (although I also could have seen Michael Keaton in the role). Bob Odenkirk brings a touch of Jimmy McGill eccentricity to his role as Ben Bagdikian. The screenplay is genius in how it incorporates scenes of Nixon (seen in the White House as a silhouette) screaming about how unfairly he is being treated, and his threats ""not to allow the Washington Post near the White House again,"" could have easily been uttered by our current President. The President is not Above the Law. He is supposed to be elected by the people (although Citizens United has blurred that), and he is not a King. This film, as previous films such as All the President's Men and Frost/Nixon, reminds us. A free press is the cornerstone to a thriving democracy. I could not help but noticing the number of down-votes for a film that is not in wide release yet. Once again, anything that criticizes the King (in his mind) with No Clothes is ""fake news"" to the brainwashed rubes. Unless the down-votes are originating from Russia....Bravo, Mr. Spielberg, Ms. Streep, Mr. Hanks, Mr. Odenkirk. See you on Oscar night."
THE POST,22 April 2018,5/10,Lost my attention after the first 5 minutes. Typical Meryl Streep movie.
THE POST,27 January 2018,7/10,"'The Post' was an engaging film with good acting and great directing. Tom Hanks delivers an average performance that doesn't have any negatives, however he didn't bring much to the role besides a stubborn and grouchy attitude which was delivered well. Meryl streep once again delivers a great performance, throughout the film, the audience can see a shift in her attitude as she is realising that she should take more confidence in her role and ignore the ones who doubt her since she is a woman. For someone who hadn't learnt about the pentagon papers scandal before watching this movie, I feel very confident in my knowledge as I learnt a lot. As well steven spielberg added a great touch of directing with great cinematography and scenes.

THE POST,6 April 2018,3/10,"Film was nothing special.
Neither very good nor very bad"
THE POST,16 January 2018,6/10,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Post, but I couldn't help but notice how the story was lacking many aspects that I hoped Spielberg was able to pull through on. Meryl Streep's character was purely there as an expositional tool, and frankly, her character was also just boring. I see the storyline they were going for with her, but I think the idea was very much lost in practice. Her character seemed to be inconsistent, notably changing in the third act. I thought the story was very predictable, because they didn't include any room for unpredictability. All of the ""plot twists"" near the end were pretty obvious to me, because without them, the film would be absolutely pointless. That was my main problem with the film that held it back from being a 7, or even possibly, an 8. Most of the performances were pretty good, but I don't think there was anything very exceptional about any of them. However, I very much enjoyed the music and the visuals. The music was able to strike some worry and fear in me, which I was happy with, since recently I haven't been impressed with the scores of some of the films I've seen. There's not any complaints about the sound design, it just worked. The cinematography was very good, for the most part. There were some parts where it seemed blurry and it felt over-exposed, but there were others where I was very impressed. I enjoyed the mix between stationary and handheld camerawork. I think all of the long shots were done very well. With Spielberg, I expected the framing and camerawork to be very exceptional, and I was glad when it was. I particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, as well as the montage with the guy on the phone looking for Dan. The shots that stood out to me the most were from the courtroom, and the close cinematic shots of the printing press near the end. I did think there were some things that they did very well in the writing. I enjoyed how some of the conversations felt real. The dynamic of the characters interrupting each-other mid sentence to get their point across, rather than waiting for the other character to finish their line, feels more real, and I wish I saw it more in films, because it's a concept that can be taken very far. Overall, it was enjoyable to a general audience, the camerawork and music were good, the acting worked, and the story could have been better."
THE POST,26 April 2018,9/10,"My question is to the director of the movie.
MR.steven spielberg , Don't you ever mis? How could you come up with Great movies all the time.?It is a Great movie. A wonderful & emotional cinematic experience.You can watch this to see How drama and thrill is created in a script based on a true event. It has given full justice to the true events and the people involved in it.
 
Amazing acting performances, Art direction, costume designing, make up and outstanding direction. the emotion is very well transmitted to the viewer. 
The BGM is very less used. At some points I felt it should have some music there to uplift the emotion and power of that dialogue. The whole drama and emotion of the movie depends on the acting performance all the time, Which was unmistakably perfect all the time. Don't miss it."
THE POST,14 January 2018,8/10,"Not much of a shock here but the acting performances especially given from Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks were very much so up to par with their usual work. Streep is for sure the best part of this movie. Seemingly every role she shines in--and this one is no different. Tom Hanks is once again proven himself was one of the better actors in the history of film. Even though shadowed a bit by Meryl Streep in this movie, Hanks's displays a very passionate performance. Lastly, I think Paul Giamatti gave a very overlooked performance in this one as I though he did very well in his role as a Washington Post editor. The thing that makes this movie is so special is that is does an unbelievable job of relating historical events with the current american society. The american people haven't been so divided as we now are until the days of the Vietnam War. Freedom of the Press in association with the government is a hot topic right now. but even bigger is equal pay and work rights for women in all industries. My favorite part in this movie is how younger women look up to the person that Katherine Graham is, and I think we need more women in this world like Katherine to inspire women and be a role model for young girls. This a true testament to how film can relate back to real world issues."
THE POST,28 February 2018,6/10,"Frankly speaking, I am not the big fan of the renowned director, Steven Spielberg's works, one of which most impressed me probably still stays in Saving Private Ryan, yet perhaps I could therefore be more neutral to judge this film. The Post performs ordinarily, and so do Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.Let's talk about the two main characters, Kay and Ben, played by Meryl and Tom, first. I definitely agree these two sophisticated movie stars are mastered in acting, yet the film didn't give too much opportunity for them to do their best; hence, it turned out as ordinary, even though Meryl has been nominated in 2018 Oscar. However, there are still some parts do impressing me. In the talk between Kay and Lally, Kay's daughter, on the bed, Meryl has done a great job on portraying this historical figure, adding that even the strongest woman feared and panicked in the mind. Aside from Meryl, Tom Hanks's classic quote in the film, ""The only way to protect the right to publish is to publish."" reveals the main idea of this film, or of any press movie.NOW let's simply go back to the plots. The story of The Post is based on a true one that The Washington Post, taken over by Katharine Graham after her husband died, published the Pentagon Papers, no matter how The New York Times had been punished for the first publication of them. The film kindled my interest to search for the real event; however, in many parts, the history doesn't correspond to ""Hollywood"", particularly in President Richard Nixon's part which is totally a far cry from the real. It is well acknowledged that in most directors' favor, Nixon plays villain probably due to Watergate Scandal. The Post certainly is an example of those. In the film, so apparently does the director shape Nixon into a bad opponent of main characters that even at the end of the movie, adding a scene of the disclosure of Watergate Scandal means by nothing but by ""Nixon is a villain in Watergate Scandal, so will he be in The Post."", yet the scandal has nothing to do with this event.Perhaps some may consider movies simply art works, which have nothing to do with politics and history but only with director's viewpoint and interpretation, yet this does not mean the movie isn't responsible for the truth. Movie is somehow kind of approach in media, like newspaper or broadcast promoting people a certain angle of view for any event, which may splits people by believing in or not. Moreover, it also shapes how people think of these historical figures and likely jeopardizes their fame and place in history if the film distorts the real. Since we agree movies are simply art works, why should some one pay for a movie? We pay only for movie tickets, not for our reputation. The essence of truth-based movies is to integrate and arouse more different perspective of one event, not to distinguish and label people."
THE POST,21 February 2018,6/10,"Disappointing. The film focused more on the people involved, thus putting the spotlight on Hanks' and Streep's portrayals. I hope it was intended because without these two great actors, the film's slow-paced storyline, banal cinematography and its non-focus on the scandal itself, would basically make this film just another dragged out plot from Spielberg."
THE POST,16 April 2019,9/10,"Without background knowledge of the Vietnam war and who people are, such as Robert MacNamara, the viewer may find themselves confused about what this movie is really about. However, the historical context serves to enhance the movie, and the movie is still good without it.This movie shows how much tension and stress there was around publishing leaked documents during the Vietnam war and particularly the Nixon administration. The movie has great acting and particularly in body language you can really feel how the characters feel in every scene, and how much stress everyone in the Washington post was under. By showing that the government was not being truthful to the people of the united states, the Washington Post was putting itself on the line by protecting the free press and the right of the American people to know the truth."
THE POST,23 May 2018,4/10,"Only this all-star cast could make a government cover-up of a war so dull and pointless. The film dragged on and never really got started.

THE POST,12 January 2018,7/10,"THE POST (2017) *** out of ***
The Post distinguishes itself from other investigative journalism pictures like Spotlight and All the President's Men. Spotlight looked too much like a television production but it still delivered a powerful presentation about a tragic global subject while All the President's Men had the full fluidity of cinema contained within it and is a timeless classic. The Post falls somewhere in between. The first hour dragged too much for me but the second half burned rubber as it raced to a satisfying climax and conclusion. You accept the shortcomings of the first half when it's all said and done and it turns out to be an absorbing ""mini"" classic. Spielberg, Hanks and Streep are not nominated for any guild awards and their chances of being Oscar nominated are about 50/50 and I would say that Streep has the best chance of any of them but I do predict that it will be nominated for best picture strictly based on its historical perspective. However, it is starting to look like Spielberg's directorial style and especially the camera work he supervises is becoming a mirror image of itself. Spielberg needs to re-invent himself at some point but after 40+ years of making films you have to ask yourself if that is even possible. He has nothing left to prove and is one of the best film makers and story tellers of all time if not *the* best."

Steven Spielberg at his best. The movie is very well directed and full of power from the characters played by Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.
The movie also presents the topic of the role of women in society during the second half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, this is achieved in a way that shows both sides of the coin and in a rather non-partisan way, that makes it more interesting.

THE POST,30 April 2018,3/10,"""The Post,"" directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks shed light on an important episode in American political history (Watergate), but was slow-moving and not terribly captivating. Nixon's Watergate fiasco should grip every American, but the movie failed to convey the drama. It was overly focused on Katherine Graham's (Streep) character and while an early 20th century feminist symbol, her story could not carry the film. It lacked Spielberg's usual suspense and while reliant on character development, was oddly lacking in that department. There was no clever cinematography nor any compelling soundtrack and the film could have and should have made better use of the music and style of the day (early 1970s)."
THE POST,29 June 2018,10/10,"The acting was on point this is my first time watching Meryl Streep act and it had me on the edge. I got frustrated, angry, to sad and even eagerness from just watching her. It also opens our eyes in moments where the media is accused of sharing false news, this movie contradicts our thoughts into thinking that what press is sharing might be all true. I hope that the media would not take our trust and throw it out the window by writing false news. A small quote from the movie we must always remember. ""In the First Amendment, the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors."" -Judge Hugo Black"

THE POST,23 June 2018,4/10,As an Englishman I don't blame my American cousins for wanting to expose evil and wrongdoing by former senior politicians. But this film actually made me feel a bit of sympathy for the past Presidents and their cronies who were being tried in their absence here. But my main feeling watching this film was boredom caused by the actors repeating the same sentiment relentlessly for around 90 minutes. And the lack of visual variety/ dull locations. It was all summed up for me in the scene when they all looked amazed when peering into a cardboard box. You'd think they were looking at the contents of Tutankhamen tomb when all that was visible was a stack of A4 paper. I usually like to watch films at least twice but once was more than enough with this one.
THE POST,28 October 2019,,That's all. There is a movie light over her right shoulder in the scene with the character with the blue shirt and c'mon this is an Oscar winning movie - why am I seeing movie lights and why is the set dec inconsistently aged? Some of it is super solid and some of it super weak. Two shooting locations and crews?Also at the scene where Maryl Streep is exiting the courtroom. Before it cuts away is that a ghost? It's not someone in a Burka it's very confusing.
THE POST,17 January 2018,10/10,"Forty years after 1976's All The President's Men, The Post is released. Not marketed as a prequel, it is still one of the most effective prequels I've ever seen, smoothly transitioning from the ending of The Post into the nearly identical beginning of All The President's Men. Watch them together, in sequence, as it happened. Kay Graham has inherited the family newspaper. She has never worked a day in her life. Her world is the social circle of the Washington elite. Even so, she in not intimidated into refusing to run the story on the Watergate Papers. She makes it clear that this is her paper, and her decision, and changes the course of The Washington Post from being a house organ for the White House Administration to being a newspaper that rises in national stature through effective investigative reporting.This is my generation. I was young then, deeply mesmerized by the explosive politics of Vietnam, Civil Rights, and the subsequent roaring cascade of Watergate and the political fall that took down our nation's top executive. All because A Woman Stood UP! and published the truth. As a woman, I am still fighting for equal rights, equal pay, equal opportunities--ideals all cultivated in the civil unrest of the 60's. These two movies together remind us of our great potential when we Stand UP! and change the status quo."
THE POST,17 February 2019,1/10,"I didn't expect much from this movie, and thank goodness I didn't, because this movie fell completely flat. There was no real plot to the story.
Was it about trying to save The Washington Post? Was it about the Pentagon Papers? Nixon? Freedom of Press? I guess we'll never know.
I don't know which is sadder; all those themes and it lacked any luster, dimension, and depth, or the big actors that didn't bring anything to the film. Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep acted like they were bored and doing this for a paycheck. This was the only thing I could really feel in this movie. And this is supposed to be Oscar worthy?

Not long ago, our right to know if five US presidents had lied to us about our purpose in Vietnam, our involvement in Vietnam, the likelihood that the US would win, what was even possible to win, the likely cost of remaining in Vietnam, and the likely length of our remaining in Vietnam, was decided by a split US Supreme Court decision.

However, if you just have a basic knowledge of events during that time, you will have no idea what's going on. And you definitely won't care. Our group lasted approximately 45 minutes before we called it quits and asked for our money back. Spielberg hasn't made an entertaining movie in decades, so this goes right along with his latest collection of ""art"" films. He is obviously no longer interested in telling stories that capture the imagination of a wide audience. He just makes films that seem based on tedious subjects from his dinner party discussions with other Hollywood ""elite."" Tired subject, lackluster acting, meandering script and action. This film will leave you with the overwhelming desire to stand up and shout, ""WHO CARES?!?!"""
THE POST,6 January 2018,1/10,A reminder of when the Washington Post used to seek and print the Truth. Totally unlike the untrue rubbish that is printed by them these days. Two good actors in Streep and Hanks. Very average movie however. Is Spielberg losing his touch???
THE POST,11 January 2018,4/10,"Incredible cast, right down to the small parts. But the film is heavy-handed to the point of ham-fisted, from the opening scene onwards. Mr Spielberg needed to have greater faith in his audience, and let the moments in the script breathe, rather than cutting to yet another brief shot of expository detail. The film is trying to be a kind of parable of feminist empowerment -- Katharine Graham finally comes into her own and she receives admiring and supportive glances from women all over! -- without realising that Katharine Graham was, from the start, smart and tough as hell. This could have been such a great film, if Spielberg had only trusted his writers, his audience, and his cast."

THE POST,5 January 2020,3/10,"Not only was I not completely distracted by the obvious similar plot from the fantasticly well made and gripping movie ""Spotlight"" from 2015, I was also put off by how Tom Hanks´s and Meryl Streep´s characters who were just overshining through the movie. The movie was enjoyable and it is watchable, however the constant edgy humour from Tom and Meryl were more entertaining if you came here to sit in the cheerleader wagon for both of these personalities and not the characters of the movie. Some of their jokes not only were misplaced and not funny, they ruined the seriousness of the plot for me. I never disliked these actors and there true potential however I do think a complete more unexpected face would have given these roles a proper serious tone and authenticity.
I was truly wondering ""Are they even trying to sell us the role"" or are they just themselves. For me this entire movie was almost a portray of the entire deep Spielberg family state of old friends who just jump infront of the cameras as usual. Was Spielberg just trying to outdo ""Spotlight"" with the same message, but peppered with some humour along with his favourite shining lead roles and probably just jolly good friends that would steal the show? Pathetic, and I truly hope I will not again jump on a 2 hour trap and insult to screenwriting and cinematography ever again. There are creative minds and geniuses out there who probably could have used a shot on a movie like this and probably swung it with a ton more dignity. This movie is so underdelivered and can not ever come close to spotlights thriller."
THE POST,17 April 2018,2/10,"If you ignore all the hype concerning this movie, there isn't much left. Spielberg tries to make News Reporters/Makers appear honourable again even though Marshall McLuhan had already suggested during Nixon's era that the daily News wasn't as important as was the business to get the highest ratings. This yawn is as much propaganda as it is dreary."
THE POST,11 November 2018,7/10,"In the famous (?) final shot of Raiders of the Lost Ark, we see a box containing the titular lost but now found object buried behind hundreds and hundreds--maybe thousands!--of other similarly anonymous boxes (damned bureaucracies!? damned soulless government!? both!? neither?). This has become one of Spielberg's calling cards--pile on the instances (boxes, spaceships, etc.) to drive home the point that it's ONE HELL OF A LOT OF (this or that)! So the little girl in The Post who runs the lemonade stand walks through the house with a huge wad of cash, the hotel room beds are literally covered up with boxes of Pentagon Papers, and as Streep's Graham leaves the courthouse near the end of the film, not one or two but MANY young women look up admirably at her as she walks by. Is this hyperbole? I doubt it. It's more a lack of restraint, judgment, and a lack of trust in the audience. Now, on this last point, as Mencken said, no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public. This is, after all, a public who voted an orange baby ""reality TV star"" into the highest office in the world! But this is also why Spielberg is not one of the great directors. He doesn't trust his audience in the way that, say, Hitchcock or Kurosawa or Bergman did. Other directors have followed suit--e.g., note the THOUSANDS of Greek ships in the harbor in Wolfgang Peterson's Troy. He brings wit, good storytelling, and great production values. He uses great actors for (often) important stories, such as this one, and he clearly identifies himself as belonging in the tradition of Capra, above all, as American storyteller, and his politics are good, if a bit ham-handed now and then. His many moments of pathos are underscored (no pun intended) by the similarly ham-handed orchestral cues of his musical counterpart John Williams. Spielberg is addicted to the pathetic appeal, and he uses it about every few minutes or so, if not more often, but, as Cicero said, nothing dries so quickly as a tear.Yet this is, like most of Spielberg's efforts going back to the early 1970s, a good film, well worth one's two hours. The subject, given our day of attacks on the free press and the First Amendment, could not be more timely, and the film, at best, reminds us that we Americans have been through this before. Will a Watergate-like end pull us out of our largely self-inflicted wound, or will we spiral into an out and out fascism? (Nixon did not have a Fox News.) God help us. The loss of a free press would send our democracy into a hole that would pretty much be a burial plot. Spielberg gives a damn, and I appreciate his effort here, despite all I discuss in the first paragraph. Hanks, Streep, Odenkirk, and all the rest are in fine form. The film may have worked better at a 90 minute running time, but that's not going to happen these days. (A ""great film"" these days cannot possibly have a running time so short, though Buster Keaton, for one, would disagree--look what he did in the 40-something minutes of Sherlock, Jr., which is not a second too long or short.) So as flawed as this movie is, it is a good one, a sort of prequel to All the President's Men. Long live the First Amendment!"

From an entertainment perspective I felt that Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep were delightful together and their performances contributed greatly to making this movie very watchable. I felt start off a bit slow, however pick up in the second half. All in all a movie which keeps you interested, especially if you like political 'thrillers' and as stated above great performance by Hanks and Streep."
THE POST,21 April 2020,10/10,"Spielberg did a great job in directing this story about the great woman that was Katherine Graham.
Three scenes I believe are particularly worthy of note:
Ben's wife pointing out how Katherine had a lot more to lose and how she was always treated as a lesser person in the company;Kay in the dining room surrounded by men telling her what to do - it's impressive to see how Meryl Streep grows throughout the scene and becomes her own person!The women admiring Kay as she leaves the Supreme Court."
THE POST,9 August 2018,3/10,"First of all, I'm not sure if those who rated this movie 5 and above, watched the same movie as I did. Pretty sure that this movie was not directed by Steven Spieldberg, could have been a distant relative of his.If you are able to get past the aging face or the equally repulsive facial make up of Meryl Streep, you are put with watching an hour and a half of sleepy, dull, ever bored, and a weak Streep. Dare I say, she was irresponsible, always trying to get a nap, even when the board is busy. Suddenly in the last ten minutes of the movie, she's a whole another person, full of charisma and she actually starts taking all the calls for Washington Post. The transference of her character is incredible and there's nothing to justify the same. Also there's a scene at the end of the movie, where tens of women, surprising gathered at one side of the court entrance are in awe of Meryl. Why the women were all towards one side is not explained.The movie's story had a huge potential. Sadly it was not utilized. Tom and one more guy, justified their roles. There's actually no character development for the rest of the multitude of men in this movie.And then there's the cliche of how reporters are trying to get their story published first. Often you get the idea that Washington Post is doing this for themselves and not to stop the war or prevent American soldier's death or Vietnamese deaths or getting the news to the public.In all, it's an indifferent direction with a massive cast. Meryl, please retire!"
THE POST,12 February 2018,2/10,"In my memory, the NY Times played a much bigger roll than the WaPo. This film seems to neglect New York. What courage is there in being second? Fake history is as bad as fake news."
THE POST,21 January 2018,9/10,"Spielberg's The Post looks to 1971's President Nixon ""shitting"" on the press as it acted as advocate for the public and it's right to know. The attack was triggered by publication in the New York Times of the Pentagon Papers. These documents revealed how American presidents and their administrations had for three decades lied to the American people and Congress to hide ""secrets,"" including compounded bad decision-making and failed policies relating to the US war in Vietnam. There is the back story. Liz Hannah and Josh Singer's script takes on the Washington Post's angle within this conflict. Kay Graham owns the Post. Her newspaper picked up the Times' lead, stared down the White House, and ran with the Papers story in spite of a pending court injunction. At stake was everything: possible jail time, destruction of the newspaper itself, and loss of jobs and livelihoods as well as Kay's fortune and status. Added to the complication is that the paper, due to cash flow problems, has just been forced to go public. Fear that Wall Street's bankers are in place to pull backing on the stock deal must dominate the decision to publish or bury the lead. Instead, it comes down to a woman. Meryl Streep's Kay Graham isn't steely-she's busy! Busy with parties and social obligations and family. But the paper, too, is her family. And the paper, too, is her blood. Her performance rings true for those who knew the age. Look how powerless we were! Bruce Greenwood plays Bob McNamara, Kay's friend, whose impassioned description of the destruction Nixon will bring down on her (and her paper) was so right it must have Oscar wheels on it.Tom Hanks plays Ben Bradlee, the editor whose newsroom captures the powerful drama of the work involved, and characters chasing the story. Once it's in hand, the job becomes deciding what to do with it. The legal team steps in and draws its sights on killing the story. Typesetting, copy and layout editors and chiefs, runners and staff, spying on the Times, and seeing the printing press in action create a reminder of a newspaper world gone, and now missed. Needless to say, the presses did their duty.On trial, of course, is the absolutism of government, as it moves away from democracy and toward dictatorship. The tissue-thin comparison to the here-and-now is a hook, meant to leave you thinking."

The film featured too many noisy meetings, full of jargon, and requiring a fairly thorough understanding of American politics to follow the plot.
We all know that the Vietnam War was a tragic piece of war theatre where lots of young lives were sacrificed, but the details involved in this so-called plot were mumbled, jumbled, and difficult to follow.
The best bits were the fascinating behind-the-scenes footage of setting up the newspaper and printing it before the digital age.

THE POST,14 January 2018,7/10,"""The Post"" is a historical drama that reminds us that what goes on in the American government isn't always what meets the eye, and is very susceptible to becoming corrupt even to the point of where they will infringe upon 1st amendment and attempt to silence the press to hide dirty little secrets they don't want us to know about. While I appreciate the movie for it's concept, realism, the stand up for what's right attitude, women's rights issues at the time, and example that things like this can happen even in America, the presentation we get isn't particularly a great one. I found this movie to be really slow and lacking substance. It just needed something more. I kind of felt like I was just watching people at the office all day. Despite all of this though, if you want to be reminded of the things your government CAN and HAS done while claiming to be innocent, this is a good movie to get that gets the message across, just not in a very exciting way."
THE POST,15 January 2018,8/10,"Name of Steven Spielberg speaks for itself. When new epic movie from the father of Indiana Jones and Jaws came on the big screen, each self-respecting cinema-fan had to immediately rearrange plans and bought a ticket to the nearest theater.1966, Vietnam. US observer from RAND corporation escorts American troops during military operation in jungles. His goal is to experience horrors of the war from the first-person perspective. Several minutes of this introductory scene is more than enough to show us that the war is indeed terrible. 1971, Washington DC. Katharine 'Kay' Graham (Meryl Streep), owner of The Washington Post and Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks), executive editor, are engaged in severe combat for the future of their beloved newspaper. Main enemy - almighty NYT - is always one step ahead. However, on the 13th of June status quo has changed forever. That day New York Times published the excerpt of highly classified government documents regarding the US involvement in Vietnam well before the official beginning of the war. Then-president Richard Nixon was furious and through court restriction made NYT to stop publishing papers. At this point The Washington Post come in and got it's own copy of documents. These so called ""Pentagon Papers"" had a potential to change the future of the newspaper as well as the future of the whole country. But the consequences might be very dangerous and unpredictable.Very beginning of the movie is a little bit overwhelming. Some people might even start to worry that the rest of the picture will be just boring. Indeed, there are too many men in identical black suits, too many technical dialogs related to law and politics, too many names and characters to remember. But once you manage to orientate yourself in the black-and-white world of professional journalism The Post will capture all your attention and you will be fully immersed into it.In the hands of director other than Spielberg, the movie would doomed to be another typical political drama, consisting of annoying cliche. But Maestro transformed it into the sparkling thriller with formidable cast and brilliant plot. Yes, film's storyline takes place not in a dark streets of New York City or dangerous neighborhoods of Los-Angeles. Apart from the short ""jungle introduction"" remaining scenes of the movie take place into the courtrooms, boardrooms, nicely decorated drawing rooms, and newsrooms furnished only with telephones and smoke. Nevertheless, movie is as exiting as any other high-quality thriller with each dialog located in the right place and lasting for right amount of time. While characters... Characters deserve to be discussed separately. The Post is the couple dance of Hanks and Streep. Hanks performs Ben Bradlee, who occupied the position of The Washington Post's executive editor almost for a quarter of a century between 1968 and 1991. Historical Bradlee was a superstar of his era and gradually became the figure of truly national character. Hanks made a lot out of his hero. He presented Bradlee to the audience as a very charismatic, cynical and brutal gangster of the US capital's journalism establishment. Maybe in old times Hanks' genuine performance would inspire generation of teenagers who watched the movie to chose the career of executive editors. Well done Tom. However, performance of Streep was not good enough to match Hanks on the screen. The way how she performed her character does not even remotely coincides with the real Graham. It is sufficient to make small research on historical Kay Graham in order to realize it. Mrs Graham was the first female publisher in the United States. After the death of her husband nobody expected from fragile Kay to take the control over The Washington Post. But she did it... and eventually succeeded. When time came to decide whether or not to publish ""Pentagon Papers"", wrong choice could in a blink of an eye destroy all what her father and husband created. Real Kay Graham was strong woman with highly calculating way of thinking. She made decision after prudent rational consideration. But what we see in The Post? Streep's Graham is presented to us as highly unconfident woman who feels overburdened with business, which she barely love. And her decision to finally publish the papers looks on the screen like a decision of a teenager to make a rebel over parents control, far away from the rational one. Obviously, Streeps has not done her best but we should admit, that probably nobody can do her part better.In addition, Streeps and Hanks are backed by players as proficient as Tracy Letts, Sarah Paulson, and Michael Stuhlbarg. And it once again proves that Spielberg did not lose his skill in making a great cast.Overall, The Post is another movie in the Spielberg's ""Political Series"" which is very different from his ""Amusement Series"" and shows the power of motion pictures in analyzing important issues. As, say Lincoln, touches the hot topic of slavery, The Post touches even much hotter topic of Fake News vs True News, which is increasingly important in modern digital era. At the end of the first year of a Trump presidency, Americans can agree that ""the media,"" whatever we mean by that, is under siege from the White House. The Post's central theme is clearly told in the concluding phrase: ""The press was to serve the governed not the governor"", highlighting the danger to Americans if the executive branch of government doesn't respect the freedom of the press encoded in the First Amendment.And finally, nice quote from the movie.Daniel Ellsberg: Wouldn't you go to prison to stop this war?
Ben Bagdikian: Theoretically, sure."
THE POST,26 January 2018,8/10,"It's always been a delight to watch a Steven Spielberg movie; no matter which style or genre he's tackling, he's a proven master craftsman who has a unique way of handling lives. This time, he has chosen to say the story of a big triumph in a small world of 'free expression'; the courage it took for Katharine Graham, the owner-publisher of the Washington Post, to divulge highly classified information on one of the biggest diplomatic lies that has ever been told-the Pentagon papers and the Vietnam War! It was no mere journalistic victory, given a bold Lady's guts it took to make an advance move; the effort put in by Ben Bradlee-the Editor in Chief, and his team in condensing the immense contents of the papers to its simplest relatable form. There's a scene in the movie where Katherine quotes her husband Phil, on the ironic immensity of the press' nature-""News is the first rough draft of History!"". And who brings it out, definitely the Press. If there's been a big reason as to why Spielberg made 'The Post' in 2017, it's to assert the significance of free Press and censure in a Democratic setup.Meryl Streep as Mrs.Grahams and Tom Hanks as Bradlee is a dream cast for any movie on the same subject; yeah it's not a dream anymore! There's nothing more to comment on their acting or Spielberg's direction, they're proven masters of this trade. The way Streep and Hanks make their acting seem so effortless presents a true befuddlement. When it comes to the other master, there's a specific purport, dignity, intrigue and mastery in his storytelling, as always. Nowadays, only in a Spielberg movie can you spot a neatly executed Dolly zoom, trolley movements and classic close-ups. There'll definitely be Janusz Kaminsky, Michael Kahn and John Williams to his legendary squad, and so they are here. An impeccable army!Investigative journalism is one of Hollywood's widely dealt with topic; to pick some classic examples we have an 'All The President's Men', a Spotlight and a Zodiac-even the father of all well made movies 'Citizen Kane' is ultimately a movie on Press. 'The Post' begins off like a satire on 'Nam, and later takes off in a more linear direction. It's a known story, rather a page from renowned History textbooks; that's where the real challenge lies, to make an engaging movie on a story whose beginning and ends you already know, everybody knows. I believe Liz Hannah has achieved it hands down, credits to the rightful assistance meted out by Josh Singer, one of the men behind Spotlight, a rightful hire. Needless to say, the 'class' and the substance is only amped up by the hands of the big Master. From what happened in 'Nam, to what happens in the Post's unofficial Board Meetings, to what goes through the mind of a sensitive Mrs.Grahams, to what's going on in the White House and down even to Watergate, Spielberg has shown it all. We know the Vietnam War wasn't neither a big victory, nor short of a great number of casualties; it was a long kept Diplomatic Secret which left no more spaces to public negotiation; a terrible loss followed by inglorious consequences. To rationalise the ill sides of such an important event in History; to make it available to the Public is a sure buy for any seller, but an even riskier task for a journalist.Now, one may ask who really cares whether or not someone had made an age-old lie; one may ask why it needs to be discussed in the current world scenario? The world is getting torn apart by civil wars and mostly internal strifes, democracies are nearing a halt, nepotism is gaining a headway in all spheres, and totalitarianism is slowly finding its way back to immense adjacencies(even Disney bought Fox AF!). The face of the world is changing, and new currents are growingly apathetic to public expression and free press. This is where 'The Post' holds a contemporary relevance; this is an ode to unsung journalistic heroes, and a note of encouraging their good spirits. Such an important lesson to come from a classic team, 'The Post' is for times to come!!! Won't be surprised if it wins the Big Prize!???"
THE POST,29 January 2018,1/10,"Should be re-titled ""The Three Stooges Make a Movie."" Sad that no one knows what is behind this campaign and so many gullible and uninformed out there. Most who liked this film know nothing about history and how the Russians and Chinese were sending in thousands of highly educated diplomats, teachers, politicians and organizers throughout the 1930's, 40's and 50's to reach the highest levels of government, schools, unions and the media to bring down capitalism. They succeeded and even Truman ignored it because it was already so ensconced. They used race, gender and class politics to stir up insurrection. Remember how they succeeded in Africa, South America, Central America, Cuba and SE Asia? Only the Indonesians stopped them in the third world in 1965 with all out violence. Eisenhower stopped them temporarily, threatening the Chinese with an atomic attack if they did not end the Korean War. Notice how that is the only place the advance was cut off in SE Asia? LBJ did nothing to stop the Russians who were behind the entire Vietnam and Cambodian takeover. LBJ opened the borders, gave civil rights to drug dealers and used welfare to encourage divorce/out of wedlock birth so America would be flooded by the 3rd worlds, more poor and the middle class wiped out. Everything went socialist and communist. Of course this film avoids every bit of the truth about the communist takeover now almost complete. We know from the Venova papers and many other sources that both the Russians and Chinese were hugely successful getting into America to take it down from within and the Ellsberg papers did nothing but expose some superficial background information that was irrelevant. Vietnam was LBJ's war as he was all in for the take-down of Western society."

What an awful disappointment when early reviews indicated this was Oscar material.
In spite of a great cast on paper (am Meryl Streep's major fan) I found it hugely boring. Tom Hanks was tedious and sanctimonious.
How anyone - unless a paid critic - could deem this Oscar material is totally beyond me.

THE POST,12 February 2018,9/10,"Ethics take thought. You have to think about all the people you might hurt with a given action and the long-range effect of a given decision. Sometimes you have to break the law to show that things must change; body bags full of young people isn't enough for someone to do something.The people in power had done everything to keep rebellious people out including making it against federal law and treasonous to try to alter things, imprisoning people who did. They shouldn't have the right to do this, make it so there's no other way than to break law to get law changed. This is very much like the internet pass-around where at first an idea seems crazy and outlandish, then we start to understand the other side of it, then-help me if I'm wrong- we are uncooperative if we aren't on the same side.This isn't about the other side of the coin.

THE POST,13 February 2018,8/10,"I went into this film mostly blind. All I knew was that it stared Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, but for me that's all I needed to go and watch it.I decided to not find out who the director was, and during the entire film, I was convinced that the director was experimenting, lots of the camera movements and shots were so completely different to what you see in most films. Never did I think, ""this is a Spielberg"". Honestly, not his best film, but certainly not his worst. When characters were having conversations if would often just stay on one character, I completely understand that he was trying not to introduce anyone else, and capture Meryl Streep's reaction, but to me it came off as lazy filmmaking.I did love what Spielberg was going for here, it was something new and innovative. But I do think that maybe a different director like Michael Showalter for example, could have done a more interesting take. I do love what Spielberg did with it don't get me wrong, but maybe he wasn't perfect for this film.What was done really well was the tension during the scene in the living room whilst all of the journalists were piecing together important facts and figures from the documents that they had to hand. This was done in some bits as just one shot and it's very clear how hard that was to film.But I feel what weighed it down a bit was the lack of court hearings we see. We see them walk in and sitting in the room and that is about it. I personally would have liked to hear at least one side from each of the sides.Overall, I liked the film, it was fun and interesting and gripping. If you have a spare few hours I would go and see the film :)"
THE POST,10 March 2018,9/10,"A great story of ideals and people who find the courage to stand for them.
Meryl Streep gives an inspiring portrayal of Katharine Graham - a woman who finds the strength to risk everything she has and go against everything she knew in order to defend her truth."
THE POST,21 May 2018,9/10,"'The post' is both gripping and compelling to the audience. Playing like a mesmerizing journalism drama, Steven Spielberg's thriller recalls the 1971 revelations of the 'Pentagon Papers' - a devastating report that detailed how the White House has been lying about the war this whole time. Written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer and widely acclaimed by the critics, 'The Post' can be described as particularly riveting for both historical events and character development. 
The two central characters are played by Tom Hanks (Ben Bradlee) and Meryl Streep (Katherine Graham). Not only these two managed to delve into their roles so ingeniously that could potentially be nominees for the Oscar award, but also the whitewash exposition seemed exceptionally bewitching. Streep's character provides the emotional shock and the will to overcome it. Being portrayed as a supposedly vulnerable woman, harassed by the predominant male collective and in mourning of her dead husband, she finds the strength to come to her senses and take a hardline approach. As for Hanks, he captures the audacious bravado of the editor-in-chief, who realizes that the cozy relationship he previously had with the government must come to an end. Both actors definitely pulled their weight in this masterpiece, striking a chord within the viewers' hearts.
The plot captivates and proceeds to fascinate, albeit the 'Pentagon Papers' scandal is quite renowned for its controversy and hypocrisy on behalf of US government. It would not be an understatement to say that the audience should be left bewildered by the US politicians' ferocity, willing to bend the rules to salvage their reputation. The Washington Post newspaper has everything at stake and vilifying the Vietnam campaign could potentially bring its demise. In the wake of unbiased attitude towards the government, Bradlee and Graham opt for publishing the classified report, starting a knock-on effect among other newspapers.
Credit where credit's due - this film is a marvelous piece of art. Bereft of plot holes and overacting, it is a worthy one to watch."
THE POST,27 January 2019,9/10,"Here's a fine film with solid acting, credible writing, great directing, perfectly paced storytelling, and historical relevance. In other words, everything you need to disappear for two hours or so. Nothing blows up, no one gets shot, there are no cheap thrills, and the suspense is character-driven, story-driven, and authentic. Engrossing and entertaining start to finish. Feels like it was made in the last century, not this one. We need more films with this kind of character and responsibility. Suggest ignoring the nitpicking reviews; watch this, and enjoy it."

THE POST,15 May 2019,3/10,"The movie covers, although with a bit of a left-wing bent (of course) an important event in history where the deception of the civilian political leaders regarding the Vietnam war was exposed.However, the acting is rather dull as they try to over-act to put energy and drama into something not as dramatic as they pretend it is. And while probably accurate, the actors' demonstration of snide pretentiousness by the main characters is distracting and annoying."

The movie did a good job of being clear, cohesive, and dramatic, but after watching the movie, I didn't have the feeling that I saw something special. My heart wasn't beating fast; I didn't feel unexplainable excitement while watching the movie. It was just good, not great."
THE POST,6 October 2021,8/10,"Frustrated by the American government's deception of its citizens at the peak of the Vietnam War, military analyst Daniel Ellsberg illegally copies Pentagon documents and attempts to give an insight into what is going on in the real world. To expose wrongdoing Daniel provides the documents to The New York Times for publication in 1971. Thus the question of whistleblowing is raised, which can be seen as a part of a system of checks and balances. Owing to such people, hidden and often illegal actions, even taken by the government, are revealed to ordinary people.Nevertheless, one cannot shed light on the present state of affairs at once. While The New York Times is engaged in a lawsuit trying to exercise its right to publish confidential material following the first amendment, The Washington Post can only envy its colleagues who are spinning the scandal of the century. But when the court forbids The New York Times to publish classified material, the Washington Post gets its own access to the Ellsberg dossier and faces a dilemma. The stakes are high, and a certain decision has serious implications for both the publishing business and the workers. If the paper publishes the Pentagon documents, it might raise its prestige, serve the nation, and perhaps save thousands of American soldiers engaged in a senseless war. But if President Nixon's government sues the Washington Post for violating espionage laws, all hell could break loose. That is, the publication might destroy the business and its entire staff will end up on the street with no prospects of a stable job or even in jail. On the other hand, if the publisher simply shies away from the problem, then a moral dilemma for journalists comes into play, as the question of freedom of speech and the press is raised. Does the press follow this principle? Does it serve the people, or does it only serve the government? Does the press deserve the title of ""the fourth branch of power""?Another interesting point is that the decision to publish is made by people who have already achieved something in their lives. For instance, they have already achieved high social status, formed a circle of friends, and built a family. Therefore, the process of resolving the dilemma engenders internal conflict for both Catherine Graham (Meryl Streep) and Ben Bradley (Tom Hanks). A positive decision to publish classified material boils down to an accusation of Nixon and the political establishment, which, in turn, could have a devastating effect on Graham's connections in political circles. For Catherine, the subjects of the secret dossiers are not faceless officials, but good acquaintances or even close friends. So, on the one hand, the woman is stunned by how many years she has been deceived. On the other hand, she finds it difficult to betray her friends, even when the fate of the nation is at stake. Ben's solution to the dilemma is easier. He is a professional journalist who puts the publication of an exclusive above all else. Still, Ben doesn't want to go to jail at the end of his years and then look for a new job. Besides, he has connections in the high circles, and he doesn't want to spoil relations with them at all. Like Graham, Bradley stands on a high pedestal, and if he fails, it will be very painful for him to fall."
THE POST,7 October 2021,7/10,"'The post' is a fascinating and well-shot movie, a moralizing drama about the leak of classified information in the era of the Vietnam conflict and the media disposing of it.In the midst of the Vietnam conflict, Daniel Ellsberg, a law enforcement officer, now a well-known whistleblower, dissatisfied with the lies of the government, bending the law, copies secret documents and passes them to the New York Times newspaper for printing. At the same time, the Washington Post employees are being jealous of their colleagues, because at the time of the release of scandalous materials, they have to cover the wedding of the president's daughter. But the impudence of the New York newspaper does not go unpunished, the court prohibits a further publication. At this moment, Ellsberg's papers fall into the hands of the Washington Post. The heads of the newspaper face a dilemma. The Pentagon's research publication promises not only an increase in prestige, but can also help save American soldiers doomed to death who are waging a losing war on a foreign land. On the other hand, Nixon's surrounding may sue the newspaper for espionage, which will lead to the destruction of the entire publishing house, and prison terms for its employees. Newspaper owner Catherine Graham and chief editor Ben Bradley have a difficult decision to make.Spielberg is a master of making movies about imperfect heroes. The viewers are tired of getting stories about flawless characters like Superman. The most interesting thing is to observe the conflict, especially the internal conflict. Spielberg is keen on stories in which people who do not need heroism behave selflessly.We could see another movie about Snowden, but thanks to Spielberg's direction, we see the story of ""The Post"" not through the eyes of Ellsberg, who risked the most, but through the eyes of the newspaper itself, because Ellsberg is an unquestionable hero, but a truly Spielberg character is Catherine Graham, an aged socialite who never worked, inherited the reins of the newspaper from her late father and husband.The role of Catherine Graham was played by the incredible (if you can multiply the word 'incredible' by 1000, do it right now) Meryl Streep. Viewers are used to seeing her in the images of strong-willed and independent women, but it's quite difficult to call Catherine Graham inflexible. She had been a housewife for her whole life, had never worked before her husband's death, and when the tragedy occurred, she was not ready to lead an entire publishing house. Thus, it is difficult for her to make even the simplest decisions, nothing to say about approving the publication of Ellsberg's materials.The newspaper's confrontation with Nixon is not just a businesswoman's dispute with the authorities, it is also a personal issue for Catherine Graham. The key people of the research are no strangers to her. On the one hand, she is impressed by how she has been lied to for years, on the other hand, it is difficult for her to jeopardize former friends, even when it comes to the well-being of an entire nation.It is much easier for Ben Bradley to consent to the printing of materials. He is a professional editor, eager to publish an exclusive. However, he considered the late President Kennedy a good friend of his, and he would not want to discredit his reputation. In case of failure, Bradley will not feel well either. Being in his place many of us would have refused to take part, but in that case Spielberg would not have made a movie about Washington Post.No one but Spielberg could have shown tons of bureaucratic red tape so effectively and intriguingly. Frankly speaking, Spielberg puts a too strong emphasis on the criticality of the situation. The probability that the court would restrict the freedom of the press contrary to the constitutional amendment was extremely small. Nevertheless, it is very important to make a movie in which even the contradictory characters remind us that the power is truth."
THE POST,15 January 2018,10/10,"I was a kid during the Pentagon Papers and Watergate. I always looked up to Kay Graham as a woman of fortitude. This film has her restraining from being the woman I read about. However, I feel like this experience was the impetus of her awakening to her strength.

Ben Bradley played by Tom Hanks was so juicy. Loved his portrayal of this balls to the walls man of steel. Hanks truly shines. His speech about Jackie after the death of JFK touched me and brought a tear to the eye. 
Spielberg is just a Master of film. He can make you sit on the edge of your seat because he uses the camera to take you in the film. His style is so sophisticated. The actors are not just characters but the film is a character too. Spielberg is always moving the camera to set us in the story. 
Bonus is John Williams composed the music. The music is outstanding and is so compelling. Such a great Master of the art. Spielberg and Williams is always genius working together.

No amount of acting talent on Streep's part could have made the decision to print any less obvious.

Streep's character speaks as though it is outdated and she's only beginning to catch up with the times. The scene of her walking down the steps outside of the supreme court is so unrealistic and pseudo profound.The whole ""female"" section of the movie is unnecessary and feels so forced it really takes away from what could have been an extra 20 or so minutes of the relationships between press and politics or the backlash of the piece being printed.Jesse Plemons was miscast and could have better in a different role (journalist).Streep & Hanks were flawless as always.Overall a good film but could have been so much more,6.1/10"

Why did the role need the expense of Streep? The side-track into the IPO was a waste of time.There was little or no urgency to any of the action. The likelihood of legal action or prison was not tense. A group of men and a lawyer bumbled around suggesting she not publish.The focus on the film seemed to be that the Press were being cheated and misled. But the point of the events is that 600,000 lives were lost for the vanity of presidents, politicians and generals, and somehow ""the country"". Apart from a few hippies and the man who leaked the papers, that did not come over at all. Even Graham, the supposed centre of the film, didn't get particularly bothered by the fact that her son had been over there. We didn't see him, and yet in real life he took over from her at the top of the Post. As KG went into the court, she was taken around a side door by a girl from the prosecution side, who spoke without passion about her support for the leak because her son was out in Vietnam fighting.The Nixon threat that we heard was actually made after Watergate, not after this leak.How on earth did it cost $50m to make?There was much that presumably Spielberg put in to promote women's causes, but it neither caught the awfulness of the time nor added anything to the film. KG too timid to say anything as the only woman in the IPO discussions. Ladies removing themselves from after dinner business discussions.

I didn't finish watching it. It was the first movie that ever resulted in me leaving theater before it ended. I felt the extra 30 minutes would be better spent driving home. This movie really needed more action- even some type of character development to make you more invested in the characters. I do not even know what any of their names were. Yikes. I love Tom and Bob... but man, I just couldn't go on."
THE POST,10 March 2018,9/10,"""The Post"" opened in box offices in December of 2017. The movie takes place in the 1960's and follows the lives of Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post and Ben Bradlee, the editor-in-chief of The Washington Post as they fight to expose years of United States government secrets concerning the Vietnam War. Katharine Graham, better known as Kay, is the first female publisher of an American newspaper, and is busy juggling her responsibilities towards advancing The Washington Post. She job faces some bumps in the road when, after receiving the means to look at stolen government documents, Ben strongly believes that publishing an article detailing the betrayal of the American Government would be beneficial to The Post. He thinks that it would allow The Washington Post to expand its standing as a major national paper, allowing it to surpass its rival, The New York Times. Kay must make big decisions and take some huge risks for both her and her staff, and the high tension and pressure storyline is exhilarating to watch.
 This film features two very famous lead actors: Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. Meryl Streep has won more academy awards, Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, and People's Choice Awards (just to name a few) than you can count on two hands. Similarly, Tom Hanks has won very many awards of similar stature. Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks have been trusted by many producers and loved by thousands of fans in their past movies. In ""The Post,"" Hanks and Streep live up to their names in their powerful portrayals of Kay Graham and Ben Bradlee. Additionally, ""The Post"" was directed by Steven Spielberg, who directed many famous, classic movies like ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and you can expect just as high a quality in this movie from him.
 Because of its powerful cast and director, since its release in the end of 2017, ""The Post"" has been nominated for dozens of awards, winning at least 14 out of 93 nominations. Some of its most prestigious nominations include the ""Best motion picture of the year"" Academy Award and several ""bests"" from the Golden Globes: director (motion picture), motion picture (drama), screenplay (motion picture), and more. While the movie did not win in all these categories, it was nominated for more awards than some movies are ever nominated for, proving that many prestigious people clearly thought that this was a movie worth watching.
 One of the main themes in this film is that of the triumph of women amidst harsh gender inequality. Especially in the movie's time and setting women were very unfairly treated. Sadly, the reality is that today, women still don't have completely fair or equal conditions, in comparison to their male counterparts. This movie shows Kay Graham, a pioneer in her field as the first female publisher of a major newspaper, obtaining a major win. The movie ties in perfectly with current gender issues, and can make women feel good, as it can really resonate with them.
 On IMDB.com, some users felt that the movie ""The Post"" was not worthy of more than one or two stars. However, I must note that it did take several minutes of scrolling to find a bad review. There was one particular comment made by the user ""MickAndRorty,"" whose claims in his 1 out of 10 star rating I do not agree with. First, the user claimed in January of 2018 that the movie ""will not perform well."" However, this movie earned $22.2 million, making up around half of it's $50 million budget, just in the first weekend after its release. According to Forbes magazine, that's considered great! Obviously, the user underestimated the potential of this movie. In the post, the user later goes on to state, ""Every time I see Meryl Streep on the screen, I just cannot take it serious."" I don't think this should be a factor towards the movie's quality, as the vast majority of critics and audiences would largely disagree to user ""MickAndRorty."" Meryl Streep has won so many academy awards. If that wasn't enough, she also won several People's choice awards, showing how most audiences enjoy her screen presence. Thus, contrary to what this user claims, Meryl Streep was an asset to this film that helped to make it great. Overall, I do not think that this user had enough substance that made his claims logical and my claims that the movie was great far outweigh his claims.
 Overall, for anyone looking for an enticing movie based on a prominent true event, ""The Post"" is perfect. I am rarely one to watch movies based on real, historic events, for I typically don't find them interesting. However, ""The Post"" was one of the only exceptions. The continuous tension and urgency in the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you are sure to find it interesting, just like I did. Next time you have some extra time to watch a movie, give ""The Post"" a try!"
THE POST,8 April 2018,1/10,"This has got to be the worst newspaper film Ive ever seen. unbearably bad B movie with big name actors and Spielberg. I love Spielberg films typically but this movie is perhaps one of, if not his worst film ever. The only reason I didn't turn it off mid-way through was to avoid chalking up the initial viewing time as a total loss. At least I can still say Ive seen all of Spielberg's movies. That and Tom Hanks' hair dye were about the only realistic or positives about this film at all. It literally read as a complete knock off of much better films in re News reporting, like every one of its ideas came from another movie that preceded it. The suspense is totally contrived and relies on pre-conceptions of the suspension of disbelief. But I did however enjoy the modern-day comparisons to Donald Trump and the abuses of power involved, or what abuses to look out for, as has occurred in former administrations. BAD BAD BAD Film, not even worth watching for free. Do not recommend."
THE POST,10 April 2018,7/10,".................in the mould of ""All the Presidents Men"" but not quite in that class."
THE POST,19 April 2018,7/10,"I love to watch historical dramas and I grew up in D.C so was really looking forward to this one. While the story was riveting once you got into it and finally figured out what was going on, the depiction of American culture in the early 70s was so wrong. As an example of this, the demonstrators looked more like people of today, perfectly put together and trying to be beautiful. My aunt was one of the actual protestors of the time. I clearly remember her as bra-less with waist length hair and bushy underarms. The hairstyles were also wrong, way to flat for women and way to long for some of the men. People in general were still pretty clean cut in 1971. My dad, who had shoulder length hair was frequently stopped by the police and questioned. You would not see long haired men in white collar jobs, never. Also whenever I saw someone in the movie talking on a payphone on a deserted street I would start feeling nervous because you would never do that in D.C. Perfect way to get mugged. D.C. was a dangerous place in the 70s. Perhaps the depiction of culture was modernized in order to make it more relatable to the younger generation of viewers. I can understand that, but I personally would have found the film so much more enjoyable if it had more accurately recreated the culture of the times."
THE POST,30 April 2018,1/10,Worst Spielberg movie ever...can only surmise that Hanks and Streep agreed to be in the movie because SS. was involved...very lackluster and disappointing...pathetic acting for both Hanks & Streep due to the screen adaptation...sorry to see Hanks in this movie......
THE POST,10 August 2018,2/10,A messy and sleepy movie. Confusing with a lot of different names and persons. Not worth the time
THE POST,23 January 2019,2/10,"The plot attempts to resuscitate the long forgotten dream of a time when media outlets like the Washington Post were paragons of Truth. Unfortunately the movie was rushed and it shows. The whole thing feels flimsy and around the second or third scene you'll be checking your watch for Hollywood's top table (well represented here by Streep, Hanks, Spielberg etc) to stop moralising.It's a shame really that it is such a hack job because there is a real problem with the decline of journalism. There's plenty to discuss. It's just that it's a much deeper and more complex problem than protrayed by the entertainment arm of the Democratic party in this second rate film"
