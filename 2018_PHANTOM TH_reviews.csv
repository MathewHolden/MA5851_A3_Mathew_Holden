PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,10/10,"Have a lot of admiration for Paul Thomas Anderson and really like to love all his work, especially 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood', even finding a lot to admire with his weakest film ('Inherent Vice' from personal opinion). Also consider Daniel Day-Lewis a wonderful actor and that his triple Oscar wins are testament to that. With 'Phantom Thread' being touted as Day-Lewis' swan song (very sad) and with so many award nominations, interest was incredibly high despite not being completely sold by the advertising. Seeing it yesterday when it first came out in my country, found it to be a truly outstanding film in every regard. One of the most beautiful and most interesting films seen recently and the standout so far of the 2017 films released here this year. Also consider it Anderson's best film since 'There Will Be Blood' and one of his very best. 'Phantom Thread' is a visually stunning film. It's beautifully and cleverly photographed (the techniques and types of camera-work being typical Anderson), with the cinematography allowing one to be in awe of the sumptuous production design and jaw droppingly gorgeous costume design (my win for this year's Oscar for its category). Anderson's distinctive directing style is written all over the film. Meaning visual boldness, the memorable way in how he uses music, how he handles thematic consistency and having characters that are flawed but realistically so while not being necessarily likeable. All present here. Jonny Greenwood's music score is as ever an interesting and layered in mood, hauntingly beautiful and clever one on its own, one that is not forgotten. Just as remarkable is the sympathetic way it's used while being like its own character in the film. Undoubtedly the reason for its Oscar nomination. The pre-existing music makes every bit as much of an impression, perhaps even more so. Most of it classical, with a mix of solo piano, symphonic and especially chamber music (on top of popular songs from the period). They are either understatedly heard in the background, appropriate for a gentle piece like Faure's Berceuse, or like characters of their own that enhance the intense mood of the scene in question, such as the Schubert and especially the Debussy (made to sound easy by the performance of the quartet, when it's actually a nightmare, Debussy in general is hard having sung many of his songs and he can be unforgiving to vocalists).Throughout, 'Phantom Thread' is very thoughtfully and even poetically scripted, with remarkable complexity. To make Alma an ambiguous character with vague motivations was an intriguing choice, and while it will no doubt frustrate viewers and will be considered a flaw it came over very well and only added to the realistically complicated dynamic of her relationship with Reynolds. In terms of the story, 'Phantom Thread' is anchored by this relationship dynamic. It may not be a novel theme, with other films having done it (a recent example being 'Mother!'), but 'Phantom Thread' handles this far better than most of them, what it says about it is illuminating, fresh and surprisingly subtle. Also effective was how the high fashion world is portrayed, on the outside it's glamorous in how it looks and is worn and methodical in how the dresses are made but behind the scenes there is bitterness and cruelness, a very truthful, if again not new, depiction and a relevant one by today's standards.Acting is throughout extremely good, superb with the three leads. Vicky Krieps is a powerful and subtle presence (very difficult to do with a character with as much ambiguity that Alma does), while Lesley Manville makes a somewhat thankless role terrifyingly formidable. But it's Day-Lewis' film, it's perhaps his most personal role with a little of himself in Reynolds and Day-Lewis gives the performance of his life portraying a man with vulnerable sensitivity and erratic quirks and is simply mesmerising, his swan-song being one of his finest performances and one of the year's overall best too. Am rooting for either him or Gary Oldman for 'Darkest Hour' for the Best Actor Oscar.It's already been said that Reynolds is not a likeable or relatable character. To me, he is not likeable but he is flawed in a realistic way (as said a trademark of Anderson and one of his strongest examples) and personally could identify with his quirks and sensitivity, being an autistic person prone to sensitivity and erratic moods, a lot of difficulties and obstacles having to be faced all my life and having a few compulsive quirks of my own. Though not as extreme as those of Reynolds, still try to be nice and easy to get on with despite all this. Overall, a divine film. A long film and a slow one but hugely rewarding. An easy 10/10.

PHANTOM THREAD,5 April 2018,7/10,"In post-war London, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a renown dressmaker. His sister Cyril is his constant assistant. At a restaurant, he is enthralled with the fumbling waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) who is also taken with him. He is particular with what he likes and lives a regimented life. Alma becomes his muse and model but his controlling nature overwhelms her.Paul Thomas Anderson has a great eye and Daniel delivers a great performance as usual. I'm not familiar with Vicky Krieps. She has some great surprising turns and is skillfully controlled. This is an intriguing portrayal of an imbalanced power dynamic. There is a surprising turn in the middle which I did not expect. After the turn, I expected a better downhill descend into a devastating collapse. Instead, it does something just as unexpected and I'm not as thrill about the second half. One has to respect the director's vision in this but it does leave me a little wanting."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2018,,"One of films who you expect. for elegancy, delicate humour, bitter dramatism. for sophisticated beauty. for the sensation of trip in a special side of past. for the status of artistic last will of Daniel Day-Lewis and expression of the art of Paul Thomas Anderson. and for the solide balance made by the performances of Vicky 
 Krieps and Lesley Manville.a film about fashion world. at the first sigh. because it is a film abbout a man and his circles . about passion and love and decisions and refuges, frustrations and romanticism in a special form. a film about life. so soft and subtle and charming and precise. than it gives to viewer one of rare states of pure admiration. for me, it is the expected film from many years. because it is not only beautiful of brilliant example of craft. but a sort of cure against traits of near every day reality."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 December 2017,8/10,"A couple of months ago, a friend was saying ""I'm not saying you should see MOTHER! but you're a yahoo if you don't""; when I saw it, I found it a self-indulgent artistic polemic against self-indulgent artistic polemics. This movie, in contrast, is a lampoon of those 1930s and 1940s movies in which someone suffers endlessly for some selfish artistic a**hole, dying of Dread Movie Disease in the 7th reel and looking more beautiful than ever, while the artist conducts his symphony or receives the applause at the premiere of his play; the protagonist is unnoticed save for the Vitaphone Orchestra and perhaps the Hall Johnson choir. Then, just as it is getting a little too long and self-indulgent, the movie switches gears. And does it again. All in that beautiful Technicolor lighting you got in Great Britain on prints that were a bit too dark.... thanks to uncredited cinematographer Paul Thomas Anderson.There's no reason this should be to your taste; large sections of it, about Vicky Krieps suffering because she loves Day-Lewis so much, and he, despite his occasional heterosexual activity (about like Donald Westlake's Parker) cares for nothing but making beautiful dresses and the memory of his dead mother, were not to mine. Still, by the end, when it's all creepy, I was left wondering whether this might actually be a comedy. It's certainly a commentary on obsessive artists, and a lot more subtly and artistically rendered than Aronofsky managed."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2018,6/10,"""Phantom Thread"" is a new American film released in 2017, here in German cinemas not before 2018. It runs for over 2 hours and reunites writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson again with lead actor Daniel Day-Lewis, in what is considered the final performance of the outstanding actor's career. Hopefully this won't prove true. Since the new millennium, we saw him play characters with crucial connections to economy (industry to be more precise), filmmaking, politics and some others too. Here he takes us into the world of fashion and as complicated as this world may be, it has nothing on how complicated his (love) life is indeed. Unsurprisingly, DDL scored another nomination that was not as surprising as PTA getting in for Best Director at the Oscars, not because he would be undeserving, but because he had almost no momentum. Having seen the film now, I am glad he is getting the recognition as this is a really beautifully directed film. The most surprising thing though is that Luxembourgian actress Vicky Krieps, who is almost unknown in Hollywood, plays the female lead, is even first-credited before Day-Lewis. But while he is of course the best thing from the cast, Krieps holds her own very well next to the legend. And actress Lesley Manville scored another surprising Oscar nomination too, but not an undeserving one either, for playing the protagonist's sister.I must say that until the very end with its big plot twist, I would be hesitant to actually call this a romance movie, but with what we find out then, it probably is, even if it is a very bizarre form of romance. There must have been a reason though for him so strongly refusing treatment during the first illness. And he said early on that it could have been some bad food, so maybe there he was not in on it yet, but when he later rules out food he knew what was going on. But he gets the weakness he longed for and one person taking care of him. Completely aside from that, this was also a beautiful film visually. I very much liked the scene of Woodcock sitting in front of the snowy mountains near the end, even if it was not filled with deep symbolisms or metaphors. It was just a stunning camera shot. What else? Don't worry if you don't know or care about fashion as neither do I and I still enjoyed the movie. A lot at times even. I am not too sure if I like the slightly masochist turn at the very end, but I cannot deny that it was among the most interesting moments the film has to offer and you can discuss a lot about it. Honestly, there are no likable characters in this film at all, but this film is a prime example of how strong writing and characterization result in the consequence that this is not a problem at all. Maybe you won't cheer for anybody here, not identify (hopefully) with anybody here, but you are nonetheless curious about what happens next in their lives. Maybe this is not my favorite film by PTA or my favorite film starring DDL, but this is just because of how great some of their other works are, not for a reason that this one here is weak. It most certainly isn't and it is a worthy addition to the bodies of work of everybody working on it. Not among my very favorite 2017 films, but I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out. A must-see almost for Day-Lewis fans. My favorite scene was probably the surprise dinner that went all kinds of wrong and Day-Lewis, Krieps and Anderson are really oozing creativity in this one. Outstanding and one of the best scenes of the entire year. That's all folks. Watch ""Phantom Thread"". You most likely won't regret it."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 March 2019,7/10,"This must be the first time in some years Daniel Day Lewis has made a film where he speaks with his own normal English accent.Director Paul Thomas Anderson has woven a beautifully crafted film set in 1950s Post War England and the haute couture fashion houses in London.Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a renowned dressmaker to the rich and famous. His clientele span the generations of the families his House has made clothes for.His sister Cyril is his assistant and business partner. She does truly understand his whims even if they irritate her and his behaviour with women that he takes a shine to.While having breakfast in a restaurant, Reynolds is taken in by a fumbling waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps.) Given the shape of her body she becomes his model and his lover.However after the exuberance and ecstasy of designing new outfits, Reynolds has a downer in his mood swings. This is reflected in his relationship with women. We see a scene where he is distant and disdainful of a girlfriend when he wants to be just left alone.Over time, Alma becomes a victim of this controlling, passive-aggressive behaviour. She cooks dinner for him as a surprise but Reynolds dislikes the style of the food and the order of the day being disrupted.However when Reynolds falls ill, Alma stays with him and nurses him better. Reynolds comes to respect her, Cyril has always liked her but it seems Alma figured out how to deal with his temperament.Phantom Thread is a clever love movie of a woman who not only wants her man but realising what makes him tick. It is a beautifully crafted film but it also goes on too long and does lull in places. There is no doubt it as times dry and pretentious. Yet I did admire its playfulness.Vicky Krieps gives the best performance but there were little odd things that could had been expanded on. I realised we know little about Cyril when we get a scene where she is standing next to her husband."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 April 2018,9/10,"Daniel Day Lewis - whatever the story is, you are guaranteed an acting masterclass with this guy. And while the pace of the movie will be trying for some (it is really slow), others will cherish it. You may also have the issue of likeability or general understanding of the actions the characters take. Especially Daniel's character does some very strange things - but all make sense in the microcosmos of the character that was written in the script and created by him.The you have the female opposite. Actually two of them, but the one that is front and center is off to say the least too. And it makes sense within what she is trying to do. Even without being told everything about her past, you know the actress did her homework, because she is confident in what she does, even if we as viewers may not understand (at first). This drama will split those watching it then, but you can't fault the actors or the costume department or any other department for that matter that worked on this. Quality work"
PHANTOM THREAD,11 August 2018,7/10,"This story might be considered in the realm of one getting in life what they deserve. There came a point in the film where it became completely ludicrous why Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his paramour Alma (Vicky Krieps) should have remained together. That would have been the first instance in which Alma went the poison mushroom route, and I was kind of intrigued that no one figured that out the first time around. But then, when Alma revealed the specifics of her cat and mouse game to Reynolds himself, I was convinced that these two maladjusted individuals were simply using each other for some twisted version of a relationship that in no way could have been considered love. Like a lot of reviewers here, I can appreciate the rich period detail of the picture, and the gowns designed by the House of Woodcock were elegantly exquisite. But the principal characters were not, for as one dimensional an individual as Reynolds was, Alma proved way beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a ball buster supreme in her own way. Both the 'toast scraping' scene and that loooong pour of water meant to get on Reynolds' nerves were classic in execution. There's no denying that both Day-Lewis and Ms. Krieps were brilliant in their portrayals, though in the end, the story itself came across as rather pointless."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 August 2018,8/10,"We cinephiles were disappointed to hear of Daniel Day-Lewis's retirement from the screen, but his final outing is a good one. Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread"" casts the world's most devoted actor as Mr. Woodcock, a dressmaker to the high society types in 1950s England. Surrounded by people as stodgy and proper as he is, Mr. Woodcock's life takes a different turn when he hooks up with a waitress (Vicky Krieps).The highbrow plot isn't the most profound, especially since it's the cinematography and the Oscar-winning costume design that stand out. What sticks in my mind are the performances. Day-Lewis and Krieps make clear that although the characters come from different backgrounds, they have something to offer each other. Certainly a better relationship than we see among the staid rich people for whom Mr. Woodcock designs clothes.It's not a great movie, but I liked the performances and the mildly comical depiction of Mr. Woodcock as ""very English"". Not at all the sort of movie that anyone would've expected from the director of ""Boogie Nights""."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,7/10,"I found out about this film through its nominations in Awards Season, but then I also found out it was the final film for the leading actor, his swan song before retirement, that gave me even more reason to watch it, written and directed by Oscar nominated Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, The Master). Basically set in 1950s London, Reynolds Woodcock (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Golden nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) is a renowned fashion designer who creates dresses and garments for members of high society, he is charismatic and a genius, but also obsessive and controlling. The day-to-day operations of his luxury fashion house, ""The House of Woodcock"", are managed by his sister Cyril (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Lesley Manville), she also has significant influence over his life. Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes. After debuting one of new pieces to a client, Reynolds visits a countryside restaurant, and becomes interested in waitress Alma Elson (Vicky Krieps), he asks her out on a date, and she accepts. A relationship develops between Reynolds and Alma, she soon moves in with him and acts as his muse, assistant, and love interest, Cyril is initially distrustful of Alma, but gains her respect for her wilfulness and determination. Alma enjoys being part of his creativity and seeing him work at first, but Reynolds proves hard to please and reserved. Alma and Reynolds bicker constantly, including a night when she makes a romantic dinner, he lashes out at how it is prepared, and repeats that he will not tolerate deviations in his routine that he has worked hard to perfect. Alma is desperate to regain some control in their relationship, so she decides to poison his tea with some wild mushroom shavings she gathered outside the house. Reynolds is readying a wedding gown for a Belgian princess but becomes gravely ill and later hallucinates his mother's ghost, but Alma takes care of him. Reynolds soon recovers, he finds himself deeply moved by Alma's devotion to him, he asks her to marry him, she initially hesitates, but then agrees. The relationship goes well at first but soon transfers back to a pattern of bickering and arguments, Reynolds feels his work is severely affected by Alma's presence and their marriage, he concludes it may be time to send her away. Alma responds by poisoning his omelette with more mushrooms, but this time Reynolds realises she has done this. She tells him she wants him to be weak and vulnerable, so she alone can take care of him, help him get stress relief and regain his strength and creativity, just so she can poison him again. Reynolds accepts the idea and bites into the food, submitting to his dark love for her. As he lies sick, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and running the dressmaking business as a partner, she acknowledges there will be challenges ahead, but their love for each other and their new arrangement can overcome them. Also starring Brian Gleeson (Brendan's son) as Dr. Robert Hardy, Harriet Sansom Harris as Barbara Rose, Gina McKee as Countess Henrietta Harding, Titanic's Richard Graham as George Riley, News of the World and Camilla Rutherford as Johanna. Day-Lewis does not often play English characters, he does give a terrific performance as the dressmaker with a very strict way of doing things, Krieps is very interesting as the woman who has affection for him, but equally tries to challenge his ways, and with her time on screen, Manville does well as the terrifying sister who is seeing the arguments from both sides. It is essentially a melodramatic love story, a war of nerves between the two lovers, also an insight into the delicate mind of a perfectionist, the costumes make for some interesting viewing as well, if this is Day-Lewis's final film, then it is a good one, a worthwhile drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Best Original Score for Jonny Greenwood, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 April 2018,,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our local public library. I don't like all PT Anderson movies, but they are always interesting and different. I like this one.Can we believe Lewis turned 60 last year? Generally considered one of the best actors of the modern generations he is really great here.Daniel Day-Lewis is self-absorbed 1950s London fashion designer 
Reynolds Woodcock. He is good and in demand and he knows it. In many respects he is a spoiled brat of a middle aged man. He runs his business out of his home which he shares with his sister, Lesley Manville as Cyril. She is his business partner, she understands him, and when a lady friend seems to become irritating to Reynolds she asks him if it is time to dismiss her.Out for dinner one evening he meets the server, Vicky Krieps as Alma. He is attracted to her, she is charmed by him, she follows him home where he proceeds to use her as a fitting model for a dress he is designing. Reynolds is capable of affection he just doesn't get in that mood very often. He is obsessed with his new designs.The movie is long at a bit more than 2 hours and many scenes move very slowly. I never minded because the character studies are so interesting. But I believe some movie fans will become impatient."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 October 2019,6/10,"If I were Daniel Day-Lewis, and I'm not, this would not be my farewell film. It is evident that he was intrigued by the character of Reynolds Woodcock, a dedicated fashion designer, seemingly devoid of any emotion except missing his dead mother. Woodcock lives a rigid, quiet life with his sister/major domo Cyril (Leslie Manville) who couldn't crack a smile if her life depended on it. He takes on young women as lovers and models, and out they go when he's throughAlong comes Alma (Vicky Krieps), his next model and eventual lover. She doesn't intend to be thrown out - ever. She's a more subtle '50s version of the Glenn Close character in Fatal Attraction.Alma figures out that underneath that hard, disciplined shell is a man who is needy for love, more of a maternal love, perhaps. So what could be better than Munchausen's by proxy?This story comes in a very glamorous, beautiful, atmospheric package, filled with gorgeous gowns, sumptuous gatherings, beautiful photography and sublime music. Take that all away and you have a Lifetime movie.Someone I know saw this and hated it, saying it was boring. I had to see it because of Daniel Day-Lewis - and he can elevate any script. The acting is wonderful from Vicky Krieps, Leslie Manville, and a neat performance by Harriet Samson Harris, another favorite.I admit the film was slow, but I wasn't bored. In that way, it was very European. I also admit I don't expect a lot of people on IMDb will be nuts about it, perhaps wanting something that moves a little faster.The major problem with the film for me was the fact that I couldn't warm up to any of the characters. I frankly thought Reynolds was a jerk, and I couldn't understand why Alma wanted to be with him until I realized she was a whack job. And Cyril - Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca comes off like Mother Theresa compared to her.Odd story, beautifully done."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 February 2018,,"This film tells the story of a master of dressmaking, and his relationship with a young women with the perfect model body.The music in the film is very striking. The screentime is filled with beautiful music whenever there is no dialog. The sorry is slow moving for people to absorb the story. Initially the dressmaker is portrayed to be unapproachable, soon the young woman enters the picture and changes the dressmaker. Their relationship is volatile and even toxic at times. The sets are beautiful as well. It is very interesting to watch."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 December 2019,8/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis, Lesley Manville and Vicky Krieps combine to deliver a work of great style and delicacy in this story about a London couturier to the rich and famous. ""Reynolds Woodcock"" lives with his sister ""Cyril"" in the disciplined and controlled environment he demands in order to be able to do his work as the leading creative dressmaker of his time. Enter ""Alma"" an aspiring, awe-struck apprentice with whom he falls in love - despite his own controlling instincts. The story evolves with purpose and depth; this isn't a straightforward love story by any means. Jonny Greenwood's score is brilliantly complimentary to the gentle but dynamic pace of the narrative and, of course, it's great to look at too."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,,"There is, of course, nothing new under the sun and it's not unreasonable that filmmakers should seek less hackneyed subject matter when beginning new projects so given a film set against a background of dresskmaking the viewer immediately seeks for precedents and comes up with what? The House Of Elliott, a formulaic television series no better or worse than any contemporary offering but more than that Eleanore Faucher's stunning debut feature film Brodeuses featuring a brace of impeccable performances from Ariane Ascaride and Lola Naymark. Reduced to a single word the film was about Healing and is worth ten Phantom Threads in both writing, directing, and acting. Okay, technically Brodeuses was about embroidery rather than dressmaking but the two fields are close enough to stand comparison and if Brodeuses didn't exist maybe Phantom Thread would be worth more than an honourable mention. Luckily for Phantom Thread Brodeuses was a foreign film that lacked the resources and 'big name' appeal of Phantom Thread. Chances are that will be enough."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,8/10,". . . its fellow ""Best Picture"" Oscar nominee THE SHAPE OF WATER, since PHANTOM THREAD is stitched together with all the subtlety we've come to expect from Ghoulardi Film's BOOGIE NIGHT director Paul Thomas Anderson. (Are we not men?!) PHANTOM THREAD's Reynolds Jeremiah Woodcock is presented by P.T. Anderson as a typical one per center fat cat living as the Solipcistic self-anointed Emperor of One for his own private universe (not unlike Jello the Hutt, currently squatting in our White House). He uses all of the people around him as random pieces of furniture, there to be kicked, scratched, or burned upon his slightest whim. Then waitress Alma, a progressive blue collar Union Label 99 per center, enters Woodcock's frosty forest. She's soon dishing out near-death experiences to R.J., insuring a fairer distribution of his ill-gotten wealth, respect, and prestige. The morel of this tale is that if your first poisoning doesn't succeed, try, try again. If it took three times to do in Rasputin, the sixth time might be the charm for Russia's Putin or the USA's Mr. Hutt. (Are we not men?!)"
PHANTOM THREAD,22 January 2018,8/10,"PHANTOM THREAD (2017) *** Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville. Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson's final collaboration with D-Day (after the latter announced his 'retirement' in the midst of production) continues to be a DynamicDuo in portraits of egotistical men with a gift for one thing in their life - i.e. a world-renowned fashion designer - while being faulted for every thing else - to wit: his Svengali-like relationship with a common young, woman (newcomer Krieps) who becomes enigmatic of their entire being. Beautifully shot by Anderson, impeccable production design by Mark Tildseley and amazing costumes by Mark Bridges give a sheen to this oddly conceived portrait of a crazed genius."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,10/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson started his career by making weird hot messes of movies (""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"") that I absolutely adored. Then he moved into a phase of making weird character studies (""There Will Be Blood"") that I also adored. Then he started making weird unpleasant movies that almost challenged their audiences to enjoy them (""The Master,"" ""Inherent Vice"") that I pretty much hated. His latest, ""Phantom Thread,"" brings back the PTA that I know and love, and while definitely weird, is one of the most fascinatingly weird love stories I've ever seen.Daniel Day-Lewis has said that this will be his final film, and all I can say is, ""We'll miss you."" He is magnificent here as a famous dress designer whose complete obsessive control over his environment becomes undone when he starts up a relationship with a young woman (Vicki Krieps) who he realizes he can't control. The thing is, in one of the film's most unpredictable and delightful turns, he realizes he likes relinquishing control but can only do so under certain circumstances. I won't spoil those circumstances for you, but let me just say that fungi are involved. We're a long way from ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""Krieps gives one of the performances of the year, and I can only imagine that the reason she has been completely ignored by end-of-year awards is that she's so unknown. The other standout is Lesley Manville, absolutely terrifying as Day-Lewis's sister, whose slight disapproving lift of an eyebrow could lay waste to entire civilizations. The film is elegant and beautifully designed, the sumptuous dresses on display serving as delicate shells to hide the festering rot at the center of these characters' hearts. And I was happy to see that Johnny Greenwood received an Oscar nomination for his lush score that knows when to be restrained and when to be overheated.""Phantom Thread"" might be my favorite movie of the year.Grade: A+"
PHANTOM THREAD,18 December 2019,9/10,"In early 1950's Britain, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the most sought-after dress designer among the rich and powerful. He lives a regimented, almost monastic life, with his watchful sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) as his close associate. One day Reynolds meets waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) and takes her on as his muse, model, lover, whatever he needs. Alma learns that she's not the first to fill this position in Reynolds' life, but she becomes determined to be the last.I could care less about the fashion world or Haute Couture, and yet I still was drawn into the single-minded obsessive artistry of Reynolds' world, his strict discipline and pursuit of perfection within his chosen field. Alma acts as an audience surrogate, unsure of this odd world led by the often inscrutable Reynolds and Cyril, the latter of whom often has the charm of an asp. But as Alma begins to see the way things work in this cloistered, rarefied world, she begins to find ways to upset it and bend it to her advantage. Cyril is naturally distrusting of this latest distraction, but Reynolds seems to find something in this new, shaky lifestyle of uncertainty.The performances are fantastic, with Day-Lewis once laying claim to the title of greatest actor of his generation. He complex, unique yet very real, without a single false note. Manville was also singled out for awards consideration, and she's scary, pitiful, powerful, and voice for order and tradition. Vicky Krieps, a native of Luxembourg, is subtle, sharp, and a match for Day-Lewis as the seemingly simple, unworldly Alma.The filmmaking is concise and largely unobtrusive, letting the characters do the work, often with silent looks and facial expressions. Director Anderson did not use a Director of Photography on this, instead working with the camera operators themselves. The result is spontaneous but not amateur looking, with a slight gritty haze that makes many scenes almost dream-like. It's not a look that I would like to see in a lot of films, but it works here among the chilly environments both exterior and interior. The score by Jonny Greenwood, guitarist and songwriter from Radiohead, is surprisingly subdued, mainly light piano pieces, with some flourishes when needed.I won't pretend that a lot of viewers will like this, as they might find it slow, pretentious, boring, or pointless. I certainly did not, and found it a deep, and even deeply disturbing, look at a unique type of love fostered by unusual people, told in a compelling, if quiet, way. This is more for the Masterpiece Theatre crowd than the Fast and the Furious crowd. I would rank this among the very best of the year 2017. Highly Recommended."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 January 2018,9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a certain feeling that envelops me while experiencing exquisite filmmaking. It's a singular blend of peacefulness and excitement as an anticipation of greatness builds in those early scenes. That feeling has rarely swept over me as quickly as the opening moments of this new film from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, a six-time Oscar nominee.We need only watch Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) go through his morning ritual to understand that he is a fastidious individual to the point that could easily be described as obsessive-compulsive. It's 1955 London, and this is the House of Woodcock. He lives and works in a home that serves as the canvas for his art, as well as a place to lay his head for sleep. His art is dressmaking. It's also his obsession and purpose for living. This is the story of a man with transformative talent, who, despite his stated lack of need for those outside his solitary realm, is dragged into the humanity of love and caring.This is an odd film about odd people. It's about a dressmaker and it features people making beautiful clothes ... yet it's not a fashion movie. No, this is the study of a genius man and his muse - who is also his lover - and their unconventional saga of love. It's also a consistently funny movie (and surprisingly so). Evidence that that 3 will always be a crowd, Woodcock's devoted sister and buttoned-up business partner Cyril (a terrific Leslie Manville) runs a tight ship, while simultaneously using her near preternatural ability to read his moods and idiosyncrasies and respond accordingly. He refers to her as ""my old so-and-so"" in a way that reflects a lifelong bond unlikely to be broken.The woman who prevents this from simply being a story of a reclusive genius is the aforementioned muse Alma (played by the effervescent Vicky Krieps). Is she his muse, a model, or his lover? Well, yes to all. And yet those labels fall short in describing the subtleties and nuances of their relationship. When does she play which role in order to maintain the balance so key to his work? Alma is often confused about the best approach in any moment, but she reaches him as none before. When she tells Woodcock that a certain client ""doesn't deserve your dress"", it strikes a chord with him that no one else has ever understood. It's as close to 'getting him' as one can attain.Ms. Krieps goes toe-to-toe with Daniel Day-Lewis in their scenes. He is simply the greatest living actor, and maybe the best ever at his profession. Her blushy cheeks and determined eye of observation bely an inner strength that isn't necessarily obvious at first glance. The twist in this ""romance"" is unlike any other love story from the big screen. While he is haunted by the memories of a cherished mother, Alma presents a more immediate force of reckoning. Is she his tender savior or a menace of danger? It's fascinating to watch this unfold.Most know by now that Daniel Day-Lewis has announced this will be his final acting role. We can only compare this to the retirements of Sandy Koufax or Jim Brown. We feel cheated by the void of greatness left by their departures, and if this is truly his final role, the DDL legacy is supremely secure. His meticulous performance shines not only through the quirky OCD moments, but even moreso in the seemingly spontaneous moments of bickering and annoyance ... moments that come across ad-libbed instead of scripted - these sound (and feel) like real life arguments!Supposedly, filmmaker Anderson based the character on Spanish-Basque designer Cristobal Balenciaga, and Day-Lewis research added other elements of authenticity. It's their first movie together since the fantastic THERE WILL BE BLOOD ten years ago, and theirs seems to be a synchronicity that few actors and directors ever share. Mr. Anderson shot the movie himself, and his use of close-ups - faces, fingers, sewing needles - capture the delicacies as well as the power. The final piece of this glorious puzzle is the orchestral score provided by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. It's both prominent and intricate, with stunning piano work that stands on its own. This is a movie about greatness by those who are also great."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 February 2018,7/10,"Strange and elegant with an interesting score, this movie seems at first like a story of a fashion designer or couturier running his exclusive fashion house designing one of a kind dresses for the rich and famous. He lives with his sister who helps him. He takes a fancy to a waitress and she becomes his muse and mistress. Then things take a more bizarre turn as the relationship between them changes. The way things progress is unexpected enough to keep the viewer interested in what is going to happen. Daniel Day Lewis is surprisingly not too old looking for her - it isn't gross. Even though he is old enough to be her father. Vicki Krieps is the young woman and she isn't too pretty so it's realistic. It was surprisingly interesting as the dynamic between the couple changes and not in a perverted way. The clothes are elegant and evocative of that glamorous period. Watch for a good cameo by Harriet Harris."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 April 2018,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson both wrote and directed this strange film that is apparently Daniel Day-Lewis' swan song from film - throughout his cinematic career he has always played strange roles, but this role is perhaps is most bizarre. It is a tale of the committed artist who lives a unifocused life in the middle of the 20th century and the effect his obsession with is chosen career has on family and everyone with whom he associates. It is also a very strange love story.The time: 1955. Confirmed bachelor Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day- Lewis) is a famed London couturier, designing elegant gowns for the rich and famous. His business is a one-man show on the design side. His genius can only be achieved within an environment he controls to his complete sensibility. On the business side is his spinster sister, Cyril Woodcock (Lesley Manville), who maintains order within the household to allow Reynolds to work within his controlled environment. She will, however, not allow anything or anyone to upset his world, including Reynolds losing sight that it is a business, and not just a means to design and create fashions solely for his own satisfaction without regard for the clients. That balance in their work/live relationship has the potential to take a turn when Reynolds meets waitress Alma Elson (Vicky Krieps). She not only becomes his muse but his assistant and lover. The entrance of Alma into Reynolds' life and the business changes the balance between Reynolds and Cyril, especially as Alma has her own sensibility of herself in Reynolds' life and in his business, which is often at odds with that control that Reynolds and Cyril have worked so hard to create and maintain. Insert attempts at poisoning, strange outings to New Year's Eve Balls, and stunning views of England, the countryside and the extravagant homes of the wealthy and the result is a treat for the eyes as well as a challenge for the intellect and for credibility.The cinematography is beautiful and the musical score - Jonny Greenwood's manipulation of fine classical music performances - adds considerably to this very long film. Tough story but worth enduring for the performances of Day-Lewis, Krieps, and Manville. Grady Harp, April 18"
PHANTOM THREAD,20 December 2018,5/10,"When this was shown theatrically I had no interest in seeing a film about a 50s high fashion dress designer. Being once more intrigued by the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and learning that the film was set in London's Soho after the war, with wondrous costumes on display, I decided to give it a go. Oh my, how sad, it seem the director was more interested in degrading film sock and reducing colour impact than in the dialogue. What we have is a series of poorly written scenes and drabness. London was a bit drab at the time but surely there was a bit of glamour in the dresses. Unfortunately the emphasis is on wedding dresses and the like and what with the designer's obsession with death it leads us inevitably to see these bundles of satin and lace as more like shrouds. He has his manly sister by his side at all times and talks (and even sees) his dead mother so it is no real surprise when we gradually learn of the lurking desire for dangerous necrophiliac sex games. Fortunately we are not asked to watch and most commentators seem not even to have noticed, or too embarrassed to mention. Daniel Day Lewis's performance has been referred to as, Shakespearian but in truth this one note and repetitive rant is more akin to a Punch and Judy show."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 April 2018,,"First and foremost, ""Phantom Thread"" is a beautifully photographed film with breath-taking colors, set-ups, and location footage. It also as well as a fascinating introduction to the art of fashion design. But it also tells a fascinating story with a mesmerizing yet frustrating central relationship of the middle-aged couturier and the young woman who is (apparently) his muse.The film would not be the same with the towering performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who etches an indelible character in the form of the fussy, neurotic dress designer Reynolds Woodcock. Vicky Krieps is also outstanding as the young woman Alma, who succeeds beyond anyone's expectation in getting inside Reynolds' head.There are touches of Hitchcock in the film, wherein a cat-and-mouse game ensues in the power struggle between Reynolds and Alma. But the film owes a nod as well to Bergman in long stretches of subtext oozing from characters in closed, claustrophobic environments.Indeed were it not for the development of the poison mushrooms, ""Phantom Thread"" would be very much in the mode of a Bergman film. The making of the omelette is one of the best in the film, as we watch the ingredients being prepared with the same meticulous attention to detail as the crafting of one of Reynolds' original dress designs.One thing is for certain. One will never contemplate a mushroom omelette in the same way after watching this inventive piece of filmmaking."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 June 2018,8/10,"This is obviously a carefully crafted film: from the scenes, the acting, the words, the clothes, the facial and body movements, the music, it is all careful and artistic. That being said, it is terribly descriptive: an obsessive dress maker finds his muse in a strange woman who wants him to be hers alone. There is nothing else, just their play back and forth, and then the film ends. If you are here for the quality of film making, then you will probably like the film. If you want some insight into human psyche, this is a good film to learn from, with actors as dedicated as Lewis, Manville and Krieps. If you are looking for an interesting story that fills you with emotion and teaches you new things, you may be disappointed.It doesn't help that neither of the characters in this film is even remotely relatable. Lewis' character is the typical obsessive genius that is careless of others and focuses on his work above all else. Yet he is not that much of a genius, just a failed human being with some temporary success and weird fetishes. Manville's character is a stern woman who's only purpose in life seems to care for Lewis to the point of losing herself, to keep things in balance when his histrionics threaten ""the house"". Krieps' character is plain creepy. If you want something to make you fear women, this is a great start. She is concomitantly lovely and well intentioned and borderline psychotic.Bottom line: a very technical and artistic study on a rather boring subject and some unrelatable people."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,4/10,"One of the great disappointments for any film buff is seeing a film which was made by a director, or which stars an actor whom you have greatly admired in the past but which fails to live up to expectations. I generally love the work of Stanley Kubrick, for example, but I have never liked his ""The Shining"", which is not in anything like the same class as films like ""Paths of Glory"", ""Spartacus"", ""Doctor Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"". Similarly, John Sturges's dull comedy ""The Hallelujah Trail"" was a grave disappointment after ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" and ""The Great Escape"", as was Fred Zinnemann's ""Julia"" after the likes of ""High Noon"" and ""A Man for All Seasons"". I had a similar feeling while watching ""Phantom Thread"" recently. There is probably no living actor for whom I have greater respect than Daniel Day-Lewis. I did not care much for his early ""My Beautiful Laundrette"", but apart from that I have loved virtually every other performance he has given since, from ""A Room with a View"" to ""Lincoln"". And yet I did not like ""The Phantom Thread"" at all, despite the fact that it was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who also made one of Day-Lewis's greatest films, ""There Will Be Blood"". The film is set in the world of haute couture in the London of the 1950s. Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a middle-aged bachelor fashion designer who lives with his sister in an elegant London townhouse. (Their parents must desperately have wanted another boy, because his sister has the normally masculine Christian name Cyril. Not ""Cyrilla"" or even ""Cyrille""). The story revolves around Woodcock's relationship with Alma, a young waitress whom he meets in a Yorkshire tea-room. Woodcock brings Alma back to London where she moves in with him and Cyril and becomes a model and Woodcock's muse and assistant. In his previous great films Day-Lewis has generally played either men of action, like Hawkeye in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" or the bloody ruffian Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"", or else men dominated by some great passion, such as Christy Brown's fight to overcome his disability in ""My Left Foot"", or Gerry Conlon's struggle to right the terrible injustice he has suffered in ""In the Name of the Father"", or sexual desire (Newlands Archer in ""The Age of Innocence"") or lust for money (Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"") or political idealism (""Lincoln""). The one exception is Cecil in ""A Room with a View"", a man whose supposed passion for culture just seems like pretentiousness, but then he is supposed to be a rather ridiculous, comical figure. Woodcock, by contrast, is a man who, if he has any emotions at all, keeps them very well hidden. He is secretly haunted by the death of his mother, but the only emotion he ever seems to express is anger, and that only in the sense of irritable petulance rather than that of furious rage. It is never really made clear whether he and Alma ever become lovers in the physical, or even in the emotional, sense. When Alma tries to poison him we never understand what evil deed he might have committed to merit such treatment, but we never really sympathise with him either. Nor, for that matter, do we understand Alma's motivation; it just seems to be a given that she is the sort of girl who does that sort of thing. The best acting performance probably comes from Lesley Manville as the patient Cyril. Vicky Krieps never really seemed convincing as Alma. (One thing that was never certain was the question of Alma's nationality. The Luxembourg-born Krieps played her with a foreign accent, but it was never mentioned what country she is from). As for Day-Lewis, the kindest thing I can say is that, by taking on a character so different to most of those he has played in the past, he at least had the courage to fail, because this is one of his rare failures. Woodcock never comes alive as a character we can identify with or take much interest in. To call the film slow would be an understatement. By comparison a three-legged tortoise would look like a cheetah. The whole thing just seemed so cold, passionless and bloodless that I thought Anderson should have called it ""There Will Not Be Blood"". 4/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,26 December 2017,9/10,"Thespian, Three-Time Oscar-Winning Actor Daniel Day-Lewis' Swan Song 'Phantom Thread' is a knockout! Writer-Director Paul Thomas Anderson, in his second-collaboration with Day-Lewis (the first being There Will Be Blood, which won Day-Lewis his Second Best Actor Oscar-Win) brings us a delicious romance/drama film, that's the one for the ages. Its truly finds its Writer-Director & Leading-Man, at their finest hour! 'Phantom Thread' Synopsis: Set in 1950's London, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a renowned dressmaker whose fastidious life is disrupted by a young, strong-willed woman, Alma (Vicky Krieps), who becomes his muse and lover.'Phantom Thread' is a love-story about a difficult, artistic man and a much younger, but strong-willed woman. Day-Lewis' Woodcock is a genius & can stitch better than anyone, he's passionate & incredibly creative. BUT, he's also very controlled & planned. His life is set in a pattern & he is a man with secrets. He isn't a regular lover, he in fact, has never married & believes in love as a luxury of limited time. And when stumbles the beautiful Alma, he sheds his own monotony. He decides to give love a shot.Alma, on the other-hand, is his complete opposite. She believes in living her life beyond the monotony & makes no point to live her life in a followed pattern. So when Woodcock dresses her up & makes her the most costumes, she agrees & falls in love. The conflict, however, is Woodcock's take on love & Alma's belief in letting him know that his love can last, if he stops living his life in the same as he has for years.And its the contrasting nature of its main characters that makes 'Phantom Thread' the most deliciously suspenseful romantic film of the year. Its an unpredictable love-story, with beautiful twists. The narrative never lets you guess the next step & the romance of Woodcock & Alma, is intensely passionate. Their relationship is brimmed with love, labored by ambition & stitched in passion. And despite the intensity in its romance, Anderson delivers humor in the least expected moments. I won't give away the delicious treats Anderson gives us, because it needs to be experienced. Just like I did.'Phantom Thread' is Anderson's finest film in years. His Award-Winning Screenplay presents romance with the correct amount of suspense & humor. The Writing never dips; its engrossing throughout. And the Dialogue, are priceless. Anderson's Direction is marvelous. The Master Storyteller paints 'Phantom Thread' with elegance & intensity. Oscar-Attention is very likely.Cinematography is magnificent. Dylan Tichenor's Editing is well-done, letting the film flow beautifully. Art & Costume Design offer perfection. Jonny Greenwood's Score is extraordinary. And Now The Performances! Day-Lewis makes Reynolds Woodcock unforgettable. A man with a troubled mind, but also a creative genius, and also too stern to change even for the sake of love, Day-Lewis paints the highs & lows of the man with magnificence. In his final role, Day-Lewis reminds us his greatness. Never has a flawed protagonist, looked this irresistible before. Lending him terrific support are the woman in his life, Lesley Manville (as his sister) & Vicky Krieps (as Alma). Manville raises laughs & is a pleasure to watch as the sister who understands her brother's flaws & lifestyle, despite her knowing how suffocating it is. Manville is a pure delight whenever she's on screen. Krieps takes on the huge challenge of facing the heavyweight Day-Lewis in practically every frame & yet, gives us an acting masterstroke. Alma is a woman of strong will, who loves with all her might & is ready to embrace newness & Krieps makes her own. Her on-screen chemistry with Day-Lewis, is simply wow. Its hard to find a single false note in any of the 3 performances here.On the whole, 'Phantom Thread' is seductive & intoxicating! Its among the very best films of the year. Don't Miss It."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2018,,"In Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread, Daniel Day-Lewis is like his protagonist, a celebrated '50's London fashion designer, Reynolds Woodcock, because they both are meticulous and mercurial artists, whose creative livelihood requires complete devotion to the craft, without distraction. If anyone can challenge Gary Oldman's front-running Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, it's Day-Lewis.Seeing an artist at work, in this case a designer sew designs and direct models, is where I find my most complete satisfaction. Reynolds is very much the genius micro-manager who guides each fold into perfection. His personal life, however, is not so easily handled as he finds out when he falls in love, a designer that brooks no competition.Reynolds falls for a waitress, Alma (Vicky Krieps), whose stature and curves reach the perfection he seeks, but always, it seems from a design point of view but not predominantly a romantic one. She has a strong will, however, that seeks the place in his life where she is not just a lady in waiting. After the electric first half, full of his genial moments and self-centered creativity, Phantom Thread settles into a melodrama losing sight of his genius in order to promote Alma's machinations gaining control of his affective life. Although her methods are extreme and worthy of thriller status, the latter half of the film loses the excitement as it relies on formulaic circumstances of whether someone will die or not from the intrigue.As he did in The Master and There Will be Blood, Thomas helms believably genial outsiders, who, like Woodcock, create beauty in the face of petty politics and personal liabilities. Although I was a bit disappointed in the melodrama, I was thrilled by DDL's performance and PTA's fluid, moody direction. There is very little out there to compete with their genius."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 April 2021,8/10,"D. D. Lewis is Reynolds, dressmaker to the rich and famous in 1950s London, with his sister. No time for distractions. Until he meets Alma ( Vicky Krieps), who is much younger. She waits on him in a lunchroom, and immediately after placing his order, he asks her out to dinner. Where he (rudely) removes her lipstick. We learn right away that he's a bit of a nut. But when i saw the film is over two hours, i knew it was going to be a complicated story. Alma begins to model for Reynolds and his sister. Music plays a role in the film as well... it's always flowing and beautiful, like his dresses. But... to fill two hours, the story does go off on some tangents. Like the Rose wedding. That was strange and awkward. Odd moments when Alma tries to correct Reynolds. He's stubborn and eccentric, and every now and then she tries to nudge him, to make him behave more like a gentleman. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Written and directed by Paul Anderson. He has been nominated for EIGHT oscars over the years... so far. And a couple were for this very film. He had also done Punch Drunk Love and There will be Blood. Quite a range."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,7/10,"""Phantom Thread"" is one of those movies as you watch it's pretty straight to the point and clear it doesn't have a lot of plot twist or turns.

PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2018,8/10,"A 1950s period drama sets its heart on a toxic relationship between London couturier Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis), whose name is a tongue-in-cheek pun to any Reynolds clan, and a waitress Alma (Krieps), Paul Thomas Anderson's eighth film PHANTOM THREAD poshly burrows into the murky dynamism of the co-existence between two disparate souls, it is a perspicacious critique excoriating the delusion of a perfect match in the gender politics. Reynolds is a debonair bachelor, whose dresses are adored by London's upper crust. Immersed in this female-objectification culture, his criteria of muse-selecting is strictly physical, which explains why he lays his eyes on the apparently inept Alma in the first place and conducts a sensuous measuring rite of initiation on her under the cold gaze of his sister Cyril (Manville), who oversees his affluent business. It is very difficult to not fall under Reynolds' benignant spell, especially for the one hails from a lesser echelon (apropos of both gender and class), Alma accepts her potluck with a stunned amazement, waltzing around in Reynolds' resplendent artifacts and believes she is the luckiest girl in the world, until the inevitable personality differences cast a long shadow on their budding fondness. Reynolds is the typical self-obsessed, anal-rentive kind, who is used to be idolized on a pedestal by his worshippers, inveterately wrought within his own mode of life, therefore he has a very low tolerance to any distractions (table manners do matter). Alma has to learn the lesson in a hard way as her rustic charm starting to pall in flouting Reynolds' self-centered directives (some backchat emerges and a bespoke home dinner to celebrate his birthday goes off the rail) and she is in the danger of being ousted, as many a woman before her. As seemingly dew-eyed as her, Alma defies our expectation in her wits and wiles, a bold experiment with poisonous mushrooms gets her an upper hand in the situation and even prompts Reynolds' heartfelt marriage proposal, which she knows all too well that she is unable to refuse because it is as scarce as hen's teeth. When nuptial excitement plateaus, their co-habitation reverts back to the strain-ridden normalcy, Alma must again push the reset button, but this time, with Reynolds in the know, the entire third act is an ode to the sadomasochistic facet of a long-standing relationship that is clandestinely exclusive of any third party's voyeurism, and the revelation coasts with utterly levelheaded poise and candor under PTA's unflinching guidance and Jonny Greenwood's comping score, which incubate with an air of glamorous decadence draping over the whole process.Of course, kudos also should apportioned to the key players, Daniel Day-Lewis, in his alleged last acting gig, is overtly well in his wheelhouse as the chic-dissing dressmaker, leaving his indelible footsteps practically anywhere in between angel and demon, an Oscar-nomination is a dead-cert when Reynolds' egoism, vulnerability and expertise are that rivetingly magnified through his performance, he is the sole living legend who ladles out his thespian talent only in the name of art and nothing else, and his screen presence will be painfully missed (if he will not walk back his retirement). In a more unexpected regard, Vicky Krieps bowls viewers over for her career-boosting turn not just by holding court in front of Mr. Day-Lewis, but also reifying the characterization of an ostensibly blasé role equipped with profound complexity, her Alma is brimming with transfixing agency, petulance and fortitude. A glacial Lesley Manville, granted with her hard-earned first Oscar nomination, taking a back seat mostly with passing glances in silence, is the omnipresent on-looker who doesn't debase herself into the ongoing fray aside from terse rejoinders, but anyone has a scintilla of horse sense knows that Cyril is the real deal one should never trifle with. Reverting to its title, PHANTOM THREAD points up a cardinal metaphor in its sartorial reference, reminds us there is something invisible, immaterial that weaves together our own existence with resultant individuality and originality, self-introspection should be a daily practice in achieving a possible satori of lucidity."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 January 2018,9/10,"'PHANTOM THREAD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's new critically acclaimed historical drama, about a famous dressmaker, in 1950s London, who's routine life is disrupted by sudden love. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, who last teamed with Anderson in 2007's critical darling 'THERE WILL BE BLOOD' (and this is reportedly Day-Lewis's last film role). The movie costars Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville, and it's also the director's fourth collaboration with music composer Jonny Greenwood. The film was shot in Lythe, England, marking Anderson's first movie filmed outside of the US, and it was also shot without an official cinematographer (Anderson says it was a collaborative effort). The movie has gotten nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for a shitload of prestigious awards as well. I really enjoyed it. The story is set in 1950s London, when Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis) is a famous dressmaker who dresses all of society's wealthiest and most elite women. He's also a bachelor, who lives with his sister Cyril (Manville), and the two siblings are lifelong business partners. Reynolds has had many girlfriends, who briefly enter his life, but then he quickly rejects them. That is until he meets Alma (Krieps), who disrupts his obsessive and routine life to it's core.The film is slow-paced but it's still always interesting and involving. Day-Lewis is once again amazing in the lead, and he also once again portrays a very unlikable leading man character, but we still end up rooting for him (or at least I did). Even more so I rooted for Alma though, who's also beautifully played by Krieps, but what's most fascinating about the movie is what a beautiful love story it is. The film also beautifully shows us how love conquers all, even in really dark obsessive ways sometimes. This film does get really dark too, towards the end (like most of Anderson's movies), and I love it for it."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,6/10,"A slow start paves the way for a pretty entertaining, constantly evolving and slightly off-kilter character-study that is structured around a series of scenes collated together to form a rather well-painted portrait of its central unhealthy relationship, rather than a more traditional narrative with a beat-by-beat plot or conventional character arcs. Its main issue is its pacing and length, for it honestly feels far longer than it actually is and seems to rival even the most bum-numbing of experiences, even though it is only a rather measly (in the grand scheme of things) 130 minutes. That's not to say it was ever boring or unintelligent, just somewhat disengaging on its most base level and, even in retrospect, a little flat from an experiential standpoint. 6/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,10/10,"Short bursts of enthusiasm on Facebook aren't enough, I fear, for most people. I've seen ""Phantom Thread"" twice now within a few weeks and I stand by my claim that it's a masterpiece. Why? Well, it's a Paul Thomas Anderson film but that, in itself, means nothing. Despite my reverance for Anderson, (let's just say ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""The Master""), even the greatest of film-makers can fall flat, (Hitchcock on a couple of occasions, Antonioni with ""The Red Desert""), but this extraordinary film seems to me to be perfection. Indeed, there wasn't a frame that didn't excite me, a line of dialogue that didn't thrill me, a performance less than brilliant, (and I am speaking of the smallest of parts as well as of the three principles). Five minutes in and I knew I was watching something really special.It's a love story, though one soaked in perversity. I don't want to give too much away to those of you who have yet to see it and to say more would be to say too much, but it's a love story nevertheless. It's also a beautifully understated study in sadomasochism though who is the sadist and who is the masochist is a matter of debate; for now let's just call it a psychological comedy-thriller with an equal emphasis on the comedy as on the thrills. Anderson's genius is to create two characters in whom we utterly believe and yet who, by their very eccentricities, remain two of the most strikingly original characters in recent cinema and, of course, he has got stunning performances from both Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps as the lovers in question, (and an equally stunning performance from Lesley Manville as the dragon sister whose bark, it would appear, is worse than her bite). Yet even that wouldn't qualify ""Phantom Thread"" for masterpiece status. So what does?Reynolds Woodcock, the character played by Day-Lewis, is a master couturier, fastidious to the point of suffering from OCD and Anderson surrounds him, and fills his film, with a myriad of telling details, details that as much as the fastidious Day-Lewis' fastidious acting allows us to get into Reynold's head, (the same details work equally well for Krieps' character Alma). This is a man who sews little keepsakes into his garments, who carries his mother with him wherever he goes, (he's a classic 'Mommy's Boy'), while Alma's early stint around kitchens certainly comes in handy when she needs it too, so the design of the film, the cinematography are crucial to its success. So too is Jonny Greenwood's great score. Here is a film positively drowning in music, drowning in the kind of music that films of the fifties, the period in which it is set, might have drowned in. So I stand by my claim that this is a masterpiece and one I know will stand up to repeated viewings. If I see a better film this year it will have been a very good year indeed."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2018,5/10,"The lead male hero in ""Phantom Thread"" is a tailor of the high society ladies in a city of London vaguely located in time sometimes after WWII. It is seldom that I am in such a disagreement with the opinions of the majority of the film critics and of many of my friends whose opinions I appreciate. I cannot refrain myself however to express my feelings about this film by quoting the famous short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about the tailors that sewed the ""emperor's new clothes"". I need to shout: ""The emperor is naked!"" ""This film is bad!"" Not even Daniel Day-Lewis can save it. IMHO, of course.I need now, of course, to explain. I will try to do it without committing the sin of writing a spoiler. It's the love story between a man well over 50 and a young woman in her 20s. Their are separated not only by the age difference, but also by a social gap (he is a famous tailor of the rich and famous, she is a servant in a country inn) and a difference of nationality left vague in the story. He is one of the best tailors in the world, totally dedicated and immersed in his art. He picks the young woman more like an instrument that fits his artistic model and goals, while the young woman (acted by Vicky Krieps) is completely falling in love with him. In order to draw his attention she will do something terrible which I will not reveal, not once but twice. The result is his complete surrender first into marriage, later into parenthood. His creative power seems however to diminish, and the final is actually vague again about his continuing artistic path. The story is outrageous (and I do not allow myself to be outraged to easily), non-credible and ridiculous.I liked a lot Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" and especially ""The Master"". I am quite astonished about his latest works including this film. He probably intended to bring to screen a story of love and horror, of passion not shared, of a relationship that is based on a terrible lack of balance. The story he created and the solutions he found did not work for me. I am even more disappointed because of the superb acting of Daniel Day-Lewis who is again investing all his acting style and talent in order not to act but to become his character. I will be very sorry it this is the last film of his acting career. Maybe he will change his mind. What about the role of a great artist like Leonard Bernstein or Herbert von Karajan? While watching ""Phantom Thread"" I was thinking about these two great music conductors as characters of the same huge talent and intensity as the one of the hero he brings to screen in this film. Daniel Day-Lewis deserves a better final."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 January 2018,5/10,"I'm not sure why I expected anything different from Phantom Thread. It's a Paul Thomas Anderson film about a dressmaker in the 1950's. If there's going to be a film that bores me to sleep, it would likely be that film. It's not that Phantom Thread is a bad film. It's beautifully shot, well-acted, and I can certainly acknowledge that the film is well-made overall. But there was no part of this film that I enjoyed. This dark and twisted relationship between Daniel Day-Lewis' Reynolds and Vicky Krieps' Alma is interesting, but I can't ever see myself ever revisiting this one.When I found yourself drifting within 30 minutes of the film beginning, I knew that the film wasn't for me. But let's discuss the good before I bore you even more than I already have. This is apparently Day-Lewis' last film, and with the type of role that Reynolds is, I think it was a nice way to go out. Of course, Lincoln would have been a better way to end, but I guess that's out of the question. Reynolds is creepy, manipulating, obsessive, devoted, and downright obscure. All things I'm sure that a method actor loves tapping into. There may not be anyone better than DDL in history, but I'm not even sure that he deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for his turn as Reynolds. He likely will, but I can definitely find 5 better performances. Even with that said, DDL carries the film and instantly elevates his fellow actors. In all though, Phantom Thread is a film for a select audience, and it's slow building twisted love story is not something I found to be worth over 2 hours of my time.5.7/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,29 December 2017,,"I admit, this was probably my least anticipated Paul Thomas Anderson film. Nothing about it seemed all that intriguing, but I should have known that even the most seemingly dull premise can turn out to be something quite fascinating in the hands of PTA. I would argue that it reminds me the most of The Master in some of its structure, getting more and more abstract the longer it goes on. But it's also somewhat more accessible than that. As with all PTA films, I need some time to digest this, but I can say that it's another deeply fascinating, always intriguing film from one of the best in the business. In terms of technical filmmaking, this is definitely one of the best of the year. As for the acting, the three main performers here are quite fantastic. Of course Day Lewis has gotten the most attention, but as good as he is, it's Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville who really shine, the latter with such minimal dialogue that it's impressive the impact she makes."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 February 2018,,"A fascinating vignette of power dynamics set in the couture world of 1950s London, Phantom Thread is another absorbing character study from Paul Thomas Anderson that's masterly directed, expertly scripted, deftly layered, wonderfully photographed, patiently paced & exquisitely performed. Original, alluring & thoroughly engrossing, it's a spectacular entry in Anderson's filmography and a fitting end to the greatest acting career of our time. In short, one of the best all-round films of 2017."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 August 2021,9/10,It was good movie.D. D Lewis once again did a great job.
PHANTOM THREAD,16 April 2018,7/10,"Phantom ThreadIronically, the one career that men will always outperform women at is designing women's fashion.Case in point, the virtuoso dressmaker observed in this drama. Top designer to London's post-WWII elite, confirmed bachelor Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is as renowned for his haute couture as he is for his fussy temperament. Even his new muse Alma (Vicky Krieps) falls prey to Woodcock's aloofness when she moves into his fashion house and becomes his wife.It is not until a walk in the woods does Alma discover a noxious way of keeping her mercurial man in check and under her thumb.Beautifully shot and forcefully acted with a haunting score, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest offering is a successful - but long-winded - analysis of genius and the extreme measures it takes to live with one.Moreover, living with a genius is easy; just keep their brain in a jar of formaldehyde.

PHANTOM THREAD,28 December 2018,8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Phantom Thread"" (2017) is a very slow paced drama. Basically nothing that much happens during its whole running time 2 h and yet i watched the whole thing basically in one seeing - and that happens pretty rarely lately. That is because i think of a very solid writing (not the story itself, only writing) which was involving, good directing (movie is very well paced given the ""boring"" plot) and superb acting by two / three leads. Surely its easy to say that a movie was superbly acted when you have Daniel Day-Lewis in you cast, but this Vicky Krieps who i saw for a first time left a big impression on me - that is some star making role in my opinion. As for a plot - this is a good character study movie - i like those when they done good, and ""Phantom Thread"" was done good.Overall, i hope the whole ""The Last movie of Daniel Day-Lewis"" story will be forgotten by himself and he comeback sooner or later to do his thing, because i don't thing anyone does that thing better then him - when you see De Niro or Pacino doing their thing, you some some powerhouse stuff, but there is a pattern in their acting. When you see Day-Lewis doing his stuff - you do not see any pattern of an a actor or anything that would resemble ""Daniel Day-Lewis"" - because he is always different - only Brando i think was like that in his golden age. Single persons acting hardly gets better then this."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 August 2019,7/10,"Extremely slow, but at no point boring, well-written, even better acted and perfectly shot. So why do I feel like I've just wasted two hours ...7/10"

its a film about life,tailoring,modelling,hate,patience,mushroms,poshism,poison,narsissism,asbergerism,silence,lonelieness,marriage,idiocracy and hypocracy and so on.its a never ending story of power and might between two super-ego's.
though it is a marvellous piece of motion picture art, its far too slow,and a dumb-stumbling story for john doe..i guess i wouldve had more benefit from watching this film blindfolded,and rather let the musical score tickle my ears to entertain me."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2018,10/10,"Although there certainly are objections to this film in various ways, its story and its slow motion above all, it is a breathtakingly beautiful film. It is a film about beauty, the delicacy of its handling, the arduousness of its creation and its unavoidable complications. Daniel Day Lewis is a confirmed bachelor working as a tailor exclusively to the highest society, which has been his life's calling from the start. He finds a new model in a serving maid out in the country, none of them have seen each other before, so it's a fresh start for both, and they celebrate triumphs on their way together to begin with. The complications begin when she starts to take over his life and he objects. Questionable manoeuvres follow.Still the film remains sustained until the end on a very high level of exquisiteness, and it's truly a cinematic work of art of the very highest rate. There aren't many films about tailors, most of them tell opposite stories, so this is in every aspect a unique film and very fitting as a crowning masterpiece on Daniel Day Lewis' career."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 March 2018,,"The summary line I would have used is ""of mushrooms, ""The beguiled"" and other thing"", which would be by itself a spoiler for those who have seen the recent movie mentioned. Or perhaps not. While mushrooms play a pivotal role in both movies, the intention and end results are quite different. ""Phantom thread"" which has just won an Oscar for Costume Design opens with what may be called a pseudo VO, which continues at various appropriate junctures through the movie. But we actually see the face behind the voice, Alma (Vicky Krieps), talking in a quiet, unhurried manner about Reynolds, a man who has made her dreams come true. A ""most demanding man"", she adds. For a moment into the movie, there seems to be a similarity with the recent movie ""Mother!"" which depicts an often-seen situation of a man's artistic career being everything to him, so much so that the women he loves has no hope of competing. But no. PT has more to offer.The narrative structure of PT is one that is often employed. It opens with a brief prologue set at the ""present"", rewinds back to an earlier timeframe to begin a linear narration, then eventually comes back to opening prologue and finishes the movie with a coda that may take various shapes (a final twist or an open-ended conclusion, among others). Immediately following Alma's opening prologue (in which the person she is addressing is ""hidden"" outside the frame of the camera), we get to see this ""most demanding man"", one Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis), see a lot of him starting with a closeup. The establishing sequences, accompanied by a mellowed, languid version of instrumental ""My foolish heart"", shows Reynolds at work, a fashion designer in the 1950s at the top of his profession, and also a perfectionist. On the domestic front we are introduced to him at the breakfast table in the company of two woman. One is his sister and business partner Cyril (Lesley Manville) who quite clearly also has the role of a surrogate mother (although Reynolds did not have an orphaned childhood, but I'll come back to that). The other woman we can completely ignore as she is out of the picture (both figuratively and literally) immediately. Whatever that relationship she has been having with Reynolds, he has grown tired of it and dumps her before we even have time to register her face.The courtship sequences show the gentle, tender side of Reynolds. Everything starts with him ordering breakfast from Alma but the mutual registration of a kindred spirit even before she comes to his table as they exchange suggestive glances and smiles while she is taking orders two table away. At his table, as if they have all the time in the world (and why wouldn't they?), he orders, in deliberate, exquisite diction, his breakfast starting with Welsh rarebit and followed by a dozen (almost literally) various items. She remembers them all by heart. To cut a long story short (half-story, I should perhaps say), the courtship overflows with sweetness like pancakes drowned in syrup, through a pageantry of idyllic setting, culminating in her moving in with him. Needless to say, making beautiful dresses for her is a key theme throughout this courtship.At about the mid-point of the story, their relationship starts to deteriorate. To get something out of the way: the competition between Alma and Cyril will obviously have a role to play, but it turns out not to be as significant as expected. Indeed, there is one scene that accentuates this rivalry, showing the two women seeing a doctor the door of the house and uttering in full synchronization one syllable replies to his questions. But by far the most important factor is the clash of character between Reynolds and Alma, with the latter gradually revealing that she is made of much sterner stuff than what her initial mild demeaner has led him (and, indeed, the audience) to expect. Without melodramatic shouting and yelling, they simply match each other retort for retort. The conclusion of this ""Act 1"" has to do with mushrooms picked in the forest. While in ""The beguiled"" they are used to kill, here their effect is only to make Reynolds very sick. ""I want you flat on your back. Helpless, tender, open with only me to help"". That works like a magic charm, with recovery, reconciliation and blissful matrimony. ""Act 2"" is basically repeating the same cycle, with minor variations, bringing the movie to the time frame of the opening scene, but now showing that Alma's audience for this ""pseudo VO"" (I coined) is actually the doctor who has come to tend Reynolds in this second wave of sickness. Then, you may not guess it - happy ending. This very art-house movie accents on characters but has left their background intriguingly and tantalizingly vague. Of Alma's background we know very little, except for her discernable foreign (likely German) accent and her enigmatic expression (unobserved except by the camera) when Jews and Germans are mentioned in a general conversation. For Reynolds, as aforementioned, he had a mother up to possibly his adolescence, as reference is made to his early blooming talents of making a wedding dress for his mother's second wedding. The creepiest scene is his hallucination in sickbed, with his mother appearing at the far end of the room beside the door. Daniel Day-Lewis and Lesley Manville got respective Oscar nominations for lead and support acting and that testifies to their superb performance. Luxembourgian actress Vicky Krieps, a fresh face to the international screen, is right up there with the two of them. And I am probably not the only one who is reminded of young Meryl Streep, watching Krieps's performance."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 April 2018,9/10,"A new film from writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson is always a cause for celebration among film buffs. Apart from his underwhelming 1996 debut Hard Eight and 2014's messy Inherent Vice (which I still enjoyed despite the constant head-scratching), Anderson's output is always something to savour with repeat viewings. But his latest, a sumptuous and idiosyncratic love story set in 1950's London, is not only noteworthy for being the work of the one of the finest filmmakers of recent times, but for the announcement that this will be the final big screen appearance of Daniel Day-Lewis, an actor whose frequent returns to cinema after long periods away always mark a reason to sit up and get excited.Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous fashion designer who creates the most wonderful and elegant dresses for the ladies of high society, who clearly pay top dollar for his services. He is charismatic and handsome, but also impulsive and quick-tempered. Woodcock is a man of routine who insists on starting the day with a large breakfast and, most importantly, quiet. We first meet him sharing the breakfast table with his latest squeeze, and he scowls at the sight of a pastry offered by her. His sister Cyril (Lesley Manville), who he shares his large residence with, has witnessed her brother's cycle of excitement and boredom with attractive ladies many times before, and quickly sets up plans to remove the poor girl from their home and his life. He talks of his late mother and a growing sense of unease. It's clear he's in dire need of a new muse to keep the creative juices flowing.His mood quickly improves when he has breakfast at a nearby hotel and has his attention grabbed by the clumsy yet beautiful Alma (Vicky Krieps). He invites her to dinner and does most of the talking, telling stories of his past and his fondness for sowing hidden messages within the dresses he creates. In his own suit jacket, he keeps a lock of his mother's hair. Alma is swept away by this charming man, and agrees to a dress fitting despite the intimidating presence of Cyril. Soon enough, she notices a gradual change in Woodcock's mood, and Cyril braces herself for the inevitable. But Alma loves and feels that she understands the mysterious and exciting genius, and concocts a plan to keep a hold of him forever. Indeed, Phantom Thread is possibly the oddest and most mesmerising love story since Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson's 2002 dark comedy and still his greatest film to date.The director has always worn his influences on his sleeve, and Phantom Thread is infused with an aura of Kubrick, and a heavy lashing of Hitchcock. It's probably his most straight-forward film, but there is an obliqueness to the story also. The narrative veers off into almost fairy-tale territory, as Alma sets in motion her grand scheme. It all moves along at a dazzling, hypnotic pace with the assistance of Johnny Greenwood's classical score and Anderson's constantly gliding camera. If this is truly the final performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, he is certainly ending in a high note with one of the finest performances of his career and further cements his place as one of, if not the, finest actor to ever grace our screens. Manville is also fantastic as the cold and shrewd Cyril, a woman who has seemingly dedicated her life to her mummy's-boy sibling, with whom she shares a relationship that often feels incestuous. Krieps is radiant, simmering with intensity as she refuses to become yet another muse to be shown a quick exit. Phantom Thread is not for everyone, but Anderson's films never are. Despite the period setting, this is a truly modern love story, and one with the power to both warm the heart and genuinely horrify.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 February 2018,8/10,"As is to be expected from the man that has given us some of the great gems of modern cinema, Phantom Thread is another immaculately crafted piece of cinema designed by the original and unpredictable Paul Thomas Anderson and while it may not be the famed director's best work, it's one of the more unpredictable and near unclassifiable experiences of the 2017 awards crop.Curiously only the second film Anderson has been Oscar nominated for his work as a director, Thread is the filmmaker at his most refined and low-key as he takes over the reigns of the films sole DOP and writing duties to set-up an intimate and slowly paced study of Day-Lewis's particular and prickly post-war dress maker Reynolds Woodcock and his relationship with his sister Cyril played by Lesley Manville and his budding romance/artistic relationship with Vicky Krieps somewhat mysterious, yet beguiling Alma.It's an on the surface slight story and one that hardly seems ripe for a cinematic treatment but as is the case with the Anderson we've come to know and love, nothing within Thread is exactly as it may first seem and despite Thread's rather solemn nature as an often bizarre darkly comedic like experience, that flirts the line between unnerving drama and expose of the artistic process, you're never entirely sure of where Anderson may be taking us on his beautifully captured and expertly scored journey.At the heart of Anderson's odd tale is yet another award's worthy turn from Day-Lewis in what is reportedly said to be his last ever film and if that is indeed the case, Woodcock offers the legendary screen-actor a fitting swansong.Much like Anderson's more dialled back direction, Woodcock offers Day-Lewis a less showy and more stoic character to inhabit than we are used to seeing from the man that gave us turns such as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting and Daniel Plainview but Day-Lewis's impact on the film is still undeniable.Woodcock is a complex and often totally unlikeable creation but Day-Lewis makes him a figure we can't turn away from, as his artistic process becomes more apparent and his socially awkward intricacies start to rear their ugly heads, in particular in their relationship to Alma's arrival as Woodcock's new lover.In what is likely to be a career defining role for the actress, Krieps is Day-Lewis's equal in Thread and in some ways steals the show from Day-Lewis's creation as Alma begins to reveal her nature and desires to the audience and with the two actors, we end up having one of the most bizarre, memorable and untypical romances committed to cinema in some time.Final Say - Not as instantly ground-breaking or recommendable as Anderson's best works, Phantom Thread is still a highly original and meticulously constructed feature from the great American director and with the brilliant work by its two main leads; this multilayered experience is a deservedly praised film that's likely to find a very passionate, albeit modest following.4 distraction filled breakfasts out of 5"
PHANTOM THREAD,11 March 2018,5/10,"Phantom Thread (2017) was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Reynolds Woodcock, who is a famous couturier. Woodcock lives with his sister, played by Lesley Manville. He falls in love with a young waitress, Alma, played by Vicky Krieps, and turns her into his model and muse.For me, this movie is overrated. Woodcock is childish and self-centered. However, because of his talent, everyone accepts his behavior Naturally, everything in the movie depends on the fashion world. It's a tightly sealed world, based on appearance and money. I found the movie a waste of extraordinary acting talent, and I would not recommend it."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 February 2018,10/10,"Probably once a year, I watch a film that overwhelms me. I feel pure elation when watching it, that I instantly grin and start to become emotionally attached to what's on screen. Ladies and gentlemen, Phantom Thread is that film. A renowned fashion designer helplessly falls in love with a young waitress where the relationship tinkers between distance and affection to which they must learn to overcome. I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson, but I can acknowledge that PTA's filmography encapsulates the beauty of cinema. Engrossing, captivating and memorable pieces of work. His collaboration with Day-Lewis is another success, and in my opinion better than 'There Will Be Blood'. The story encompasses both the highlights and low points of a rapid relationship. The routinely based idiosyncrasies of Reynolds juxtaposes the spontaneous surprises of Alma. Starting off with the best of intentions yet succumbing to the twisted dark love of vulnerability. He is a particular man, one who resents deviations from his lavish work. There really was only one class act that could portray such a pernickety yet conflicted character with ease, Daniel Day-Lewis. If this is to be his final acting credit, he went out in style. His soft speech, gentle workmanship as he threads the elegant costumes (which will win every award going...) and ill-tempered manner was simply overwhelming. Both Manville and Krieps held strong performances against him to which also carried the pace incredibly well. Greenwood's overpowering original score was intoxicating and enhanced the romantic tension between the two lead characters. PTA's direction was masterful. Incredible long takes where both the dresses and acting take centre stage. The production design was flawless and captured 1950s London beautifully. It's...just outstanding. There was a moment I felt myself become unresponsive to reality. Hypnotised by the quality of film making, my eyes were entranced as if I was watching an artist making their masterpiece. This haunting beauty gets the first perfect rating of 2018."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 February 2018,8/10,"Saw this in a theatre. Movie aint that good but Daniel Day-Lewis' acting was phenomenal.
He superbly potrayed the character of Reynolds Woodcock, who is obsessed with order, symmetry n following an organised routine. DDLs mannerisms, facial expressions n costumes were spot on. Many may hate the characters controlled behaviour but Woodcocks breakfast time was superb n so was his appetite. The film does hav repetitive trope of breakfasts for foodies.
Also noteworthy is costume designer Mark Bridges incredible work, the look of Woodcocks suits n the gorgeous female dresses added a charm.
Another aspect one cannot ignore is the mesmerizing musical score."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,3/10,"Much like mother!, Phantom Thread is an unnerving 2017 auteur look at a tortured artist and his neglected spouse / muse. But where mother! was a slow descent into abject insanity and (literal) barn-burning chaos, Phantom Thread is as uptight and dry as an aristocratic dinner party on Ambien. As an overwhelmingly opaque Paul Thomas Anderson film, it's the kind of movie that people seem expected to at least appreciate if not adore, especially given the universal praise poured upon it. I, for one, just found it boring at best and pretentious at worst.
A successful clothing designer (Day-Lewis) in the 1950s meets and falls for a younger woman. The movie sets them on a cyclical course of love-fight-make-up-repeat that to anyone ever in a long-term relationship will certainly feel familiar, though hardly revelatory. Like a Victorian-era costume drama, it's all so stodgy and stiff, much of the apparent filmmaking ""beauty"" and unimpeachable performances went nearly unnoticed by me. I became preoccupied with Krieps wife-character's inexplicable interest in this man and getting irrationally enraged imagining method-actor Day-Lewis sewing dresses between takes.
Now Anderson is inarguably a master director, so there are certainly some high points: the moody, bouncy piano score; Manville's strong sister character; individual scenes that spark up the otherwise monotonous proceedings (dinner arguments, fever-dream visions). Apparently, there is an underlining dark comedy to it all, but I just must be incredibly dense or simply missing something to not notice anything even dryly droll on screen. From my vantage, Phantom Thread is neither funny, compelling, nor even that beautiful; it is, however, maybe the most overrated film of 2017."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 September 2020,9/10,"Slow narrative, good plot, but dragged, perhaps it causes a certain anguish to the most anxious, in the eternal expectation of what is about to happen, and that never happens, or rather it happens between the lines, in the coldness of what is not said, in the omission of acts ... That ending surprised me, and crowned the great film masterfully, tacit agreement... Simply Lovely..."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 June 2018,8/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson films are always such a joy to watch. Ok, maybe not a ""joy"" in terms of being a pleasant and easy to ingest, but a ""joy"" as far as observing fine craftsmanship.Anderson is as assured in his visual storytelling as ever in ""Phantom Thread,"" which teams him with the most assured actor working today (or now retired?) in Daniel Day-Lewis. The film doesn't offer much in terms of plot but serves as a portrait of a master dressmaker, his operation in vaguely 1950s England, and the woman who becomes the focus of his admiration and desire.Yes, ""Phantom Thread"" is still a love story despite missing all the obvious trappings. Reynolds Woodcock (Day-Lewis) is a self-proclaimed confirmed bachelor completely dedicated to his craft but capable of being entranced by the right woman for periods of time. He meets Alma (Vicky Krieps) when she serves him a robust breakfast at a restaurant and she quickly becomes his muse. Alma carefully weaves herself into the fabric of Reynolds' work and personal life, even navigating his tight bond with his sister (Lesley Manville). She soon discovers, however, that she must reckon with his controlling, abrasive ways.There's an elegance to ""Phantom Thread"" that's more inviting to audiences, though it's a sharp contrast from Anderson's usual California-set stories and American narratives. That elegance goes beyond the film's focus on fashion - though that's certainly part of it - and pervades the entire aesthetic including the camera movement and another exceptional Johnny Greenwood score. Plop Day-Lewis in a frame like that and you immediately have a riveting visual. In fact, these components are enough that Anderson can get away with a loose narrative containing many related scenes but no distinct arc.Day-Lewis makes anything more interesting and he's in top form here. You get the sense that his role feels lived in - there's a verisimilitude to this and most of his performances that blurs the line between actor and character (which admittedly is kind of the point of method acting). Day-Lewis does give us a bit of a trademark of his in the volatility of Woodcock's temperament, but the grace and his professional demeanor belong to the character.Acting opposite Day-Lewis and Manville would be a frightening prospect for nearly any actor let alone an unknown like Krieps, but the Luxembourgian actress proves her salt, balancing Alma's naivete, elegance, shrewdness and determination. Although at first presented as the precious doe who is bound to make the same mistakes as Woodcock's past lovers, we see an unexpected fearlessness as their relationship becomes about power dynamics. Krieps is extremely well-cast and it will be curious to see what directions her career goes beyond such a well-suited part.Although the third wheel, Manville also deserves recognition for bringing refreshing dimension to the part of the shrewish older sister. Usually that role is immediately dislikable, but there's something in the calm of Manville's performance that both complements Day-Lewis and opens us up to idea of Cyril as a human.Somewhat of a chamber drama, ""Phantom Thread"" proves nothing is beyond the scope of Anderson's skill set. Certain story pieces and characters can be equated to those in other films, but you might assume at a quick glance that some one-time ""Downton Abbey"" director made this film, not an American. Do not assume the fashion component and period element is just a chance for Anderson to play dress up - they are well-researched, well-realized and integral to the story being told. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

PHANTOM THREAD,5 August 2018,9/10,"P.T. Andersons movies are best suited for the arthouse movie lovers. For those who love to be puzzled and confused. For those who like to use their brain while watching a movie and who can relate to mentally twisted emotions, which wont fare well with those who might wish for an upbeat kind of story. No cheery happy feelings to be found here. Oh no!Beware, the first half of this story is rather bland, but that slowburning start is only the introduction to a mesmirising second half of this movie, with a grand final to follow! The ending is truly heavenly. I dont have any other words for it. Mind you, I am not at all a romantic person, but this movie mesmirized me romantically with its dark beauty. It is almost superfluous to state the following, but the photography, editing and soundtrack are magnificent, as always.I can understand why this masterpiece has earned 50 movie awards worldwide, but at first I had my doubts though about this latest story in ""Phantom Thread"". Beforehand I had only heard that it was about a tailor in England. I just couldnt imagine how anything remotely dramatic could be extracted from an ordinary story about a tailor. But stories by P.T. Anderson are NEVER what they seem to be at first sight. But even while watching it I could not surpress my anxiety that this movie might be the first one in his carreer that was rather bland, without any big drama. I was proven wrong ofcourse. The climax in ""Phantom Thread"" is only to be found near the very end. And then it feels like emotional fireworks going off!"
PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2018,8/10,"""Phantom Thread"" (2017 release; 130 min.) brings the story of Reynolds Woodcock and Alma. As the movie opens, we see Alma talking about Reynolds. We then go back in time, as we get to know Reynolds, a dressmaker for royalty and high society in the 1950s London. Reynolds is stressing out due to the visit of a baroness, and at the urging of his sister, Reynolds decodes to go to his country house, away from London. As luck would have it, when he takes breakfast the next morning, he is waited on by charming Alma, and Reynolds, a lifelong bachelor (marriage would make me deceitful"", he comments at one point), is immediately smitten and asks her out for dinner. Alma accepts. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre (don't just call it a movie!) from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia; There Will Be Blood, The Master, just to name those). Here he brings a love story, Paul Thomas Anderson-style of course. At first, it seems love at first sight (""I've been looking for you for a long time"", admits Reynolds), but then clouds appear.... I shan't say more plot-wise. Anderson leaves us guessing from start to finish, and in that sense it is a mystery movie, but of course the movie is so much more than that. There are stretches where seemingly nothing happens (in the best possible way), and we get to enjoy the scenery and of course the performances. Daniel Day-Lewis has said that he is retiring from acting after this movie. Say it ain't so! He is masterful here as the top of a small fashion house for the rich and famous (yes, even a Belgian royal highness is seen as coming from Brussels to buy her wedding dress at the Woodcock house). But even better is Vicky Krieps, the (for me) previously unknown Luxembourg actress who reminds me of Meryl Streep era-Kramer vs. Kramer. As Alma struggles to keep up with Reynolds, yet feels strongly attached to him, she pleads with him ""Whatever you do, do it carefully"". Wow, just wow. With this breakthrough role, we have just seen the very beginning of what I am sure will be a long career in Hollywood. Last but certainly not least, the classical-leaning original score is absolutely fantastic, and is composed by Anderson's house composer over the last decade, Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. This movie is already gathering quite a few nominations for the upcoming awards season, in particular for Anderson, Day-Lewis, and Greenwood, and deservedly so.""Phantom Thread"" finally went wide this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely I am happy to report. If you are a fan of Anderson's previous work or are simply in the mood for an exquisitely made love story that will leave you guessing until the very end, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Phantom Thread"" is a WINNER."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 February 2018,5/10,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson is chiefly known for what I would call ""generic historical period pieces."" I use the term ""generic"" since his stories are fictionalized accounts of true events and they are usually strong on style but weak on substance. His earlier ""The Master,"" a take on the early days of Scientology, represented much more meatier subject matter than what we have here in Phantom Thread-the visually impressive but rather dull tale of an eccentric fashion designer based in 1950s London.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a bachelor curmudgeon who just happens to be a star designer of extremely expensive gowns for women in high society. His business is run by his sister Cyril (played most winningly as an ice queen by the most talented Lesley Manville).Woodcock meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), a good-looking waitress at a restaurant in the countryside, and before you know it she's modeling for him and eventually becomes his lover (although I can't recall any scenes involving overt sexuality between them). It's literally a slow-moving affair and only those who like their romantic interludes presented in a lugubrious fashion, will find it compelling.As Alma becomes more devoted to Woodcock, he's unable to reciprocate her affection, as he's completely self-centered and a raging creature of routine. Things come to a terrible boil when Alma fails to prepare asparagus the way Woodcock likes it for dinner (he prefers the vegetable cooked in butter; she insists on some kind of oil). To inject some drama into the proceedings, Anderson ludicrously transforms the docile Alma into an affection-starved scorned lover who poisons her husband with mushrooms she's collected on the grounds of the house. Her plan is to make Woodcock devoted to her as she nurses him back to health. The plan works to a tee as the confirmed bachelor now agrees to marry her!After Woodcock recovers, the bickering begins anew so Alma decides to poison him again-this time with an omelette. In a classic case of pathetic masochism, Woodcock deduces what his wife has been up to, but submits to being poisoned once again, and having Alma again take care of him.Does it really make sense? Not really, but Anderson needed some way of spicing up a rather inert tale to begin with. Phantom Thread has some beautiful cinematography, an elegant score that sets the mood of 1950s England (both London and the countryside) as well as a peek at a collection of neat-looking gowns (the kind they used to wear, way back then!).Day-Lewis's Woodcock has been hailed as an Oscar-worthy performance but I think he's saddled by a script that highlights a one-note, one-dimensional character. The women, on the other hand, are much better, especially Manville as the sister who is the only person who knows how to stand up to her often-bullying brother.If you like fashion, then perhaps Phantom Thread is the film for you. Others more into drama will probably find this a bit too slow-moving, generic and inauthentic, for their tastes."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,3/10,"I have a theory. Basically it goes that some critics have already decided, long before they take their seats in the cinema, that the movie they're about to see it going to reviewed as a masterpiece based solely on who the director is. They are films that if a nobody had been in the director's chair the film would be panned mercilessly. 2017 seems to be a year with a number of these films and 'Phantom Thread' is certainly one of them. There is very little to like in this film. It can only be described as pretentious nonsense.Unless I'm missing something (I'm not) there is no point to this film. A character simply goes back and forth, back and forth on whether or not he loves (or even likes) a woman. That's pretty much the extent of the story. Anything else is simply filler. Everything is basically set up to allow Daniel Day-Lewis to shine, but again if any other actor in Hollywood had played this role he would have received no attention at all. Day-Lewis does it though and it's Oscar-worthy? Go figure. Bland, boring and pointless. 'Phantom Thread' is two hours of your life you will never get back."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 February 2018,,"Basic story of a complicated and obsessed man (Daniel Day-Lewis as a world-class couturier) and a passive-regressive young man (Vicky Krieps) who worms her way into is life goes sour because of the fairy tale ending.This is yet another of those films in which the woman gets what she wants and gets away with it. It's a total la la land fantasy .Day-Lewis gives an impeccable performance as the famous designer, an imperious man whose life with his sister (Lesley Manville) is obsessively ordered and successful. They are like two sides of the same coin in their world visions.Everything changes when he picks a homely frump of a klutz to take under his wing. Their relationship is vaguely sexual. She's basically a doormat in the household but she's smarter than she looks. She eventually hits on a plan to turn the tables.The 1950's London fashion scene with its gigantic dresses is well done and shows, perhaps in too much detail, the process of creating a one-of-a-kind fashion piece for the 1%. These women range from the iceberg countess (Gina McKee) to the aging heiress (Harriet Harris) for whom every dress is a work of art.Day-Lewis and Manville turn in Oscar-worthy performances as the iron-willed siblings. Krieps, on the other hand, never quite finds the center of her bizarre character. Lush music score and cinematography help evoke a time and place long gone. I liked the Bristol 405 Day-Lewis drives also.Bottom line is that this odd romance story edges along until is take a sour and unlikely turn, never to recover."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 November 2018,,"Quiet, moody period piece set in the glamour era of 1950s London about a renowned but self-absorbed and fastidious couturier and how his life and career change course after a chance encounter with a striking young waitress. Anderson's deliberately leisure direction allows viewers to take in all the dazzling sights and sounds of the time period, but more importantly get inside the minds of the characters and the world which they inhabit. Aloof at times but riveting throughout, bolstered by Day-Lewis (in reportedly his final acting role) who as expected completely immerses himself in the skin of a complex character who alternates between admirable and contemptible. The film's also a good showcase for Krieps who's perfectly understated as his determined ingénue; the exquisite wardrobe and music are just another added bonus. ***"
PHANTOM THREAD,20 July 2019,2/10,2/10 - couldn't enjoy it...so boring...I mean SO BORING - the two stars are purely for the costumes
PHANTOM THREAD,10 March 2018,6/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's latest is more in the vein of There Will Be Blood than Magnolia or Boogie Nights, meaning it's tighly focused on a very small, richly-developed cast rather than a glut of competing, interwoven storylines. Really, there are only three characters who matter: an intense, controlling dress-maker (Daniel Day-Lewis), his steady, all-business sister (Lesley Manville) and his young, headstrong new muse (Vicky Krieps). Their relationship is complicated, a careful balance of ticks, emotions and triggers that frequently threatens to collapse, but somehow manages to remain upright. They badger and provoke each other, testing for weakness between fleeting moments of warmth and compassion, and this flood of dense, competing emotion fuels their creative output. Like many of Anderson's other films, Phantom Thread is quite slow, breezily coasting through snippets and snapshots of the trio's various liaisons - sibling, professional and romantic - and doesn't always settle on a firm message or meaning. We're merely documenting a small tangle of lives, complete with unsightly quirks and personality-driven hardships, as they learn to coexist and endure/accept one another's shortcomings. It's a film I enjoyed more upon reflection, thinking over the various layers of subtext and character motivation, than I did while I was watching it."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2019,10/10,"Excellent . PHANTOM THREAD, we're stuck in prim and proper 1950s London, where fictional high fashion designer, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) presides over his all-female staff hand-sewing immaculate dresses for the rich and famous. When we meet Reynolds, he's living with his sister/business partner Cyril (Leslie Manville) and a wife tired of his suffocating control over his surroundings. A narcissistic boor, Reynolds cannot abide any noise at the breakfast table, not even the sound of butter being spread on toast. He demands the space to sketch but he needs women for sex, for some level of companionship, and to act as his muse. Enter Alma (Vicky Krieps) a server he meets at a countryside cafe one day. Instantly smitten with her, he coaxes her to his London flat where she will model his clothes, inspire him, and yes, stay dead silent during the morning meals. Soon enough, like the others before her, Alma slowly dies inside. The power dynamic between Reynolds and Alma, as well as that between Cyril, who knows where all the bodies are buried, and the pair, constitutes the film's main storyline. As such, PHANTOM THREAD takes its sweet time getting to the ""good stuff"", which proves to be almost as perverse and twisted as a Michael Haneke film. For a long stretch, the film crawls along quite slowly, but Anderson carefully, painstakingly lays out the push and pull of the central relationship. Every slight, every stinging formality stings just a little, and both Day-Lewis and Krieps beautifully communicate their complicated feelings. Manville, a Mike Leigh regular, could teach a Master Class in focus and stillness. Her hard stares and assuredness prove mesmerizing and chilling. Krieps, unknown to me before this, conveys so much with a glance or a subtle facial tic, I felt willing to follow her character anywhere. This is one gorgeous looking movie, from the drop-dead, period specific costume design by Mark Bridges, the clean lines of Woodcock's studio and wildly over-the-top New Year's celebration scene provided by production designer Mark Tildesley, to the rich cinematography by none other than Anderson himself. If you're into mid-century chic, this movie will hit that sweet spot. I'm also giving a standing ovation to Anderson's regular composer, Jonny Greenwood, who delivers memorable, stunning music to the film. It may sound somewhat conventional, but it fits the mood and characters perfectly. Without spoiling anything, the film takes a strange turn, exposing its darker and richer themes. It's almost worth the long wait it takes to get there, although I would have preferred a slightly shorter buildup. Regardless, it's the type of film that feels like a long slog, but after sleeping on it, I came to admire it more and more. Day-Lewis brings just enough sweet charm to his fairly mean-spirited character to make you believe he's in love with Alma. Krieps, not unlike Meryl Streep in THE POST, slowly emerges as a feminist character in a pre-feminist era, and it's quite lovely to see. Manville tears up the screen with her direct gaze. For those who prefer a little more movement in their movies, this may not be the best choice. It's still, and stifling, but also often funny and artful in its presentation of a distant yet co-dependent relationship. In its old-fashioned way, there's something new here."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 October 2018,6/10,"Day Lewis is a famous couturier who is completely self obsessed and can only live his life subject to his own set of often petty rules - essentially a genius child. A long time philanderer he falls for a shy waitress - Krieps, who slowly but surely tears at the perfect working infrastructure he and his sister Manville have created.This a slow, deliberately paced love story and is certainly something of an acquired taste. Patience pays though as it is fascinating to follow to see if she can overcome his fragile structured existence so that they can finally, truly fall in love or whether his need to follow his set of rules wins through. Krieps is fine and Day Lewis as always is superb in another textbook - literally - performance. Manville is the great presence here - wonderful when she gets irritated and knows exactly which strings to pull to knock him down to size.Well worth seeing albeit not one for Friday nights. Nice music too."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 October 2018,8/10,"(Flash Review)This is supposedly DD-Lewis's last film, which is a sad thought as he is too good to remove his talent from the big screen. He plunges into the role of Reynolds Woodcock, who is an obsessive and moody yet famous clothing designer in 50s London. He has a very meticulous way of working. Any change to the order of his ways is met with frustration. When he schmoozes up a waitress, as she is an ideal size for modeling dresses, he unknowingly invites in a persona that will push on his concrete comfort zone. This creates a new dynamic between his sister, acting as business partner, and his young model romance, Alma. Those two leverage themselves to be most respected, listened to or emotionally leaned upon. Strong-willed Alma, frustrated with Woodcock's work taking more of his attention, takes matters into her own hands. Will she be able to alter his unbending ways? Once the film wrapped up, I was witness to a cringe-worthy and highly peculiar relationship. Overall, the acting is brilliant with much told through subtleness, glances or a sharp comment. The story did drag a little before the climax as parts felt a little redundant but that is a minor quibble but did keep it from a rating of 9 or higher."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 October 2021,8/10,"This is a nice, quiet film with first-rate performances and nice direction and cinematography. Vicky Krieps does a very nice job, and has a wonderful future as an actress, as long as she doesnt take any roles in the future that are connected to horror; then she will be typecast. Lewis is impeccable and Manville is icier than a slushy. Anderson did a great job with the script and direction. A must-see film."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 April 2018,2/10,This thing should only be shown in cemeteries and grave yards because no one there could die of boredom!This thing is over two hours long and I have been to funerals that were more interesting and lively and shorter. Nothing happens in this movie until there is an argument at a the dinning table. Then it's back to a corpus like story.Save yourself and live another two hours and skip this --- thing.
PHANTOM THREAD,7 July 2020,4/10,"Since this is a Day-Lewis/Thomas Anderson project, it was bound to be labelled as an ""elegant masterpiece"". On a more prosaic level, the moral of the story could be that no matter how fastidious and sophisticated a man is, he is still a man following his - so to speak - ""Woodcock"".DDL is Reynolds Woodcock (a surname that reads as a joke), the revered couturier of London'd high society. Afflicted by a severe case of OCD and a confirmed bachelor, Woodcock is used to taking lovers and muses and discarding them when fed up, assisted by the equally icy, spinster sister Cyril.His clothes fit perfectly his personality, his style being austere and sinister, because of stiff tailoring in dark colours and silhouettes that reminded me of Disney's evil witches..His new muse is Alma, a foreign waitress with no breasts (perfect for a model) who wants to dominate Reynolds life, even if she's well aware of his ways. She definitely objects to going back to obscurity once she gets discarded.Other messages of the movie could be that even obsessive, domineering people want to let go and be dominated, or simply that Woodcock is getting old and tired of playing the same game. He wants to play a more dangerous one. Whatever it is, I wouldn't call it ""love"" on either side, but for sure these two creepy psychos are a perfect match.The plot moves at snail pace and there are more silences and ""meaningful glances"" than actual dialougues. However, I liked it more than I expected and Krieps, as the enigmatic Alma, pulls of a difficult part. In fact, I enjoyed better her acting than DDL.I regret he chose this weird role as his last and certainly not most memorable one but I applaude him for choosing to retire, which is what lots of actors should do before becoming parodies of themselves. Shame his goodbye came with such a vapid movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 February 2018,,"From the very beginning when the script wanted the leading role to clip his nostrils and ears hairs, brush his shoes and then put on his trousers, I already knew the limitation of this director's poor guidance and the mediocrity of the screenplay. Then came the try out of the costume the guy made for the higher class lady, Jesus, what an ugly design! Then, the guy had some unhappily encounter with his disgruntle wife, he didn't want to have it. Then under the suggestion of his female executive, he went to the country side to relax himself. What came up the next simply made me certain that this film sucked big time. The awkward, stupid and unnatural arrangement of this guy meeting the waitress of the restaurant in Victoria Hotel. The young waitress who supposed to be his muse and love later was definitely a miscast. If I were him, I definitely would have lost all my already limited inspiration. What a plain girl without any attraction at all either facial or physical. The whole scene during that breakfast was one of the most pretentious, illogic, awkward scenes that any good director won't try to force down the throats of the audience. There's no way, obvious or vague, this old diner vs. the young waitress would have any possible mutual consent to light a wild fire to each other. It was such a stupid take-it-for-granted scene without any merit or believability to convince any viewer with the least I.Q. to accept it. It's just so stupid. I don't want to waste any more word to review it as I just walked out right away and refuse to waste any second. This is, by far, the most disappointed film and the most painful one that involved one of the most talented actors."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,5/10,"GRADE: C THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well-crafted but pretentiously boring movie that is dressed to the nines, but barely rates a five. SYNOPSIS: A portrait of a suffering artist, set in the 50's world of high fashion.JIM'S REVIEW: Reynolds Woodcock (a great screen name) is an elitist snob with little tolerance for others and more interest in himself. He is consumed with his art and his social skills are lost on anyone who enters his world, except maybe his only living relative, his sister, Cyril. He is a genius when it comes to fashion and a fool when it comes to love. He clings to a sense of order in his life and longs for a reasonable amount of decorum in his everyday existence. But all that will change when he meets and woos Alma, a common girl with an uncommon figure and profile who will become his muse. He is, of course, the talented Daniel Day-Lewis, in his final film role. And while it is not the greatest exit in his illustrious career, it is still a compelling portrait of an artist. Sadly, Mr. Day-Lewis' last film vehicle, Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread, ultimately disappoints.The talented Mr. Anderson serves as director / screenwriter and this is not his best effort, given the contrary praised lavished on this artistic dud by many critics. Yet Phantom Thread has a wonderful visual and epic sweep. It cannot be denied that this movie is one of the most elegantly mounted films of the year. Mark Tildesley's production design is stunning, with wonderful sets and backdrops, lavish period costumes by Mark Bridges evoke the era very effectively, and Mr. Anderson's camerawork (yes, he also did the lush cinematography) is fluid and helps to peek interest with his lovely composition and lighting, plus a captivating atonal music score by Jonny Greenwood seamlessly mixes jazz renditions of popular songs and classical elements. Still, with all that care and craftsmanship of these fine artisans, the film rarely has any emotional connection. It is a joyless character study that just doesn't go anywhere. The fault is primarily an unfocused script by the director that lacks clarity and purpose. Without divulging any plot spoilers, one can simply say that the film takes an interesting enough premise, an intricate character study of a man possessed, and makes a long story longer. The film doesn't tie up its loose strands of plot very well, but to its credit, it doesn't follow a predictable story either. Sometimes a strange Hitchcockian love story, sometimes a psychological thriller (without the thrills), it is a hybrid of sorts that can't decide its own direction. The screenplay establishes supposedly complicated characters that are given nothing to do other than pout or look intense, act gravely, wear lovely outfits, and talk in stilted phrases with many pauses that accentuates the gravitas of their splintered relationships. The film holds your interest with its overall look, even as it starts to unravel in its complicated narrative structure and odd character twists and sadistic turns that all lead to an illogical ending. (Can submitting to death really evoke true love? Let's get real!)Acting-wise, for this film to work, the three main characters must establish conflict and heighten the drama. There lies another problem. Mr. Day-Lewis adds layers to this nebulous character and watching him suffer and fuss is always an enjoyable exercise in moviegoing, one that will be missed. The most compelling role, however, is not the foppishly handsome and fastidious Mr. Woodcock, but his cold and straight-laced sister and business partner, Cyril, played to the hilt by Leslie Manville. One wishes she was given more screen time. It is the third character, that of Alma, which is miscast. Vickie Krieps plays this part and is being outacted by the pros around her. She brings forth little charm or the ability to make an impression that commands any attention. One fails to believe her allure with her bland interpretation of this crucial character. Ms. Krieps never successfully shows the cunning manipulations of her wayward character. It is this imbalance that seriously undercuts the film's potential. All in all, the actress is not the ideal Phantom's menace. (Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun.)As a director, Mr. Anderson also lets scenes go on far too long which drags down the film and flatlines his film to a sluggish pace. His plot becomes a rather predictable and pretentious mystery that builds little tension or suspense. Except for a well-written office scene between brother and sister, dialog has an improvisational aura that lacks eloquence, seems contrived, and is just plain boring.All the fancy trimmings cannot hide the fact that Phantom Thread is one of the most well-made films of the year, but it is also one of the most overrated as well. Critics have adored this film and heaped accolades on this pretentious movie. But truth be known, the Emperor is wearing no clothes."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 September 2018,8/10,"My Rating : 8/10This is a delicately executed drama intimately woven around the characters of Daniel Day-Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock and Vicky Krieps as Alma.Right from the opening shots I was engaged and the brilliant performances, beautiful background music coupled with breathtaking cinematography make this a worthwhile watch if you are in the mood for something slow, something a bit art-y. However if you are not in the mood for something like this it can become a chore to watch so I ask the viewer to understand that it is a very beautiful film and in the right frame of mind you will be absorbed into the world of this renowned mid-twentieth century dressmaker who can be a bit fussy.Daniel Day-Lewis is at his typical level of brilliance here. He perfectly plays the role of an obsessive personality, who is so averse to letting someone interfere with his work, yet who more and more, through both natural and artificial means, also doesn't want to lose the new woman in his life.Stylish camera work, wonderfully-paced drama. Solid 8/10."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 June 2018,5/10,"Too much time for so little, too much beautiful and annoying music (in fact, the best scenes did not have music, like the different discussions around the dining table), a shiny surface that only reflects itself. I finished its viewing out of respect for Anderson, but I could have seen something else (and better) for 130 minutes or (preferably) less."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 January 2018,9/10,"A skillful score humming in the background, gowns of exquisite beauty being sewn into shape, a lens with the power to bruise and break, a script as skillful as a great work of literature...this is ""Phantom Thread"", the latest drama from the great Paul Thomas Anderson, a man whose career is ten times more impressive than that of  Fitzgerald. Daniel-Day Lewis has stated that he will quit acting after having finished this film, and I feel that this is, as disappointing as it may be to fans of Day-Lewis such as myself, a respectable and sensible decision...because WHAT a final performance! While it does not exactly match the fierce power of his breathtaking portrait of Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"", it is damn close in its eyebrow raising excellency. He plays a complex character with near equal intensity and much more subtlety in this film. Reynolds Woodcock is as compelling a character as Anderson has ever portrayed, and his legacy is that of a confused, intimidating, and eccentric condition. He is at once funny, scary, sad, pathetic, admirable, tender, and cruel (but only to be kind). He is, above all else, the perfect subject for a character study. And, put him in the ring with another complicated soul and the result you get is a film as fierce and brilliant as ""Phantom Thread"".  By no means Anderson's ""best"" work to date (I'm not even sure if it's better than ""Inherent Vice"", a movie lots of people hated but I loved with an odd sort of passion, largely likely because of how much I love Pynchon and respect Anderson for having the balls to be the first to adapt one of his novels into a fictional feature film, one that is, on top of this, a semi-mainstream effort despite all its arthouse weirdness), ""Phantom Thread"" may just be his most PERFECT movie, if that makes much sense. I could not find a single thing wrong with it...it moves with a pace as slow and precise as necessary. The score plays continuously throughout what seems to be close to the entire runtime of the film, and it never feels misplaced. The performances are always real and believable, the writing is honest and as witty as need be without being in the least bit unnecessarily ""clever"" (I have a profound love for ""The Social Network"", but even I can admit that Sorkinite dialogue is hardly ever believable when EVERY single character in your movie virtually talks in the same witty rhymes and riddles), the cinematography is gorgeous, the costume design is goddamn fabulous, and just everything about this movie-from its comedy to its tragedy to its tensity to its complicated Gothic love story that isn't really a love story but still kind of is-is pulled off with the utmost expertise, and I seriously respect Anderson for somehow possessing the capability of making a film this great after a string of so many films this great."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 October 2018,7/10,"While it's very slow moving yet beautifully shot, this movie is worth a rental and a DVR recording on TV. Set in the 1950's and being an original story, this Oscar nominated movie stars Daniel Day Lewis in his final act as a man who makes corsets for females, and falls in love with one (played by newcomer Vicky Krieps). A web of intrigue ensues. Add to that an excellent score by Johnny Greenwood, and you've got one of the best movies of 2017 that is much better than that other Phantom movie, The Phantom Menace, and far better than Phantom Tollbooth and The Phantom and the Phantom of the Opera."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 September 2019,7/10,"Under the direction and script by Paul Thomas Anderson, ""Phantom Thread"" is a bit of a mix genre of romantic interludes combined with some scenes that lie in the thriller genre. At first glance, it starts off as a period piece costume drama situated in 1950's London, but then we later get into more Hitchcock inspired thriller as envy, obsession and co-dependency starts to take over the story. The thrill ride only comes into prominence in the second half of the movie, so all I can sat is patience is a requirement.In what is Daniel Day-Lewis' final acting role, he truly goes out in style, starring as dress designer Reynolds Woodcock, he is a man dedicated to his craft even though he has a few obsessions that can be at times very unsettling. For one thing as good as he is of his craft, he is prone to being a perfectionist which can lead him to being quite short-tempered and volatile. His agenda is very routine and has a disdain for surprises. His love for his craft is admirable but his demeanour is distant and arrogant. He resides with his sister who's also his assistant Cyril (Lesley Manville) who ensures his work is never distracted, cleans up after him, and serves as wedge to anyone who may get in the way of his passion. The complexity of Reynolds' character is the brightest grey you can come up with. You like him in some areas in other areas you just can't stand him.As he was having breakfast, a waitress named Alma (Vicky Krieps) catches eyes toward him and soon his life is challenged forever. They converse with each other, he takes her over to his place for dinner and pretty soon she is hired as his muse. But then his anger issues become more frequent as their friendship starts to fade away and it becomes her mission to lure him away from the controlling nature of his sister. Unlike the other women the Reynolds had dumped, Alma has a much thicker shell to crack. After hoping to to take their relationship to the level of romantic partners, her obsessions towards him take on a much more sinister level and soon both their darker characterizations go into overdrive.By the second half of ""Phantom Thread"", which takes the romantic genre to the greater hour of darkness and puts the relationship between Reynolds and Alma in question. There is no generic sentimental mush within the couple and Cyril is never far away from the middle of their madness. Alma's greatest weakness is trying to win Reynolds' heart, but Cyril is just the wooden statue that continually stands in her way.Sure it is hard to perform in these complex stories, Day-Lewis is the best performer here and his support from Manville is the perfect foil for his character along with the unpredictable nature of Vicky Krieps' Alma. Krieps succeeds in keeping Alma subtle in her psyche and can come off tamer than intended for. Under that naive personality, she can come off more conniving and macabre though she feels she's doing nothing wrong.Anderson will most likely not cater to the requests to the fans and bite into their demands to hurry in on the action. He will run the show at his own pace. So if you're expecting fast-paced scenes, well look further because it's not happening here. Though I'm not a scholar when it comes to fashion, I do like the little details that's carried out. It's shows that Anderson has the essence of knowledge of what the setting he's up against and the styles that come with the period.In the end, ""Phantom Thread"" is a film that depends more on character interactions as opposed to narrative dependency. The pacing is slow at the beginning, but gets faster in the second half that's equally provocative and disturbing, but will leave you with a lasting impression."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 October 2018,5/10,If you like 1950's set films about dress makers this is the film for you. A dress maker meets a woman and she works for him. They make dresses. This is the film. Nothing else happens. Enjoy.
PHANTOM THREAD,29 November 2018,,"What can you say....Awards galore, National Board of Review, marvellous lighting, images, performances, direction, costumes, interesting music score and on it goes...Now, what about the story? What was Paul Thomas Anderson thinking - had he perhaps just watched 'Suspicion' and a string of other classics with similar themes? So then, is this the great love story - about two perfectly unsuited people who meet in rather unbelievable circumstances - then grow into a love hate relationship that develops into deeper territory with every inflicted irritation? Even several odd side plots like names sewn into garments, the controlling sister, the ghostly mother fixation etc, tend to go little further than the development desk - all interesting, but never fully explored. Now enters the High Point:- let's try 'poisoning' to assist the relationship in its rise to all time classic proportions! And, if at first you don't succeed - attempt it multiple times till you reach the desired mutual loving attraction!This is bizarrely weird in any measure of the written word. Still, it's just weird enough to gain full adoration of today's 'art society' and the Academy! Not to be missed - magnificent pretentious ambiguity cannot be denied its position in high creative circles. Just approach with caution if you seek entertainment grounded in a little more honest believability. Daniel Day-Lewis may need to take another 'last' role - to atone for this lame foolishness no matter how technically perfect it all may be. It's interesting to find critic, Michael Woods revealing observations (London Review) as one of the only honest 'stand-out-from-the-crowd' assessments - just hope he doesn't eventually accept membership into 'the club'."

PHANTOM THREAD,14 November 2018,8/10,An American-British period romantic drama; This melodrama is poetically scripted and with an unpredictable plot. It has a theme about the impact of emotional upheaval on the fragile mind of a finely tuned creative. Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as the celebrated dressmaker prone to tantrums. Vicky Krieps as a maladroit seaside waitress besotted with her lover is spellbinding. This is an exquisite film with lush and vibrant photography and beautiful costume design.
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,10/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the few actors in cinema history to be a consummate box office draw by being a 'Capital-A Actor' rather than ""movie star,"" has found his true cinematic soulmate in Paul Thomas Anderson, a kindred obsessive perfectionist whose craft is so refined it verges on the sublime. If Phantom Thread is genuinely to be Day-Lewis' swan song, there couldn't be a more apropos note for him to retire on - a gruelling, winsome character study of the ripple effects of savant-level precision and control in the name of artistic perfection, and how it all unravels when the idiosyncrasies of something as blasphemous as another human's desires factor in. The fact that it's one of the most riveting, hauntingly beautiful films of the year should come as no surprise. What does come as a surprise is that Phantom Thread is also the closest thing to DDL and PTA making a romantic comedy(!) that we're ever likely to see - and the film is both slyly funny and deceptively romantic in its high culture austerity. Yes, really.  For those expecting the harrowing, existential despair of There Will Be Blood pitted with the world of haute couture - or, even worse, a more dour My Fair Lady - your favourite three-named gents are one stitch ahead of you. The cheeky irreverence of a protagonist named 'Reynolds Woodcock' is a hat tip towards the film's sly bawdiness peeking under the proverbial skirt of its prim veneers of ball gown elegance and severity. For, although Phantom Thread is 'about' fashion, muses, and breaking down the obsessive temperaments of auteurs who see any sacrifice and cruelty as worthwhile in the name of art, it's, at its thematic bedrock, really 'about' love. If, by 'love,' you mean a Freudian deconstruction of socialized imbedded neuroses and trauma, and the false illusion of closure from them. And who wouldn't?  Granted, it's a far cry from the vacuous pandering of your average Hollywood rom-com romp (although, in a movie about monolithic precision and control, Woodcock's foil, Alma, literally stumbles into the scene, in a delicious riff of a Hallmark-worthy meet-cute). Here, love and power - the loss, exchange, relinquishing, and struggle thereof - are inextricably intertwined. In Anderson's no-holds-barred study of subjugation, the immutability of two people's needs and wants crashing into each other like waves against a cliff face takes on an almost poetic level of allegory - a couture fairy tale, if you will. This is not to say that Reynolds and Alma have a healthy relationship; it's anything but. But, in the thick of Woodcock's histrionic flurry of standoffishness, selfishness, explosive fussiness, and every gradient of emotional abuse, there's a spark of surprising purity and sweetness at the heart of their maelstrom of incompatibility that is teased out and painted so immaculately that, in spite of itself, it's enough to make you believe there just might actually be somebody for everybody. And all without a single pop music makeover montage.  Appropriately, for a film whose protagonist utters the word ""chic"" with the vitriolic disgust of having just thrown up in his mouth, Phantom Thread has a classical elegance bar none. Here, Anderson manages to have his cake and eat it too, spinning a film that works equally well as a dazzling immersion into the world of high fashion as it does as a subtly snickering p*ss-take at its own outrageous pomposity. Anderson's cameras sweep over the film's array of exquisite dresses, ballrooms, and lush food spreads, almost pornographic in their jaw-dropping opulence, with a swooning, unsettlingly shark-like creep. Similarly, Jonny Greenwood's Age of Innocence-esq piano score is an exquisite simulacrum of claustrophobically swooning elegance, as beautiful as it is maddeningly fawning and slyly parodic. Still, the film's standout technical element is its hysterically hyperbolic sound editing, gleefully accentuating the most innocuous sounds to intolerable levels to ironically empathize with Woodcock's waning, condescending thresholds for interpersonal interaction. You'll never look at toast the same way again.  Interestingly, Day-Lewis may be the initial draw, but it's a trio of equally formidable performances that give the film its life. Naturally, Day-Lewis is so inherently magnetic that even a fleeting shot of Woodcock fastidiously plucking his nose hairs is (somehow) both riveting and revealing. Still, he weaves a playful twinkle in throughout, making Woodcock's soft-spoken tyrannical temper tantrums amusingly petulant, and softening the film's power imbalance. It's a immaculately controlled, but surprisingly lilting, funny, and perversely charming performance, and utterly unforgettable in its bizarreness. Incredibly, relative newcomer Vicky Krieps easily matches, if not outperform him, her Alma driving the film with a disarming calm in the face of Woodcock's histrionics. Her face a perennial mask of sphinx-like half-smile, Krieps delivers a masterpiece of the subtlest emotions and most microcosmic epiphanies. Contorting into the most inappropriate circumstances and slyly bending them to work in her favour, Krieps' eerie, ethereal pleasantness is as haunting as it is unpredictable. Finally, Leslie Manville as Woodcock's ferociously steely sister is truly remarkable, punctuating her monolithic rigidity with the most revealing tiny twitches in eyebrow or corner of the mouth that somehow tell more than a soliloquy. She's the least showy of the three, but just as unexpected, and searingly unforgettable. Seldom has such a cauldron of tumultuous emotions been conveyed with such irreverent gentleness and loveliness, but Phantom Thread is a gleeful masterpiece of the unexpected, traversing its formidable cultural critique, ravaging character study, and philosophical treatise on gender, power, and compatibility with deadpan teasing and disarming sweetness. Its swooning dichotomy of lush, romantic trappings and flagrantly unromantic character interplay belies the fact that it may be the most revealing and unforgettable film about romance in years. Just like the private, achingly intimate messages Woodcock sews into his designer works, Phantom Thread nestles into the back of your brain, and it's a work of genius you will be proud and moved to sport and revisit for years to come.

PHANTOM THREAD,12 January 2018,,"Paul Thomas Anderson has always been attracted to obsessives as the protagonists in his films. From the gamblers in his debut HARD EIGHT to oil man Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD to the religious leader Lancaster Dodd in THE MASTER to now, fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock in PHANTOM THREAD. Played by Daniel-Day Lewis, Reynolds is a prototypical PT Anderson subject. Diligent to the point of fastidiousness, isolated from much the outside world, and seemingly, an enigma to even those in his orbit. Reynolds happens upon a plain-looking, quite ordinary waitress at a restaurant, Alma (Vicky Krieps). As a sign of their odd relationship to come, the 'first date' culminates in Reynolds measuring her for a dress. Stripped down to her underclothes, he carefully takes full notice of every inch of her body longingly, if not sexually, for it soon becomes clear that his attraction to her isn't erotic, but, out of finding a perfect model for his creations. Reynolds' right hand woman is Cyril (Leslie Manville), who happens to be his sister. Neither has ever married. More than a sibling, and far more than an assistant, Cyril essentially runs the business - and her brother's life. The intrusion - and it is presented as an incursion - of Alma into their quietly symbiotic relationship into the house of Woodcock. Indeed, in modern terms, this 50s set tale would tag Reynolds as an extreme case of A.D.D. - the mere sound of buttering one's toast at breakfast is enough to ruin his mood for the entire day. But, A.D.D. is the least of the neuroses in PHANTOM. But, without spoiling anything, let's just say that the situation as described gets more and more intense as the relationship between Alma and Reynolds (with a very present Cyril) develops. Director PT Anderson shoots all of this with a fervent sense of detail. Long closeups of the characters' faces are matched with details as fine as a needle and thread piercing fabrics and every inch of a tape measure. Captured on 35mm film by the Director himself (uncredited; Lighting Cameraman is Michael Bauman), the work, while vigorous, isn't well captured. Some shots are beautiful, others diffuse to the point of distraction - sometimes within the same scene. Seeing the film in 70mm, only betrayed the amateurishness of some setups. Composer Jonny Greenwood's original music is exceptional, only diluted by some overly obvious classical selections.  PHANTOM is in many ways, a perfect film for PT Anderson - and obsessive making a movie about an obsessive. Daniel Day Lewis (in what he claims is his last film; I'm doubtful) perfectly captures the oddity at the center. Krieps builds her performance slowly, but one fully accepts her transitions. Manville is a marvel. One of the strongest of the year. It's too convoluted, and at times it borders on being risible, but there is no denying its perverse intensity. P.S. SPOILER  This was the third major movie of 2017 that had mushrooms as a critical plot device. Cinema wise, last year will be remembered as the year of the Me Too movement, but who would have thought it was also the year of the fungus film?"
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread is the last movie of the legend Daniel Day-Lewis, winner of 3 Oscar for best actor, and the perfect farewell would be to win an Oscar, but I believe it will not happen (Gary Oldman will take), but Daniel Day-Lewis Vicky Krieps is excellent in the film and should not be anything to Daniel, Lesley Manville is great and the rest is very well too, the soundtrack is beautiful, the wardrobe is very good and the direction of Paul Thomas Anderson is great, Phantom Thread is very good and deserves to be seen, even more because it is probably the farewell of the great Daniel Day-Lewis. Note 8.6"
PHANTOM THREAD,15 July 2018,6/10,"Beautiful film, that captivated me in the first hour. However just as Woodcock tires of his muse, i tired of this in the second half.Lesley Manville is great (she always is), but for me the revelation is Vicky Krieps. Yet she received no Oscar nomination?Beautiful Jonny Greenwood score though."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 February 2018,8/10,"London, 1950s: Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a renowned, high-level fashion designer who lives and works with his sister Cyril (Leslie Manville). He meets Alma Elson (Vicky Krieps) and brings her into his life as a muse and as a lover. Alma has a difficult time adjusting to Reynolds' obsessive perfectionism and Cyril's coldness.Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson is very successful in creating a mysterious world, making viewers feel like we are in the place of Alma - intrigued by the fascinating Reynolds but also very cautious of his eccentricities as well as those of his sister. This odd atmosphere is also a creation of the talented actors behind it.Day-Lewis (whose best performances among many include ""My Left Foot"", ""In the Name of the Father"", and ""There Will Be Blood"" also directed by Anderson) is at his usual brilliance. Without being harsh, he can give a sharp sting with just the slightest gesture or comment. The film would have had much less impact if he had not been in the main role.And Manville conveys so much with a stone cold glance with restrained emotions, one wishes she had been given an even greater part. This role is a great contrast to her superb work in ""Another Year"" in which her character's emotions were anything but restrained.The last third of the film begins a new chapter. While it is less engaging than the first two thirds, the spell of the movie has already been cast on the audience and it cannot be withheld by this point. In addition to Anderson and the cast, credit must also be given to the beautiful music by Jonny Greenwood, the sets, and of course, the costumes. - dbamateurcritic."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 January 2018,9/10,"The title points three ways.
 (i) To the brilliant, eccentric dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock, the phantom thread alludes to the little secrets he hides inside his creations: his mother's portrait under the canvas of his jacket, little messages, a talisman like the ""never cursed"" he plants in the Belgium princess's wedding gown. These are ghostly presences. 
 (ii) More broadly, it suggests the magic of his craft, his famous ""touch"" that pulls the superior materials together into an even more brilliant whole. It's the genius he brings to the ""trade"" his mother taught him, the genius that makes him the dominant figure in 1950s London fashion (before the working class eruption of the Beatles, Carnaby Street, etc.). 
 (iii) Then there's the love story - the core of this lush drama. This phantom thread is the mysterious element that draws together the handsome rich designer and the awkward country inn waitress. Trying to define this explains the opening (and returned to) scene of Alma being interviewed by a reporter about their relationship.
 In fact, the reporter is an intriguing ambiguity. Why is he interviewing her? Is he a fashion feature writer or a crime reporter"" Is he sniffing out a new style trend or a mushroom snuff? Either explanation, i.e., either thread, is a phantom we need not pursue.
 Suffice it that the film chronicles a fascinating, unusual and therefore probably quite representative anatomy of a love affair. 
 It's especially quirky in its general exclusion of sex. It avoids the obvious. Woodcock (the name admits a retreat from fleshy sex stuff) has a ravenous appetite - but it's exclusively for food, as his breakfasts demonstrate. Alma's first note to him addresses ""the hungry boy,"" an affectionate reduction. 
 Alma's initial appeal is to his designer aesthetic: he likes a model with no breasts and a bit of a belly. But when she moves in he gives her a separate room, next to his but not with him.
 For he also has a ravenous hunger for complete control over his life. He doesn't want his work or meals or emotional balance ever disturbed. Hence he's a confirmed bachelor, though he explains that as his attempt to avoid the inevitable deceits of marriage. 
 Alma loses him when - against his sister Cyril's strong advice - she springs a surprise romantic dinner on him. Woodcock can't abide surprises. Oddly, he handles having a sister named Cyril! But this is a story of irregular sexuality. 
 Alma's entrance ends his apparent career of serial mistresses, with whom he is early infatuated before he finds them irritating enough to let Cyril get rid of them. Alma brings new life: ""Who is this lovely creature making the house smell so nice?""
 Their romance traces the shift of power from the totally self-absorbed man to the plain woman who struggles to sustain her own identity. He doesn't respect her taste, personality, her desires, preferring to treat her as if she were just another material from which he fashions his work. The model is a tool of the dress. If anything, he cedes her less respect than he does his antique lace. 
 ""Alma"" of course means ""soul."" Paradoxically, the woman who brings soul and warmth to the cold Woodcock can only do it by shattering his independence - here, through poisoned mushrooms. She makes him physically sick to heal him emotionally. 
 The dressmaker becomes human, properly appreciative of his woman, only after she forces him into some dependence upon her. Then her tending him supplants his earlier exclusive commitment to his dead mother: ""It's comforting to think the dead are watching over the living. I don't find that spooky at all."" In his delirium her entrance drives out his vision of his dead mother.
 The first poisoning has him fall and ruin the wedding gown he's finishing. But his seamstress crew solves the problem without him. Here he achieves an identity and success outside his work. He marries Alma. So much for his ""I'm a confirmed bachelor. Incurable."" Alma cures him of isolated bachelorhood as well as the poisoning. One poison drives out the other. 
 But he lapses from their healthy independence, prompting him to want Cyril to despatch her as well. When Alma's second dose confirms their union, she tells him what she is doing: 
 ""I want you flat on your back. Helpless, tender, open with only me to help. And then I want you strong again. You're not going to die. You might wish you're going to die, but you're not going to. You need to settle down a little.""
 Even without knowing what she has done to him, he accepts it: ""Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick."" In context, that's as romantic as the opening sonnet of Romeo and Juliet. As Alma tells Dr. Hardy, ""Reynolds has made my dreams come true. And I had given him what he desires most in return.... Every piece of me.""
 The park idyll, with Woodcock and Alma playful of a workday afternoon, sister Cyril happily tending the infant in its carriage, may give the film a conventional happy ending. Love conquers all, etc. Or it may be just another projection of Alma's fantasy. Which it is may depend on what that journalist is writing."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 April 2018,2/10,"What the hell was that?A tale of a twisted fashion designer, his best friend, and his muse of the moment.I don't know what I expected, but is was not the movie I watched.I did manage to view the whole film even the walloping ending.The deserved each other in the end, but no one deserved this movie.Skip..go out for tea instead!"
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2018,9/10,"I've expounded on more than one occasion my profound love of the filmography of Paul Thomas Anderson. In my view, he hasn't yet made a film in his 20+ year career that fell even slightly short of perfect. There has only been one other filmmaker before him that managed to do the same. Stanley Kubrick. So from that equation, you must ask, am I saying PTA is the new Kubrick? 100% yes. You'd have to make a good argument to prove me otherwise, however, that is a discussion for another time.But to all those familiar with his works, there is a familiar pattern in the way he has made films up to this particular point. A sense of emotional grandeur. Whether his characters are up to their knees in oil, filming a porn shoot, collecting pudding packets or wandering the streets of a 1960's LA dazed and confused, they all seem to walk a tight rope of fragility and could explode at any given moment. This makes the themes and performances of his films noticeably big and memorably intense. Phantom Thread breaks the mold in accomplishing something that Anderson hasn't before. Subtlety.Phantom Thread is one of the most elegant and graceful films I've ever seen. It floats across the screen like a rose petal. If you were to merely blink, you'd find yourself watching the credits. Few films in this day and age capture a sense of serenity that has even the most inattentive of viewers to drift into it. But once you go adrift, you'll unexpectedly enter the cold world of Reynolds Woodcock. A mad seamstress. Damn anyone who impedes on his creative process. A lower class waitress named Alma comes into his life and tries to find the section of his heart that could love another woman as much as he loves his craft. What she finds is that Mr. Woodcock doesn't respond to kindness. In fact, he grows to detest even the littles micro actions of Alma, including how she chews her food at breakfast time. A passionless affair this becomes. In a fit of rage, Alma attempts to poison Mr. Woodcock with tea infused with poisonous mushroom. He falls ill. Upon recovery, he inexplicably asks her to marry him. Alma begins to realize Mr. Woodcock's tragic disposition. He only reacts positively to hate.Paul Thomas Anderson has made a tremendous classical satire of romantic relationships. Despite it's elegance, Phantom Thread contains a range of humor and horror that sloppy Hollywood blockbusters just don't come close to. You will spend most of your time cringing, but you'll find yourself laughing out loud towards the end when you finally understand the meaning of Mr. Woodcock's madness. He is a memorable character, tailor made (mind the pun) for Daniel-Day Lewis. It saddens me that we may never see him onscreen again. There isn't enough praise in the world to give to an acting giant such as he. If he could spend the rest of eternity standing upon a stage and enjoying a standing ovation, we would all find a way to make sure our hands don't tire."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 April 2018,3/10,4/13/18. This is really not the way to remember the work of Daniel Day-Lewis. He is such a great actor but this was awful. Way too plodding. Too bad.
PHANTOM THREAD,27 December 2017,8/10,"It's about time. Daniel Day-Lewis, probably the best actor alive today finally returns in what is said to be his final film. Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most consistent directors today comes back for another exciting film this time a period piece set in 1950s London. It was impossible not to get excited for this. I haven't seen Hard Eight, but I think I love everything else I've seen from PTA, he is a fantastic filmmaker who deserves more praise than he gets. I think Phantom Thread may be his magnum opus (though I need to assess this for sure).The film is about an esteemed dressmaker (played by Day-Lewis) who makes dresses for the cream of the crop. Things change very soon for him when he falls for a waitress named Alma. She becomes a part of his life and though he is a fixed man of routine her ways make him question himself, his love and their relationship. The film also shows some of the ups (and mostly the downs) of their relationship, and how volatile things become. The film examines the relationships between the two and the effects that ripple over time.This film is superb on a few fronts. I don't think its Daniel Day-Lewis's best performance, although that's even hard to assess because the roles he does are so different. DDL's Reynolds Woodcock is a fixed, brutally honest, snotty man who clashes heavily with his wife who challenges him and is not content with standing by his side and remaining quiet. The back and forth between the two is a joy to behold. The scene at the surprise dinner has some of the best dialogue you will see this year. I can't commend the cast enough on their performances. Vicky Krieps has just put her name out there with this effort.The cinematography and score are also of the highest order. I think this film is a strong contender for the Oscar for costume design as the costumes are gorgeous and impeccably immaculate. This is a vibrant and gorgeous picture in mind and in visuals. There are hardly any dull moments and the film flies by. PTA also masters comedy in this picture, there is enough levity to contrast the films more serious moments. Overall, this film is worth all the hype and praise its received. Its probably the best we've seen from Anderson and a wonderful swan song for Daniel Day-Lewis (if this remains to be the case). There are many strong films this year and I think Phantom Thread is up there with some of the very best. All around memorable film that is breathtakingly stunning.8.5/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,22 January 2018,10/10,"""Phantom Thread"" is mesmerizing and profoundly sad. Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting and powerful as the solitary artist unwilling to release control of his own world to surrender to love. In Writer and Director Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread"" set in post-War 1950's London, Day-Lewis plays renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock, who designs wedding dresses for all of London's elite. Middle-aged Woodcock is the confirmed bachelor taking and discarding his lovers. Reynolds along with devoted sister Cyril, played by powerfully understated Leslie Manville, lead the fashion House of Woodcock. Having also foregone marriage, Cyril apparently cares for her brother, who seemingly battles depression. Woodcock is the paradox. He creates beauty, accommodating women with his fashion. Yet, in his personal relationship with women, he is unforgiving. Daniel is brilliant restraint and the master of detail in Woodcock's focused will constructing his world that he imposes upon those close to him. Day-Lewis's Woodcock has no self-awareness, his character failing. He allows no space for love, much less granting permission to love him; aside from his Cyril. On holiday at their family vacation home, Woodcock encounters beguiling natural beauty Alma, authentically vulnerable Vicky Krieps. Woodcock romances Alma in his distinguishing style. Is he falling in love with his discovered muse or is she merely the ideal model? Woodcock confesses, ""I've been looking for you for a long time."" While walking on the gorgeous hills of the English coastline Alma says, ""You found me..."" So is this the beginnings of true love?Director Anderson creates the elegant world of fashion and privilege with meticulous images and the moving musical score. His love story of Woodcock and Alma resonates as deeply sad. Someone wise said that profound sadness heals loss. Poignantly, the sadness in ""Phantom Thread"" is the kind that reminds of past loss, and perpetuates. Yet, the possibility of profound sadness may exist in the narrative resolve. Reynolds suffers with the loss of his Mother as a young boy. He loved her so, but never completed his loss. Anyone who dares intimacy with him suffers the consequences. That narrative thread is sown into the very canvas of ""Phantom Thread"". At the tipping point of Woodcock and Alma's love affair, Cyril defends her distinct fondness for Alma. Brave Cyril warns her brother, ""Don't pick a fight with me. You certainly won't come out alive. I'll go right through you..."" Woodcock is his own worst enemy, of which he has no clue. When all three are present, Woodcock tragically says, ""There is an air of quiet death in this house..."" That is so. And Reynolds is the source. In the ironic narrative twist Alma betrays Woodcock to calm their volatile relationship. Strangely, this element enlists defining gravitas. Cyril and Alma truly love Reynolds. Ultimately, he must choose to give up being right about everyone. That is hard for anyone to do. Director Anderson is unflinching and patient in revealing his portrait of humility and personal surrender. His story falters at times, yet his humanity is eloquence. ""Phantom Thread"" is beauty and sadness. Day-Lewis, Manville, and Krieps are all sublime. ""Phantom Thread"" inquires: What you would sew into the canvas of your life or for those you love? ""Phantom Thread"" is wonderful and touching to behold."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2019,7/10,"Much like The Post (2017), Phantom Thread (2017) has a director/actor combination that just begs for an Oscar nomination. It seems that a decade after the last Paul Thomas Anderson/Daniel Day-Lewis collaboration, There Will Be Blood (2007), the Academy might want to pull their ""should have won"" trick and give the Best Picture Oscar to Phantom Thread. After seeing this film, though, I have changed my initial assessment. Sure, it's good and has certain artistic elements that make it culturally significant, but other parts of it are just kind of . . . weird.First, the good. Daniel Day-Lewis, in his last role as an actor, unquestionably shows how good he is at his craft. I wouldn't doubt that he has a good shot at earning his historic fourth Best Actor Oscar. The costume design and cinematography are noteworthy, but the best part of this film is a little more subtle: the music. The score for this movie permeates the entirety of it, but the fact that the majority of it is on stringed instruments (even the piano has strings) speaks to the ""thread"" connection. Quite clever, if you ask me. Overall, the film just seems to ""work,"" even if I don't know how it does.Phantom Thread also seems to suffer from the same slow build-up that There Will Be Blood had. Sure, it's methodical, but there are also weird moments where I couldn't figure out what the characters were thinking. Sure, Day-Lewis' character was a perfectionist to the detriment of his social skills, but some of his reactions were bizarre when the character broke out of his routines. Perhaps the weirdness of other Paul Thomas Anderson's films (like The Master (2012)) leaked in and made it challenging to get a grasp on this movie.Another fine Paul Thomas Anderson/Daniel Day-Lewis film, I give Phantom Thread 3.5 stars out of 5."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,8/10,"Have you ever been in a relationship with an artist? They'll say that it can be difficult, as most artists tend to be indifferent towards their significant other's differences. Artists make their living by doing things their own way. Now that they have to surrender a little bit of that to live with someone else, that can throw part of their creative intuition off balance. Perhaps before, when they used to have sleepless nights trying to create the perfect paining, is changed because they have to do it during the daytime rather then evening. Or perhaps a significant other has to take a job in another town, causing the artist the deal with the possibility of moving. To change an artist (especially a renowned famous artist) is like changing an older person; not impossible, but very hard.Perhaps it's a mental disorder like Aspergers or obsessive-compulsive tendencies, or it could be a certain personality type who sees the world as their own canvas that they can use to their advantage. An artist who has to share things is sacrificing more then most people realize. This happens to be the focus; an artist whose forced to change in Phantom Thread. In the mid fifties in London, a famous dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) is like a lot of artists. He has a set way of living, from how he eats his breakfast and keeping his shop at home. His sister Cyril (played by Lesley Manville) manages his operations, his house, and is the most encouraging of his obsessive nature. Reynolds is known for hiding messages within the stitching of his dresses, calling back to his mother. While out for a little trip to the countryside, he becomes attracted to a waitress Alma (played by Vicky Krieps). The two start a romantic relationship...but don't play out like you think.Though it's clear that Reynolds has a lot of complicated feelings for Alma, he doesn't treat her with the same kind of passion that she does to him. Aside from remaining on his side, she also works as one of his assistants. Reynolds is partially annoyed by her changing of his routine, but is also respectful of her, knowing that she is trying and willing to put up with him. They bicker and fight, but they also play certain roles. When she tries to host a intimate dinner, he gets angry that his routine is off. But when she cares for him when he falls ill, he's reminded why he really likes her. I guarantee that Phantom Thread will not be a film that a lot of people would expect. There isn't a story or even that much of a plot. It's just about two people learning to live with each others differences. The film was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (The Master, Boogie Nights) whose known for rarely having focus in favor of creating characters that are interesting enough for you to follow their decisions to see what they make of them. Phantom Thread is his most definitive example of that. As I said, it's about two people living together...and that's pretty much it. Because of that (especially with it's long running time), this is not a typical film for the mainstream audience. In fact, when I got out of the theater, I didn't know what to think other then it was shot beautifully. I then thought about just what people have to sacrifice to find a different kind of happiness that made me think. The movie's writing does help separate the characters not just with their dialogue, but with how their personalities show how bad they are...and yet how good they are for each other.Because of this, Daniel Day Lewis and Vicky Krieps are amazing. Krieps is perfect as the woman who is doing everything to try make her lover happy, but has her limits when pushed too far. Lewis on the other hand, is exactly what I'd expect a famous fashion designer; egotistical, arrogant, demanding, and compulsive. Anybody would have ran from this guy, but Lewis gives him a soft, boy-like voice that gives people the illusion of sweetness.I'll give this eight 1950s gowns out of ten. For the average moviegoer, I doubt they'll get into the slow building of a relationship. But for those that love these kinds of art-house features, Phantom Thread will definitely please them. This movie is a lot like the beautiful dresses that the main character designs; elegant, deep with patterns, and something you have to admire based off of the form."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 January 2018,10/10,"Phantom Thread, is an absolutely wonderfully detailed and observed film that I feel is an important film and even a very relevant film in today's world of Hollywood scandals of sexual harassment and abuse. What I am getting at here, or suggesting is not because of any physical, or sexual violence in this new film because there is none, but what I could keenly observe was a man's overbearing and dominant relationship (if one could call it that) over a woman, and again while there may be no physical, or sexual violence, there is still the damage of hurt feelings as well as countless other forms of damaged emotions and inner hurt that as we all know is still a form of abuse and is still painful and terribly damaging. One looks at Daniel-Day Lewis's character here, who is a man who seems very almost obsessive compulsive and routine to the point of almost being fanatical about how he lives his life. Everything has to be according to his schedule, or timing and if the tiniest thing even slightly irritates him, or takes away his focus from his work, or whatever it might be that he is doing, he either becomes cold to the point of being distant and almost getting pleasure out of seeing the other party be witness to his terrible bouts of mood swings and his ever changing mood which here seems to change as often as the weather. He is in many ways a quiet man and may even be classified as a genius in his line of work, but at the same time he is a control freak when it comes to his work and the events going on in his life and this also comes into effect here when a new relationship is brought into his life. Pretty much from his first couple of encounters with this new girl named Alma, Lewis's character Reynolds, seems to want to mold, or even conform her to a certain image that is not what the world, or society deems women to be, but instead how he things they should act, speak and behave and again because he has to have everything so rigid and to a very fine routine, this means that he not only more or less has a dominating role over Alma, but she has very little freedom to behave, or just be herself and instead must adapt to Reynolds every and any whim, or personal standard of status that he believes she should have. The sad thing is that at first, Alma completely goes along with this. Maybe because deep down she is a lonely and damaged person herself and maybe this is the only kind of acceptance she has ever received. Maybe she is afraid of losing the only relationship that up to now she has ever had. The dominance of Reynolds is equally fascinating and disturbing to watch and it immediately made me reflect on today's abuse of women in Hollywood which is in the media almost daily with new accusations of sexual assault against people pretty much weekly. This is a problem that I fear has been not only in Hollywood and the film industry for a long time, but also just in society in general where women are often under valued and even still today treated as sexual objects. The interesting thing about Phantom Thread, is that Alma doesn't put up with this attitude for too long and instead she starts to play Reynold's game right back at him and in a sense there is almost a feeling of trying to play games with each other till eventually both parties will be dominant, or acceptable to one another. It certainly is a fascinating character study and one well worth observing and I fear that not only in the period piece setting of this film, but even today, that unhealthy and destructive relationships like this still exist and how they are completely damaging and ruining people's lives because one member, or the other is too timid, or afraid to speak out against it. Paul Thomas Anderson has always proven how wonderful at bringing to the screen unique and well developed characters he is and this may be one of his most interesting and best to date. Day-Lewis, who says that he is retiring from acting after this role, gives what I think is one of the best performances of his already legendary career. With Reynold's observances of life and his tics, mannerisms and body language, Day-Lewis makes this a character that we both loathe and yet can not take our eyes off at the same time. It is truly this year's most well written and fascinating character and I would also call Lewis's performance as the best male performance of the year. The supporting performances by Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville are also fantastic as is the writing, direction and attention to detail. This is a film for serious film goers who love to study and observe people, places and situations and if you are a lover of character studies and deeply involving films, then you could not have a better film you could ask for and Day-Lewis ends his career with another honourable and wonderful performance that continues to prove he is one of our best living actors. One of 2017's best films."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread tells the story of Reynolds Woodcock(Daniel Day-Lewis), a famous fashion designer in 1950's London. Reynolds falls in love with Alma(Vicky Krieps), who also becomes the latest woman to test his beautiful dresses. Phantom Thread is a superb movie. Director Paul Thomas Anderson has given us an engaging, suspenseful & dramatic film, that is original & not an adaptation, which is a rarity these days. The cinematography captures all the gorgeous locales of the UK. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Daniel Day-Lewis has given us another mesmerizing performance, as Reynolds Woodcock. Day-Lewis retires from acting, with a bang. We'll miss you, Daniel Day-Lewis. Vicky Krieps is spectacular as Alma. Day-Lewis & Krieps share this dark yet charming chemistry, that works wonders for the film. Lesley Manville is fantastic as Cyril. Phantom Thread is a must watch for fans of Paul Thomas Anderson & Daniel Day-Lewis. Go, witness Woodcock's perfectionist behavior."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 April 2020,8/10,"The one thing that can be guaranteed with writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is that he doesn't work in set genres and his features are all (superficially at least) quite different. I can honestly say that I've never seen, nor would I really expect to enjoy, a film about a male fashion designer/dressmaker set in the haute couture world of London in the 1950s. But that is what Phantom Thread is about and I found it fascinating and think it is Anderson's best film, since his epic There Will Be Blood, which featured completely different dramatic content, but which also starred Daniel Day Lewis in the lead role.Here Lewis (in what he says is his final role) plays Reynolds Woodcock the creative force behind The House of Woodcock, which produces dresses for members of European high society. He possesses an extremely obsessive and controlling personality, which we understand to be only truly understood by his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville), who manages the day-to-day operations of their fashion house and has significant influence over his life. This includes the relationships he has with various women whom he invites into their large Edwardian home, where the Woodcocks live and carry out their work. The latest of these women, who Reynolds meets and invariably tires of, is Alma Elson, a waitress of European origins, with whom he appears instantly smitten during their first encounter over a breakfast table. Soon she moves in with him, becoming his chief model, muse, and possible lover. I use the word ""possible"" deliberately, because even though the production notes of the film say Reynolds and Alma are lovers, we never once see any evidence at all, that their relationship (at any stage of the movie) is physically consummated. In fact the opposite applies, which I personally see as being important. The initial big question therefore is will Alma suffer a similar fate to earlier Woodcock models at the hands of Reynolds and Cyril, or will she be able to display a more wilful, determined and resilient approach? Well, is the Pope a Catholic?Phantom Thread is the sort of film that defines the genre of psychological drama. Quacks will have a field day analysing the quirks of the power plays and actions occurring between the three lead players, particularly Reynolds and Alma. Reynolds is an extraordinary character; aloof, finicky, hard to please, possibly asexual and still fixated on his deceased mother, whose influence upon him was profound. But in Alma, he finds an initially captivating woman, who may well be not so easily denied from following and achieving success in her own ambitions.The actors are terrific. We all know of the three-time best Oscar winner Day-Lewis's talents, but Vicky Krieps, playing Alma, is a revelation. She's innocence, vulnerability, strength and an enigma, all rolled into one extremely believable performance and the perfect foil for Day-Lewis's highly mannered Reynolds. Lesley Manville's quietly imposing Cyril, has also garnered critical acclaim for no uncertain reasons.The costumes, sets and locations all perfectly complement the 1950's time period and the photography, for a film that doesn't boast a director of cinematography, is first class anyway. Frequent Anderson collaborator, musical director Jonny Greenwood, has crafted a more than effective musical soundtrack, largely featuring solo piano pieces.Paul Thomas Anderson's films rarely are great money spinners, but generally win wide-spread critical acclaim. It's for good reason that Phantom Thread ended up high on many critic's best films of 2018 lists. It's an original blend of character study and psychodramatic romance offering us a glimpse of a post-war London social setting, that has rarely been investigated by other film makers. It's well worth seeing."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 January 2018,1/10,"""Phantom Thread"" (R, 2:10) stars multiple Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis in what he has said is his final film role. Day-Lewis plays the fictional Reynolds Woodcock, a world-famous, 1950s' high-end London dress maker to the rich and famous. He's persnickety in every sense of the word and self-absorbed enough to callously dismiss his live-in lovers for having the nerve to ask for his occasional adoration, appreciation or simple attention. He then meets and seems to inexplicably but instantly fall in love with an unremarkable foreign-born waitress named Alma (Vicky Krieps) who looks almost young enough to be his granddaughter. After one date, she moves in and becomes his model, muse, assistant and lover. When Alma realizes that Reynolds' treatment of her has fallen into his usual pattern, her impulsive and drastic action changes the equation, but not in the way she planned. Reynolds is a completely unlikeable character and writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's film doesn't even benefit from telling a true story that might help us understand some real-life persnickety, self-absorbed dress maker. Why Anderson would invent such an unpleasant character and put him in the center of a story which has virtually nothing to teach us about life or love - and is so completely unenjoyable - is difficult to understand. As typically terrific as Day-Lewis' performance is, it's a shame for this character to be his swan song - and as great as Anderson's early career was (""Boogie Nights"", anyone?), it's too bad that he now gives us films like 2012's ""The Master"" and 2017's ""Phantom Thread"". This one is a another pointless character study in which the main actors give great performances, but which are in service to unlikeable, rarely sympathetic characters which make confounding life choices and fail to effectively entertain, enlighten or excite many Movie Fans. ""D+"""
PHANTOM THREAD,21 February 2018,8/10,"The alleged acting swan-song of Daniel Day-Lewis (""Lincoln"") sees him deliver a brilliantly intense portrayal of a maestro in his craft with all the quirks and egotistical faults that come with that position. Reynolds Woodcock is the craftsman behind a world-renowned 1950's fashion house, in demand from the elite classes and even royalty. He has a magnetic personality, is overtly self-confident, obsessive, a cruel bully and treats his girlfriends as chattels that he can tire of and dismiss from his life without a backward glance. Trying to keep the business and Reynolds on track, with ruthless efficiency, is his sister Cyril (Leslie Manville, ""Maleficent"").Looking for his next conquest during a trip to his seaside residence, he reels in blushing young waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps, ""The Colony""). But he gets more than he bargains for. This is a really exquisite and gentle film. Aside from some dubious fungi-related practices, there is no violence, no sex and - aside from about half a dozen well-chosen F-words - limited swearing (of which more below). This is a study of the developing relationship between the two protagonists, with little in the way of plot. Sounds dull? Far from it. This is two hours that flew by.What it also features is (yet) another example of extremely strong women asserting their power. A scene (well trailed in Manville's award snippets) where Cyril firmly puts Reynolds back in his box is brilliant: a real turning of tables with Woodcock meekly falling into line. And Alma makes for an incredibly rich and complicated character, one of the most interesting female roles I've seen this year so far.It's a stellar acting performance from Day-Lewis, and while Oldman fully deserves all of his award kudos for ""Darkest Hour"", Day-Lewis delivers the goods without any of the make-up. It feels like Day-Lewis is a long way down the betting odds this year because ""he always gets one"". He certainly gets my vote ahead of all of the other three nominees. Kreips - not an actress I know - also brilliantly holds her own, and if it wasn't such a strong female field this year she could well have been nominated.Also worthy of note is the pervasive piano score by (suprisingly) Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. It's really lovely and counterpoints the rest of the classical score nicely. Its BAFTA and Oscar nominations are both well deserved (though I would expect the Oscar to follow the BAFTA steer with ""The Shape of Water""). All in all, this is a real tour de force by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (""Inherent Vice"", ""There Will Be Blood""). How much I enjoyed this film was a surprise to me, since I have no interest in the ""fashion industry"" (as my family will no doubt be quick to point out!) and I went to see this more out of 'duty' based on its Oscar buzz than because I really wanted to see it.The big curiosity is why exactly the BBFC decided that this film was worthy of a 15 certificate rather than a 12A. Their comments on the film say ""There is strong language ('f**k'), as well as milder terms including 'bloody' and 'hell'. Other issues include mild sex references and scenes of emotional upset. In one scene, a woman's nipples are visible through her slip while she is measured for a dress."" For a 12A, the board say ""The use of strong language (for example, 'f***') must be infrequent"". I didn't count the f-words... but as I said I don't think it amounts to more than a half-dozen. Is that ""frequent""? And - SHOCK, HORROR... visible covered nipples you say?! Lock up your teenagers! When you look at the gentleness of this film versus the violence within ""Black Panther"", you have to question this disparity."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,10/10,"Let me just start by stating that I'm not the biggest fan of director Paul Thomas Anderson. I'm well aware that I have a very unpopular opinion among film fans about that. From his earlier films like Boogie Nights or Punch-Drunk Love to newer films like Inherent Vice or The Master, I've appreciated his films for what they are and even though they were at least solid watches. That being said, upon my viewing of his latest outing in Phantom Thread, I found myself incredibly baffled by how much I was loving it. Yes, of Anderson's entire filmography, I think Phantom Thread may just be my absolute favorite that he's made. From its calm direction and slow-paced emotional core, here are all the reasons I believe that every mature film viewer needs to witness this movie.Following Reynolds Woodcock, an older dressmaker who is as arrogant and simple-minded as they come, he happens to come across Alma, the perfect woman in every way for him. Being the perfect body type to model his dresses while also finding her very attractive, the two of them for a very strange romance that ultimately leads to deception and heartache for the both of them. The premise itself seems like something that a much older audience will appreciate, but I found myself sucked into this story and honestly on the edge of my seat at times. Yes, there are quite a few tension-filled moments throughout this movie and the surprises in it are some of the most memorable that I've witnessed in quite some time.Where I feared this film would lose my attention, like many of Anderson's previous works did, was in its pacing. I find his sense of storytelling to be very dull and even though his filmmaking techniques are extremely commendable, to say the least, they just haven't stuck with me over the years. This time around, the film relies on your connection of these two characters to hold your interest, which was precisely the reason I fell in love with it. Watching a man make dresses and fall in love with someone at least 30 years younger than him doesn't seem like a masterpiece on the surface, but I can assure you that this movie builds up to a very unconventional love that will catch most viewers off guard.Not only does Anderson do a great job at directing this film, but his screenplay is also worth mentioning, due to the incredible detail that seems to be written throughout it. Whether or not a character is talking, there's always something going on. Whether it's through a look that a character shares with another or whether someone simply touches a piece of clothing, it almost seemed as though everything about this movie was telling a story, even when nothing was happening, and that's a very rare thing to accomplish. Although these are two very different films, I got vibes that dated back to my first viewing of the film Drive. In the way that it used a little less dialogue and more visual storytelling. Don't get me wrong, there's still plenty of dialogue here, but this is a film that doesn't need dialogue to get its point across.In the end, Phantom Thread is a movie that deserves every bit of praise and awards buzz that it's receiving, which is a lot coming from me. The slow pace didn't bother me, because the characters were so interesting and the third act almost becomes a quite romantic thriller, due to the situations that begin to present themselves. This film develops very quickly from one thing to another and it kept me wanting more. For these reasons and more, I can't bring myself to complain about anything here. If you're a hardcore fan of cinema like I am, I can see you loving this film."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2018,8/10,"'ve now seen 7 of the 9 Oscar nominated movies for 2018 and can't recall a more diverse range of stories and characters for quite some time..
There's something for everyone history and action in Dunkirk and The Darkest Hour, fantasy and romance in The Shape of Water and Call Me By Your Name and standing alone in my view Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri .We then have the dramas based on fact I Tonya and The Post.
Two films I can't comment on yet are Lady Bird and Get Out but I can comment on The Phantom Thread.
I found this film compelling and fascinating in its portrayal of 3 totally self centred self obsessed characters who in one way or another can't survive without the other.
Daniel Day Lewis who is mesmerising and plays Reynolds Woodcock the talented couture genius and the darling of the London fashion set , he a is precious self absorbed unsympathetic complex man who meets Vicky Krieps who plays his muse Alma (think Professor Higgins meets Lady Macbeth )or perhaps even an intellectual Fifty Shades of Grey , minus the sex .
The performance though that stood out for me was Leslie Manville as Reynolds protective twisted sister , reminded me of Mrs Danvers in Rebecca.
Leslie Manville and Allison Janney as Tonya Hardings twisted mother are both nominated for Best Supporting actress and to me they are a tie and both deserve the Oscar.
The film is long but I didn't get bored at all , it's elegantly set and costumed and deserves all the nominations it's in the running for but my favourite to win Best Film , Best Actress and best supporting actor remains Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri and I think it's an insult it's Director Martin Mc Donagh has been denied a nomination."

In other words, he too-often displays the temperament of a peevish, demanding child who will not be questioned, opposed or criticized. Could we expect anything less from a severely introverted, incurable bachelor who is surrounded by women only, in his daily work life?But, it's also the story about a ruthless, determined young woman, Alma (Krieps), who, when opportunity arises, takes the necessary time to break through this perfectionist's emotional wall to achieve what she thinks will be her version of The Sweet Life. For her, that is, and her compliant lover ... or husband. Crucially, this story opens with Alma relating to a doctor her trials and worries concerning her relationship with Woodcock, and as though she is talking of the past....And so ... by sheer coincidence our perfectionist is taking a break from work at a rural seaside resort where, in a quaint restaurant, he is served by Alma, a waitress (the name traditionally means 'nourishment' or 'soul'). There is a spark between them - he is intrigued. Enough to cause Woodcock, in turn, to later take Alma to dinner at another restaurant; and then to his nearby residence - where he insists upon using her as model to design and make a dress ... for her to wear.From that point onwards, the plot - and Alma's occasional voice-over - continues with the strengthening of that mutual attraction - followed by the gradual disruption caused by Alma's presence at his London business; the displeasure evinced by Woodcock's sister, Cyril, a spinster whom he calls 'my old so-and-so' (Lesley Manville in a low key, but riveting performance); the inevitable attempts by Alma to gain more of Woodcock's attention; her desire to go dancing, his arrogant rejection of such frivolity; the mutual frostiness that begins to cool their ardor for each other; and so on, with other peccadilloes, little by little, until....One morning, Alma decides to use - and reuse - the only technique she thinks will help to ensure his need for her. Exactly what she does, I must leave for you to discover writer/director Anderson's ironic and macabre resolution for Alma.On balance, I think there are three ways this story can be interpreted: first, as an allegory about the creative process, and the difficulty of sharing that creativity with others, especially those emotionally close; or second, simply as a male-female power play in an industry where creativity was, at that time, largely dominated by men; or finally, as a man simply with a mother fixation, who discovers, at last, a suitable woman as mother-surrogate, and wife.Writers usually choose names carefully for the main players in a story, often as a metaphor for character. So, I'm confident P. T. Anderson followed that principle when he wrote the script. Hence, if I were to chose, I'd select the last option as the most relevant interpretation for this dressed up (no pun intended) account of a thoroughly unlikable, neutered man who, fortuitously, will achieve the happiness - such as it is - he so thoroughly deserves.But it's not everybody's movie: there are long silent scenes with long looks between each other; scenes of the two simply walking together; and, of course, many scenes of the women workers doing their work. What's entirely missing, of course, is sex....Naturally, the overall standard of production, the flawless acting, the directing, the setting, the photography and editing, the music (a tad too loud for me at times) - they all combine to give the viewer the very best in entertainment about the ties that bind.

PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2018,8/10,"Set in 1950s London, this is very old-fashioned 'classic' looking film and is reputed to be Daniel Day Lewis's last performance. He plays a high end fashion designer 'Woodcock', who makes dresses for the rich, famous and royalty. His attention to detail had earned him a perfect reputation for craftsmanship, his clothes were viewed as works of art. An important aspect to his creations were the 'secret' messages sewn into the linings of his clothes. His sister Cyril was also his business partner, she was the only person who truly understood his character and always did her best to protect him. There always seems to exist a heavy atmosphere in the household, Woodcock demanded structure and always followed a strict daily routine. It was important that his routine was maintained or the whole of the rest of the day would be thrown into turmoil. He formed a friendship with a young waitress, Alma, who he grew attracted to and used her to model his designs. They fell in love but maintained a strange relationship, there always appeared to be an increasing power struggle between them, which culminated in Alma deliberately cooking some poisoned mushrooms into a meal, Woodcock became very sick and almost died. Alma gradually nurses him back to health. However, towards the end of the film we see Alma poison him a second time, with more mushrooms in an omelette. Woodcock appeared to know her game but obviously liked the feeling of dependence when being cared for. We see that Woodcock never felt more alive than when close to death.Recommended viewing for anyone tired of '50 Shades of Rubbish!"

PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,9/10,"What a beautiful thing on the eyes. It really works for all senses. A great character drama with strong performances and a great direction. 
The film describes a very complicated relationship and explores it to its deepest core. Its how the film works, rather than having a complex story it has complex character and thus works as the mother of character studies. Its a beautiful swan song for masterclass actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Once again the Day-Lewis gives a fantastic performance and is in total control of his character. Its really hard to imagine any other actor in that role, because they would have easily hammered it up but Day-Lewis totally embodied that role. Great and unpredictable performance once again. I wasnt too fond of Vicky Krieps. Its probably not her fault, because it felt like she was constantly in ""awe"" when she acted towards Day-Lewis. She was quite good in her scenes alone but alongside Day-Lewis it felt she hesitated a little (MINUS the dinner scene, where she was really great). Lesley Manville was good as it was a great character, on the surface you would expect her to be the bitch of the show but then you figure out that it is just ""show"" and that she is truly good hearted. The look was fantastic, and not only the costumes, but also the whole set decoration. A fantastic cinematography, decent score and a very soulful screenplay that constantly kept you interested in the characters. Great PTA film, best since ""There Will Be Blood"". Mr. Day-Lewis you will sorely be missed."

PHANTOM THREAD,1 March 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread ix a drama film starring Daniel Day-Lewis. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, Boogie Nights), it is a finely crafted and sincere portrayal of an emotionally distant man's perfectionism.In the 1950s in London, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) works as a dressmaker creating dresses and other garments for upper class members of society. Due to his perfectionist nature, Reynolds has a reputation for being difficult to work with and believes that he has no time to settle down intimately with anyone. However, one day, Reynolds becomes fascinated with a waitress named Alma (Vicky Krieps), whom he later takes under his wing as his muse. As their working relationship begins to flourish, Alma soon discovers Reynolds' controlling personality and often finds herself at odds with him over his obsession with his craft.The film is essentially a slow burner, as is the case with most of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, and this allows the audience ample time to understand the mindset of every important character and their motivations. This also helps showcase the blossoming romance between the two leads and makes their time together feel more realistic and genuine, as would be the case of a real relationship. The soundtrack, composed by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, compliments the film beautifully with its fragile string arrangements and gentle piano chords. While not quite his greatest role, Daniel Day-Lewis gives another solid performance as Reynolds Woodcock, whose character's perfectionism seems like an excellent fit for the committed actor himself. If this really is his final film, then it is a noble one for which to conclude his acting career.I rate it 8/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 February 2018,6/10,"This is a special director. Either you like it or you do not like it. I usually do not like it. This, for me, is his most conventional film, within what fits. That's why I like it more than the others. You have to see it and support the characters you are seeing, if you do, you will see a movie with a good enough bill, but one that is difficult to carry.It's hard to put up with because all the characters are unpleasant, that's what they get, with their interpretations. They are all great. But I think there is a problem. I do not believe that the character of Daniel, choose that girl as a model and fall in love with her. Does a man who cares so much choose that girl who has neither style nor class nor is she beautiful? I'm sorry for her, but that's the way it is. As an actress, she's very good, but her role is not good.It has a great picture, there are only moments when it spoils putting a lot of light through the window, but otherwise it is very beautiful and helps to enter the story.
Not to mention makeup, hairdressing and clothing. Magnificent. The good thing about this movie is that being a film set in fashion and talking about fashion characters, it does not entertain much in it and does not bore. It is dedicated more to the plots and that I appreciate.I do not like how he directs. I have never liked it. The tempo is too slow, even for this movie. Sometimes they have a conversation and it's hard for them to say words. It does not count well with the camera. The plans are not pretty.You can see it, although I do not think that most people remember it in a short space of time"
PHANTOM THREAD,20 March 2019,6/10,Phantom Thread deals with the psychology of feminine males and the stronger women (psycho) who love with them. A feminine man wants a woman to be his mother and unless she is willing to care for him than the relationship will not work. DDL plays a man who literally wants his mother to care for him while he lays on his back - and I guess lucky for him he found the lady psycho enough to do it. This film is boring AF but nice dreamlike allegory of the psychology of a feminine man and the stronger women who care for them.
PHANTOM THREAD,2 January 2018,10/10,"Every stitch of the filmmaking (the directing, the photography, the screenplay, the acting, the exquisitely beautiful music from Jonny Greenwood) mirrors the careful threading of fabric and creations of the film's focus: 1950's London dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock (played perfectly by Daniel Day Lewis). But writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson flips things on their head by making the new love interest, Alma (an amazing Vicky Krieps), the protagonist...and her emotional chess match with Reynolds creates the film's beautiful, subdued, classy, and darkly humorous suspense.Fans of refined cinema should rejoice. Phantom Thread is a carefully constructed and mesmerizing masterpiece. It is both unlike anything we've seen before from Paul Thomas Anderson and everything you could hope for from such a talent (the underlying themes carry across from other works, and the attention to detail remains paramount). If this is Daniel Day Lewis' last film (as reported), then he leaves on a very high note.Quite simply, this is the film of the year...and one of the best of the decade.Read full reviews at theschleicherspin.com"
PHANTOM THREAD,6 October 2018,8/10,"Quiet movies are not usually my thing. I like pace and story and energy. But this film crackles in the quiet. PTA makes every scene feel like a battle, and the actors' performances rise to that challenge. It may be a quiet movie about a dress maker, but it is so much more - a battle of wills, a tension against each seam, a few characters slowly resigning themselves to something other than what they planned. If you described the plot, I would be like, ""Really? That is the story?"" After watching it, I can say it is not just a story...it is a great story."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 January 2018,4/10,"Pretentious comes to mind. Daniel day lewis, the ""empty vessel"" of the acting profession, comes up short here. a non romance between a self involved ego maniac (pun intended) and a masochistic protégé. in the current atmosphere of sexual harassment, this movie shines as a prime example of the mistreatment of women. shades of Hitchcock, I hear. very pale shades, if any. lots of glowing reviews from movie goers, though."
PHANTOM THREAD,31 January 2018,10/10,"Have you ever examined a spool of thread? You follow the thread around its spool, line after line, turn after turn, gazing at its perfect uniformity. The slightest disturbance, a speck of dust perhaps, disrupts the flow of the thread. Each line of the condensed cotton, uniformly following the other with machine-like precision, each strand dependent on the piece next to it to make up the tightly wound collection of cotton. Imagine further, once the spool is destined to be used, how it is laid out in preparation, having been selected to perfectly bring together the garment being made. Then imagine, the spool falls to the floor, maybe tumbling down a flight of stairs or bouncing down on the carpet; the strands explode from their homogeneity becoming tangled as they travel through their unexpected journey. Finally, when the spool hits the baseboard, the thread rests, a disorganized heap of its former self. Eventually, someone who cares enough will wind the thread around the spool once again, twisting and turning until reaching the end of the line. This time, though, the spool won't be as neat or tightly wound, it never could be after such a disturbance. The machine-like quality of the previous configuration now visibly altered by another person, much like the well-orchestrated life of a fastidious dressmaker. Paul Thomas Anderson weaves a modern-day masterpiece with his 2017 feature Phantom Thread. Showcasing the intimate details of the life of a renowned dressmaker, Reynolds Woodcock. Dressing the most elite and prestigious of Britain, Woodcock has every aspect of his life firmly entrenched in routines and order. Balancing between dressing actresses, heiresses, and royalty, Woodcock, with the unwavering support from his sister Cyril, (Lesley Manville) maintains a rigorous schedule, keeping himself in high demand. Maintaining a life as ordered and tightly wound as that spool of thread, Reynolds is used to getting his way in every aspect. A consummate bachelor, Reynolds is used to having muses rather than partners. Muses that can be easily disposed of once Reynolds is through with them being a fixture in his life. One such a muse is what he expected when he met Alma (Vicky Krieps) but for once in his life, Reynolds grossly underestimated who he was dealing with, and actually found the person that would disrupt his carefully commanded life like a falling spool of thread.Phantom Thread is a perfect film. Clearly wound by a visionary filmmaker, the impact of Phantom Thread only intensifies upon repeat viewings. I drove an hour away to see Paul Thomas Anderson's film, and I couldn't have been more enchanted by what I saw. Well worth the traveling, I have planned to see Phantom Thread again this weekend. The score is a work of art, Daniel-Day Lewis is in usual top form, as are the female co-leads, Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville. I saw Phantom Thread five days ago and I'm still on such a high that I won't continue this write up much longer, as I'd simply be babbling on while drooling at my desk. The most emotionally gripping film I've seen all year, Phantom Thread immediately affixed itself near the very top of my list of favorite films of 2017."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 February 2018,9/10,"The movie world jumped for joy when they heard that Daniel Day-Lewis was reuniting with Paul Thomas Anderson once more for another period epic. Although it was upsetting to hear that it would be Day-Lewis' final swansong, there was no doubt that it would be a suitable film to bow out in style with and I'm delighted to confirm that that's true.Although not as powerful as the duo's previous There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread is an exquisitely crafted film with phenomenal performances and enigmatic characters that dare you never to tear your eyes from the screen. There's a tremendous tension bubbling beneath the film's stylish exterior, yet that tension never quite explodes in the way you might expect. Phantom Thread is a love story with a strange twist. It follows a fashion designer called Reynolds Woodcock who is about as fascinating as a character gets. A beyond fussy workaholic who lives with his coldly reserved sister (played beautifully by Lesley Manville) and feels utterly cursed despite living lavishly. We meet him at his lowest point during breakfast where his latest relationship is in tatters. His sister convinces him to go away for a while where he meets Vicky Krieps' Alma, a shy waitress who becomes besotted with the eccentric genius after he orders enough food to feed the Vatican City. From then on we're treated with the weirdly captivating ups and downs of their beyond volatile relationship.Some might say that nothing much happens in the film's 130 minute running time. I heard an old dear behind me say, 'well that was far too long. I would've edited that down.' But thank god they didn't hire her as editor because there's so much more going on beneath the surface. This is a character-driven film, very much like Anderson's previous There Will Be Blood and The Master and as such requires multi-layered, strong performances to carry the narrative along and this film does so in spade loads.It doesn't come as much surprise that Daniel Day-Lewis gives an outstanding Oscar-worthy performance given that the man already has three of them. It would be wonderful to see him win a record-breaking fourth but it looks as though this year belongs to Gary Oldman. He completely transforms into the character and was extreme as ever when preparing for the role. Everyone on set had to refer to him as his character's name and he even learnt how to sew and make dresses. The result is another astonishing performance, if it really is his final film then it's a pretty spectacular exit.Equally as magnetic is Vicky Krieps, a relatively unknown actress from Luxembourg who is entirely believable as the young muse falling head over heels in love with Woodcock's peculiar charm. Lesley Manville is also quietly hilarious as the ultra-frosty sister whom Woodcock adores. In fact there's a quiet hilarity running through the entire film. Woodcock's eccentricities make him appear as a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode at any moment. The slightest noise at breakfast riles him, as does cooking anything in butter. His outbursts are both funny and sad at the same time. Funny because they seem so trivial and sad because this is obviously a man who struggles to find happiness in anything despite having it all.The film is also beautiful to look at, as any film about beauty and the fashion industry should be. You could proudly roll it down the catwalk for everyone to marvel at. Anderson even worked as his own director of photography for the film and the result is luscious imagery, some even quite haunting. There's a heightened sense of reality in the film which makes it feel dreamlike in quality.In some ways Phantom Thread is the opposite of There Will Be Blood. It's far more subtle and contained with most of the drama happening within Woodcock's majestic home. It doesn't have the same raging intensity and is instead surprisingly tender. It leaves you with much to think about and even if you're the kind of person who doesn't like their films to leave them thinking, you can't help but be astounded by the highest calibre of acting. Films like this don't come around too often so let's treasure it and cherish it even more so that it could be the last time we see the greatest actor of our generation on screen."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 March 2020,6/10,"I was worried I'd struggle with this. It's not a popular opinion, but I can take or leave Daniel Day Lewis. I've seen him in things I've really liked. I've seen him in things I've really disliked. Where would this fall? Reynolds Woodcock designs, makes, obsesses over dresses. Obsesses over everything in fact. Living and working in London's high society, he's meticulous and detached. Sensitive and childish. Money isn't in short supply, but his happiness found in perfection is. That is, until he meets Alma. In Alma he's found a new muse, a soul he connects with, but also with the frame he's been longing to dress. But which is more important. He's controlling and quite honestly, a little bit creepy, but although he's the centre of his universe and has the facade of strength, it's the women in his life who truly wield the power, be it by inspiration, organisation or retaliation to his cruelty. His sister Cyril, played by Lesley Manville is magnificent, part complimentary part adversary to Reynolds' pure art view of the world. Vicky Krieps as Alma isn't scared of him either, learning to go toe to toe. This though is a challenge that Reynolds isn't interested in. He craves control and their unorthodox relationship is destined for both misery and romance, as the slow pacing of the film accentuates a quiet, thoughtful rise and fall. It's a strange love story, but engaging none the less and Daniel Day Lewis is indeed excellent."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 January 2018,8/10,"I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this film to typical Americans, but will say, it would be worth it if you gave it a chance.
Because the nuance will fall on folks who want to be relieved of their lives. This film is about the social elite and their issues when it comes to a consumed artist. Most people who have made art as a profession will understand completely. The story is of a man who excelled at his craft and is forced to see the human in rough sketched lines. Does that sound interesting to people who've just stepped out of ""Jumanji""? Nope. But it is high art.
This film is artwork come to life which will fall on deaf ears of the general public who want a more visceral experience. This is atmosphere and mood. The details are exquisite and beautiful. Again, if your meals require you yell through a drive-thru squaw box, don't see this."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 March 2020,8/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a really underrated director. I loved his film Punch-Drunk Love and once again he's proven his skill as a top-notch filmmaker.Phantom Thread is about Reynolds Woodcock, a well renowned and respected dress designer, whose life changes after he meets Alma who becomes his lover.The world that Anderson creates in this film feels like it's out of an painting. The gorgeous setting and artistic background score makes the world of 1950s London feel as authentic as possible. Anderson's long time collaborator Jonny Greenwood crafts an elegant score filled with soothing piano music that brings a richness to the atmosphere. Anderson fills this film with stunning long takes accompanied with silence and writes an intriguing script that includes interesting characters and dialogues that doesn't lose your attention throughout.That's not all that's executed well because the performances are stellar. It's sad to see Daniel Day-Lewis retire from acting but at least he left with a BANG! Even after a five year gap, Day-Lewis proves to us why he's one of the best actors to ever live. He is perfect as Reynolds Woodcock. I don't think words can describe how good he is here. The best way is to just watch the film. Vicky Krieps is also terrific as Alma. Her relationship with Day-Lewis is really well done. There is one brilliant scene when both are having dinner alone where she fully shows her acting prowess. Another outstanding performer is Leslie Manville who also did a fantastic job.If there is one thing that bothered me, it was the ending. There is a very big risk that Anderson takes towards the end which will divide people and I'm not sure whether it worked for me.Despite that one issue, Phantom Thread is a beautiful movie with incredible cinematography, a superb score and an insane performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that makes you wish he would come out of retirement."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 February 2018,8/10,"Grade: A-Rating: R, 130 minutesIn a Nutshell: With gorgeous shots and images, this stylish film by Focus Features showcases glamour, fashion, romance, and a fantastic Daniel Day-Lewis. On June 20, 2017, Daniel Day-Lewis said that this is his last film, which would be a terrible loss to all of us. He's absolutely fantastic. As an added bonus, both Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville are equal to his performance.As of today, this interesting film has been nominated for 6 Academy Awards, including ""Best Picture."" It has already won the National Board of Review"" award for best original screenplay.
Tips for parents: Alma wears some sheer fabric that reveals her chest.
Quite a few F-bombs, but no other profanity.
Most children and teens will be bored out of their minds.
Pre-marital relations
Uplifting theme: ""It's comforting to think the dead are watching over the living. I don't find that spooky at all."" - Reynolds (Daniel Day-Lewis)
The give and take required in a relationship.
We are most tender and vulnerable when we're sick. In fact, director Paul Thomas Anderson got the idea for this film when he was sick in bed. His wife, comedienne Maya Rudolph, was taking care of him and he realized she hadn't looked at him with such love in a long time.
 
Things I liked:The musical score was noticeably beautiful. Johnny Greenwood's work really enhances the movie.
Incredible attention to detail. 
It's very subtle.
You think the movie is going in one direction, but then it surprisingly changes with one major choice by a character.
There are several interesting scenes where Woodcock illustrates that the dresses are not simply garments, but a lifestyle and that the wearer must earn the privilege of being seen in them.
It's fascinating to watch how Reynolds' sister and Alma handle his eccentricities in two entirely different ways.
The title refers to several things in the film. There is a ""phantom"" in Reynolds' life who serves as one of his muses. Reynolds sews secret messages and items into the clothing. And finally, the seamstresses who work for him all day and night get no glory, although they do most of the actual work.
Critics have mixed feelings about director Paul Thomas Anderson, but they all generally agree that he did a great job on this film, creating a meticulous movie with a surprising twist.
The dresses are beautiful. Supposedly, Reynolds' character was inspired by fashion designer Balenciaga. 
Daniel Day-Lewis was the one who suggested his character's name. It made director Paul Thomas Anderson laugh so hard that he used it. Together, they wrote the script.
Things I didn't like:It's slow moving.
It leaves you with an odd taste in your mouth...so to speak.
Interesting lines:Whatever you do, do it carefully."" - Alma (Vicky Krieps)
""There is an air of quiet death about this house and I do not like the way it smells."" - Mr. Woodcock
""The tea is going out. The interruption is staying right here with me."" - Mr. Woodcock"
PHANTOM THREAD,10 February 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread is meticulous and constant in its delve into the life of a great dressmaker of 1950s London. Day-Lewis and Krieps deliver two of the best performances of the year and keep you captivated the entire movie. The thematic considerations of how an internally driven, efficient, fastidious person coexists with a caring, intimate partner were well explored, and I felt their relationship was very well developed. All of the characters are very realistic, and the script, visuals, and especially score were all excellent. While it didn't blow me away, Phantom Thread nails what it's going for, with the knockout performances of Day-Lewis and Krieps leading the way."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 May 2021,7/10,"The film asks patience of the viewer to hold out while any sort of character, story, or drama is revealed. Once these do begin to unravel you are lured into a finicky world, a world that is rippled by a woman brought in by the master dress maker and a strange questionable romance begins. Watching a woman obsess on a man's every move, every word, every approval, is almost pitiful to watch, but it's also extremely dangerous messing with a person's emotions. I do not pretend to understand the ending, nor do I approve of it, I was hoping for something else entirely. Maybe one day I'll understand."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 January 2018,,"Daniel-Day Lewis is back as yet another obsessive, re-teaming with writer-director Paul Anderson to play Reynolds Woodcock, a soft-spoken, finicky, middle-aged fashion designer, strongly set in his ways, who in close collaboration with his sister runs a fashion house catering to celebrities and aristocrats in 1950s London. He has a habit of engaging young women as assistants and part-time models, then dropping them when they begin to chafe under his strict, undeviating daily routines. He finally meets his match in Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who attracts him upon first sight and whom he gradually grooms as a sort of factotum. His interest in Alma is wrapped up in an oft-referenced but never fully explained obsession with his late mother and primary professional mentor, an obsession shared in a different way by his sister Cyril (superbly and frostily played by Lesley Manville). Red herrings and unresolved mysteries abound. Anderson will point a character or a situation in a distinct direction only to change course unexpectedly, most notably in Cyril's behavior and utterances which seem to be leading one way - until they don't. The major unresolved mystery involves Alma who has no back story whatsoever, not a hint other than a German accent, all the more reason to be riveted by her every move, wondering if her motives will ever be revealed. The actress herself suggests at various times Kate Moss, Hannah Schygulla and Meryl Streep. The other two leads are equally compelling and inscrutable in their own way.Much screen time is devoted to small visual and aural details--ordering meals, buttering toast, chewing food, pouring tea, poking sewing needles through fabric, arranging objects, dressing and undressing. Some prickly verbal sparring around the breakfast table or during workaday routines beautifully and humorously captures the way familiars get on each other's nerves and start arguments over trifles, each feeding the flames. Jonny Greenwood's delicate, sometimes melancholy musical score perfectly complements the proceedings.In short, this is a unique film, unclassifiable, unsatisfying, uncomfortable, unforgettable. You can't pin it down, and you can't look away."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 January 2018,5/10,"Went to see this because of DDL and Anderson. As always, incredible job by DDL, and there was some unexpected humorous dialog, but frankly, we kept waiting for something to happen. Perhaps we were simply spoiled by 'There Will Be Blood' and were expecting the same dynamics in the personality of DDL's character here as well. But for us, the relationships were all a bit too mysterious. What was DDL's fascination with the waitress, or hers with him - what hold did the sister (if that's even who she was) have on him? How did the 'phantom thread' play any significance? Both my wife and I think 'Lincoln' would have been a far better movie for DDL to exit on. In 'Phantom Thread,' other than the poisoning, nothing very interesting happens, and even that was anti-climactic. 'Mysery,' which shares the basic plot of controlling a man by sickening (or crippling) him, was far more interesting."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,6/10,"Phantom Thread - This movie has incredible acting, cinematography, use of sound and musical score, beautiful costumes and style to it... BUT it's a painfully slow and boring drag from one awkward moment to another.. and another.. No likeable or even relatable characters either. I guess it might be enjoyable for someone really into fashion?"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 February 2020,8/10,"It wasn't a film about London in the swinging 60's, it wasn't an exposé about a troubled designer, it wasn't a twisted romantic thriller, it wasn't really any of these things, not entirely.What it was, however, was pure cinema.I will certainly need to watch it again to decide what I think about it. By far its worst quality is that its themes and messages, points and metaphor are buried so deep that I am almost sure they're buried beneath the newly carpeted floor of PT Anderson's cutting room. Phantom Thread is a film as much about what isn't explained or shown, than what is.Its best quality, however, is that it is magnetic, I watched behind the restricted view of a massive barnet in front of me and 10 minutes in I was absorbed as if I was inside the screen. It is a film that simply can't be guessed and each twist and turn is merely so normal that, that alone, is cause to throw you as an audience member.When it ended I thought two things: 1: Phantom Thread is by far the sharpest and funniest film I've seen in a long time, the actress playing Cyril deserves the highest praise available: that she manages to upstage Daniel Day Lewis' acting. And number 2: I just saw the kind of film where a director and an actor fuse together their fragility and their anxiety, the way they see themselves, the way others see them, and they open that nerve to the audience to be judged and hopefully redeemed. Is this a self-analysis to offer those PT Anderson has hurt on his way to global cinematic acclaim and respect? Is this an apology to Fiona Apple to explain the fallout of their relationship during the making of Magnolia?Or am I overthinking it, and is this just simply, one of the most deft, tight, apt and entertaining character studies of man and woman? Particularly engaged in duty and love together?"
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,8/10,"There is no simple way to describe Phantom Thread (2017). It is complex and multi-layered, with exquisite filming, extraordinary acting, and an engaging narrative. It is also deceptive. What appears to be a period drama of romance and high fashion is closer to a dark, double character study, wrapped in a psychological thriller, overlaid with a satire on haute couture.In 1950s London, the elegant House of Woodcock is where royalty and high society go for gowns made by revered fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day Lewis). He is an obsessive-compulsive personality type who needs complete control of everything around him. His career began by making his mother's wedding dress. Having never recovered from her death, he forever wants to create her image through his art. Sister and salon manager Cyril (Lesley Manvile) is the only person close to him and she wards off casual lovers as quickly as he tires of them. Young waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) is different: she is awkward, bold, perfectly formed, and he wants to possess her. She is soon absorbed into the House of Woodstock as model, muse, then wife in a tense relationship where each wants to control the other. Alma struggles to please Reynolds and Cyril's constant watch does not help. One day she learns about toxic mushrooms and stumbles upon a novel way to make Reynolds need her.At one level, the storyline is transparently simple; at another, it is an intricate portrait of two damaged people who progressively peel back each other's social and emotional disguise. Reynolds is manipulative, fastidious, and judgemental, but vulnerable and forever searching for a surrogate mother. Alma's innocent appearance hides her own calculated determination to find his weakness and turn it into dependence on her. Without knowing it, they are perfect for each other.The sumptuous cinematography dwells on the minutiae of this claustrophobic world: his love of fabric as a canvas for capturing beauty; his obsessiveness about how a meal should be presented; his revulsion at the slightest sound that intrudes into his space; and his disgust when unworthy women wear his creations. The camera tracks the shifting tension point of his overbearing dominance and her measured acquiescence in a sexless film that oozes repressed, even perverse, sexuality. Against this façade of fashion elevated to art, wealthy high-born women parade in Woodstock garments, radiating material beauty to mask their ugly selves.This is a film rich in thematic ambiguity that remains open to interpretation all the way to its twisted climax. Almas motives are left vague, and it is unclear if Reynolds is a subliminal cross-dresser, a neurotic artist, or a toxic bully looking for control through the world of high fashion. Regardless of how you read the film, the performances of Daniel Day Lewis and Vicky Krieps are mesmerising. At two hours and ten minutes, it could have achieved more impact with thirty minutes edited out, but not all will agree. That's a small complaint for a film that offers so much style and so much substance about so little.More reviews https://cinemusefilms.com"
PHANTOM THREAD,10 February 2018,9/10,"A luxurious movie set in the world of 1950s haut-couture, something I'd never have anticipated in a Paul Thomas Anderson film. Acted to perfection, beautifully written, designed and shot, with a pleasantly unnerving instability of genre: it's a romance, a thriller, a mystery, a comedy, a satire -- it's all of these. It boasts a comparatively conventional but nevertheless beautiful score from Jonny Greenwood. I can't wait to see it again."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 December 2020,2/10,"The fabric of our lives: oh, what a tangled web we weave.If only.If you're looking for something informative on an haute couture genius, search out a documentary on Yves Saint Laurent or Karl Lagerfeld; Reynolds Woodcock, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a very second rate couturier.If you're looking for something revelatory on ""the heart wants what the heart wants"", this is not the film you're looking for; you need to pray for a new hope.If you're still here, I'm not sure what you're going to get out of this film. It's very decompressed, especially the rather uneventful first hour. Reynolds Woodcock is a rather obnoxious character. Vicky Krieps, who plays Alma, looks so very much like an enervated (sic) Romola Garai. There's very little surface emotion until around one hour in, when things pick up a little; but it still stubbornly refuses to take flight. That's all folks."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 January 2018,,"There is no denying that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of visual, audio, direction and acting. And I'm pretty sure that ""Phantom Thread"" is going to receive nominations in some technical fields, such as costume, production design, hair & makeup, sound mixing, original score, cinematography and so on. The suspenseful direction of Anderson attracts the focus of the audience until the last minute, and Day-Lewis simply shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Nonetheless, the plot and the editing really makes me uncomfortable. On the one hand, the female protagonist Alma (Vicky Krieps) is nothing short of a bitch, displaying vanity and narcissism, behaving rather rude, making lots of noise, pursuing meaningless fun, and even poisoning her lover/husband Reynolds (Daniel Day-Lewis). It is just a shame that such a bitch did not receive any punishment. On the other hand, the change or the transition of the two protagonists are extremely strange and unnatural. It seems to me that one day Alma cares more about Reynolds, and on the next day she suddenly cares more about skiing, dancing, and social activities. The same thing happens to Reynolds. Maybe in the first minute he cannot stand the rudeness of Alma, and then in the second minute he unexpectedly says that he cannot live without her. Really bad editing."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 July 2018,10/10,"PHANTOM THREAD just annihilated me. It's completely worthy of all the immense hype (such as, most cinephiles considering it the best film of 2017). It grows and builds in as organic a manner that a film possibly can. At first, I wasn't sure how I felt - I needed to get to know the characters, then, through most of the movie, I was cracking up at all the tension and the misery between them, then, by the last 10 minutes, I was in tears - a flow of tears which increased each minute as I processed the power and uniqueness and realness of what I had just witnessed. They were ""profound"" tears. I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that so tastefully glamorizes the toxicity of love. The poison that so many of us romanticize, the poison that we NEED in our lives. There are two types of people in the world: people who feel at home in perfectly ""healthy"" relationships, and then there's the rest of us. This film is for the rest of us. It stands in a league of it's own. I could never have expected the conclusion - the way that the ribbon is tied, the way the final thread is sewn. It hit me like a bag of bricks. It is all of the pain in love and all of the beauty, all at once. I have never seen this story told before. It's completely original, and completely shattering. The three leads are absolutely astonishing - Daniel Day Lewis and Lesley Manville are terrifying - Vicky Krieps is the most real. The writing and directing is impeccable - P.T. Anderson's legacy continues, it's fire burning brighter than ever. Yes, this is a masterpiece. I am dead."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 May 2021,4/10,"Yes, this is the final film to feature Daniel Day-Lewis - let's get that out of the way. He is surely a talented actor, and his portrayal of a 1950s London fashion designer fits on the rack alongside his other Oscar-nominated roles. That said, 'Phantom Thread' suffers from incredible dullness.Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Thread' really is the DDL show, as everyone in his orbit - from Reynolds Woodcock's sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) to his live-in model/assistant/girlfriend Alma (Vicky Krieps) - plays second fiddle. Woodcock's quirks and mannerisms are as complex as the dresses he designs, not to mention his relationships. The (mostly) non-romantic throuple he's at the center of is peculiar, and the drama caused by mixed messages is interesting. But 'Thread' suffers from pretentiousness, lack of self-awareness and general boredom.Sure, Lewis will be regarded as one of the best to ever act, but that does not mean every film he stars in should automatically be regarded so highly. 'Phantom Thread' is an overindulgence that exemplifies what happens when self-obsession gets in the way."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 February 2018,10/10,"I lay in bed for some time this morning tossing about in my mind how best to convey the impact of Phantom Thread. I've only got one shot at this and I don't want to tarnish my impression by getting all luvvie about it, or resorting to my overused canon of superlatives. I will try therefore to create a picture that captures my sense of wonder as I sat in Edinburgh's Cameo cinema last night watching the masters at work; those masters being Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis.If, as is rumoured, we are never to see Day-Lewis on our screens again this should be cause for mourning because the man has no peer - he has won three of his leading actor Oscars (from 5 nominations) and this is his sixth. There's a reason for that.In Phantom Thread, Day-Lewis is caressed by PTA's quite stunning camerawork (not only did he write and direct the movie, he is its cinematographer to boot) in a way that is usually reserved for leading ladies. (Darren Aranofsky was accused of overdoing so in his fine Mother! with his muse and real life partner Jennifer Lawrence last year.) But that's because it's as if PTA is trying to squeeze every ounce of juice out of Day-Lewis's colossal performance. It's hardly surprising because Day-Lewis takes craggy, older man, handsomeness to a new scale (he was 60 during filming).He plays a 1950's London based couturier with a client list of Royalty and society movers and shakers. Clinically obsessed with quality this makes him mildly sociopathic and he is certainly 'on the scale'. He's kept in check by an icy protector - his sister Cyril: an aloof Lesley Manville, in a career-defining-performance in which she constantly reminded me of Anna Massey's Mrs Danvers in Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca - the TV adaptation from 1979.Day-Lewis's personal tics, foibles, routine, sense of decorum and inner sociopathic tendencies simmer just below, occasional breaching, the surface for the entire two and a bit hours of this masterful performance and represent a case study in containment. For my money this is by far and away a superior acting achievement than Gary Oldman's, show-stealing, Winston Churchill impersonation in the downright boring and turgid Darkest Hour. His confirmed bachelorhood, devotion (or certainly commitment) to his sister and a necessary effeteness, in keeping with his status as a master dressmaker, suggest initially that Day Lewis's character, Reynolds Woodcock, is assuredly homosexual. But this is quickly dispelled upon a weekend trip to 'the country' in a humorously 'overcranked' road trip to Whitby in a gorgeous burgundy Bristol 405.In his lodgings Woodcock meets, and immediately invites to dinner, the breakfast waitress who quickly becomes his lover and muse, thereby dispelling any homosexuality theories. Alma, a European girl, of indistinct national origin (although actress Vicky Krieps is from Luxembourg) is sweet, defiantly 'un beautiful' in the classic flimstar definition, with breasts that are 'too small' and a face that has a rugged outdoors sensitivity. She soon matches Day-Lewis for lingering camera sweeps as the movie settles into a slow thesis on what becomes a complex power struggle of a relationship; in which Cyril makes three.Krieps is surprisingly missing from most awards shortlists which amazes me because she is no third best in this tremendous acting menage. Her performance is spare and engrossing and she trades punches all the way with both Day-Lewis and Manville.Silk, organza and lace also feature lovingly in a pean to the craftsmanship of dressmaking. Indeed, such was PTA and DDL's attention to detail that PTA hired seamstresses rather than actors to play the boutique roles, and DDL learned to sew, making his wife a dress, in his classic method practice.Sitting high in the credits, and rightly so, is Production Designer Mark Tildesley, because he creates a sense of place that marks this is a classic period drama. This is aided and abetted by the extraordinary film grain that PTA elects to use, to further enhance Tildesley's sense of place (if not time - not time because movies of that era would be either super saturated colour or black and white, the film grain he employs is redolent, instead, of amateur photography of the period).And lastly, I have to make mention of the extraordinary score by Jonny Greenwood. Nothing could be further from his Radiohead work. It is classically styled with nods to Chopin in particular and underscores the movie almost throughout. This adds a sense of wonder so some of the slower, more crafted, scenes where action is at a premium. All in all this has reinstated Paul Thomas Anderson as my favourite director after his one career slip with the abysmal Inherent Vice. It sits alongside Punch Drunk Love, Magnolia, There will be Blood and The Master as film making of craft and distinction.I sat with mouth agape, grinning like a 50's child watching a box set of Disney, for much of the film, in sheer wonderment at the genius that is Paul Thomas Anderson.It is not to be missed, although, be warned, it moves along at a pace that could best be described as languid."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 September 2018,8/10,"While there are movies out there unserious about filmmaking, there are some rare gems like the extraordinary Phantom Thread movie that is the exact opposite.

PHANTOM THREAD,27 February 2018,9/10,"A film-oriented feature film, Paul Thomas Anderson in his new slow-moving, unattractive plot film captures the viewer in the beauty of driving, with a handsome costuming and soundtrack, not to mention the marvelous performances. With a script that draws little attention, showing the life, success and strong personality of a famous designer of the fifties, the whole writing part is handled by Daniel Day Lewis, but it does not mean that the script is bad, on the contrary, its driving and character development are great, its touching unpredictability, and its beautiful nuances, only its plot itself is not great. The film is a novel with painted madness, it is a love story between mother and son, and all its peculiarities, besides dealing with platonic love, submission, egocentrism and, mainly, solitude. Unlike other films by Paul Thomas Anderson, here we are not charmed by photography, much because of almost no external shots, but this is offset in the direction of art, composition of scenery, light, makeup and costumes are spectacular, the film had everything to be slow and dull, but to assemble the band with a very good rhythm, and especially, the soundtrack, the soundtrack here is perfect, besides guiding the whole movie, conducting scenes, developing characters and assisting in the rhythm of film, the soundtrack works as a character of its own, enchanting and holding the viewer to the long, as well as being a beautiful trail. Daniel Day Lewis again gives a show, it is as if the actor were lost inside his character, leaner, old, with posture and unique expressions, the actor completely steals the film and already has his hand in his best acting oscar room , Lesley Manville is also wonderful. Finally, Paul Thomas Anderson hits it all and brings us a great movie that reminds us of the pure essence of cinema."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 June 2018,6/10,"The match-up of Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis last time in ""There Will Be Blood"" was a modern classic. The screen presence of Lewis and the epic photography by Anderson's cinematographer created an award-winning experience. The story was for sure profound but as a period piece was both entertaining and educational. There is no comparison of the bravado of the character Daniel Plainview that Lewis occupied in TWBB and the repressed dress designer Reynolds Woodcock. Woodcock's OCD is the source of interest for this screenplay, and subsequently how it bludgeons any possible open relationship with anyone in his life. Even though there is a potential draw to seeing life in the 50s in London, the film rarely leaves Woodcock's quarters where he endlessly is scribbling on a notepad. So as a period piece, we only really get a glimpse of the fashion of the period, not much else. The movie centers around an empty relationship between Woodcock and a beautiful woman that he brings back to London as though he is adding her to his collection. The movie rarely shows any attempts to explore each other's feelings. Our reaction as the audience is to be turned off by Woodcock as a dysfunctional partner who hides himself in his work in order to not confront problems with his relationship. Vicky Krieps as Alma, becomes lost in her reality, wanting to be the girl by the side of the sophisticated older man. Relishing in the jealously of the other girls around her. Woodcock's business partner is someone who oversees all of Woodcock's personal and business matters. She has a scene that resembles a similar moment in ""The Master"" where Amy Adams, the wife of a powerful and charismatic leader, scolds him when he fails to obey her wishes. There is a by-the-numbers quality to the film that matches Woodcock's personality, and the movie's slow deterioration of his dull relationship with Alma didn't really captivate me. There is an unexpected outcome in the third act that really goes against Woodcock's character, and for me didn't really ring as true. If anything, it was Woodcock and Alma mutually deciding to pretend that their problems can be magically resolved by feigning a fresh new chapter in their relationship. Forget it, we know that Woodcock is married to his work, and his repressed personality needs years of therapy, not a moment of revelation. I also didn't care for the movie clocking in over two hours, since this movie had such a small scope. The greatest allure, the production and costume design, did not rise above the material. I would say that Anderson as a director achieved exactly what he wanted with this film, but the nature of the story can only go so far, and is a less compelling than his other films. I waited for the DVD to see this film, and felt justified skipping it in the theatre. I give a 6 out of 10 as an interesting character study, but little else."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 July 2021,10/10,"Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017's Phantom Thread marks something of a departure for him, since it's his first film set and filmed in England. It's also a period drama and romance, but whilst it might seemingly have little in common with his previous films, it soon becomes apparent that it bears familiar Anderson themes, notably the use of deeply flawed protagonists.Phantom Thread stars Daniel Day-Lewis as dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock, who designs and makes dresses for the rich and famous in 1950s London. The financial side of his business is run by his formidable sister Cyril, whilst he focuses on his craft. He is precise, obsessive and emotional repressed, easily angered and unsettled by any disruption to his routine or distraction from his desire to perfection in his work. Disruption and distraction soon appear in the comely form of Vicky Krieps' Alma Elson, a waitress whom Reynolds takes first as his model and then as his lover. Everything seems set for a traditional romance, with bumps along the road to happiness, but being an Anderson film it isn't that simple.Phantom Thread is all about control. Reynolds is obsessed with control, retrieving a dress from a client whose behaviour he thinks doesn't deserve it, dictating the circumstances under which his breakfast must be served and eaten, and often treating her as a mannequin. Day-Lewis thoroughly immerses himself in the role, conveying just how distressed Reynolds becomes by anything that threatens his concentration and - as Alma discovers - surprises. He's pedantic, egocentric and frequently obnoxious as a result; it's hard to see what Alma sees in him. But then it eventually becomes apparent that she's just as controlling: when she poisons him in a moment of anger and then nurses him to recovery, he emerges from his delirium with a desire to marry her; when the marriage starts to fail, she poisons him again, with his knowledge this time, bluntly telling him that she wants him weak and dependent on her. Faced with the promise of such total control, his domineering personality is rendered utterly submissive. It's a brilliantly disturbing ending to the film that is entirely in keeping with Anderson's previous blackly comic - if deadpan - cinematic back-catalogue.The film is recognisable Anderson in another way too: his direction has become unmistakeable. Every element of the film drips quality, including the casting: Day-Lewis is an actor whose talent threatens to overshadow that of his co-stars, but Krieps more than holds her own, going from sweet and endearing to disturbingly controlling with great ease and conviction. Lesley Manville is equally convincing as the frosty and tirelessly efficient Cyril. The film is as precisely woven as Reynold's dresses: one expects Anderson's mise-en-scéne to be highly polished and with meticulous attention to detail, and it comes as no surprise that in a film about a dressmaker the costumes are particularly carefully crafted.The location filming in England - mostly in North Yorkshire and partly in the Cotswolds and London - is gorgeous. Nobody is credited as cinematographer; whilst describing it as ""a collaborative effort"", Anderson seems to have largely fulfilled the role. The film, shot on 35mm film stock, has what Anderson describes as ""theatrical haze"", which at times helps to create an almost dreamlike aesthetic. The use of close ups reflects the fastidiousness of Reynolds. Anderson's characteristic use of moving cameras results in some fluidly dynamic shots, put to good use when Reynolds' dresses are being modelled. The final flourished is provided by a perfectly-pitched soundtrack from Jonny Greenwood, collaborating with Anderson for the fourth time. Superficially, Phantom Thread does not seem typical of Anderson, but examine the stitching closely and it is unmistakeably his handiwork."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 January 2018,6/10,"There is an unsettling disquiet that runs throughout Phantom Thread. It's sewn into the film's every narrative twist, as power balances shift and infatuation bleeds into something darker. It's lodged firmly in the way characters gain and lose sympathy over time, as they (and their motives) constantly shift in and out of the light. It's present in every frame - most of which manage to intrigue and alienate, all at once. In other words, Phantom Thread is a quintessential Paul Thomas Anderson film: a gripping psychological study that will strike some as delightful, and others as depraved. At first glance, the film pays troubling tribute to the debilitating genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' Reynolds Woodcock. One of 1950s London's top haute couture designers, Reynolds is so good at what he does that all kinds of excuses and exceptions are made for him, particularly by the women in his orbit. Cyril (Lesley Manville), his sister, efficiently manages his life and his whims, making sure that anything that might upset him is swiftly removed from his immediate environment. He acquires new muses as easily as he inevitably discards them - a grim fate that seems to await Alma (Vicky Krieps), a charming waitress whom Reynolds sweeps into his world of high fashion.So far, so casually misogynistic. For much of its first act, the film feels like a bitter, twisted take on Pygmalion - a younger woman is forced to accommodate the eccentricities of an older man who lives and thrives in a cocoon of his own worth, wealth and privilege. Take a scene set at the Woodcock breakfast table: Alma's buttering of a slice of toast proves too jarring for Reynolds' delicate sensibilities. At a cultural moment in time defined by the #MeToo and Time's Up movements, it's hard not to think about issues like gender power imbalances and male entitlement when Alma first enters Reynolds' rigid household.But, then, the film shifts gears. Alma, in her own way, pushes back against what is expected of her - both by Reynolds and the audience. She questions his choice of fabric. She decides to surprise a man who clearly does not appreciate the element of surprise, planning a romantic meal that leads to the most aggressive consumption of asparagus you'll ever see on screen. Suddenly, the tables are turned - or are they? As Alma and Reynolds continue dancing a deadly dance that's laced with as much attraction as resentment, right and wrong and black and white fade into too many shades of grey. The trouble is that the film never quite makes a move for the heart. It's clever, and dark, and almost proudly perverse in its exploration of this match made in somewhere other than heaven. Anderson expertly allows tension to creep into every corner of Reynolds and Alma's 'love' story. But the film treats its own story and characters with such a chilly, cynical detachment that it's hard to care all that much when the proverbial (and literal!) shit hits the fan. More frustratingly, we've seen it all before. Anderson has already asked audiences to dive with him into the psyches of two characters who are as much man as monster: The Master's Lancaster Dodd and There Will Be Blood's Daniel Plainview. Phantom Thread's Reynolds Woodcock is cut very much from the same cloth. To be fair, Reynolds' future and fate - unlike those of Lancaster and Daniel - are tied, quite firmly, to the women in his life. That immediately opens the film and its power dynamics up to plausible, if not particularly inspiring, feminist interpretations. Even so, Phantom Thread is ultimately all about Reynolds. The female characters are interesting, sure, but they also exist primarily to shed light (or darkness) on Reynolds - who he is, and how that will shape what he'll become. That being said, Phantom Thread is never less than a gripping watch, and much of that is down to Anderson's superlative cast. As can be expected, Day-Lewis plays Reynolds on a masterful sliding scale, going from charming to sinister and back again, while hitting every note in between. It's a rich, committed performance, if not quite as dazzling as you might hope for from what Day-Lewis claims is his swan song. Krieps more than holds her own as Alma, somehow radiating innocence and malice, often in the same breath. It's Manville who steals the show, however; her ever-present Cyril is an intriguing creation, her deference to her brother never fading into a lack of agency.In truth, there's a great deal to appreciate about Phantom Thread. Anderson knows just how to deploy everything at his disposal - a top-notch cast, Jonny Greenwood's stunning score, and the gorgeous London period setting - to create a mesmerising cinematic experience. But, as exquisitely crafted as the film is, it's becoming harder with each successive Anderson opus to shake the feeling that he's just treading familiar ground - that he's fast running out of things to say about hard, horrible (white) men who are drowning, sometimes quite happily, in their own toxic masculinity."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 August 2021,7/10,"""Phantom Thread"" is a sober and elegant film whose austerity hides a great deal of complexity. Paul Thomas Anderson's sophisticated filmmaking is now focused on the untold, with details like colors, small objects, sounds, subtle gestures, and glances being as important as the dialogues to understand the nuances of his storytelling.Despite the film being the analysis of a twisted and toxic relationship characterized by emotional dependency, self-centeredness, dominance and mother complex, the tone is usually warm and gentle, as if it was a classic romantic comedy with Hitchcockian glimpses. It's an interesting experiment from one of our generation's most capable directors, but unfortunately felt a bit too distant and unengaging on an emotional level. I know it's a highly unpopular opinion, but I was not particularly fond of the two leads."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2021,9/10,"Reynold Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a celebrity couturier for whom life is all about work and a certain self-imposed discipline that's a routine. He lives in 1950's London with his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) who is quite similar to him. Egotistical, self-centric, fastidious and downright rude, Reynold runs into Alma (Vicky Krieps), a simple waitress in a countryside inn who turns into his muse, model and lover. So far so good, but problems start surfacing soon as Alma isn't one to be bullied into subjugation. She speaks her mind and questions her existence & role in his life as he refuses to partake in her modifications to his lifestyle. So will Reynold once again tire of his latest muse and banish her from his life, or will Alma be able to turn the tide? It's a true battle between supremacy and an iron-will that will change lives and establish new rules.Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant in his portrayal of cynicism with the legendary British characteristics of dry humour, a stiff upper lip and breakfast table fussing over distraction to his attention. But it's Vicky Krieps who competes with total elan as the commoner who won't cow down to his meanness. She is courageous, composed, self-conscious, determined yet simplicity personified. Paul Thomas Anderson's scripting and direction are laudable. This is Oscar winning material indeed."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 April 2021,4/10,"Phantom Thread has many positives; the acting cannot be faulted, visually it is very easy on the eye, and audio is heavily used in its favour. But my word what an unbelievably dull film. The plot is non-existent, yes you are following a quirky (dislikeable) character and seeing him progress (through very little), but to no end. Constant build up to absolutely nothing. Longs periods of talk about nothing leading to a silence. If you focus of course there are tons of tiny things you can build up about the entire film, but that doesn't make it enjoyable in the slightest. Posh people getting upset by barely showing emotion is hardly relatable for an audience either. I can understand why many are calling this pretentious, yes there's a deeper level throughout but that doesn't make a good film."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 December 2017,6/10,"I simply didn't know what the point was. I got that Lewis was a perfectionist and an artist. But a very dysfunctional man who could not maintain a regular relationship.Then he suddenly thrusts himself into another relationship? Or was it? Or not? The ""love at first sight"" aspect between the two of them rang phony.A big problem was that the role was based on a gay man, but what was depicted was (I guess) a hetrosexual man.Was not really too sure what role Krieps was filling for him. Sure seemed like a relationship, by and large. And there was some growth to it.But Krieps' motivations were awfully vague. Did like where she felt pretty being dressed by Lewis. But for him, why her? I felt I was told that there was something there between the two, but nothing showed me that. He was admirable in his achievements and interesting in his disfunction. Her? Nothing but some regular person.I really also didn't feel respect for her as it degenerated to her blind love for a man that had no love for her. And very creepy (and many daddy issues) due to the age difference between the two (31 years in real life). What is it with Hollywood in saying that there are no relevant women older than 35?Her poisoning him was a sad turn for the character but did develop into an interesting sequence of change. Something she couldn't have known would happen. I kept thinking she was trying to kill the part of him she didn't like. But then his unraveling after the marriage was phony and broke with the tone.Conversely his knowingly and willingly eating the poison mushrooms was an interesting turn, albeit one that was too little, too late. But I did guess it before he sat down and she confessed.Just a couple hours of very good acting and moody scenes that tried to wring out some sort of ""love story"" that just wasn't there. (And it won The National Board of Review award for best original screenplay? Huh?)"
PHANTOM THREAD,10 March 2018,5/10,"A tale of obsession and strange love set in the 1950s London. A dressmaker (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his sister (Lesley Manville) are at the center of local fashion world, dressing royalty, movie stars, heiresses etc.Women come and go through his life, providing the confirmed bachelor with inspiration, until he comes across a young, strong-willed woman (Vicky Krieps), who becomes his muse and lover.Confession time: I love the idea of screenwriter-director Paul Thomas Anderson making movies in general... but the last one of his that I enjoyed and thought I understood was 2002's ""Punch Drunk Love"".The next four, including ""Phantom Thread"" are just... I don't know what. Exercises in style, that's for sure, and technically very well realized at that, but what style? What is he trying to achieve? Can't understand, nor relate.Hoping to find out, I read some reviews after, from famous publications and everything, but they didn't seem to know the answers either. Everybody was using fancy terms such as ""strange but mesmerizing"" and writing about the plot at some length - always a sign that reviewer does not find much to say, even if s/he liked the film.So... it's an exercise in style, mostly visually because story doesn't carry nearly the same weight as the way everything is presented on screen.PTA wants to show how genius and madness (not being able to function in ""normal"" world) are often closely related, and there's an intriguing back story to dressmaker's life supporting that, but there's not enough content to achieve a real dramatic punch.""Phantom Thread"" would probably work well as a shorter work lasting about 15-20 minutes. But at 131 minutes, the endless mechanical repeating of the same situation, emotion, moment just wore me down. It was never boring or mediocre, it wasn't. It just mostly never evolves. Mostly.The acting is great all around, simple, sure and elegant, always concentrating on the emotion of the moment. All three leads - Day-Lewis, Manville, and Krieps - would deserve an Oscar nom in principle but only the first two got it.There's no point in discussing what makes the performances so great because they are closely tied to - or should I say, central part of - PTA's style, pieces in his great puzzle called ""Phantom Thread"". Let's just say it's a solid farewell for Day-Lewis who has announced retiring from acting (again).There's a lot to be admired about how ""Phantom Thread"" was made: how it looks, how exactly it's shot, the acting. But I can't say I really liked the movie. The admiration stayed purely on the intellectual level. All in all, it feels just exhausting.But I am in minority here. Critics at Rotten Tomatoes have given it 91/100, Metacritic 90/100. It's been nominated for six Oscars, including best picture, director, actor (Day-Lewis), supporting actress (Manville), music, costume design."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,3/10,There comes a point in this film when you want one of the characters to murder one of the others. You know it will never happen as this whole venture is a clunky depiction of the narcissist-co-dependent dance. It fails on a number of fronts to get this dynamic true to form whilst needing it to carry the story. What the screenplay said in print clearly does not come over very well with the writer also directing. This film needs a better eye for visual story making than you'll find here. There is just one stunningly outstanding portrayal and that is provided by Lesley Manville as the sister of the 'great man'. The tailoring/sewing however is a complete joke. A miss in my view.
PHANTOM THREAD,12 June 2018,10/10,"If this is truly Daniel-Day Lewis' last film, it was definitely one to go out on. I can see why Lewis felt the way he did about the character, from his interviews, as Reynolds Woodcock is such an idiosyncratic character, full of so much sadness and love. A character one could lose themselves into and go into a deep depression over. It's understandable where Lewis is coming from. That being said, what an amazing love story interwoven with extraordinary acting, stunning costumes, a sensational music score and an astounding direction. A film which relates to life in all aspects from head to toe and delivers on all of those peculiar feelings we have in the sane and bizarre. One of Paul Thomas Anderson's best, if not his best. Was very pleasantly surprised at how funny this film also was. Funny because of who the characters are and how they react to everything. A must see!!!"
PHANTOM THREAD,28 December 2020,9/10,"So annoyed I missed phantom thread in cinemas, would have loved to have seen it in 70mm.I loved it, it's my favourite Paul Thomas Anderson film at this stage, although I'll have to re-watch there will be blood to confirm.It's clear that love and care went into the making of this film. The production design sends you back in time to 1950's London, this is only reinforced by the use of dialect of the period.Reynolds Woodcock and Alma Elson are written to perfection, along with the rest of the film, and they are performed incredibly well by two incredible performers. I found that I exhibit a lot of similar behaviours as Reynolds which I find extremely interesting and something I would love to look into more, to get a better understanding of the film and myself.The almost constant and at times piecing score by Jonny Greenwood was fantastic, it was stuck in my mind for days. The cinematography is beautiful even without a DOP, but my favourite element is the relationship between Reynolds and Alma, it's so nuanced and disturbing. It's not often a film has a genuinely phenomenal score and it's not my favourite element."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 February 2020,8/10,"Phantom Thread is a great story about illness. When I say illness, I don't refer to disease, I refer to the volatility of the human brains.This movie shows a man that is preoccupied more by his work and reputation than anything else. the main character is portrayed by the well-known Daniel-Day, almost every character portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis is well-written.The relation between the characters is very complex, I think that it is similar to roller-coaster except that in this movie, you don't know how it will end. Sometimes to character are in love with each others, and others time they ignore the other one.It is hard to explain without any spoiler, but this is a great romance drama where you see that in love everything is not fantastic, and sometimes there are downhills."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 February 2018,3/10,"A film about an obsessive, or complete solipsistic personality, is not a typical movie and this one doesn't help itself. In addition the dialog writing is so bland as to be a bromide of mundane stupefaction. It's not a code for some deeper meaning: we're talking about sewing but it's really about lust. The key scene is when our intense and precious hero has a prissy fit about butter and asparagus. The drama; the human conflict; the emotion; the utter poverty of decent writing on display is enough to kill the movie right there. It's also quite ridiculous. The film looks ravishing and the photography is quite engaging but long sequences of women wearing clothes and fussy rich folks is not sufficient. In this time of inequality who cares an iota for some old woman who spend loads of money on a big frock? The less said about the Pygmalion aspect of the story the better. It's outright creepy and old fashioned. This is a very strange movie to make at this time and far too self regarding. If it had been better written by a novelist it might have made an effect but as it is, this is a failed yet striving grasp for a mature piece of film making."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 May 2018,9/10,"His newest piece of art, which aspired to six Oscars without any surprises, wickedly slips through the 1950's day-to-day characters of Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, and Lesley Manville: a close-minded designer, his faithful and inseparable sister-assistant and his new wife and muse. What the director and screenwriter - two in one - communicates through the aesthetics of his storytelling comprises more than a mind can get caught in one fell swoop, as it displays a dazzling commentary about loving relationships and how they can destroy each other or construct each other. As expected, the only thing our characters will swim against the tide, creating an inhabitable environment where subjugation, confrontations, and madness build a fatality barrier. The script seems at risk, habitual coming from him, as it touches on matters that unfortunately come at the worst time, and it was one of the main hindrances the film had to handle. With revolutionary feminist movements which emphasize women importance and equality with respect to the male genre, a lot of movies have been made as a criticism of undeniable power about their proficiency to tell really unique and forceful stories, making it clear that from here on out many actresses will discard inferior roles, where women must be behind a man. Precisely this is what we can capture about the film at first sight, because Alma, Vicky Krieps' character, must endure the constant psychological abuse by her husband, however, those who give a chance to the story will leave the theatre as enchanted and excited as me. The story never gets caught in muddy matters as giving a vengeful and righteous attitude to the unsubmissive lady, giving her a voice to express what goes through her mind, to express how the relationship is getting her to fly off the handle and in the end, inexplicably, how it manages to transform her. The storytelling structure fits with the tone perfectly as a kind of retrospective interview, as Pablo Larraín did in ""Jackie"", Alma relates in detail her state of life before, during and in the present alongside the renowned and afflicted fashion designer, while at the same time introduces subtle but effective comments on the capitalist world, the toxic desire for success, the inability to love or the ability to hurt and accept a poisoned heart.It's time to say goodbye, Daniel Day-Lewis has bestowed one of the most forceful, intoxicating and electrifying interpretations of his career for his fervent followers, the definitive show of one of the real egregious artists of the last century. There is no problem that many prefer to remember him for the American-historical character who gave him his last Academy Award, ""Lincoln"" by Steven Spielberg, others - like me - for his more than 30 courageous works as an actor, literally getting under the skin of every one of his cathartics and peculiar characters. Well-spoken Reynolds Woodcock is who concludes his filmography, the designer by which the British actor had to undergo a hard preparation process in order to portray with honesty and truthfulness the unspoken pain and personal demand of a man who can only fall in love with his threads. Although from a personal point of view, Day-Lewis doesn't have the leading role in the film, this man gives a stellar performance, that solemnity before an imminent bitterness embellishes the character with a required apathetic, expressionless and dictatorial personality; it's a dramatic range of such a high caliber that, for example, in the discussion at the table, several spectators felt a true anger, nothing implanted, the rage and displease was perceived by a woman of ""bad"" customs that all she wanted was to truncate his pacific stability. Introspective and disturbing, this controlling fashion designer will be captivated in my mind for a long, long time; a character to analyze. It was a huge surprise to hear about the nomination the Academy gave Lesley Manville thanks to her role as the nosy and demurely envious Cyril, a character that, although is important for the development of the central conflict and shows the unspeakable talent of the actress, never gets to stay the necessary time on screen to justify tremendous recognition. Perhaps, the truly inexplicable thing is that, even if she performs a restrained and applaudable work, the real laurels and props should go to Vicky Krieps, because it's such the scope of her interpretation that the scenes in which both ladies share screen are pure fire. Turning to the matter in hand, Krieps is the absolute femme-fatale of the film. Her powerhouse performance is rebellious and caustic, emotional and fun when she should, never melodramatic; each line of the screenplay comes out delicately from her mouth, using as means a character who doesn't want to lose freedom at the expense of an unsolicited recognition and toxic love. Her mocking, anti-real behavior, where modesty, reverence, and formality aren't vital stuff, becomes the actress's interpretation into another golden achievement that contributes to the impending women renaissance in cinema. It's a shame that very few have recognized her priceless effort, but it is here where the true value of a good performance is, in accepting that although the industry doesn't consider worthy of recognizing her work, the audience applauds, she has an amazing future ahead of her.And of course, the visual section leaves anyone speechless. A close-up, the camera slowly moves away from Alma's face, who, tranquil, narrates how unconditional and true was her love for the designer. Having as a background an incandescent bonfire coloring her skin of a crackling orange lost in blackness, it's how opens one of the most aesthetic and brilliantly crafted movies I have seen on the big screen. With pieces of art such as ""The King's Speech"", ""Darkest Hour"", ""The Theory of Everything"" or even ""Paddington"" as a benchmark, it's almost clear that, visually, a Europe-set film must enclose an elegant and carefully designed wrap. However, the tape is not explicitly conceived by European hands, as the production companies are recognizably American, Universal Pictures and its indie film division Focus Features, denoting the different views that were part of the creation of an aesthetically organic experience that defends the vices of British film perfectionism but also the eccentricity and unusual imagery of Yankee minds. Obviously, it's primarily Mark Tildesley's production design that jumps out at you, which facilitates the staging of a discredited cinematographer who, without expecting, turns out to be the one who directs and writes, a man who truly put, soul, mind and heart to a memorable work. All Anderson's art crew (make-up, costume, hairstyle, set decorators and department derivatives) performs an unusual milestone for the genre, because it's such the grace of each dress, the delicacy of each fashion show, the care of each decoration that this experience becomes serious, though, I had never liked so much to suffocate me in that way. The colors of the landscapes, the textures of the dresses, the coincidence of the elements and the setting allow the construction of scenes that now are in my mind, without intention of leaving. Among the endless delicacy of vintage beauties, There are specifically two with which I'll remember the film: the first défilé de mode in which Alma models a gorgeous dress, a phenomenal and impossible to improve moment; and Woodcock looking for his wife at the New Year's Party, the fall of the multicolored balloons is a feat and an artistic gift full of love for cinema.Jonny Greenwood, the filmmaker's loyal squire, composed one of his best scores for a director's film. It's great to hear in almost all the scenes, some type of composition, either secondary or primary, of course, defending the tone of the moment it is being placed, highlighting the constant use of grinding sounds. Slow, soft but sharp, this score combines perfectly the wit and delicacy of the moves, a fabulous success. Generally, I don't focus too much on the sound design of a movie, although I inconsistently keep an eye in each aspect, however, the excellent sound edition of this work refined my senses and I focused on this detailed feature. The scenes in which Alma was not aware of her noise, causing the discontent and distraction of her husband were the perfect material to show me, every blow of the spoon over the eggshell, every asparagus in the mouth of the diners, the preparation of the foodstuff (with butter), the mushroom hunting, the rubbing of glasses, the sound of the teapot, the creaking of the food, the slipping of the butter on the bread, every little aspect, especially at the table, made it necessary to highlight the neat work of sound editing, simply at another level.Shockingly beautiful, interestingly touching and caustically moralizing, ""Phantom Thread"" by Paul Thomas Anderson is an intense trip through the damaging relationship of two human beings consumed by hate and love, a story which you will only be willing to enjoy if you know the characteristics and constraints of the works from this warhorse. Laying on the table again the importance of women at any time, age and context, the film acts as a treatment to current global issues such as love martyrdoms, marital conflicts, abuse and human reaches. With an invaluable interpretation of Vicky Krieps and an emotional and sublime farewell to acting of a giant, the film benefits from the onerous and elegant high-class visuals and a passive-aggressive narrative to deliver an absorbing story, with dimensions of perfectionism as exquisite as those of the protagonist, with whom, from a personal point of view, the director/writer raises a representation of his own story; his films are the refined, detailed and tantalizing dresses."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 February 2021,8/10,"A weird but touching love story with tremendous performances by the cast. The photography feels strange early on, maybe because of the aspect ratio but really becomes fabulous once you're used to it. Great music, great acting, great visuals, everything is there."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,2/10,"Having seen this last night, and two other films by Paul Thomas Anderson, I am convinced that he is a reptilian and a misanthrope, too boot. His characters are cruel, selfish, sadistic, amoral or a combination thereof. The sequence with Barbara Rose (a stand-in for Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton) in this twisted ""Pygmalion"" (that whirring sound you hear is George Bernard Shaw spinning in his grave!) is the perfect example of Anderson's truly-vile nature: the ""hero"" and ""heroine"" not only do not give a whit for their obviously-miserable client, after she passes out at her wedding, they decide that she does not ""deserve"" to wear the gorgeous gown they made (and she paid for!). They go to her hotel room, and demand the gown back. After the lady's lady companion balks (understandably), the ""heroine"" storms into Barbara's boudoir and strips it off of her -- an act which gives her and the ""hero"" a sexual charge! Karl-Otto and Ilse Koch had nothing on these two!But things really kick into ""high gear"" when Ilse, sorry, Alma, discovers the joy of poisoned mushrooms: you can slice them; dice them; crush them; fry them in lots of butter. Oh, and you can use them to make the man you love deathly-ill to get back at him for raking you over the coals over how you cooked the asparagus! Now, you'd think the ""my girlfriend is trying to kill me"" bit would have Karl-Otto, sorry, Reynolds, running to the nearest police station, but, nope, he gets his sick kicks being waylaid by his Wicked Witch to the point where he tells the doctor his sister (aka The Butchest Women in The British Empire) drags into this sordid, sorry mess to examine him to shove his stethoscope where the sun don't shine!Incredibly, Karl-Otto and Ilse tie the knot, and - wouldn't you know it! - run into Dr. Shove Your Stethoscope Where The Sun Don't Shine on their honeymoon. You're waiting for Ilse and Dr. Shove Your Stethoscope Where The Sun Don't Shine to hook up when he invites her to a New Year's Party he promises will be a jolly time; she goes to the Jolly Time, but Dr. Shove Your Stethoscope Where The Sun Don't Shine is a no-show (!). Anderson really drops the ball when Karl-Otto drags Ilse out of the Jolly Time, then whines to The Butchest Women in The British Empire that he made a mistake in marrying Ilse, who decides it's time to break her New Best Friends out (again!). Ilse could have dispatched Karl-Otto and The Butchest Women in The British Empire, taken over The House of Woodcock (what a stupid name!), hooked-up with Dr. Shove Your Stethoscope Where The Sun Don't Shine, and lived happily ever after -- until it was time to break her New Best Friends out (again!)"
PHANTOM THREAD,19 April 2018,9/10,"I think this one of the best films of the millennium so far. Perhaps one of the most aesthetically handsome movies ever made, it tells an extremely dark and sordid story that it makes seem almost uplifting. ""Transcendent"" is a word generally best avoided, but it might qualify here. A love/hate story between characters that any reasonable person would have to objectively consider to be two creepy, off-putting, dysfunctional human beings, the filmmakers manage to make these two beautiful freaks seem like stand-ins for all human yearning. On the most immediate level this work deals with the tensions between romantic and artistic yearning, but the film goes deeper even than that. To love and create in the world of this movie is just to live, which is to say to look death in the face."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 May 2018,5/10,"I didn't get what was so good about it. The story was quite boring. It wasn't about very much. It was just about a tailor who falls for a girl even though he's annoyed by her and decides to marry her anyway, but they have no chemistry."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 April 2018,10/10,"I'm always watching out for newness, for originality, for something I've never seen before: the more it strikes me (because I never thought it could be done), the most I'm interested, dragged to it. And on the other hand I look down (I know I shouldn't but I do) on everything that looks old fashioned or sounds dated. Which is peculiar, being myself an old man.This is just to say that I hesitated a lot before going to watch this movie and if you understand what I just said and feel the same way I do, you'll surely know why.But this was a beautiful movie that will make you relive old times as if they were new and will recall you of an other marvellous French 1969 movie (if you have seen it) that I won't name, afraid as I am of spoiling.As its illustrious predecessor, the present movie simply celebrates love which, as known, is timeless. Or, as a Poet said, '...no season knows nor clime. Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time'."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 April 2020,9/10,"My personal highlights:
The car mounted camera sequence as Reynolds drives to the country at dusk
The breakfast order and meeting Alma

The well oiled machine of the seamstresses at work

The beautiful dysfunction
I am thankful we have such amazing filmmakers like PTA working today creating such exquisite pieces of art such as this film is and that we are able to come together as lovers of film to enjoy it."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 August 2018,3/10,"The woman (cold, calculating and ambitious) basically cows the man (arrogant and self-centred celebrity) into submission by judicious use of poison, with the complicity of his sister, presumably because by this time she'd also had enough of his narcissistic temperament.
That either party can actually use the term love is frankly perverse, since they are both using one another to fulfill their own ends (while the essence of love is putting somebody else's interests before one's own).
Perhaps the sister Cyril (a superb portrayal) feels that they are both good for one another, looking at the bigger picture and perhaps not aware that the severe boughts of illness are deliberately provoked, so perhaps she is motivated by love.
Although I find the story repellent, the acting is excellent, which hauls the rating up to a 4."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 February 2021,6/10,It's hard to explain to someone why this movie is good. But it is. As much as you want to hate something like this they do some really unique themes in this period piece. I wouldn't recommend to a lot of people but I'm actually glad I watched it.
PHANTOM THREAD,1 October 2018,9/10,"I just got out of the new movie Phantom Thread, I must say it was incredibly interesting. The movie truly left you guessing on where it was heading. The underlying theme of obsession was always at the center of the plot points. The movie was very well made. It perfectly captured the elegant, sophisticated, and pompous lifestyle of the aristocracy. Paul Thomas Anderson did a phenomenal job directing. I'm a big fan and I was definitely not disappointed. He seamlessly combined drama, mystery, comedy and suspense perfectly. The movie also had a excellent score formed by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. The work perfectly to build atmosphere and a thick ambiance.As expected Daniel Day-Lewis was amazing. As always he is one of my favorite character actors. He certainly deserves the Oscar nomination. Overall one of the most intriguing movies of the year 9 out of 10."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,9/10,"So much has been expessed about this marvel of a film that I feel it's more warranted to explain how it's not boring, the opposite, really. PTA has always been my favorite director since watching 'Magnolia', which imo is a masterpiece. First, to let you know if my advice is worth your time. 
 I love sitting through films, whether their 3 hours or 90 minutes, which is short and better be tight. I'll give you a very controversial film that many people were confused by, and felt challenging sitting while watching Cloud Attlas, I loved It! I could have continued living in that world much longer. Or call me by your last name, which was such an enchanting love story that inspired any sexual preferences, as me being a heterosexual. It's romance! I don't care if it's two men, I care about a profound story about love in what was presented in northern Italy. Then there's Molly game where one of two of my favorite writers is at the helm of the movie, and impressed me for his directial debut. But, his words coming out of those characters was like a feast for my ears. Idris Elba speaking Aaron Sorkin dialgue? What's better than that? Well my other favorite writer whose amazing at dialgue too, but for different reasons than Sorkin. Quentin Tarantino. I would love them to collaborate. 
Anyway, this moving, yes, it is filled with at least brilliant acting, but mostly incredible acting. Paul Thomas Anderson put a lot of work into this, as his others but you can tell was more passionate about this. Perhaps it's because I can relate to Daniel day Lewis character as a writer, but not so prominent to his massive success, but in which the perfectionist in your love for your work. Constantly finding muses, even in pain. But, never allowing myself to fall in love became it will interfere with my work, yet I've loved so hardly and internet and have been heart broken that all the pain in my life is the source of my creativity. His routines are so true to life by creative genuis minds! 
 This movie is never boring because it is one, insanely exited to a crisp pace, never feeling like your attention diverts, because before you know it another scene is presented before you. Note, it's all so beautiful is the way the story is captured, most definitely the 70mm camera. But also the cinematography done by the one and one PTA. Earlier in the film as a car ride was taken by Reynold, Daniel day Lewis, the camera work and score just let me know this movie is going to be special.  Like the master it has to do with obsession, but controlled this time. It's far improved and knows what it's doing, not saying I didn't enjoy that film, there only one film of his I thought was not HIS best work, veherent vice. 
But, now, he goes the tiniest actor of his generation saying this is his last and he chose this character. Intriguing enough. Two forces of nature's, and pioneers in their line of work coning together for their second time. High expectations, but then people, men, read or maybe saw the trailer and thought a date as maker? They underestimated the incredible amazing talents of PTA and Daniel day Lewis film selections. In a great sense of irony he was playing a form of himself with habits of approaching his acting approach. He is known to have a rigorous routine.
You'll either find the score mesmerizing, the remaining between him and his possibly new muse, and remember he says he doesn't want love because it makes him deceitful. Maybe I had to be at my life to truly understand it all to get it, but I have a sense that this spoke to every one that actual are film enthusiasts. This one is top one of my favorite. Call me your last name is tied for my favorite movie of the year, probably ahead. That movie was just demanding of a rematch immediately. This, it demands a week to process everything. No, it's not boring. If you're a movie goier that likes to see sueprherero movies it may very well be. If you can't get into such a intriguing plot, it's scares me for our future films lack of innovations. This was substance for my brain the whole time, while i started it at 1 A.M. and never got tired or thought about waking up at 7. It's a MUST SEE"
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2018,8/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis, a match made in cinematic heaven. Both have immense talent and are painstakingly meticulous about their craft. Ten years ago these two combined forces to make There Will Be Blood. The film received eight Oscar nominations as well as Day-Lewis going home with the Best Actor statuette. After some time apart, and another Oscar for Day-Lewis, they have rejoined to make their second feature, Phantom Thread. Both a pristine costume drama and a dark comedy in disguise, Phantom Thread is one of the year's best films. It's a fitting farewell to Day-Lewis, one of the best actors of all time, who revealed he would be retiring after this role. Set in the 1950's, the film follows the meticulous and calculated life of Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis). He's a renowned dressmaker who runs a world famous London shop with his sister, Cyril (Lesley Manville). Reynolds expects nothing less than perfection from everything he does and from everyone around him. After being a lifelong ""confirmed bachelor"", Reynolds meets the much younger, and more vibrant, Alma (Vicky Krieps). Their relationship quickly gets serious, which proves to be both a blessing and a curse as their differences begin to collide. This creates an uncomfortable range of emotions and incidents that slowly test each character's limits. What starts out as a seemingly simple film eventually turns out to be a multi-layered recipe used by PTA to engross his audience. He lures us in with the costumes and drama but then takes us for a wild ride by incorporating jokes and sexual tension. It's all done so well and blew away my expectations away as the story progressed. While the film does run on for too long in some parts, PTA's knack for creating interesting and unique dialogue is very evident. Each confrontation is fresh as the characters come up with new ways to express their displeasure. A highlight is a certain dinner scene where Reynolds and Alma fully let loose as they try to understand what motivates the other. It's exciting to watch and gives us so much insight into the underlying factors for each character.This film almost acts like Anderson's attempt to model Hitchcock, but without the horror. He uses suspense as a dramatic tool as we never really know what Reynolds is going to do next. He also uses a bit of sexual foreplay to express each character's inner workings. It's very subtle but gets the point across marvelously. One could call this film the arthouse version of Fifty Shades of Grey. The cinematography surprisingly is done by the PTA himself, even though he claims he isn't the cinematographer. Whoever actually did it, they did a marvelous job. This is the best shot film of the year, except for Blade Runner 2049. The camera seamlessly weaves throughout the house as it showcases the extravagant world of Woodcock. It almost became natural for me to be lost within the frame as I watched the technique PTA would use. Specific highlights include the opening tour of the Woodcock shop, the tracking shot of Reynolds walking through a party, and a slow zoom in of Reynolds and Alma together.Jonny Greenwood also deserves heaps of praise for his brilliant score. His mastery of strings and piano bring class to the picture. The score almost acts as stitching as it seamlessly extends the impact of every scene it is in. The acting in this film is as typical as you would expect in a PTA film, it's amazing. Daniel Day-Lewis is his usual astounding and commanding self, continuously breaking the line between character and actor. He makes Reynolds so unbelievable by his actions, but also believable because of the authenticity and commitment he brings. The character of Reynolds almost acts as a vessel for Day-Lewis as he illustrates to us all the work he does behind the scenes to prepare for a role. Rising to the occasion is Vicky Krieps as Alma. Everybody in the past has played second fiddle to Day-Lewis, but Krieps breaks past that mold. She goes head to head with him countless times, fearlessly holding her own and coming out on top. She's dominant and lively and acts as a perfect opposite to Reynolds. Lesley Manville is also a scene stealer as the sister, Cyril. Early on we can tell she is the more aggressive one of the siblings as she instinctively pushes down anyone in her path. Manville gives the right amount of shrewdness to make herself invaluable to the film and overall pleasing to watch.Is this film a dark comedy, period piece, or a sexual thriller? It's all three at once, which makes for an unforgettable experience. It's probably Anderson's best film and one of Day-Lewis' best performances, which is saying a lot when you look at their respective careers."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 April 2018,8/10,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerPaul Thomas Anderson has made some of my favorite films. Magnolia and There Will be Blood are masterpieces. Daniel Day Lewis has many masterful performances under his belt like My Left Foot and In the Name of The Father. This is Lewis' last performance of his career so I had to watch this film. Phantom Thread tells the story of a masterful dress maker who struggles with the love of a young woman. It is a mundane story but it does hold some power. The dialogue is fluid and the ending is very good. We get to see Alma work with his ticks but then she slowly and deliberately annoys the man. Lewis plays a man who is strict on order and structure but can be very rude with his words and manners. The acting is wondrous. Daniel Day Lewis performs to the standard he made for himself which is masterful. Vicky Krieps also performs very well a kind yet naïve young woman who wants the love a master of design. Lesley Manville also holds her own.The pacing is very slow and this is the worst part of film. The runtime is also overly long.The music used throughout the film is beautiful and adds to the film. The costumes and clothing are all stunning.Pros: A very structured and well-planned story, great acting, an amazing performance by Daniel Day Lewis, fluid dialogue, good use of music, beautiful costumes, and a great endingCons: Very slow pacing, the story may be too mundane for some, and the runtime is overlongOverall Rating: 8.0"
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,8/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's movies are never coherent enough to appeal to the mainstream, but this one is so exquisite that you have no difficulty ignoring its inherent lack of logic. The attention to detail, the use of certain colors, the lush and vibrant photography of the dresses Reynolds Woodcock makes and the clothes he wears they're breathtaking. The primary appeal to seeing this film is Daniel Day-Lewis in his (supposed) final film role and while it is a great performance, it is the actress Vicky Krieps that will amazes you. But the main star, as always in an Anderson movie, is the writer-director himself. As ""Phantom Thread"" progresses, Anderson never quite explaining what each character is up to as he or she moves from one scene to the next and that makes it a stunning film."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 April 2018,7/10,"So, a successful dressmaker for the upper class people and royalty, who usually treats women like furniture, meets a much younger simple woman and they start a game of who needs who more. Sounds like an awful fun... except it doesn't. In fact, it sounds insanely boring and predictable.Predictability, however, is not what this film's characters try to avoid. Quite the contrary, they embrace it and get pissed when something goes awry, that is, against their routine. The battle of a feisty and rebellious youngling and an established but moody oldtimer is probably the most exciting thing about Phantom Thread. It might be the very thread going through the whole film, so noticeable that at some point you start keeping a score of who burned who and who threw a fit as a revenge move. One might even start accepting bets on who would emerge victorious out of this inevitable confrontation.The quality one cannot deny this film, though, is how beautifully this push-pull game of two plus one is acted out. The trio of Vicky Krieps, Daniel Day-Lewis and Lesley Manville make all sorts of posh sad/posh irritated/posh condescending faces, showing us just how far ahead of the whole world Brits have gone in terms of humiliating each other in a quiet voice and perfectly decent vocabulary. After all, true class is the ability to do the ugliest things with the most regal look you can afford.But, in all its dignified appearance, Phantom Thread loses an ingredient essential for providing not just style but also substance: the logical consistency. The characters' behavior is erratic, swinging between dangerously radical opposites a bit too carelessly. You're fascinated with someone, and the next second you push them around like they are dirt under your shoes, then you are all loving and sensitive, breaking all your habits for a person, and then you compare their presence with a smell of silent death. I might've found that normal for a story of some precocious teen like Lady Bird. But for a grey-haired man who above all values the stability of his life, such maneuvers seem too far-fetched to be realistic.And then there's the ending, which is literally tailored to make you have that ""WTF have I just watched?!"" moment. I admit that after Fincher's Gone Girl it's pretty hard to come up with a more messed up way to finish a convoluted story, but Phantom Thread has come pretty close. And, while the Fincher movies are messed up for a pretty relatable reason, Phantom Thread ultimately leaves you wondering whether all these quirks have been put together simply to make the story look decadently... chic.Maybe for a sewing addict this kind of chic is exactly what is needed. But a less exquisite person like myself leans towards the descriptives like ""awkward"" and ""ridiculous"". It's still a bespoke suit of a movie, that is, it's unlike most things you see around. But, in my personal case, I guess this bespoke suit was simply made using someone else's measurements."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 January 2018,9/10,"I thought I would hate this movie. Sorry, but imho, mr anderson's last movie was depressingly bad. Before 'inherent vice' I never saw anyone actually ask for their money back, so I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing another production of his and not many theatres in my area were willing to take the risk either. I don't think 'phantom thread' was in any theatre in my area when it was originally released and then when it was re-released I could only find 4 theatres initially, and all across town. When it finally showed up in my neighborhood, I only went because of the ratings. How bad could it be, right? I went alone to a discount matinee. Only two people in the audience, including myself which changed to one about 40 mins later. His loss. This is a great film. It doesn't have comic book characters, and there are no bombs or gunfire and no over the top special effects. It's basically an interesting opera about a complicated man brilliantly portrayed and supported by excellent performances. It's not a pretentious art film. It's a movie that has been carefully crafted, scene by scene. If you just want to be entertained with fireworks and quick editing, stick to the comic book movies. Also, if you need a clearly defined story plot in 3 parts, you'll be disappointed. But, if you appreciate the art of movie making, you'll probably like this film. Every scene is planned and produced with impeccable timing and attention to detail. One scene at the end is so perfectly done, I dare anyone to find anything in cinema history that comes close to it. At first, the movie comes off like one of those classic french films from the 50s and 60s (film genre I personally don't like). You know the ones with the citroen driving in the rain and cute rural places and beautiful girls and ridiculous dialogue. But, pay attention; there's a lot more to the movie. Like at least one of mr anderson's previous movies, it's an orchestral production, imho. What I mean is that one part of the movie, like the soundtrack, doesn't complement the movie like in most films, but rather it's part of the film. Like a great symphonic production, all the parts work together. No part is more important than the other. And like a symphony, get all the parts right and it's wonderful to experience but get one or two wrong and it ruins the whole production. Imho, bad 'parts' have killed some of his previous movies but 'phantom thread' is as near perfection as you can get. Regardless if it wins awards or makes a lot of money, it will be appreciated, and talked about for a long time."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 May 2020,9/10,"I would never normally watch this kind of film. It like one of those old french films that people rave about, then you go and see it and think what is all the fuss about? A man falls in love with a much younger woman. Has her model his clothes and wait on him hand and foot, which is what she wants to do. Everything has to be on his terms, when he wants it. Truly this film went nowhere, there was no big reveal. She poisoned him, to look after him, got him better again and with his consent it started all over again. What ever rocks your boat. The reason for the 9 is Daniel day lewis. Perfectly acted and smoulderingly sexy but oh so flawed."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,9/10,"There is so very much to enjoy and praise about this film: Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is very smooth, period-aware, and one that extracts the very best from a cast of the highest quality. There are points in the film when his style is reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman at the top of his form.Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to have won three Best Actor Oscars (Nicholson won three, but one was for a supporting role) , so he is statistically the best actor the cinema has ever seen, and it is sad news that he has decided to call it a day. He is magnificent as a completely job-focused tailor, his acting reflecting deep understanding of haute couture, and an almost autistic approach to the world until he meets Alma (Krieps).The latter is superlative in her part, she literally loves her man to death, always with a very controlled and controlling approach, but never losing her grip. After all, she has the courage to tell him that he is not as strong as he thinks. Between Alma and Reynolds there is, however, the latter's sister, Cyril, played by the oustanding Lesley Manville, who reminded me of Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers in Hitchcock's Rebecca (US 1940), permanently putting the House of Woodcock tailor/dressmaker venture her first and foremost interest.Clearly, a game of power is constantly played by the three leads, the decisive move being when Alma manages to get Reynolds to ask her hand in marriage. Up to that point, everything makes sense in the film. Thereafter, it blurs somewhat, and I ended thinking that Reynolds and Alma played a game of poisonous mushrooms to keep their marriage alive -- which, to my rather normal IQ, seemed a very odd way to live and an ambiguous ending to a very elegant and wonderfully embroidered movie, with an exquisite musical accompaniment that becomes increasingly jagged, and eventually replaced with background noise, as the power struggles intensify.Photography is gorgeous, cinematography first class, acting sublime, script very intelligent and yet... the whole is less than the sum of its parts, and I wonder whether I had missed something important that would allow me to come up with a cogent interpretation of THE PHANTOM THREAD.It is for that reason alone that I give it only 9/10. That said, I think it is the best film competing for Oscars this year -- but, on the other hand, I doubt that it will get Best Picture or Best Director. I would be very pleased if it went to Day-Lewis, and he would deserve it, but I doubt anyone in Hollywood will wnat to give a limey a fourth Oscar."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 November 2019,10/10,"LOL I loved this film. I will watch it again, because I didn't completely understand it. That is not a bad thing. This quality took me back to my school days, reading and studying difficult literature :) I read a New York Times review afterward, and the Roger Ebert review, in an effort to gain some understanding of the film. It might be that it is so long since I've seen a film like this that I've gotten out of the practice of using the old noggin :) Anyhow, the film is a beautiful delight. I'm so glad that films like this are still made. It is truly a gem, and a wonderful note on which Daniel Day-Lewis has ended his acting career."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 March 2018,10/10,"If its not the movie of the year I dont know what is)
Like all serious works of art it is not for everyone. It is only for mature audience! It has a scent of great classical wrighters and eye candy of amazing performances. It's hardcore theater multiplied by hardcore cinema raised by genius wrighting. It is very slow yet you want it to be even slower, it is so good! Each frame , every word, evry music choice. It is very hard to get 10 out of me. I waited till the end, and then just had no choice. Watch it!
For those who didn't understand: it was about growing up and been in relationship as an adult. Dressmaking was his connection to his mother, the most important person in his life. And Alma showed him that he can have new family and that this is what he really wants. Movie shows that there is some level of sado-mazahism in marriage but all this sums up into something very special and important."
PHANTOM THREAD,31 December 2017,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's painstaking craft and haunting style are both vigorously at work in this weighty film about Reynolds Woodcock, a famous fashion designer in London in the 1950s who becomes personally involved with a young woman he meets at a café near his country house. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an absorbing performance as the seemingly impenetrable Woodcock whose firmly ossified and perfectionist world is challenged by the presence of a woman he meets out of pure chance.Day-Lewis's intensity often dominates and overshadows the films he is in, but here Vicky Kreps gives a marvelous and captivating performance as the woman he meets and whom he takes into his demanding world of fashion design. Lesley Manville is also superb as Woodcock's demanding but humane and knowing sister. In keeping with his past performances, here Day-Lewis portrays a man who is a tough nut to crack. The mystery surrounding his psychology is slowly unwoven throughout the film.The film's musical score maintains an alternating sense of angst, furious labor and heartfelt vulnerability throughout. As usual, Anderson's film knows how to use a musical score to great effect. This film is meant to be absorbed slowly and linger on. For patient viewers, it's an incredibly rewarding experience. Extraordinarily recommended."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 August 2021,9/10,"Extremely wonderful. Well acted, bit slowly paced but it justifies every single moment. The things we love, sacrificing, being vulnerable and everything in between."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 January 2018,9/10,"I'm a huge fan of director Paul Thomas Anderson's films (except for ""Inherent Vice,"") and was really looking forward to seeing this. After finally seeing it tonight, I can confirm that it does not disappoint. This delicate and utterly elegant period drama about a fictional tailor known as Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel-Day Lewis) relationship with a young woman played by Vicky Krieps. From its first frames, it is clear that PTA has paid sublime attention to detail with this film. Each scene feels truly finely crafted with a level of intense precision uncommonly found in even sophisticated filmmaking today. The sets, costumes and score are simply masterful and well worth the price of admission alone. From a somewhat more tangible standpoint, Anderson's drama further delivers the goods. The acting is very strong, as the film's performances can feel slightly subdued and low-key before creeping up on the viewer to create a sharp but simple impact. The movie's script is a delight, managing to pull of a genuine hat-trick by feeling both simple and complex at the same time. With a tone reminiscent of a classical romantic drama with Gothic and even some Shakespearean undertones, the tightly but grippingly paced drama that unfolds is both entertaining and enthralling for its audience. While PTA's films are not always known for their senses of humor, ""Phantom Thread"" is surprisingly very funny at times. The film's use of irony is also immensely clever, as dramatic and situational irony are both used in clever and impactful manners--both when the audience most and least expects them to arrive and occur. While some might criticize the film for being slightly slow at times, patient viewers will find much to savor--and commend--here. Highly recommended. 9/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,26 February 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread is a film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The film was on my radar for quite some time mainly because of Daniel Day-Lewis. Finally after seeing the film I can definitely say that he is a treat to watch. Plot: Reynolds Woodcock, a fashion designer in the 1950s falls in love with a waitress, Alma.Story and direction: The film is a very correct depiction of what famous people are. The characterization to the minutest detail has been very nicely done by Anderson. This is what caught on to me for the entire runtime. The problems, fame, tensions, etc.. all were shown without any adulteration. It felt very genuine on screen. It was as if I was looking at an autobiography of a very famous person living in 1950s London. One thing that very well caught my attention was the costumes. Considering that the film is based all around costumes, it was natural that my attention would be to that aspect. For the first time, I felt in awe of the costumes. Also the BGM by Johnny Greenwood. His score is very simplistic yet very beautiful and melodious. But the film is not without any faults. The very much linear narrative of the film itself is its problem. There are no high moments of the film where you feel that the film will standout. Also I did feel that there was not much time given for Alma and Reynolds' relation to develop.Performances: I felt this film more of a performance oriented film than a story driven one. Daniel Day-Lewis nails the role of Reynolds. The mannerism and attitude by him was perfect. For him acting is not a word, its art and passion which is very clearly seen in his performance. Vicky Kriepes role was not that great. I don't know whether it was the script or her acting I did feel something lacking in her role. Lesley Manville was good as Reynolds' sister, Cyril. She provided great support to his character.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Alma cooks diiner for Reynolds and he looks at it in a very disgusting way and comments of being very off from his routine. That scene showed the greatness of Day-Lewis as an actor which captivated me the most.Verdict: Although not so great in its story, the performances are worth a watch. If this is Day-Lewis' last role, I can very well say that he ended on a high note. He will severely be missed a lot.I am going with an 8.5/10."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 December 2020,7/10,"A truly captivating film, covering a subject matter I had no interest in what so ever, dressmaking. I actually watched this film because it was part filmed in Robin Hoods Bay and Whitby two of my favourite parts of the country. I was hooked from start to finish. The characters are captivating and although it is so slow paced the two hours wiz by.Loved it, although it is hardly essential, Daniel Day Lewis is amazing in this"
PHANTOM THREAD,30 December 2019,8/10,"Wow! This film, that often moved like molasses, kept me riveted and entranced through the whole two hours and eleven minutes, including the credits too. I thought Phantom Thread was perfectly cast in lead and supporting roles: the Master Daniel Day-Lewis as the precise, controlled dressmaker, Reynolds Woodcock, the beguiling, talented Vicky Krieps as Alma Elson, his muse, and Lesley Manville as Woodcock's sister, all turned in spectacular performances. The narrative was just confusing enough to keep me a bit uneasy and hanging on to every next word. The scene where Reynolds first dresses Alma is a perfect example to me of how seductive an intelligent script and adept direction can be."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 November 2021,6/10,"It's almost a shame Daniel Day Lewis decided to end his career with the Phantom Thread, since the film left me puzzled, and less connected to him as a character or actor in comparison with most of his previous work. Here is a film that teases you with a sweeping, period romance and drama and then gradually devolves into something more psychopathic, less serious, and overall less interesting as it develops. In a way the movie completely bamboozles you and feels like a middle finger to the audience by the end of it.The broad strokes are interesting - the story is that of an upper-class fashion designer, Reynolds Woodcock, who marries a waitress, Alma, makes her his muse, and lover, and then controls her life to such a degree that she begins to retaliate in ways that would only spoil the film to get into them too deeply. The design and opulence, the score and cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and evokes a grandeur of the English countryside and luxuriant manor houses that is something of dreams. And the actors, individually, are on point, particularly Vicky Krieps who plays Alma, with an innocence that is often touching.Crucially, Daniel Day-Lewis, and his character Woodcock, remains a shallow cypher throughout the film, and instead of deepening an understanding into the man in any meaningful or poignant way, the film revels in its shallowness till the very end. I felt nothing, and a kind of emptiness by this films conclusion, and this was the films major disappointment. It reminded me of the Master, another Anderson epic with an opulent look to it but I did not connect with emotionally. And as dark and cynical as this film seems to want to be, it did not go as far or as engrossingly into the depths of a dark soul as There Will Be Blood, which remains their collaborative masterpiece.On second viewing, I was bored, because I knew what to expect, and knew that the effort doesn't amount to much in terms of feeling or humanity, so I relied on simply gazing at the beauty of the whole thing, but then, I didn't really understand what I was supposed to feel beyond that, and I put off viewing it a third time. I don't want to invest time into a movie that makes me simply feel empty.Sadly, it's also film that made me re-evaluate Anderson's work totally, and now I wonder if some of the aesthetic power built into his work has just made up for some of my lack of being able to truly connect emotionally with it. The Phantom Thread is a film that closed me off from the world depicted in it, the world of the characters, and I felt like Alma, desperately wanting to be let in."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 January 2018,8/10,"If you tell me: ""Paul Thomas Anderson directed Daniel Day-Lewis in his final film as a famous London dressmaker who falls squarely somewhere on the Asperger spectrum, oh and it's set in the 1950s and it's also a love story,"" I would say: ""Oh, barf."" Like, gag-me-with-a-spoon barf.No explosions, no car chases, not even a sex scene. Instead, we get a love of fashion and appearance, non-verbal cues often sent and sometimes received, and a haunting score from Jonny Greenwood who sneaks in My Foolish Heart by Oscar Peterson at just the right moment. There's also an impromptu mosh pit after a balloon drop, for those of you into that type thing.Mushroom hunting has never been more fun, nor eating breakfast to get the day started off correctly, especially for people who have very keen senses of smells. If you can hide blessings, messages, and memories within the threads of clothes, then so also should you be able to hide curses, questions, and stuff to forget.If you can hide thoughts in clothes, then you can hide thoughts in movies, and if you can hide thoughts in movies, you can hide other movies in movies, which is probably what Paul Thomas Anderson was thinking when he wrote Phantom Thread, to make it a whole universe ready to compete with DC, Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 January 2018,7/10,"Phantom thread is a pas de trios, a delicate dance for three, in which there's no clear dominant player and the relationships between members of trio are constantly renegotiated. The movie Phantom thread directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (also directed there will be blood) is about Reynolds Woodcock( Daniel day-Lewis tall, lanky, stylish )who likes peace and quiet when alone and when working on his superb gowns for attractive, rich ladies. Reynolds and his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) understand each other very well and look out for each other all the time. Then comes Alma (Vicky Krieps)into Reynolds life. Alma, a waitress, and Reynolds fall in love instantly. Alma gets tired of Reynolds uppity up mannerisms and talk and lack of freedom in living her life the way she wants. So, Alma decides to make Reynolds slightly ill to make him depend on her so she could have him for herself. Some parts of movie reminded me of the movie boxing Helena by Jennifer lynch and of course Pink's song please don't leave me video . The movie is good. Too long. Daniel Day Lewis is a terrific actor and gave a touch of class to this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 February 2018,9/10,"Wow.
What a supposedly simple story, and so much tension! Filmmaking at its finest - the score, the framing, the rhythm are excellent, but at the core we have acting at its finest from the two leads. While Daniel Day-Lewis needs no introduction. Vicky Krieps is the true revelation here - it's her first international production (I think) and her role is the complete opposite of the one in ""The Chambermaid Lynn"" where she first caught my eye, but her play is equally mesmerising. We'll never see her in an action blockbuster I guess; hers is a play of face and stance, and she draws you in like few others. In fact, ""Phantom Thread"" would make a nice double feature with ""Lynn"" - where the ""plot"" sees the titular girl just beginning to develop some sense of self-worth and finally daring to make her own decisions - in ""Phantom Thread"", Alma is a full-fledged force of nature, forcing herself into the Woodcock household and finally whittling down Day-Lewis' driven Reynolds to manageable size and form while keeping peace with his difficult sister (a very silent but intense performance by Lesley Manville).
Another movie which imposes itself as a double feature with Phantom Thread, by the way, would be ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Women"" - since Phantom Thread exemplifies Marston's idiosyncratic worldview whereas happiness for the modern man is to be found in the submission to a loving and wise woman.The real triumph of Phantom Thread lies in the fact that it manages to make the strange relationship between Alma and Reynolds believable despite the extremes of silliness and brutality and tenderness it goes through. Highly recommended!"
PHANTOM THREAD,26 April 2020,7/10,"This is not a designer and high set of film, the film about a relationship. The bottom line is that the world will find a way to satisfy you if you don't say no."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,9/10,"Have I ever been interested in sewing or fashion? No. Does romance or costume drama films interested me a lot? Not too often. But this film, ""Phantom Thread"", got my attention. If you are a cinema fan then the reasons may seem obvious. It's Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis re-teaming just in time for the 10th anniversary of ""There Will Be Blood"". I watched all of the PTA films in preparation for this one and I've noticed how much of a chameleon he is. All of his films are so different and unique. Although I can recognize the visual look of his pictures. And just mentioning really quickly before I forget: PTA acted as his own cinematographer (uncredited as well). And it looks stupendous. The framing and the blocking of characters is on point! The story was inspired by a special look the director got from his wife's eyes when he had been very sick. To me it's so interesting that the movie was built around that. I never knew where the story would take me next. So because it constantly surprised me, I will not write about any plot details in this review. Suffice it to say, the filmmaking here is the work of masters, yet it comes across as a small personal little movie.It's the details. What you choose to focus on. The storytelling doesn't lie in the script as much it does in visuals. You can have a fantastic script with layered characters and you may not necessarily need to film it in such a detailed way. Because most details are told and therefore you can film that movie in a simpler way: Shooting the story. But here partly why it's so compelling is in the way the story is shown. The story is not told, but shown with visual imagery and the choices in the details that are presented to you on the screen. That's merely one reason why it's so compelling. We are dealing with characters that are strangely particular. I can honestly say that I found myself understanding what was going in their minds. Most of that is also communicated with stares and long silences where your guiding point becomes that look in the character's eye. Vicky Krieps is a like-able presence, and I hope that she gets the recognition she deserves from this as its easy to get overshadowed Day-Lewis. She manages to stand out and bring complex a character to life. I'm fascinated with Daniel Day-Lewis. The fact that he immerses himself that much into his roles even leads to him feeling the same trauma his character will. That's an insane amount of dedication which also leads to the most real performance you can get. So obviously he's good, but so is the rest of the cast and crew too - Which shouldn't be forgotten. The character of Reynolds is as dedicated to his art as the filmmakers are. Sometimes he feels bursts of creative ideas and he can't help but to get into his work and isolate himself. He loves his art and I can understand him as an artist myself. Because there are times when you need that concentration and focus. Those are the moments when you can't get distracted by other stuff. That only leads to your frustration because of you loosing that creative energy.It's complicated to explain all of this and I could talk about ""Phantom Thread"" for hours, but I'll get to my final points. It's slow paced and I think that a lot of folks out there may find it tedious or un-engaging. It's strange at places, but to me it was always interesting. I wouldn't have minded the run-time to be longer actually. Today was the Swedish premiere of the film. The wait was sure long for us to get it. The cinema was pretty empty and only a handful of old ladies were in the audience. A shame that not more people showed up. But maybe it's the subject matter that doesn't turn any heads. Because believe me, it's about so much more than just sowing. I implore everyone who admires cinema to check it out and just give it one little chance. It can be challenging, but elegantly rewarding."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 October 2019,10/10,"I finally got around to seeing PTA's newest film a shortly after it's release and let some time pass to digest Daniel Day-Lewis's supposed last performance, and Phantom Thread's overall grade.I can easily say I have not been disappointed in the least. Phantom Thread delivers and I find myself once again drawn to Anderson's work without much of a story and engrossed with what Kreips, DDL, and Manville are doing. I can also say that possibly with the exception of DDL's performance none of them beat out the trifecta PTA conducted in his 2012 masterpiece The Master (Pheonix, PSH, and Adams). Even so, all of the ingredients of a staple PTA adventure are present; hard-nosed acting, 2-3 characters that confront each other in some climax of sorts, Greenwood's beautiful score, and long quiet takes. The film is even sprinkled with a handful of comedic moments that work because the characters are believable and the line delivery is so good.Like most PTA films I think any sort of weakness is found within the lack of actual story (tends to meander) and specifically moments where I found myself questioning Kreips' character's decision making. At times this was very questionable as to how it makes sense she stays with a man like Reynolds Woodcock, but it tends to become justified by the time you make it to the end of the film. I don't think Alma's motives are as clear as Freddie Quell's in The Master (comparing Alma to Quell and Dodd to Woodcock in the sense that one character is drawn to the other which begins the relationship and the overall journey the film takes).Being familiar with PTA's work I was waiting for that scene we all can look back on like the ""I drink your Milkshake!"" Or the ""I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China..."" and i thought Phantom Thread wasn't going to have one until it hit me half way through the actual scene. This moment is the ""Omelette"" scene. Which doesn't necessarily get intense up front like the others I mentioned do-much more subtle in fact, and in this way I find it brilliant because Alma and Reynolds realize the rollercoaster of their relationship and why they need each other.I don't think Phantom Thread is exactly a ""deep film"" but one that highlights some of PTA's best work and puts a whacky love story in the spotlight. It's always always always about the dynamic between the two leading characters (and sometimes the third), and it draws me in every single time.P.S. Greenwood's score is his absolute best work yet, which I can confidently admit, had me crying as the credits rolled. Stunningly beautiful chord progressions and dynamics."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 August 2019,8/10,"Anderson has this ability to define thin personalities with elegance and at the same time to evidence its brutal and nevrotic contradictions. The couple Anderson-Day-Lewis works perfectly: he his the best actor to interpret a complex stylist mind as Anderson want. The main character infact oscillate between great intelligence and nevrotic desires of order and habits: his lover have tragically to understand his soul and how to deal with it through difficult times. The response his in acceptation of the pain as the only moment in which the stylist reveals his lover and real behavior. With amazing costumes and curated scenery and photography, this movie can fight against the difficulty to represent complex and evanescent personalities: and Anderson can do it."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 February 2018,8/10,"Most men, when trying to woo a woman, are looking to take her clothes off. Daniel Day-Lewis in Phantom Thread, however, looks to put more clothes on. In his final role before his supposed retirement from film, Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, an enigmatic fashion designer in 1950's London who is consumed by his work. He is the most eccentrically elitist dress maker you could possibly find. If you eat your toast too loud during breakfast, you have ruined his entire day--that's the kind of man we're dealing with here. And this presents a challenge for Alma (Vicky Krieps). She is in love with this man because of his idiosyncrasies and his dedication to his craft, but those are the exact things keeping them apart. A conversation they have drastically changes her approach to winning him over, as she begins to play the same ""game"" she perceives him to be playing. And with this comes a fascinating back-and-forth over who will dominant their relationship. Phantom Thread presents a truly interesting look at the relationship between an artist and his art, and how that relationship affects those close to him. Simultaneously, it also showcases a rather toxic partnership between a man and a woman, and the extents they will go to to manipulate each other..."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 July 2018,7/10,"....surprisingly liked the film. I kept waiting for a moment to 'open' my DVR as I did for 'The Master'. Understand I am not saying I would see it again - probably not but it was no where near as dreadful as many here made it out to be. It reminded me of a film Kubrick would have directed - meandering with confusing purpose and a finale that, although possible not very plausible. The repetitive center on Reynold Woodcock (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) is that which Kubrick often times used and for the viewer for very little gain.Alma slowly but determinedly becomes her own woman however the role she plays is (maybe intentionally) confusing in the house. Regardless even allowing for the long scenes of seeing Reynold Woodcock act with horrific arrogance and cruelty the story shows a much needed transformation of him for all involved. Is it a surprise of what Alma decides to do to re-start her seemingly collapsing marriage an act of evil? Remember this is 1950's UK which is the one complaint I had i.e. I doubt very much anyone used the coarse words that Woodcock did per his class and status.It rather reminded me of a Henry James novel which is why such are always better depicted on the screen with actors/actresses rather than having to wade through both dull prose and even duller settings as this certainly would have been in 'book form'.The star for me was the sister 'Cyril' played by the strong but elegant lesley Manville. Her performance was the only truly 'real' person in the film. I would say see it but if you're fortunate get it from the library as 'one setting' is a bit much even for a film a bit longer than 2 hours."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,8/10,"I thought it was a great film, and nice to see some old-school cinematic technique and class on the screen, filmed on film rather than digital. A reviewer said it was unrelatable but I fail to see how - it cuts to the human condition of routine and familiarity vs excitement and danger, the vulnerabilities of creativity, trappings of power against happiness, fulfilling one's needs vs another's, figuring out the difference between what we want and what we need, being suffocated by the various cages we build around ourselves. His collision of contempt against desire for Alma is as interesting a dilemma to watch play out as any. I have to mention how bizarre a one-star reviewer is below, a mental health nurse claiming to 'deduce' Alma is a sociopath. It seems everyone and their aunt is able to diagnose a sociopath these days with the vaguest most tenuous experience, any time someone lies or is selfish. A complete misreading of Alma's character, needs, perceptions and insecurities. Wow. Aside from which, sociopath or not, it hardly affects the film towards one-star."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 February 2018,4/10,"All I could think at the end was, ""Okay. I don't get it."" But I will still try to make a modicum of sense out of it, just for you. Let me say here, in case you don't feel like reading further: Don't watch this movie if you haven't already done so. Find something better to view. (""Message from the King"" isn't half-bad.)My understanding of this film:The control freak meets his soulmate. She loves him but she wants to tame his OCD-ness. She will poison him over and over, with his permission, until he is (my rendering of her words) ""flat on his back, gentle and needing her again.""Ugh. Ever since ""My Beautiful Launderette"" I have loved Daniel Day-Lewis and enjoyed his masterful acting. Even though ""Last of the Mohicans"" was absolutely cringe-worthy, it was fun to watch Day-Lewis running through the forests, lugging that ancient flintlock musket (or flintlock rifle or whatever it was), brown curls flying. Wow. That was something. My Left Foot, Room with a View, Lincoln, etc. All of his great performances over the years . . . And now we have this piano-tinkling, violin- downer music codswallop?As always, Day-Lewis is riveting. The storyline is somewhat intriguing, too-----until you realize the whole thing is about this Alma chick not getting the attention she needs. She will not be tossed aside. She suddenly has the inspiration and means to bring this great artist to his knees. We learn how she is going to give him near-death experiences and settle his hash and thereby win his love.Bah. Shame on her. She is not a muse, she's a low-life jealous ninny. Jealous of his talent and artistry. And she tells us she will find him throughout the ages, no matter where he is. What? And make him miserable over and over again, in those many lifetimes? And he goes along with this? What a bunch of tripe."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 February 2018,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson remains very much at the height of his powers with Phantom Thread. Narratively challenging, to be sure, but Anderson displays such a mastery of tone and craft that the film feels and flows like silk. There is an almost virtuosic level of grace and poise exhibited here, and the acting manages to reach that high bar as well. The film itself feels like one of Woodcock's signature dresses: carefully considered, patiently sewn, poured over, hemmed and tailored to perfection, every detail intentional and delicately positioned. It may prove elusive for those looking for a more transparent and immediate drama, but there is plenty of substance below the polished surface if you're willing to dig a little deeper and the story takes a number of genuinely surprising turns that sustain intrigue throughout. In an age of films patched together with sewing machines, Phantom Thread is lovingly hand-stitched with a needle and thread. Savor it.Decent 4.5/5"
PHANTOM THREAD,23 January 2020,8/10,"The movie is ok. I expected different end, but its ok.
What annoyed me, that the female, Alma, was very unattractive. That was a reason I didn't enjoyed movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 January 2020,10/10,Holy moly what a beautiful film. DDL is a god and there's a scene where he is eating an omelette and thats the most interesting things i've ever watched in my hole life.
PHANTOM THREAD,2 September 2020,4/10,"The main problem with ""phantom thread"" is that it's not a visceral experience. People to go the movies to feel, to relate to the characters, to experience things they wouldn't in 'real life'.Phantom thread delivers none of that. The two leads, while perfectly acted, are purposely made impossible to relate to. I get it, it's an 'anti hero' folie a deux, an ode to melodramas, an exercise in photography. But without a story that moves forward it falls flat on its back, helpless like its protagonist.Worth noting and quite frankly bizarre considering how much effort was put into the production values, there are a few dialogue errors, some of the tracking shots are rather 'oh-hum' and unnatural, and the lighting is at times all over the place. In the midst of this chaos are a few shots that you could freeze frame, print and put on your wall. The mind boggles, but I think what we're seeing here is a case of 'too many cooks in the kitchen'.I expected much better of PTA. If reviewers were more honest they'd admit they'd have given this 2 stars if DDN didn't save the day with an award worthy performance. But even the best actor in his generation cannot save an empty script.4/10 and that's only because of some courageous shots in terms of photography. If you're not an aspiring filmmaker, pass on this one."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 December 2017,5/10,"As I watched this film I felt like I was watching ""Eyes Wide Shut""-- the glacial pacing, the fashion and the mysteriousness seemed familiar.I'm not really as impressed with visuals as most people. I have enough knowledge and experience with film making to know that any moron can get good/great visuals if he or she has enough time in a location and even a fairly competent director of photography-- or, in the case of a huge budget movie, competent video editors as well. But I must state that unlike Blade Runner 2049, although this film's visuals are good, they weren't good enough to justify its ultra-slow pacing. Even though it's actually shorter than Blade Runner 2049 by thirty minutes, it felt longer than it to me.Daniel Day Lewis delivers his usual outstanding performance. But his Reynolds character is borderline unbearable. If Vicky Krieps's Alma character (his lover) wasn't in the film to counter his repulsiveness, I might have left the theater early. Throughout the film, Reynolds and his parasitic brood of socialites speculate that her youthful age is to ""blame"" for her humanity. Even Alma herself claims that she longs to be dead inside (my words) like Reynolds as she ages. I wanted to say to her that she should never aspire to be as boring and tedious. Reynolds has a lot of Freudian issues. By the end of the film there is much fatuousness and derangement as Alma reveals just how she is manipulating him. And unlike some of the people who were in my audience, I wasn't amused or entertained by Reynolds' willingness to accept it.It's better than Paul Thomas Anderson's last couple of films, and Lewis manages to go out on top as an actor, but ultimately it gives way to the same sort of pretentiousness that ruined those films as well."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,9/10,"Set in the 50's the movie follows the life of Reynolds Woodcock, a world-renowned couturier who meets his next muse Alice, a waitress in the English countryside. Things get weird on their first date as he asks her to try on something he's working on (some might say it's a privilege), that is until his sister comes in to write down her measurements. Way to ruin the moment, right? The movie runs along with Alma constantly having to fight her way to get to and through to him, being meticulously savage about how he likes to stick to his routine and that applying butter on your toasted bread can ruin his whole day.So the biggest question is why stay? It's easy to assume that she's staying with him for the lifestyle or the money. It's also easy to say that she changed herself so she can become acceptable to him. Common knowledge is love should be easy, it should come naturally and effortlessly. But what the movie is trying to point out is love comes in different shapes and sizes. They may not have the typical love story but theirs is their own kind of love story, granted it takes a little craziness to understand or appreciate. This also somewhat breaks the notion that there are people who are unlovable. They just haven't found the right person for them yet.Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the purveyors of method acting notched up his 6th Academy Awards Best Actor nomination, of which he already won three. While his last movie in 2012 won him the award (he semi-retired for 5 years), this year's race is a lock between Chalamet and Oldman, him on a close third. I was expecting Vicky Krieps to have been nominated for Best Actress, having held her own with Day-Lewis for the most of the movie, except for the surprise dinner scene where she seemed coming apart at the seams (see what I did there?) Cinematography was great considering no Director of Photography was hired and of course it's Costume Design nomination was well-deserved.In a nutshell, this is what the three Fifty Shades of Grey movies combined would've wanted to be if it tried really hard, but will never be.Favorite Quote: A house that doesn't change is a dead house."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 January 2019,1/10,"I cannot get to understand this movie at all. What is this all about? A woman that poisons her boyfriend is the hero of this story? what? she has a criminal mind, he had all sorts of obsessions and his attitude is brutal and offensive.... how come with his way of treat her she stayed? she had no self-respect, and that is not love at all.
So, he knew she was poisoning him and accepted it as a cure for his horrible personality?
Poisons cure sick minds? is what the movie is trying to teach us?
WHAT? you have to be kidding me....
And how such criminal like her's is portraited as hero??
1950 is not in the so far past...... this story should had been placed 300 years ago.
The only good thing in this movie was to see Daniel Day Lewis back.
He is for me one of the best actors of all times!"
PHANTOM THREAD,9 June 2018,7/10,"This movie is a romance drama with a twist. It may seem a little slow in the beginning but it is well worth watching.
The protagonist, Reynolds Woodcock, is a prodigious dressmaker whose reputation precedes him. Right from the start it is revealed to us that Reynolds is all about his work. Thinking about dresses 24/7. 
He's so preoccupied with his work that he sketches new dresses even in his spare time (and during breakfast). All of that changes when he meets Alma, a young and strong-willed woman who works at the local diner. Despite the fact that Reynolds is somewhat of a quirky character he manages to hit it off with Alma, almost immediately. It is a really weird relationship, especially at first. Reynolds drew Alma into ""his world"" as soon as they started seeing each other. Which is not very surprising if you consider how obsessed he is with his work. 
During the first half of the movie, Alma is more of a muse to Reynolds than anything else. The dynamics of their relationship start to change after Alma confronts Reynolds and his numerous pet peeves. Or as she has put it ""games"". To her, a woman from the working-class, Reynolds peculiarities seem very odd and theatrical. She perceives them to be some sort of pretense. Reynolds gets furious about this accusation and the conversation devolves into a nasty diatribe. That, in essence, is what I'd call the ""inflection point"" of the story. It is at that exact moment that their relationship ""changes"" in the sense that Alma becomes more than just a muse as she stands her ground and demands equal footing. She realizes that the relationship has been lopsided in nature and is unwilling to ""do all the work"" anymore. Their relationship becomes quite toxic from that point onward. So does the relationship between Reynolds and Cyril, his sister. The toxicity reaches its culmination when Alma finally decides to ""teach"" Reynolds a lesson. She found a way to proverbially punish him and did so with resolve. At that point their relationship undergoes a final transition as they consummate it. 
The ending is disturbingly beautiful in the sense that we as the viewers get to peek behind the curtain. Right from the start I had a weird feeling that there's something off about their relationship and at the very end the movie confirmed my suspicion with the big reveal. We're basically fooled into believing that their relationship is highly dysfunctional when in reality they're, quite literally, perfect for each other."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,3/10,"The film has high production values, excellent acting which keeps your interest for for the two hours the film goes on. I would love to tell you how sumptuous the photography and locations are (they are) and how good the acting by the principals is ( It is ) but then you might want to watch this two hour film and I fear you would be disappointed with a film that in the end seems ambiguous at best and less than engaging at worst. Skip it."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,10/10,"Utterly superb performances from the three main actors in this unusual story. Every little detail about this movie is worthy of appreciation. The movie isn't going to appeal to the masses, but if you appreciate the art of movie making then this one will not fail to please. Lesley Manville as the sister of Daniel Day-Lewis's character is just great. She plays her role to perfection. The ending wasn't at all what I was expecting. A great movie in every sense of the word."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2021,9/10,"Interesting psychological tale based on Oedipus Complex, very classy and Elegant. Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as always."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,1/10,"I made it through two hours and walked out. That is pretty bad considering it was almost over and I did not care about missing the rest of it. I kept wondering when it would become dramatic or interesting in the least. It never does. The main character smiles incessantly at his next young lover. He has the maniacal leer of a 12 year old adolescent and that is how the film opens and carries on for 20 minutes. So I am immediately thinking ""he may be a talented designer but he is a moron and so is she."" There are no highs and lows throughout, just maudlin dialogue and frustrating relationships. The entire two hours I sat there was work and I could not make it all the way through."
PHANTOM THREAD,31 December 2020,8/10,"As with any DDL movie, you know that you'll be given a powerful acting performance. What I wasn't expecting was the performance by the female lead, by a relatively unknown actress. For most of the movie as a viewer, we're given a front row seat to a dysfunctional relationship that is difficult to understand why they continue to be together. Towards the end, the extent of their twisted co-dependence is slowly revealed. It sticks with the viewer and you observe the previous two hours with a different lens. A film that you appreciate more, after having completed it."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 December 2020,9/10,"Accepting to be poisoned in the name of love and thus finally allowing yourself to be vulnerable.... what a thought.Aside from the ending, my journey through Paul Thomas Anderson's career ended on a high note and I hope his future movies will continue this magnificent voyage. The cinematography went a level up here, I absolutely loved Vicky Krieps and especially Daniel-Day Lewis in the role of a ''cagelike'' man waiting to be opened or rather helped to open himself. I was fully immersed into the story, never look how much longer does it have until the ending.A 9.6 out of 10 from me."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 April 2018,8/10,"33 winning awards and 90 nominations, plus director PTA, and Daniel Day-Lewis, this is a guaranteed good movie.Short review, this is an unusual romantic story, story characters had a confusing and oppressive relationship, the movie mostly focused on 2-3 persons, a story about a blame temper genius designer, with his protector sister and his muse lately wife. Not going to summarize the story, there were many great reviews already written.*What I think/ What I learn
I am not fond of slow pieces movie, but this one is captivating, script timing just right, and their costumes and music are sophisticated. They are one of the best cinematography films I have seen, every cut is beautiful like a painting. It will leave you great impression because the plot was weird and slow, yet the art was so great to entice your eyes.To be honest, I don't know Daniel Day-Lewis before this movie. While watching, I was so amazed by his facial micro-expression, all the details built a man, his angry and pain is so true from the veins exposed and shaking hands. So I searched his name after and I was surprised by his amazing acting career achievements. Cooool.6/10 plot1/10 cinematics1/10 beautiful costume background + acting of Daniel Day-Lewis"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 April 2019,7/10,"He really loves what he's doing, I admire such enthusiasm. Somehow he's obsessed about it, but that's what beautiful. Great movie, I love what it's trying to say."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 July 2020,10/10,"For several years Paul Thomas Anderson has established himself as one of the best, if not the best, living director.
In his most recent work, he ventures to treat an apparently romantic story, but with an extremely deep, dark and twisted subtext.
Set in 1950s London, Reynolds Woodcock is a top dressmaker who unexpectedly crosses paths with a waitress, who will become her lover and muse.
In this story Paul Thomas Anderson leaves all his talent and intelligence. This makes the film difficult to digest and, like many of his works, requires some thought and analysis after viewing. This is probably due to the visual genius and dark beauty at its core that the creator tries so hard to hide from the viewer. In the case of 'Phantom Thread' this visual beauty, with such an elegant and dazzling staging, hides a story of a psychological suspense that would keep Alfred Hitchcock himself on the edge of the seat. In the same way, the story is disguised as a fairy tale romanticism, but with a chilling darkness.
If we wanted to summarize the greatness of this movie, we should probably refer back to its creator. Paul Thomas Anderson has proven to be a genius by any standards and shows no less with this tape. It is good to see that the great directors of yesteryear still have a descendant to match them. In a few years where cinema is more and more an element of consumption than an art in itself, seeing a film like 'Phantom Thread' shows that true cinematographic art still exists, hidden behind a large number of commercial films.
If cinema is still considered an art today, it is by directors like Paul Thomas Anderson and by films like 'Phantom Thread'."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2018,3/10,"There's a lot of potential in the movie's concept: brilliant 1950's fashion designer, creating fashions for Europe's upper crust, owns a cool 1950's British sports car, a confirmed bachelor who meets a waitress and dines with her that night. Could have gone places. Didn't. This is a slow movie about some very strangely damaged people somehow accommodating each other in ways neither my wife nor I could fathom. You know how you see some movies and wonder for two hours ""When's it going to start?"" That's this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 January 2018,5/10,"OK. Handsome older man and pretty young girl form a relationship instantly. He becomes abusive b/c that's who he is; so it's OK? He is a renowned dress designer, and has a psychotic personality. DD Lewis is perfect in his role. He is truly an amazing actor. His character in the film, to me, is a mix of Dr. Hannibal Lector and Mr. Rogers. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. It is painful to watch, and the ending makes you deny reality. I really don't like it, but DDL deserves an Oscar."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,6/10,"The film is billed as a 'crime/drama', and that's a bit misleading.Behold the indelible Reynolds Woodcock, of the House of Woodcock. He is a dress designing genius. He is wealthy, prominent, poised, cultured, polite, mild mannered, and impeccably dressed.Reynolds spends his days with a very specific routine in his enormous mansion that he shares with his spinster sister, Cyril.Similar to an autistic child, Reynolds despises being lead into anything new or different. He would be classified today as a true workaholic, performing and pouring untold hours into his creations with tremendous reward. Few can afford his time. Only the richest of socialites and even the Queen of a foreign country will be allowed his attention.Enter Alma.Alma is a bit of an uncultured hick by Reynolds standards, yet captures his heart anyway. She is also at least 25 years his junior.After moving in, Alma respects and conforms to the ways of the almost royal unspoken laws of conduct. But after a while, bit by bit, her country girl personality and spontaneous nature rises to the surface. In Reynold's mind, she commits to unspeakable crimes as in buttering and loudly chomping on her breakfast toast, slurping from bowls, and any number of innocent slip-ups that Reynolds firmly and sometimes cruelly rejects.Caught in the middle is Cyril, who does show compassion for Alma, but will not move more than a couple of inches in crossing her brother. Cyril understandably will not jeopardize her position in the hierarchy of all things Woodcock. Not a chance. She knows when to curtly cut off Alma, and Alma is smart enough to obey.And here is presented the great and timeless struggle of a woman bound and determined to influence her man, even though he is twice her age, has already been established and his ways set in stone for decades.While the couple grow contemptuous of each other, they never, NEVER break dishes or shout like the common folk do. That would be inexcusable. Instead, Reynolds defends his ways with soft-spoken but cold logic, while Alma consciously behaves in subtle ways to break her husband's attention. In one scene, Alma pours water into a glass painfully slow from high in the air at the dinner table, knowing the noise is driving poor Reynolds out of his skull.Though beautifully made, 'Phantom' moves at a deliberate crawl. I was invested enough to see it to the end, but my patience began to crack at the one hour mark. I couldn't help but check my watch here and there after that.There are many dark and deeply sinister turns this story could have taken, but it does not. If it had, it would have balanced the rigid and stoic tone to the film and made it truly memorable.The last 15 minutes of the film is just a very slow fade into an ending that left me flat and unsatisfied.At the end of the day, 'Phantom' just doesn't deliver."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 January 2018,7/10,"Phantom Thread no doubt has fantastic directing, acting and script, essentially without question from beginning to end. Every shot is filmed with utter perfection. However, what this movie lacks is relatability - at least for me anyway. It creates a man Reynolds Woodcock who is basically married to his work and cannot fall in love with another woman. Women enter and leave his life, but mean nothing to him. As he says himself, if he does get married he can only see himself being 'deceitful.' This is because Woodcock's work is his passion and women are like objects who do nothing but distract him. Every time Woodcock has enough of a woman he sends her away, because he cannot work with a distraction. Of course, this is only until he meets Alma, who challenges his personality in almost every way possible. The movie depicts the relationship between Woodcock and Alma, and the complex 'love' they share. Alma shifts between Woodcock's muse and lover, which is probably the best aspect of the film especially in terms of Vicky Krieps' acting, and it is a huge disappointment that arguably the best aspect of the film was not even recognised for a nomination at the Oscars. The problem with the film is the way the relationship between the two leads is revealed, and also concluded, is bizarre. Call it 'crazy love' or otherwise two crazy people in love, where control becomes the centre of both characters' traits, and their love for one another is almost entirely based on control of one another. When Woodcock is distracted, he will isolate himself and be rude. When Alma is annoyed by his behaviour, she will poison him to open up Woodcock's vulnerabilities. It is only when Woodcock is vulnerable, that he is able to love. It is not as if this is revealed in some major twist; it is more so depicted slowly throughout the film. However, for others, love can be simple, love can be succinct, and love can be uncompromising. For these two characters, love was something else. And, for these reasons, the movie may be difficult to understand or appreciate for some, including myself. The movie itself is almost comparable to TWBB with a deep 'character study' of a man, his actions, and his reasons for his actions, albeit in a different setting in the 1950s fashion era. TWBB was more humane and relatable, had greater character development and a better message. Phantom Thread can leave you feeling empty after leaving the cinema, despite watching an amazing directoral and acting set. If you can understand the concept of people doing very crazy things for love, even including hurting the person for your own satisfaction of 'love', then maybe Phantom Thread may be a masterpiece for you, along with the other amazing characteristics of the film. But, if you live a fairly normal life and you don't need bizarre acts to remain in love with your partner, you may be able to appreciate the acting and directing, but you will be dumbfounded by the relationship between the two characters as almost fictional. Yes, we all go through difficulties in our love life, but if a relationship is so tense, so difficult to continue, it will ultimately break down. If Phantom Thread had managed to capture a break down scene, between the characters themselves, rather than in isolation, the movie may have been substantially better. There was enormous acting potential for such a scene. But, instead what we get is two people who begin on the crazy spectrum, get crazier as they fall in love, build up so much potential for an epic finale, but get left with a phantom conclusion. Maybe that was the purpose of the film, but to be honest, TWBB stuck with me much more, mainly because it was a better character study overall."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 October 2018,8/10,"In Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread,"" Daniel Day Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, an elegant, meticulous, demanding couturier to royalty, aristocrats and famous women in '50s London. He is deeply set in his ways, never married, highly driven and obsessed with his designs. He lives and works in a beautiful townhouse (the House of Woodcock) with his sister/business partner, Cyril, marvelously played by Lesley Manville, who is really the best thing in the film. Reynolds, newly unattached after dumping the latest of a string of much younger girlfriends, meets Alma (Vicky Krieps, who glows and glides like a woman from a Vermeer painting), a young waitress from Luxembourg. Alma becomes his new muse, sewing assistant and model, and she moves into the townhouse with Reynolds and Cyril. Before long, however, they begin to clash over everything from how she butters her toast to his crotchety devotion to his rigid routine. ""Phantom Thread"" is mainly an exploration of their relationship, with some sumptuous fashion design as the backdrop, but the shining star of the movie is Manville as Cyril. She is brilliant, restrained, wise and visibly weary of holding everything together: the business, her prima donna brother's bloated ego. Well-deserved Oscar nomination for this wonderful actress. ""Phantom Thread"" is beautifully filmed, elegantly staged, and very weird in parts, but certainly a captivating film with very good acting from this trio of top-notch performers."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 December 2020,10/10,"I don't usually rate movies 10 stars, as none are perfect, but this film brought me so much satisfaction, has such richness, such scope of detail open to interpretation, that I have to, esp when you consider how low the film bar is as 2020 draws to a close.I can't believe I have not seen this 2017 film until today! Perhaps I should start paying attention to the Oscars again as no streaming service will ever feature this kind of film up top (I was digging on Hulu when I found it). I almost didn't watch it, as I'm kind of tired of British costume dramas about the upper classes (usually a fantasy about ""the great old days""), but I couldn't resist a costume drama about costumes, and Daniel Day-Lewis. He generally chooses good projects.There is so much more to this film than the smarmy ""dressmaker meets willful waitress"" teaser that is so typical Hulu. Alma is a waitress for about 2.5 seconds. After the meet, there is an amazing depth of detail, as we examine who the dressmaker, Reynolds (Day-Lewis) is and how the waitress fits into his life. Much food for thought, about love and sex (there is none on screen, which makes it almost scandalous) and the complications of categorizing and analyzing love and attraction. About the needs we carry from childhood into adulthood (a bit worn Freudian, but can be excused as all of us just want to be unconditionally cared for, don't we?). And, of course, about the stiff, too-silent, stuffy (literally, the dust coming from old wool rugs), fatally boring, typical higher class British environs (granted, I haven't lived in the UK for 45yrs, but I'm sure my experience applies to the 1930s). A world in which one views a pot of tea as the ultimate (only) rescue. I am also suddenly struck at the willingness, in our society, of women to lavish love and attention on complete, although handsome and talented, rude jerks (I think it's called ""male privilege"").The directing, set designing (I could almost smell the rooms) and cinematography are outstanding, as is the script. The acting is as physical as it is verbal. The body language, the sighs, the ""hmmmms"", the silence, the routine, but here disturbing, sounds of daily life. Day-Lewis is typically uneven, as he phones in his more banal lines, but does bring the meat of his character when it counts (we always forgive him!). He is perhaps the best physical actor of his generation (who will replace him?), so I can see why he was cast. Vicky Krieps, as Alma, the waitress, is so seamless that you might forget her, but that's the beauty of her performance. Gina McKee (the amazing Irene from The Forsyte Saga) has a cameo (what a waste!) in the 1st act, but I can't help wishing she was in the Alma role. She is still younger than Day-Lewis, which could have worked better, as Krieps' youth compared to Day-Lewis' lack of, is often shocking and distracting, as it surely would have been in the 1930s. Lesley Manville, as Cyril, the assistant, does a stunning job and really, really keeps us guessing.I wish PTA had explored the anti-Semitic times better here, or just left the few lines out entirely. As it is, they come off as hastily tacked on, at odd times, and very clumsy; almost insulting to the issue. There are other films which address the issue completely, but this isn't one of them, as it's a limited character study about 3 people and their private environs."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 March 2018,9/10,"An extreme display of the intimacy of the artist, and probably the best film in 2017.
The biggest surprise of this beautiful drama was Vicky Krieps's performance. In the film, this unknown Luxembourgian actress showed her unusual talent, did a fantastic job as well as the great Daniel Day-Lewis. 
The smooth and steady photography keep the rhythm of the film under a charming pressure, making the romantic plot become a fantasy, also reflecting Paul Thomas Anderson's unique personal style. Once again, proved that he is still one of the most creative and scuessful director in the world.
Therefore, this film is filled with a calm but powerful confidence that also is the professionalism that permeates every detail of the film."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 October 2018,9/10,"I'm really amazed how many one-star reviews are in here. No matter how people are rationalizing, it is because there are no easy pat solutions that gift wrap a shallow plot. Yes it is slow, quiet, and one big part of the story line seems to be making people uncomfortable. I thought the cinematography was beautiful, and esp. the score took me in almost immediately. DDL is brilliant as always, but I have to say that Vicky K steals the show. I am a little surprised to not have seen this mentioned here yet; but I saw so much of Meryl Streep in her."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 December 2018,7/10,"First of all - what a cowboy name for a designer!
I like the title letters, they are like the endless knot. And so is this movie. It leads nowhere, but strangely finds a cure for sociopaths. Give them a little bit of their own poison and you will live happily ever after. Maybe. This notion is the best that this film gives you, even better than the production design. I really liked the wallpapers so I won't complain about the production value, style over substance, and so on. It's brave to try to cover the truth with lots of lace and chiffon to make it watchable because the result may be pretentious and boring. And then if the truth isn't necessarily cathartic, the mushrooms are. But, to like the film I need to like the characters and they are not likable. I can't imagine what he sees in her or what she sees in him. The motif of poisonous love games and the uncertainty of love has been better used by François Truffaut in his Mississippi Mermaid (1969)."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 May 2020,,"It's difficult to determine if Paul Thomas Anderson purposefully made this film to sour the public's opinion of the great Daniel Day-Lewis for some diabolical reason or if Anderson simply ran out of unique and interesting stories to tell. Either way, two geniuses just made one of the dullest, dumbest films ever. A terrible shame that this was Mr. Day-Lewis' last."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 January 2018,7/10,"For any cinephile, going to the theater to see the latest Daniel Day-Lewis movie is considered mandatory viewing. The same goes for director Paul Thomas Anderson, who, like Day-Lewis, opts for quality over quantity by selectively releasing a piece of work once every 3 to 5 years. When combined, as they've done with 'Phantom Thread' (and the second such instance following 2007's 'There Will Be Blood'), the necessity in seeing the film is given an order of magnitude greater importance.At best, 'Phantom Thread' stands to receive a polarizing reaction from viewers. It's a fine (I'd say perhaps even exemplary) film within the drilled-down genre of ""English-set period-piece romantic dramas."" However, when judged from a broader perspective, the film is simply far less captivating than either Day-Lewis' or Anderson's prior work, and the rather esoteric ending leaves audience members wishing the two had dedicated their respective time and effort to another pursuit."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 January 2019,4/10,"Right off the bat, it's a disappointment because it's a boring slog; and doubly so because it's Daniel Day Lewis' final cinematic role, allegedly.The film is about a dressmaker, renowned and famous in London who begins to fall in love with a lower class woman. The plot is simple, and there are countless movies about a higher class individual and a lower class individual meeting and falling in love.This will be a short review so i'll say this first, the film has good sets, a good cast including Day-Lewis himself.I enjoy a good art house movie once in a while, and I've liked some of Paul Thomas Anderson's other films in the past; but this movie was putting me to sleep. I really like a film like Spike Jones' 2013 film Her, but that movie didn't put me to sleep because there are engaging things in that film and it hooked me within the first 10 minutes. The movie just repeats the same plot threads: Making a dress, dinner party, long stretches of talking, and repeat and repeat and repeat. Also to mention, this is the blandest performance i've seen by Lewis, and he just feels like he's phoning it in. And the pacing is so boring, so the ultimately thing that dragged it down was the studios choice to give Anderson this to direct. Seeing this movie i just feel like this was the wrong type of film for Anderson to direct in 2017.You have other reviewers saying that if you don't like it it's because you don't ""understand the deeper sophistication and art"". If i wanted that i'd watch Yoko Ono scream into a mike for two hours. When i'm watching a film i don't want a lecture and i don't need some director shoving his/her artistic flare down my throat, i'm watching it to get compelling drama, story and character development; that's not what this film has. I don't mean to be harsh but this movie gives me the same feeling as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apocalypse Now, and if i got it and made it part of my collection i'd just make me come off like some pretentious art student who wants to come across as DEEP! and IN THE KNOW!I'm giving this a 4 out of 10. At least i still have Lincoln to fall back on, or Gangs of New York."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 October 2021,9/10,"An intriguing take on love, possession, domination and control within the stuffy confines of 1950s Britain, Phantom Thread is a compelling and visually stunning film. There are some brilliant moments of almost unintentional humour and the central performances from Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville are magnetic.Moments of stillness and tranquillity are balanced fantastically against the brewing storms of emotion and the actors perfectly capture the intensity of a fraught yet passionate relationship.Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is as always masterful, every shot composed with finesse, and the overall craft here is as majestic as the garments made by Day-Lewis' character!"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,4/10,"I had really been looking forward to this film. I sincerely believed the hype which I had read.
Like the parson's egg some parts of it were excellent;. Daniel Day Lewis' acting. The overall art direction, the dresses, the inner workings of a renowned fashion house. The actors all stayed in character, it is the plot, the writing, that took bizarre and inexplicable twists. So confusing I am not sure what the ending of the movie was. Were the actions in several ending scenes, just fantastical visions of Alma?
Why would Reynold not be appalled at what happened to him, rather than appreciating it as some grand joke? Who would do anything that even, inadvertently could possibly (and did) cause harm to a very expensive garment, the result of painstaking labor on the part of up to twenty people and possibly be the source of a catastrophe to a royal wedding.
The best thing I can say about it is, that my husband and I did get two sincere laughs (but the only ones in the theater to do so) from scenes at the table. And Reynold's perfect explanation of their annoyance."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 December 2020,4/10,How disgusting is this movie depicting two sociopaths and a situation where a man totally dominates a woman who has no self respect? Hideous. I don't know what the pointn of this creepy movie was -- unless it appeals to guys who like to emotionally control women. Waste of time!
PHANTOM THREAD,6 April 2018,8/10,"It's an art movie, abstract and pure artistic pleasingness! This movie never tries to achieve anything except pure beauty, from its colors, dresses, post-WWII bourgeoisie it's set in and the elegant framing of P.T Anderson and the perfect acting from D.D Lewis. it's also a movie about perfection and perfectionists told by its two main characters through their relationship and love, full of contradiction and duality as one is a symmetric purist, a stickler for perfection, idealist, pedant and the other is spontaneous, unrehearsed, impulsive and unstudied asymmetrical yet they're both perfect in their own way and the fusion of this two forms of flawlessness is kinky, complementary yet cataclysmic as their two titan personalities can't but clash for dominance until they destroy each other. I am sure this movie need many watches before it will reveal all its secrets but for now am fondly in love with it."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,3/10,"I think people in the Academy should watch ""Dead Poet Society"" again or possibly for the first time(?) and tore that page of mathematically measuring art! That advise of course is an optimistic conclusion where we ignore theories of their politically corrupted system as the reason behind picking up too many worthless movies this year."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 January 2021,6/10,"DDL's character was not pleasant - the relationship between the main characters made me feel distinctly uncomfortable. The look of this film is beautiful, I couldn't workout where it was set, was it an English or a French fashion house. Looks lovely - the designed dresses were interesting - another uncomfortable element, poor women trussed up with lots of corsets and buttons."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 May 2018,1/10,"Dreary, Slow, and boring. All words that describe this POS movie that is nothing more than a waste of time. This movie is so slow we watched most of the second half of it at 2x, sometimes faster, and it was still slow. It's the kind of movie that you are happy when it ends. And even the ending was awful. 
SPOILER ALERT: The movie is about a bizarre and kooky tailor who finds a muse in a woman who becomes angry and jealous and then tries to kill him. But he likes that and so she repeats it. How nutty is that? People who liked this movie have be a little crazy themselves. OMG, please watch a rerun on TV, it will be far more interesting than this crappy movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 February 2018,3/10,"I didn't like the main character, Woodcock (for the most part . . . he did have a charming side which he showed stingily). He was a bully at times and as a love partner, took more than he gave knowing that his talent and money would substitute for actual effort. Alma is quite likeable. Her devotion to him is endearing. But she wants more. Here the movie starts to decline. Her solution to the logjam of their personality clash is to poison him. Oddly, it (his illness) makes him fall for her and seek marriage whereas he has known himself to be a bachelor up to now. I'm thinking to myself, ""That's just sick."" And I ask myself, ""Is it love any more when attempted murder becomes part of it? No wonder it takes her so long to answer ""yes"" to his marriage proposal! It's not surprising that the marriage fails miserably but we're asked to believe that another poisoning is just the remedy and that the whole ritual is some sort of acceptable romantic dance . . . and we're asked to accept that it works. Woodcock figures it out and since it's OK with him it should be OK with us. I endure a lot of pain at times when I have bowel trouble so I have a lot of trouble seeing this as a happy ending. I don't understand why the critics liked it so much."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 July 2018,2/10,"One of the most boring and on the whole, one of the most awfully written movies ever made, I am surprised how ""Phantom Thread"" is in the 2017's top 10 list of National Board of Review. It feels like a completely typical period piece that was done to death and felt like it was trying hard to get nominated for Oscars. In simple words, it is just ""try hard"" movie that was simply made for being nominated because it looks so different than other ones. Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps have given a very good performance, can't take anything away from them. The characterization given to Day-Lewis was not bad, but at the same not something that we have not seen before. And, Krieps's character is obviously the polar opposite of what Day-Lewis's character is. The way they fall in love is done very abruptly. And, during that and after that, all the movie does is repetition. A whole lot of plotlines are simply showing their polarizing characters and just that. Then, we don't know why but Krieps poisons Day-Lewis kind of like to .... develop some romance, I guess. Then, after that plotline is over, we get the repetition ..... again! Then towards the end, he agrees to get poisoned because that's the only way he can be with her, because he is some sort of a terrible stubborn ..... I think. It doesn't sound so bad, but it's done quite horribly. During all the repetitions, a brief character development of Lesley Manville's character is there. Otherwise, until towards the end, at the point where I stopped caring about this movie, we get literally no character development whatsoever. It was the same thing in a slightly different situation. The storytelling is very very poor. The only merits are the performances of the lead actors, the production and costume design. Else, nothing is redeeming about this movie. I still have an opinion that ""The Shape of Water"" is the worst best picture ever. But it wasn't the worst nominee in that category. Guess which one was? Yup. ""Phantom Thread"". In short, it's a ridiculous period piece and a ridiculous romantic movie that doesn't even have the most generic romance.Score : 2.1/10Grade : E+Label : Will forget after you watched it once"
PHANTOM THREAD,15 November 2020,7/10,"Tense, dark, calm, paced, consistent, brooding, sad, subtle, strong!I enjoyed this film for its nuanced and subtle but jarring story of love. Our lead is strong, unlikable sometimes, but understandable throughout. An interesting and honest take on what it means to love someone unconditionally."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 May 2021,10/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my favorite directors. His style has matured as his career continued. During the early stages of his career, Anderson was emulating the style of the likes of Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman. In the 2000's and beyond, the filmmaker offered more challenging and unique films. From the slow-burning period anti-western There Will Be Blood, to the hypnotic psychological drama The Master, to the incredibly complex and drug-fueled Inherent Vice, and now the slow-burning dreamy romantic period drama Phantom Thread.Phantom Thread was legendary actor Daniel Day-Lewis' final film before he retired from acting, and his performance as renowned dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock is impeccable as he delivers a performance to mark an end to his incredible career. Day-Lewis is paired eye-to-eye with Vicky Krieps, who gives a surprisingly amazing performance. Jonny Greenwood's score is delicate as it plays a role throughout the film."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 February 2018,7/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best screenwriters working today, and he delivers here with an intelligent, sophisticated, and twisted romance. Daniel Day-Lewis, in his last film, delivers another breathtaking and masterful performance. Paul Thomas Anderson and crew master many filmmaking elements, well deserving of all those Oscar nominations. However, ""Phantom Thread"" isn't without its boring scenes, lack of emotion or reasons to care about the characters, and implausible character decisions.There are so many good adjectives one could think of when describing the aesthetic and filmmaking process of ""Phantom Thread."" Like so many other Oscar nominated films, it is a technical and visual masterpiece, but that does not mean it's a true masterpiece. The acting, writing, and cinematography are practically perfect, and save the movie from sheer boredom. Daniel Day-Lewis' narcissistic and emotionally-cold Reynolds Woodcock (very cleverly named) is a very interesting character to watch, but not one worth caring about. His quips and abrupt aggressive demeanor are hilarious and very quotable. His narcissism, obsession for his work, and OCD-like daily structure alienate those closest to him. The relationship between Reynolds and his romantic interest Alma (played wonderfully by Vicky Krieps) goes from romantically peaceful to uproariously vile.Some of the things that Alma does to get Reynolds attention are something you would see in a Stephen King novel. The ending (I dare not spoil it) may leave some viewers scratching their heads wondering why. Why!? Because Paul Thomas Anderson is a true filmmaker; meaning, he has balls and uses them (remember ""Magnolia"").""Phantom Thread"" is an artistic, beautifully filmed, masterfully acted, sporadically boring Oscar bait vegetable movie with some hilarious lines from Daniel Day-Lewis. Daniel, you will be missed."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 May 2021,9/10,"Though I think DDL is the best actor on the planet, well one of them for me, I didn't think this movie was in my wheelhouse , but since DDL was retiring I had to watch it anyway. I'm ALWAYS blown away with his ACTING and once again he didn't disappoint. He's the best that's it. The movie was a 5 his acting a 14 therefore a 9. Bill the Butcher, Hawkeye, Daniel Plainview, or Lincoln and now Reynolds Woodcock all completely different personalities and characters but only ONE Actor played marvelously by DDL. I watched this twice back to back enthralled by his acting, had to see it again not for the movie but just to watch him again so PERFECTLY portraying his craft. He is one of the best of all time. Surely he's not done."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,1/10,"An aggravating and tediously slow storytelling that is about nothing, and goes nowhere, unless happy endings built on sadomasochistic relationships are your thing. The sister's icy gaze and mannerisms are worthy of the Nurse Ratched Award, and kudos to the background collective of seamstresses who gave the film it's only glint of humanity. For those who willing to endure the over two hours of self-indulgent posturing and loathsome, dis-functional bickering, the truly sick abhorrence of the ending may make you holding back your vomit.A feel-bad movie where the award should go to - if you were hoping for any inspiration, beauty and form - the car."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 January 2018,5/10,"This is an unusual film (not to say ""weird"", but some will). It is not a naturalistic account; while apparently set in 1950's London, with non-magical human characters, it is nevertheless a fantasy of a kind. The acting, sets, and costumes are of the highest level. It took me a while to decide how to view this film, and longer to decide how to evaluate it.Alma is working as a waitress in a hotel pub. An elderly and powerful man descends on the place for breakfast, and, noticing her beauty, tests her by seeing how if she can remember his complex breakfast order. She passes his test, and he invites her to dinner, and then back to his house. He strips her to her slip and an elderly woman whom he refers to as ""Old So-and-so"" arrives and records her measurements as he wields the tape. ""You have no breasts,"" he observes. ""I know. I'm sorry."" ""I can give you breasts,"" he responds. ""If I choose."" At the end of this session, he takes her to a room and says ""This will be your room. It is next to mine.""Stripped (as it were) to the essentials, this encounter just about mirrors the kind of male dominance fantasy we find in the opening chapter of a pornographic novel like ""Belinda Blinked"".* The parallels don't end there. The man - Reynolds Woodcock, fashion designer to the rich and royal - in fact presides over a houseful of women, assisted by his sister, Cyril. Wealthy women come to him, and he has the power to make them beautiful, if they will do as he demands. The difference between this and ordinary porn (or magical fantasy porn) is that Woodcock is physically celibate, as far as we ever determine; his servants are seamstresses, his clients are buying dresses, and his demands on his clients consist of fittings and customer loyalty; but he is as self-centered and intolerant of women's independent existences as any male BDSM protagonist in the tradition of the Marquis de Sade. It is all dominance. Woodcock's whims are law. Salaries and benefits are never discussed with Alma, and she does not care. She only wants to be needed and loved by this powerful man. But he does not need her and does not want to - that's the basic conflict.Reviewers of this film often refer to Alma** as Woodcock's ""muse"". I believe that this is a mistake, whether you use the word in the mythological sense or in the most watered-down modern sense of a male artist's girlfriend who sort of inspires him. I believe Alma would very much like to be Woodcock's muse, but he doesn't want one. In reality she is sort of like an impulsively purchased pet. Beyond living in the room next to his and eating breakfast quietly with him, it's not clear that Woodcock really has plans for what she should do. He sends her in as one of his models at one point to a fashion show being held in his own house, and she enjoys herself, displaying his creations with a joyous and flirtatious flair. But this contrasts with the dour and robotic mien of his other models, and I believe this is why we never see him use her this way again. After that, she is largely relegated to appearing before clients with the rest of his women, all in pretty much identical white lab coat things. ""I live here,"" she insists on telling a Belgian princess on one such occasion. It is an unheard scream.Alma wants Woodcock to notice her, but he just wants to have her at hand. Beyond this mismatch of goals, Alma also has her own thoughts and judgments, not to mention a desire to butter her toast even though it scrapes on Woodcock's hypersensitive auditory nerve, and these are like sand in the gears of the machine of his life. Trying to break through his ice, Alma proposes to surprise him by sending all the other servants away, making his dinner, and having him to herself. Cyril warns her that this will go badly, and it does. She needs another solution.Now, let me pause for a second here.It ought not to be lost on anyone that this is a film, and that the whole issue of women determining how to address the dominance fantasies of powerful men is precisely relevant to the film industry (not to mention every other aspect of the world) at this time of #TimesUp. This film is a not a naturalistic account. It is a fantastic fable, the rules of which have been laid down not by life but by writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, real-life heavyweight in that industry and creator of the Woodcock universe. This means that he is morally responsible for the lessons that this fable teaches. So, what are they?I don't want to recap and spoil too much, but basically we learn that within the male dom is a male sub longing to be a helpless baby in his mother's arms. (I don't think this is actually evidence-based.) ""Everything (you) want to know is in books""!*** (I endorse this one. In general.) And that a woman can get what she want if she is willing to play the dominance game as ruthlessly as a man. At this point something awakens in me and says, ""Really?"" Is this really a lesson we want to promote in the world of Harvey Weinstein? That's the way to go - just playing the game harder and more skillfully - not changing the rules, or escaping and finding a better place, or realizing that it's a bad game, or writing an anonymous article?I wouldn't be as sensitive to this if it were not for the fact that the questions of ""what women should do and are entitled to do"" are being intensely debated right now. And I'm not saying that the denouement is bad in the terms of the Woodcock universe. It may even be satisfying there. But I do feel that there are certain moments in history, when particular things and particular solutions are being struggled over in the real world, that make it jarring at least, or inappropriate and counterproductive, for fantastic solutions in fantasy universes to soak up the publicity that ought to go to real solutions in our own universe.""So, you are giving this movie a bad rating out of political correctness?"" Call it what you like. The principle that the reviewer is addressing only the technical and artistic skill of the producers, and not the social effects of the product, is not universally accepted.* subject of the podcast ""My Father Wrote a Porno""** inequality of naming is endemic to the film. I believe we only hear Alma's last name (Elson) once in the film, and it doesn't appear in the credits (the same is true of other female characters)*** Lincoln"
PHANTOM THREAD,31 January 2021,7/10,"Phantom Thread tells the story of two people who, at first glance, could not be more different. In the course of the plot, however, it turns out that they need each other more than first thought. The relationship of the two seems strange, seems false, seems bizarre. It is put to regular tests, but no one can divide them, because they are connected by an invisible thread.Rarely I have seen a movie where I would say the title is perfectly chosen. It represents both the frame story and the connection between the two main characters.The first half of the movie is tough. The focus is primarily on Reynolds' passion towards his profession. It is fascinating to see how a person really subjects everything to a certain activity / conviction. Acting-wise, it's also really well played. Unfortunately, the movie as a whole didn't get going at this point. The plot dragged on and it wasn't clear to me in which direction the movie actually wanted to go. Drama, character study, love story or the cat and mouse game of two people trying to improve the other.The staging, the accurate shots at first sight wonderfully reflect the attitude of the main character. As soon as it comes to looking inside, the movie has a hard time. It's addressed, you're supposed to think it, but as a viewer you can't empathize. This is mainly because the characters are anything but approachable.Towards the end, the movie picks up speed again. However, this can't take away from the fact that the movie's running time is noticeable due to its slow narrative style. Phantom Thread is definitely a special movie, you have to be in the mood. If you don't know what it's about, then it can get you off on the wrong foot."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 March 2018,5/10,"Life imitating art or vice versa? In this movie the characters all tip toe around the 'genius' of Day Lewis' character. Saluting his artistry and talent as a dress designer to royals and others of good breeding etc. Monied people, in other words.
And how different is the movie from real life. Everybody nodding appreciatively at DDL's performance. I've watched most of his movies and I always get the feeling I'm watching an actor who knows he's being watched. This isn't method acting - it's showing off. 
There's nothing to like or to feel sympathy towards the main character. His behaviour is childish, self indulgent and precocious. The Alma character acts like a saint. And I got the feeling the actress was feeling the same way about DDL's performance."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 March 2018,10/10,"Perfection in cinematic form is rarely achieved, even in the greatest of films, but one that comes close is Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread"", the story of a fictional renowned fashion designer in London in the mid-1950s who finds his muse in the body of a clumsy, lower class immigrant girl (who might have been a Jewish refugee from the Nazis). Daniel Day-Lewis plays the obdurate couturier Reynolds Woodcock; Vicky Krieps, the muse Alma; and Lesley Manville, Reynolds' sister and manager Cyril - the three characters comprise the trio of 'instruments' of P.T. Anderson's cinematic chamber film in which every composition, every camera movement, every character nuance is marked by his superior directorial control. The acting of the three stars is incomparable, each perfectly matched to play off each other - sometimes in harmony, sometimes in extreme dissonance - and this may be the finest performance of Day-Lewis's career, even considering his ""Lincoln' of 2012. But it is Anderson who controls the film with utter mastery, his camera lovingly focusing on close-ups of colored threads guided through lace and thick fabrics, gliding sensuously over luxurious dresses, traveling through the many ornate rooms of the House of Woodcock. Anderson not only directed, he co-wrote the script over several years with Daniel Day-Lewis, and even served as his own cameraman (uncredited). Actually a precise cinematic allegory of the romantic relationship paradigm, the film often echoes Hitchcock (""Vertigo"", ""Rebecca"", even ""Psycho"") in its portrayal of an obsessive love that serves as a direct metaphor for the forming of a romantic bond with another, yet it also reaches into the rich baroque luxuriousness of Max Ophüls. How much does one have to give up in a relationship? How does one balance a personal creative calling with another's needs? Do we always ""hurt the one we love?"" Clichés are both encompassed and transcended in ""Phantom Thread"", one of the most intimate, insightful and stylish films of recent years. P.T. Anderson himself operates uncompromisingly here, using every filmmaking technique on a creatively heightened level, and in the service of his own personal art. Even Jonny Greenwood's opulent score with its twisting piano chords and rapidly-moving strings conveying hallucinatory neuroticism with ghostly melancholy occasionally runs simpatico with the characters, but sometimes intriguingly counter to the image, conveying relationship disharmony, becoming an emotional synthesis for the moment. In future years there is no doubt this film's reputation will tower. This is the film Anderson has been working towards his whole career, and, so far, his masterpiece."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 June 2021,7/10,"I'm quite a fan of PTA. Except for Inherent Vice. I just didn't get that. And I HATED Magnolia when I first saw it where now it's one of my favourite movies.I didn't expect a lot from this either to be honest. I'd avoided it like the plague because effete upper class fashionistas aren't really my cup of tea but as it happened it was actually quite amusing.The music wasn't as powerful or moving as it was in Magnolia but I grew up in a very toxic household so this was like normal behaviour to me. It took me years to realise what i took to be normal behaviour was toxic and to put it bluntly, insane. But as my mother keeps reminding me, who's normal? And I think she's right. We're all a little bit mad, aren't we?Aren't we?"
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2018,7/10,"A fairy-tale story in which a lonely boy wants to keep playing with his toys and treating people as objects, and never to actually face or engage with the world, until the young woman he ensnares forces him to change. What makes it interesting to discuss is the multiple story-lines that thread through it. At times we are in a story about an artist who must maintain his integrity but also remain popular, and we fear that love will ruin this. At times we are in a story about a man surrounded by women, controlled by women, and haunted by women, looking for a way out of persecution. At times we are in a story of a young woman looking for fun and love who ends up in a house belonging to a spoiled brat and his mean and jealous mother-figure. Will she run, or will she find enough reason to stay? Will she be able to catch the thread of his love for his mother and tie him to herself?It is a beautiful and suspensefully-told love story but it is not feminist. He is successful and famous, she is a modest and kind. She doesn't try to take over the artistry, she aims to take control of the home-life, so that the man can continue being the famous artist, and she can be famous in the house. In this way, the movie is not a huge feminist statement. It is simply a statement that, even in a male-dominated world, a healthy heterosexual relationship must be brokered by both strong independent people, not just the man. If you are looking for a raging fireball of cinema and equal rights, check out ""Camille Claudel"" (1988)."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 February 2018,7/10,"Phantom Thread is essentially a study of a dysfunctional relationship: a man imprisoned by his own obtuse, fixated nature, and the attempts of one young, strong-willed woman to pull him out of it.Reynolds Woodcock, a renowned dress-maker for elite ladies in 50s London, is as stiff as a hat stand, ritualistic and firmly set in his ways. He demands that those who take breakfast with him do so in stony silence, lest the sound of a knife scraping on toast should interrupt his precious thought train as he sketches his designs. In his lavish Georgian home, he is surrounded by women; his bourgeois clients, his seamstresses, his strangely cold, waspish sister, Cyril, and an unhappy, ignored woman occupying the position of 'wife'. We also learn that he is deeply attached to his late mother, who often visits him in his dreams.
Based on the setup, I actually assumed that the plot might revolve around Reynolds being a closeted homosexual furnishing a fake marriage, but that's actually not where it goes at all.Things change for Reynolds when he decides to acquire a new girl to fill the abdicated role of muse/model/partner and discovers Alma, a friendly, unpretentious German waitress, who strikes up an immediate attraction with him and agrees to live at his house in London, to wear his dresses and accompany him to expensive dinners, etc, without fully understanding the sterile, suffocating artifice this life will entail. As time goes on, she becomes increasingly frustrated by Reynolds' lack of affection for her and devises a plan to make him truly hers.The performances are stellar. Daniel Day Lewis' silver-voiced portrayal of Reynolds is totally believable, everything from how he curls his spindly body in a chair to how he loses his temper backstage during a dress show conveys his internally enraged nature. It becomes amusing to watch him grimace at the crunch of toast or the loud pouring of tea and these inflections are where much of the film's humour lies. Vicky Krieps' sweet and natural performance as Alma is the perfect foil to the pretentiousness of the Woodcock household. A real delight is Lesley Manville as Cyril, whose regal poise and glacial stare give off the aura of a venomous snake about to strike at any moment. She gets the best lines.The film is shot beautifully, with portrait lenses capturing the intimacy of each moment with a painterly composition and soft light, to which Johnny Greenwood's delicate piano score is the perfect accompaniment.The main question however, is any of this entertaining? My initial reaction was mixed. Despite the film's obvious beauty and solid performances, I couldn't help but find it rather slow, tedious and dull at times. There are so many sequences of people trying on dresses, eating dinner or sipping tea, and even though there are lots of subtle emotional cues being inferred with the clink of a knife or the glance of a head, it can feel preposterously artificial at times. In many ways it seems to suffer from the same boring affectation as its protagonist, which may be deliberate, but doesn't make for an engaging watch. There are few dramatic payoffs for the palpable tension, which builds to a whistle, but never quite catches fire and that is a bit of a let down.The relationship between Alma and Reynolds is also questionable given their age gap and the distinct lack of sexual chemistry between them. We see very little of anything in Reynolds for a young whimsical girl like Alma to actually love, though she does anyway. Even their first meeting in a cafe feels a bit contrived, it's not conceivable that she could fall for him so easily over a breakfast order, especially one that telegraphs his weird obsessiveness so early on. Even less conceivable - and without wanting to give too much away- is the bizarre turn their dysfunctional relationship takes towards the film's end.An intelligently crafted film from all departments, but a little overdressed."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 April 2018,5/10,"The trailer hooked me onto this film, but the actual thing was a disappointment in many respects. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in (yet another) superb performance, completely believable and compelling. He allows us to experience the frustrations of a genius/madman who needs his world ordered in a particular way but is dependent on others for keeping it that way. He rules the roost and everyone kow-tows to him. But the young woman he falls for proves to be stubborn, willful, and yet she seems to appreciate his artistry more than anyone else. This is a story about two people drawn to one another who are clearly really bad for each other. And that's where I lost interest, because it lost credibility. Yes, a genius can mesmerize a young woman, and said woman may abandon everything for a chance at hanging around a genius, but for their relationship to take the turn it finally did in the film is just plain dumb. There is a lot of creepiness in this film, and the trailer prepares you for it, but it does not prepare you for the actual source of that creepiness. That was a surprise indeed, and my hat's off to the screenwriter for that. The film is artistic, well crafted, and in the case of the protagonist and his sister, superbly acted. But it is also ponderous, self-absorbed, and ultimately not very interesting. There are lots of dead-end bits that you think will lead to something, but they don't. There are a few lovely dresses, but I have to say that even that I found uninspiring; it felt like we were supposed to oooh and aaah when each new dress was shown, but frankly none of them were appealing. Ultimately there just wasn't enough here to justify over 2 hrs of time."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 November 2019,7/10,"Interesting, pretentious and all at once pretty to watch.
Though I have to say, Reynolds was such a pain in that it was almost hard to finish watching.
No idea what to think of this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 January 2021,10/10,"Mr. Woodcock is a very talented man with a passion for his craft. For many years, he has held a great status quo and reputation for his talent in fashion along with the help of his beloved sister; however, it all changes when he falls in love with Alma. The two are clearly opposites, but Mr. Woodcock is fulfilled when he is with her. What I most liked about the film was the part of how Alma took care of him when he felt sick; through sickness, Mr. Woodcock saw his mother in a dream and realized something. Even though he loves his craft, Alma is a priority in his life because through sickness, he felt cared for. When he was about to drift away, Alma made sure to remind him by feeding him to fall sick again. A great film that shows how when you fall in love with a woman it all changes. Thank you P.T.A for a great gem."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 July 2020,2/10,"If you are going to watch this film, you are watching for Day-Lewis' performance. But after that, it is an incredibly SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW film. I saw it in the theatre and fell asleep 4 times. I re-watched on video and thought ""thank God it's almost over - BUT IT WAS ONLY ON FOR 25 MINUTES!!!"" Day-Lewis is haunting in his performance; masterfully crafted, but the Woodcock is an unlikeable, spoiled character - there is nothing redeeming about his personality. Manville's sister act is good as well (fairly creepy but good). The problem? This script is just BORING!!!! It goes noplace slowly. Unlike their previous collaboration, THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Outside of Day-Lewis and Manville, everything else would be a 5-6 outta 10. But that script - THAT script kills the picture, kills the spirit and drops this to a 2 if that good."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 May 2020,9/10,"Phantom Thread is a delicate and crude film at the same time, as it deals with the execution of art, from the artisan weft to the final result, which, in the case of the film, are dream dresses that go beyond materiality, bringing secret messages and auguries literally filled in.His character Reynolds Woodcock is woven asymmetrically between an absurdly cordial and delicate perfectionist and an explosive, self-centered, and authoritarian personality.Between one affair and another, where the choice seems to focus less on passion and more on the aesthetics of the woman who accompanies him as a model, the couturier is assisted by his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville, high performance). She protects him from any external distractions, fixes his mistakes, dismisses his occasional companions, and keeps him protected in his predictable world.During one of his trips to the countryside, Reynolds allows Alma (Vicky Krieps) to enter his life. Alma, the Latin word for soul, is a waitress who animates that being so controlling and so controlled quickly becomes her muse, model, and, surprisingly, the great love of his life.When asked why he never married, Reynolds replies to Alma, ""I make dresses,"" and recognizes himself as an incurable bachelor.When she goes to live in the house where the sewing studio also works, the girl soon realizes the symbiotic relationship between the brothers, and the romance seems doomed to the failure that has always characterized Reynolds' relations.When she is harassed by him, in a loving situation engendered by her, Alma knows that if she remains submissive, she must leave the house.To change the situation, she tries a solution that reveals a dark face that we will later discover is common to both. Or a metaphor to all conjugal relationships?Director Paul Anderson Thomas, who also does cinematography, seems to want to scan the characters' intimacy through close-ups that always show a peace that does not exist."

Phantom Thread has a very strange story. 
Lets get some things straight, the cinematography, the sound, and the acting were ravishing. 
Daniel Day Lewis is creepily attractive, and Vicky Krieps is surprisingly a wonderful actress. 
I really liked how individually unique they both were. their personalities were flourishing throughout the movie, and the love between them is also a battle of their personalities. It is hard to breathe at times as the tense chemistry is beyond the roof.

PHANTOM THREAD,11 April 2018,5/10,"I think this is the year of the overrated film. Two of my favorite filmmakers, Guillermo del Toro and Paul Thomas Anderson have apparently made 2 of the most highly rated films of their careers. The problem is that neither film is really all that much. What sank The Shape of Water was not the acting, cinematography, or the production design. That was all superb. The problem was a horribly flawed script that didn't seem to develop a single likable character. 
Phantom thread suffers from the same issues. The acting is quite remarkable really. Lesley Manville is particularly wonderful in creating sympathy for a very complex character. DDL is fantastic, but then what else is new. Vicky Krieps was completely enchanting. However, I could not give a rat's ass about any of their characters. There is a moment in the film where someone is about to be poisoned and I found myself thinking is the poison for him or for herself. The fact that I was wishing for both of their deaths is not a good sign.
The score was good and the sets and costumes were great. I loved all the beautiful shots of the details of dress making. I like DDL but his character was dreadfully unappealing even though I lean towards sympathy for artists, knowing that sometimes creativity is a very jealous mistress. Alma payed by Vicky Krieps was beautiful and interesting, but by the end of the film I had no sympathy for her either. The bottom line is that PTA made a very personal film here. The title's initials are PT and I don't think that's a coincidence. I like personal films. But I think we have reached a point in film cricitism where a highly acclaimed film at the same time can be dreadfully slow, boring, and void of an interesting plot. PTA says that Hitchcock was a influence for this film, and that is clear in watching this film. However Hitchcock never made a boring film in his life except for maybe Under Capricorn. To me this is the first film PTA has made that was not entertaining in any way. I think he thought he was creating a lot more intrigue in these scenes than was really there. I'm still a PTA fan but this film missed the mark for me. It is very much like a play, and now that I think of it maybe that's where this story belongs. It's sort of a parlor mystery, but without the mystery."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 October 2018,2/10,"Spoilers: I don't care that Daniel Day Lewis is the protagonist or that the cinematography is fantasitic or that it won an Oscar for costume design. This has to be the most boring, dreary movie ever. I can't believe it got so many praise from critics. Thank goodness for Netflix, where I could fast forward hoping something would happen, but no. Even when Alma attempst to poison him, a scene that in the hands of Hitchcock would be riveting, I kept thinking just kill him already so that this movie can end!! And the tinkling of the stupid piano for 2 hours straight, I thought I would go crazy.You would be better served watching any Hitchcock film, where the music alone builds up a frenzy of suspense and the fantastic editing of a master makes it even more thrilling. I love fashion, but the half dozen outfits shown were just so-so. For a fun ""fashion"" movie actually set in that era, watch Funny Face, with Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. Every time Audrey is on the screen wearing little ballet slippers and black pants to that foto shoot where she dons and prances wearing dozens of gorgeous outfits, you have a smile on your face. Watching Lewis measure, and tuck, and sew on Alma's tall, wimpy, pathetic body is like watching grass grow...aaaargh!!!!"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 October 2018,7/10,"Film snobs and Daniel Day-Lewis fans will love this movie. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy fine acting and are patient enough to let a story unwind, you will find this film engrossing. If you're looking for a movie with flash/bang, car chases, or any type of action, this ain't for you."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2021,9/10,"I was admittedly rather nervous to see this film, Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my favorite filmmakers working today and I didn't want one of his films to completely drop the ball. Yet as the film began I was hooked by its atmosphere, score, and tremendous direction and writing from Anderson. Like with There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson somehow manages to make a romance between a waitress and an eccentric fashion designer to be something that's intriguing and complex, and after this film I don't believe I'll be doubting Paul Thomas Anderson again.I would say that this film is one of Paul Thomas Anderson's warmer films, but I don't think that would be necessarily true. Phantom Thread is a deceptive film, and while it may seem warm and inviting when you first examine it, you'll only find a much more strange and unsettling experience when you're done with it. I've noticed that Paul Thomas Anderson has a thinly veiled love affair with irony, as it's often present in many of his films and especially in his newer ones.Phantom Thread starts off as a simple gothic romance, but Anderson's playfulness with genre conventions and tropes shines through. His penchant for character psychology and ironic set ups continues to shine through with Phantom Thread, you expect one thing to happen in the movie, yet then something else happens instead. It is this unpredictability that keeps Anderson's films fresh in my mind.I do wonder if Reynolds is on the autism spectrum or has Aspergers disorder, as he does share many of the mannerisms that's apparent with many people who have it, as well as his almost child-like adherence to his routines. There were times where I just wanted to smack him and tell him to stop being such a sourpuss, but I can certainly understand his frustrations when it comes to change. Being an Aspie myself, I understand his need to be in control and to constantly stick to schedule. But I couldn't fully sympathize with him either, and I don't believe that Anderson intended to make us sympathize with him. Alma on another hand, constantly challenges Reynolds and attempts to take him out of his comfort zone, rather it be in subtle or more obvious ways. In many ways, they're meant for each other.The romance itself is contradictory and elusive, not being able to be held down by a straight forward description. It is loving and tender, yet also dysfunctional and trying on both of the parties involved. It very much captures the trials and tribulations of a relationship, though it becomes much more sinister as the film goes along. I found Anderson's flair for irony, where he shows one thing in a scene, and then suggests something else. Sure, perhaps Reynolds and Alma will be happy together, but there's that lingering bad taste from the manipulation and her basically forcing him to bend to her will in order for this romance to work. It is peak, classic Paul Thomas Anderson to be confronted with such contradictory emotions and that subtle feeling of discomfort that's layered into the film as it goes on, and I think what makes his films so fascinating.I loved this film, to be frank. I was taken in by this film's sense of atmosphere, scope, and character. Jonny Greenwood's score was once again a delight from beginning to end, bringing a romantic and etherial sound while also having a sinister mood lurking in the background. But the real winner of this film is the acting, Daniel Day-Lewis gives his supposedly final performance with Phantom Thread and he gives it his all as per usual. While I do think that his role as Daniel Plainview is superior to this one, his turn as Reynolds Woodcock showcases his knack for completely disappearing into the characters that he plays. He is also complimented by a strong supporting cast consisting of Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville, who bring performances that compliment Lewis' intensity and drive.It's quite strange for me when I see Paul Thomas Anderson in interviews, he seems like a rather straight forward, laid back kind of guy, yet he'll make these films full of dramatic intensity and I just can't have enough of them."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film revolves around an eccentric dressmaker, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) who treats his life just like his art. Everything needs to be perfectly planned out and timed, if this isn't the case he won't function for the rest of the day. He treats the people around him like the tools the tools which he needs to make his art. One day he meets the young waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) whom he is automatically drawn to. To him she is the perfection of imperfection (to remain as vague as possible). This is Paul Thomas Anderson's best film since There Will Be Blood. He constructs a film that feels so authentic for what it is trying to tell. The camera moves swift and sleek through rooms, staircases and streets giving the film this feel of artistic control. This is meant to represent the character of Reynolds, he tries to control every aspect of his life. Often this results in very painful situations for his sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) and his muse Alma. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing in this role, he pulls of this character by playing him naturally. He doesn't go overboard with his performance and is very subdued, sometimes there is a sense of boiling anger within his eyes. Day-Lewis' performance keeps this character engaging and helps the audience understand him and get behind him. What's so good about Reynolds is that he is likeable enough even though he often is contemptible, he never becomes too unlikeable for the audience. Vicky Krieps is equally engaging in her performance as Alma. At the start of the film she adds vulnerability but throughout the film the strength of her character grows. It was really interesting seeing these two interact and play off each other. What else should be noted is the score by Jonny Greenwood who composed a score contemporary for the time period the film is set in. However the score also acts as the representation of Reynolds' mood swings. When everything is in control and well the music would be calm and quiet piano. However when the anger rises within him the score would turn to more violent and aggressive violins. The costumes and dresses also kept the film interesting and authentic. In particular the beautiful dresses that are used inside the film, it makes it easy for the audience to see Reynolds as the artist he is. There some issues that I had with Phantom Thread, mostly I thought this film was a little unfocused at times. Some scenes felt unnecessary and dragged on. I thought Vicky Krieps was great in the film, however I thought that the film should've explained better why she decides to be with Reynolds who constantly tries to control her. Phantom Thread is a slow film, I feel like I must warn you. The story never goes through large twists and there are no bombastic scenes that made other films of Anderson so memorable. Many will see this film as pretentious and boring and I can understand that. This film should more or less be seen as a painting. For some it is just a bunch of colors thrown on a canvas. However if you let it, it can show you something unexpected. If you mentally prepare yourself for this film. This could very well leave a huge stamp on you."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 February 2018,,"Resisted a higher score due to what I feel is the restrained potential in the overall plot. I understand a sparse script and plot is intentional, but it leaves the feeling that more could be done with this.A man's longing for his mother's embrace, creating beauty to honor her in elegant fashion. Contributing to higher art. But this longing and natural disinclination to discover his true purpose in life leads this wanderer to attempt to solidify this longing in the form of a young beauty untainted by the glamorous and upper-class world.So his desire, and her concordant need to live a life on her own terms results in a slow but underlying mutual love that creates a type of mutual resignation, albeit in a somewhat macabre manner.A beautiful film which draws you in with every scene, every subtle expression and movement.Will close by commending Lesley Manville's performance. Stood out and deserves her own examination in her place in the above dynamic. Always the bridesmaid? She who sacrifices for the art?"
PHANTOM THREAD,9 January 2019,7/10,"This is stylistically probably PTA's most restrained film. It's an exaggerated essay on issues in relationships. A good elegant film but I'd be hesitant to call it more than that, out of PTA's filmography I prefer it only over the mess that was Inherent Vice, although I'm kinda interested to give IV a rewatch. But yeah, great to see Day-Lewis and Anderson reunited.Rating: 7/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,7 October 2018,2/10,"So much ennui. I wanted to give everybody a charge with a cattle prod. I think this should really have been called The Emperor's New Clothes, because many many people got fooled."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 September 2019,,Daniel Day Lewis in a challenging role. By that I mean challenging for the viewer. It is really hard to understand why this movie got made. Maybe the script had something to it that got lost in translation. Tedious music score. Hard to believe that these costumes could have made anyone famous. Not recommended.
PHANTOM THREAD,23 July 2018,9/10,"While I watched this film earlier in the year, I revisited it again last weekend, it had been on my mind for a while and the second viewing only made it occupy more mind space. PT Anderson enjoys showing power dynamics between the Master and the servant (see what I did there?). Phantom Thread is a similar film along those lines. Reynolds is a dressmaker played impeccably by Daniel Day Lewis in what may be his final role, who gives it his all in such a way we don't see a star or a bombastic performance as in PTA's There Will be blood but a far more nuanced performance. Vicky Krieps is the second lead playing his muse and sometimes lover who did an admirable job but in some scenes her accent starts to act up and a strong German accent hits the viewers which I don't think figures in the origin story of her character. Lesley Manville plays the overprotective sister who's also the business head for the venture while Reynolds' artist she's surprisingly the comic relief in the film as well because of her deadpan and dry delivery. The movie is gently directed with long shots and soft classical music which goes a long way in my books. The ending is however this movie's real strength lies, it was a lot of food for thought and talking more would give away the details. Would love to talk about it in the comment section though."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 October 2018,2/10,"1. star - acting
2. star - costumes/beautiful dressesNone of the characters was likable except maybe Cyril and the staff. It was such a twisted tale of obsession and possession.Suffers from weak plot: Needy person manipulates eccentric workaholic to succumb to her bidding by poisoning him with poisonous mushrooms. Workaholic in turn allows her to poison him so he could slow down and be bedridden in order to need/love her back. So, this is why I wasted two plus hours? Sorry, this isn't for me. And what's up with the haunting by his dead mother? And why was Cyril so devoted to Reynolds? These were never explained. Plot-holes galore."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 January 2021,9/10,"Perhaps what is most stunning about this film is the way it is shot, leaving the audience with a genuinely marvelous film to look at. It never moves faster than it needs to, allowing the characters to stand out, and allowing the audience to form opinions about them. Phantom Thread's unique and sophisticated set-up to the final act elevate this film above many others."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 March 2018,,"There are gorgeous shots, superb acting (I usually hate Daniel Day Lewis, who always plays thoroughly disagreeable characters in his films- and boy is he in this story!- but he is here PERFECT for the part of the odious dressmaker) and lush music. But this movie is very much like the dresses Reynold Woodcocks fictionally produces in this story: the sum of their finely sewn parts does not amount to a stunning outfit. The twist that keeps the ""love"" relationship going is either simply unbelievable, or leaves a bad taste in the mouth (wink wink for those who saw the film!) in term of the abuse and psychological dysfunction it implies in lieu of genuine love. I must say, though: many scenes were a pleasure to watch, and many had a great deal of humor about them. So I am giving the movie 7 out of 10 stars, as a fine piece of art....which nevertheless fails to deliver a more lasting impression than wall ornamentation."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2020,9/10,"Caresses the ears and eyes. Beautiful. PTA is a great director.. pace, mood, timing, feel... all weighted perfectly."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 January 2018,7/10,"This was a beautiful movie. Every scene, every shot was a feast for the eyes. The textures of the fabrics, the colors of the rooms, the lighting, the framing, the music ALL make it a work of moving art and worth seeing.And the acting and direction were as perfect as the script could ask for. So why only a 7? Well, I remember reading about how DDA and PTA were obsessively involved in the script and the production; I was surprised that Day-Lewis did not get a writing credit. Although the script did have some some nice turns of phrase and a few smiles, there was no there, there. The plot was thin as weak broth, and confusing in parts. My point is this: if you go to see this movie go for the beauty, go for the acting but don't expect a plot that is worthy of the excellence of all else cataloged above. And then I think the reason is that Day-Lewis and Anderson wound up talking just to each other living in their own universe and creating this for themselves without thinking of what we would think about the plot and the characters. Ultimately, it was too claustrophobic.The review in the LA Times talked about a lot of other movies and directors that Anderson derived from, but to me this was a Kubrick movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,16 October 2018,10/10,"I found this film to be totally mesmerizing, however, viewer beware. If you didn't understand Luchino Visconti films such as The Leopard, The Damned, 1999, or the Conformist, you may as well skip this. Anderson has created a fascinating and wonderful work of art here which many may not get. I have just watched it for the second time. It takes patience and respect and empathy to fully understand, however, you may find that if you give it a chance you just might find yourself being intellectually ravished. When I finished watching it the first time I found I was limp as if I had just done mental gymnastics for a good two and a quarter hours. Finally, someone has made an art film. It has been a long time coming. I hope Paul Thomas Anderson has another in the works sometime sooner than later."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,6/10,"Saw this at the open air cinema in Sydney and was distracted by fruit bats, the Opera House, the Harbour, police helicopters and fireworks. 
A very ODD film indeed. I had no expectations as no trailer seen, (Nil publicity here in Australia) but the clothes had to be fabulous and they did not disappoint, even to all that structured underwear, and the seamstresses, in my next life I will be a 'premiere'! i didn't know they existed as a kid, but I would have gone for it! Had I known! Nice clothes and not having to work and being able to buy a house for a thousand pounds and better music, the 50s are so underrated.
Odd, from the accents to the unexpected story.....no spoilers here. Just darn weird! The actress Vicky Kreips from Luxenbourg is a find,with perfect English, and English looks, and a believable model, very tall and young (actually 35, looks 20 at most) trying to look old as women did in that era. I think the premise is compromise is needful at all times. I am not sure if I enjoyed it. Carole"
PHANTOM THREAD,4 December 2017,10/10,"Another masterpiece from the combination of Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis and reminded me about their last one "" There will be blood "". But my opinion is this movie is even better than the first one .And i think most of us will admit this.Why it is a classic?I am referring it to a Classic as this movie has every answer to all of the critics. The plot is centered around a renowned dressmaker of Fashion era of 1950 in London.The movie has successfully shown the fashion types and patterns of London in 1950. It has all the classical designs of high society and it is very much amusing to see those in 2017.Next the entry of a perfect quetie in the form of Vicky crieps. She has filmed the role of a glamorous women with all glows perfectly.Her dressing, impressions, expressions and activities around her own beauty is so eye soothing that it has added an extra flavour.Now the main part of the movie which is an unequal affair between the dressmaker and the young lady. Their strong will, intense romance, breathless moments of pure expression all set in the fashion era of 1950 is very much mindblowing. The rest of the film is a real set piece to enjoy.Daniel Day-Lewis is as excellent as ever in the central role. Direction is always perfect when Paul Thomas Anderson has responsibility of performing it.When we say classic it reminds us ""Godfather"" or may be ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and so on. But you have to add this movie to that list surely.May be a fourth Oscer is coming for Daniel Day- Lewis....You never know....May be...."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 July 2020,7/10,"A slow, matured, romance drama with a perfect touch of elegance. Not very heartbreaking neither very heartwarming but never the less feels warm from time to time. The plot is about the process of dealing with a 'tough on love' man. The perseverance of holding on to someone whom you claim to be in love with even though the person is a polar opposite of you and that's what makes the film beautiful.
The cinematography & editing was marvelous. Had an elegant ambience.
Daniel Day Lewis nails again as always."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 November 2021,8/10,"Every film starring Daniel Day-Lewis is always a treat, combined with Paul Thomas Anderson is gold.In this movie que see every human feeling and the hurt that comes with those feelings.

PHANTOM THREAD,21 April 2020,10/10,"""What the hell is it about? Are you a special agent sent here to ruin my evening and possibly my entire life?""What a trip. Phantom Thread was a film that I had voluntarily disliked. I hated the title. Its poster was a sore for my eye because I was certain I knew how the story would unfold. Frankly, I'm glad I didn't know any better because I wouldn't be as blown away as I am now if I had seen a glimpse of this gem. I gave it another chance coming from a recent read that it was a near perfect art. That one I have to disagree because it was faultless. Like the dresses and gowns Reynolds make. As exquisite as Alma on a Woodcock dress.The thing I love most about this is its palpability. My gad I can feel the fabrics touching my face. The gaze of Daniel and Vicky melted me. Anytime, it's as if I'm gonna explode from the quiet intensity I'm trying to hold between my hands. It must be about the thoughtful shots. Perhaps the music. Or just because of the extremely natural actors. Whatever it was, Paul Thomas Anderson sure created a masterpiece that celebrates purpose, time, and life. I like to remember it as a rom-com acknowledging the many goods laughs I had but it won't be proper to label it as one thing. It's a multi-genre achievement that has some twisted moments I totally understand- and dig 😀."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,8/10,"Set in the world of 1950s haute couture in London, Phantom Thread is a beguiling love story with a somewhat dark, occasionally unpalatable underlay. Daniel Day-Lewis proves yet again why he's the pre-eminent actor of our generation by deftly inhabiting the character of Reynolds Woodcock, a brilliant couturier with an equally expansive ego. He is matched onscreen by two other powerhouse performances: Vicky Krieps as Alma, his strong-willed muse slash mistress; and Lesley Manville as Cyril, his cold-as-ice sister & business partner. The world that director Paul Thomas Anderson creates is both sensual and aloof, with clashes that alternate between imperceptibly subtle and wildly spectacular. It's a beautiful film to both watch and hear, with elegant cinematography that evokes the period magnificently, and Johnny Greenwood's incessant score that portends the plot's vicissitudes with pitch-perfect precision. It may not be a film for everybody, but it's the most incisive commentary on the innate tragedy of relationships that you'll see all year."

I thought, ""So that's it?""I was also surprised that she had a child.I wonder if the age difference is about 50 years..."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 May 2020,9/10,"I'm really glad I took the time to watch this great piece of filmmaking and character-study again.
First time I saw this I found it really boring, because the movie it was one of the most talked about during the award season that year and PTA and Day-Lewis were in it, so my expectations were through the roof. And when when I saw it, the slow pacing and my high expectations didn't went along well in that moment.
The movie as I said it's a perfect piece of character-study. Breaking down the character of Reynold Woodcock would have been really difficult as he's a very complicated character, and even though PTA wrote him very well, I think that it is Day-Lewis that displays Reynolds character in such a way that I am surprised by myself that I didn't understood him the first time I saw the movie. Because the amount of detail that Day-Lewis puts to his performance is very impressive, even by him. The face expressions, the body movements and everything else in his performance are simply perfect.
PTA is one of my favorite filmmakers. I've seen almost every one of his films and I either like them or love them. PTA knows how important are the details, alongside Fincher he is one of the few directors whose movies I find flawless in technical point of view, and yet I think that he is a better filmmaker than Fincher because he manages to bring the best out of his actors, and he does the same here too.
Overall this is one of the best films of this decade."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 March 2018,7/10,"2017's Oscar, Best Picture nominee Phantom Thread, is a beautiful and boring movie! The movie has some of the best of the year, the story and everything makes it look like a masterpiece, it is a masterpiece, but it's super boring no matter how the much beautiful and well-crafted the movie was. Phatom Thread was just too long and the first 40 mins were necessary too introduce us to our characters and the whole environment of the movie yet it should of been way less long, since yes I agree it was necessary for the beauty of the film but stil how much can we wait before being completly off the film. So basically my major problem with the film is how much of a bore it truly was. 
At least to make the whole movie less boring we had an incredible, divine performance from him. Lewis once again proved he needed another Oscar. The music, is magical too, its pure, delightful, and dramatic. Paul Thomas Anderson new adition to cinema proves us how much unknow talent their still is in Hollywood. One thing he should still consider is make a masterpiece less boring and long."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 April 2018,2/10,"Don't waste your time, this movie started out boring and got worse the longer it ran. I am a big fan of Daniel Day Lewis and had to give it a chance. It was difficult to watch and I found a lot of the behavior in this movie to be just creepy.I think that you would really have to have a serious interest in fashion to even waste the time watching this movie. I was terribly disappointed and cannot recommend this movie to anyone."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 August 2018,5/10,"Fairly well executed, yet not enough story line. One does get the feeling it is going somewhere, only to be disappointed. The sets and clothes were magnificent, if that ticks your boxes, the attention to detail will not disappoint you. There is an element of perverseness within the whole film, this only intensifies as it moves along. It is a slow death to watch, but bear with , if it is your subject matter, and you might go away feeling your time was not wasted."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 August 2019,7/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis delivers yet another masterful performance, albeit at the hindrance of an underwhelming plot. This film presents an interesting look into obsession, work and relationships but ultimately fails to ascend into greatness."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 July 2018,10/10,"I absolutely loved Phantom Thread. From the moment the film started, I was captivated partially because of the soundtrack and cinematography, which were gorgeous. Almost every shot in the film is beautiful and the soundtrack provokes emotion when it needed too. I also loved Daniel Day-Lewis's acting in this film. He sucked me in. Everything he said and did in this film was somehow interesting to me, even eating asparagus. As for the story, I thought it was very enjoyable. You would think a movie about a man who makes dresses would be boring, yet this film is anything but. The film is very suspenseful at times and the twist towards the end of the film is very shocking. I would highly recommend this film, but I am aware that many will not enjoy this work of art."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,6/10,"Phantom Thread is one of those movies that has great acting, a solid direction, but nothing goes beyond the conventional of making a movie.The acting is solid and well-crafted by Daniel Day-Lewis and Lesley Manville, both look great. However, Vicky Krieps as Alma leaves holes lower than I expected. I was going to scream in pain as I heard her say to another character the following phrase: She does not deserve this dress. The acting of this actress is too rudimentary to be taken seriously. Her character is your generic love interest who tries to dissolve the love in the character with the stone heart. But the biggest sin of Phantom Thread is that the story is too commonplace, everything here has been shown a thousand times in the past, with better results and better worked in other films. The script of the film only follows as if it was a recipe to make a cake, the movie does not give you space for acuteness nor seek to invest more in the film itself than what was presented.In other words, nothing original, except for the amazing acting. What a pity, on the part of Paul Thomas Anderson as a scriptwriter, after the excellent and stupendous Magnolia (film in which he exceeded the expectations as scriptwriter and director alike).Of course, the Costume Design is excellent and beautifully crafted. A good movie, but nothing amazing and out of the ordinary. Like making a dress, you must following the steps one-by-one, and you can not escape the traditional method of making a dress. So this is Phantom Thread what is, this film lacked a little more special, something out of ordinary that would not hurt Paul Thomas Anderson ambitions as director and screenwriter. A good movie, but nothing beyond that. At the end of the day, Phantom Thread is just a good movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 July 2018,8/10,"I personally found this film a bit tedious and unengaging( I was a bit bored throughout). This film just wasn't for me. Yet objectively this is an amazing film. The acting, directing, cinematography and set design were all outstanding. I just wish I could have enjoyed it. I went in with very little info on the film as I usually do with films that are well reviewed. (I read the reviews after watching the film, so I don't have other people opinions clouding my judgement). I was unfortunately expecting something a bit a bit darker. I also had to see the movie because it may be Daniel Day-Lewis' final film. If you are a fan of Downton Abby or Jane Austin novels (both of which I dislike) you will almost certainly enjoy this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 October 2018,4/10,Like many Oscar nominated films I didn't enjoy it at first but it really stuck in my mind and so i bumped it from a 5 to a 7
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,8/10,"Most critical praise will primarily go to Day-Lewis, and rightly so. He covers Reynolds with a veil of precision, that is slowly removed to expose the storm of feelings internal. he's, but, met with two similarly noticeably performances in his leading women. Krieps is the heart of the film, slowly recoiling at the realisation that her surprisingly simple wishes will now not be met. instead of slink into the background, she makes Alma more potent, more calculating than the people around her anticipate. She's much less showy than Day-Lewis, however no much less critical to the tale. On the other aspect of the fence is Manville, in a performance that screams Oscar. The veteran actor, regarded for her paintings with Mike Leigh, glides via the movie, controlling the action with a look and reducing down each co-superstar with a easy statement. She represents the world Reynolds has created to preserve him secure, and steals each scene she's in.Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Phantom Thread is a definitive return to the identical superb form that marked his final collaboration with Day-Lewis, There will be Blood. Anderson has always been a compelling and difficult filmmaker, but he has additionally been ploughing a clinically cryptic area inside the past decade with head-scratchers which includes The master and Inherent Vice. whilst Phantom Thread is a extra trustworthy film from Anderson than his devoted following has become conversant in, his gift behind the camera is all the better for it.Wise, fierce and unforgettable, Anderson could not have crafted a better farewell for one of cinema's most charming talents. at the age of just forty seven, it can easily be argued that his best remains yet to come. perhaps it will likely be some thing that can set off Daniel Day-Lewis to rethink his untimely retirement."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 June 2021,3/10,"Surely there are more important subjects to be explored in film than this. Fashion: the most superficial of human behaviours.DDL is DDL as usual +camp, then there's an aggressive lesbian sidekick - whose behaviour toward the lead female character would be wildly inappropriate for a man but it's fine for a lesbian, of course.Q: Who knew that fashion would be so cut-throat and non-CIS-gendered?A: Everyone.It's an OK film."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 March 2018,6/10,"""Phantom Thread"" was a film that I was worried I would be bored at, but ended up being a pleasant surprise.In many ways, you could consider this film to be pretentious and in many ways - it is just that, but it boasts its confidence, in such a way, that it just works.In ""Phantom Thread,"" Paul Thomas Anderson builds this world, where every small detail is important. We have Daniel Day Lewis playing a dressmaker who's used to having his life exactly the way he likes it, until one day he allows a woman into his life and through their falling in love, she begins to change his everyday lifestyle.And that's what this film is about. It's very much ""slice-of-life"" in a way and so, not a lot really happens, but it's through these character interactions that ""Phantom Thread"" shines.Also the costume pieces. In actuality, I could care less about a bunch of dresses, but knowing the time it had to have gone into creating all of these costumes is very impressive.If like anything similar to a BBC show, you'll enjoy this one and if you're not sure whether you'll like it, why not give it a shot.Hear me talk about ""Phantom Thread"" more here: youtu.be/HfSouIJXGhw"
PHANTOM THREAD,19 February 2018,6/10,"Much has been said about Day-Lewis' decision to retire from acting after this role, but, of course, one doubts that. Still, critics might applaud his choice after seeing this film. A gifted actor, although one who is now and then guilty of violating the old rule ""Never let them catch you acting."" His performances are mannered in the extreme, such as the voice he chose for Lincoln, far too much an affectation for my taste. Yet, he is compelling to watch, as he is here, inhabiting this complex character. Despite a glacial start, the film finally finds its pace, and engages you, although you never entirely empathize with the character. The director of this film is equally an enigma, who considers Magnolia his best film, one that I found unwatchable, and an utter waste of time. How he came to this project, I do not know. Still, the long, lingering scenes, the beautiful cinematography, the lovely costumes, are interesting, and often engaging. To be fair, the performances are first rate, the natural lighting is well done, and it really comes down to a matter of taste. 
I somewhat liked it, with reservations. Perhaps if they ever do a biopic of Lewis, Meryl Streep can play him. Chameleons one and all. Still, kidding aside, Lewis best work, and it was truly marvelous, was in My Left Foot, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and The Last of the Mohicans, a remarkable filmography. I like watching him."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 May 2021,6/10,"This film is a beautiful and fascinating mishap because Anderson forced story elements on his characters. The result is misshapen and disappointing. I watched a masterpiece for over an hour and then it became something else, something untrue to itself and it's audience."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 September 2020,9/10,"Phantom thread is just another great piece of work by pta and team. as pta ages and experiences more about life he very much shows that in his work and every aspect about this movie very much conveys that. the narrative alone is captivating, providing a unique, melancholy, and mature stance on relationships, love, marriage, and the loss of loved ones. this movie is very much a slow burn drama but a lot of aspects keep it from being anything but slow. the performances by the main trinity of the cast is great (daniel and vicky being the stand outs). there's this soft but grainy look to the movie that makes it one of my favorites that i've seen this past decade. most of the film is quite static or has slow camera movement but the blocking and directing make it so that every shot set up is in service to the movie. the score is what probably the biggest impression on me and how it ranges from these gothic to these sweet and beautiful pieces is just aw inspiring. this is a movie about dress making so that aspect is obviously good. over all, great movie, watch it with your wife."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 February 2018,,"I really don't see what all the hub-bub is regarding this movie.
It's well acted, beautifully shot but still just another sappy ""chick flick""... It's pure estrogen overload. 
Suffer through it with your wife or girlfriend but be warned, you might need to go hang with the guys, watch a football game and drink a few beers to reset your testosterone levels."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 April 2018,7/10,"The inhumanity of P.T. Anderson's movies has reached a new high (low). This is a gloriously staged and brilliantly acted period drama which can feel languid, overdrawn and positively painful. The atmosphere is cold, the land is crippled and the people are repressed. I did not particularly enjoy the movie or its characters, but I can appreciate what it does. Not exactly a ringing endorsement, huh? I do not regret my experience with it at all - but I never want to see this movie again."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 January 2018,1/10,"I have been looking forward to Phantom Thread for several months and chose not to read a review because I wanted to make up my own mind on this film without another's opinion clouding my judgment. I adore Daniel Day-Lewis and think he is an incredible actor and I thought he must have picked a wonderful script if this is his last movie. I got settled in the theater's new recliner seats excited to finally see this highly anticipated film. I enjoyed looking at the clothes and 1950's London scenery but that's about all that I enjoyed. I am a mental health nurse and quickly deducted that Alma is a sociopath. She figures out Ryan's weaknesses and uses them to irritate him and manipulate him. Ryan thinks his life is cursed and had sewn ""never cursed"" into the lining of a Royal's wedding dress. When Alma sees these words sewn in the wedding gown her sociopathic scheming goes into overdrive. She cooks up an omelette with poisionous mushrooms and there is a tense scene....will he or will he not take a bite? Both characters are playing head games with each other and it develops into she poisons him then nurses him back to health and continues to do this Russian roulette until one day ""he will be waiting for me on the other side of eternity"". The head games and cat and mouse story line are uncomfortable to watch and not intriguing as the director wanted us to be. Most of the movie was dragging, so much so that I almost left but I wanted to stick it out and be fair to the film. Bottom line is this movie is meant to be strange so that is is touted as artistic but it is anything but. It is a dark draggy movie and I feel like I could have done something more productive with my time. I'm disappointed that Daniel Day Lewis choose to do this script. And one more thing....this ain't love people. No matter how you slice it these two characters do not love each other."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,1/10,"I cannot understand the praise this movie has received, aside from that for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance. It is, frankly, an insult to the movie-going public.
My wife and I are both very well-educated individuals, which I think is important for anyone to know who thinks we just ""didn't get it"" with this movie. The same can be said about the couple who saw the movie with us. When it ended, we all looked at each other and felt that we had been had. 
The movie's title has no apparent connection with what passes for action in the film. Is this movie a love story? A study of the fashion industry decades ago? A battle of the sexes? Well, whatever it purports to be, it fails.
It's pretentious, with lingering shots of couples or individuals passing for deep meaning. Long silences that do nothing to advance, or even explain, what passes for the story. Moody stares and shadowy lighting do not make a great film, or one as lousy as this.
 The musical score is probably the most intrusive of any film I've ever seen. Music swells to let you know that ""This is important!"" That doesn't work, and it interfered with scene after scene. Maybe the producers and director thought it added gravity to a movie desperately trying to show you that it is meaningful in so many ways.
For many years the movie that most offended me, as an utter waste of my viewing time, was ""Titanic."" It has now been supplanted by this overwrought couple of hours of cinema. 
The worst movie I've ever suffered through, and that includes many of the ones lampooned on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Come to think of it, that might be an appropriate venue for future screenings of this pretentious bore."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 January 2018,8/10,"Tweet me @MarkoutTV if you have a comment about this review that you want me to see.Most of the interest in this movie will stem from the reunion of Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson, star and director of There Will Be Blood, respectively. Moreover this allegedly will be the final performance of Daniel Day-Lewis' brilliant career. I say allegedly because similar rumors surrounded Lincoln, but given his famous selectivity regarding films, I am inclined to believe him and if this is truly his final performance, bravo on an unimpeachable career, sir (he won't read this).This is a splendid film and one of the most captivating experiences I have had at a movie theater in quite some time. From scene one to the final, not a single person left the theater, not a single person talked or cracked a joke, and nobody took out their phone. An entire theater of people, singularly invested in what was on the screen. That is rare nowadays... even more rare when it comes to movies about dresses.The credit for this phenomenon is all round. Let's start with the performers.Although there are great supporting characters to be found here, particularly from Leslie Manville's performance as Reynold's stoic but well-mannered assistant, Cyril, this is a story about the relationship between two people: Reynolds Woodcock and Alma. Reynolds Woodcock is one of the mid-twentieth century's greatest dress-makers, his greatness brought about by his fiercely stringent routine and slavish devotion to his craft over any personal relationships. After a particularly stressful day he makes a solo sojourn to a diner where he meets Alma. There, they immediately take an interest in each other. Alma is a polite and self-conscious woman who immediately allows herself to become vulnerable in the confident-if-demanding arms of Reynolds.I hesitate to call this film a ""romance"" or a ""love story."" I rather refer to the relationship between Reynolds and Alma as a great game: a game to see which one of them will get the other to make the necessary changes in order for their relationship to either become stronger, or fall apart. Reynolds is detached, possibly out of fear of falling in love or ruining his routine, possibly not. Alma's newfound sense of self-worth drives her to break down the rigid shell of Reynolds in order for him to prioritize her more. Again this may be because she is in love with him, or maybe she has never gotten close enough to another man to know how a relationship works, or maybe she secretly has the same need for power and control that Reynolds does, and not having it is maddening to her. All things are possibilities and there are infinite more.I am using words like ""possibly"" a lot when describing the feelings and motivations of the characters here, and it's because this movie doesn't give you answers, and that's what makes it challenging, and therefore worth seeing. You will see these characters develop, you will see them argue, you will see them get along, you will see them exhibit coldness to one another, you will see them exhibit love and you will see them make some incredible decisions on their mutual-yet-connected journeys. However at no point will you be spoon-fed. Instead you will have to ask yourself: ""what the hell are they thinking?"" and be fine when you have to figure it out yourself. This film doesn't even answer the question of whether either of these people actually love one another. The most it does is show that to some extent, they learn to understand one another.Daniel Day-Lewis is at his typical level of brilliance here. He perfectly plays the role of an obsessive personality, who is so averse to letting someone interfere with his work, yet who more and more, through both natural and artificial means, also doesn't want to lose the new woman in his life. It was a challenging role, with the need for confidence, intensity, comedic timing, physical and mental weakness at times, nonverbal communication and everything in between. If this ultimately becomes the framework for the definitive Daniel Day-Lewis performance, it will be earned.However, I need to give a special shout-out to someone who was previously unknown to me, Vicky Krieps as Alma. She was given a difficult role to perform: she needed to have moments of vulnerability, confidence, sadness and glee. She needed to have both moments of submissiveness and vindictiveness and she had to make every second of her growth believable while acting alongside one of the most esteemed actors of all time. And she nailed it.Only elevating the performances, Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is superb here. The film is lengthy, but not a single frame of 70mm film is wasted (and that's a good thing because that stuff is freaking expensive. Seriously those projectors are like tens of thousands of dollars each. The Alamo is one of the few theaters that has one and my ticket would've been like 23 bucks if it wasn't my birthday. Oh yeah, the movie).Every moment of the film serves to advance the story. It's a slow burn, but you are always moving forward, and that is the important thing. The pace is consistently moving and therefore even though there are no time jumps or action scenes, it never gets boring. There is some damn stylish camera work here to boot, but it doesn't come off as pretentious. Pretentious is when M. Night Shyamalan says ""Hey look what I can do"" by trying to do a single-shot fight scene in The Last Airbender. When Paul Thomas Anderson does a single shot of Reynolds leaving his comfort zone while trying to find Alma (a woman who he still doesn't know how he truly feels about) at a crowded ball, you feel every level of his conflict. Everything from the beautiful imagery, to the spectacular camera work, to the authentic period representation, to the deliberate pacing and certainly to the career defining-performance of one lead, and the career-making performance of another, combine to make a delightful theater-going experience.Oh and the ending is brilliant.See it in 70mm if there is a theater near you with the capability."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 August 2018,7/10,"If you enjoyed There Will Be Blood, Inherent Vice, or Boogie Nights, you will like Phantom Thread. There are so many connections between these four movies that it isn't surprising they share a lot of common characteristics - long takes; soft, natural lighting; an emphasis on indoor scenes; and camera studies of characters' faces. These are all signs of movies from Paul Thomas Anderson who wrote and directed all four of these films. Not surprisingly, this isn't his first nomination, having received writing and/or directing nominations for all four of these films as well as Magnolia.And he frequently brings his own team together for these films. Composer Jonny Greenwood, who received a nomination for the excellent original music in Phantom Thread, also composed the music for There Will Be Blood and Inherent Vice. Mark Bridges, who won the costume award for this movie, also did the costumes for all three of Anderson's other big movies as well as winning the Costume Design Oscar for The Artist in 2012. Clearly, this group of film makers have been making this kind of movie together for several decades.And don't forget Daniel Day-Lewis, who was nominated for Leading Actor in this movie. He Won the Oscar for There Will be Blood, and so has a rewarding relationship with Anderson that goes back more than a decade. An accomplished actor, Day-Lewis has received Oscar nominations for five other movies, and won the acting Oscar for Lincoln, and My Left Foot. Casting him as Reynolds Woodcock in this movie was a perfect choice as Day-Lewis has a great knack for playing powerful men, who retain tragic flaws. Day-Lewis has the uncanny ability to project both strength and cautious vulnerability which gives his characters just the right amount of empathy.In Phantom Thread, Day-Lewis had the good fortune to play off of two powerful supporting performances. Newcomer Vicky Krieps plays his muse and love interest. I can't say I've seen her in any previous movies, but I suspect we will be rewarded in future movies. She has a wonderful ability to project emotion with her face and can exhibit joy and sadness with inflections in her eyes. In tense, emotion-laden scenes with Day-Lewis, she can hold her own. I'm kind of surprised she didn't receive her own nomination.Probably, though, the studio wisely reserved the supporting actress nod for Lesley Manville who did a terrific turn as Woodcock's sister and business partner. Although this is her first Oscar nomination, she is an accomplished actress on stage and British television. She has a terrific scene with Alma, Krieps' character, early in the movie where she actually smells her almost like she's a bouquet of flowers. The scene establishes not just her uncanny and sophisticated sensibilities, but also expresses her powerful position as Woodcock's second-in-command. She has several other turns of equal ability.Jonny Greenwood's original score dominates the movie and seems nearly perfect. It is difficult to pin down exactly what year the movie is supposed to take place, although there are clues that suggest sometime in the mid-50s. Greenwood's music takes a lot of themes from 50s big band music, classical music, and 50s movie backgrounds. After working with Thomas for two decades, he has managed to understand his message and here he creates music that helps maintain the tensions between all three personalities.Although I haven't done the comparisons with the other nominees yet, I'm kind of surprised that this movie won the Costume Design Award. Perhaps it is because the movie is about a dress designer, so the costume guild rewarded the movie more because it was about one of their own. Of course, the dresses he designs for Alma and the British royalty who use his services are beautiful, I don't know that they are exceptionally so. But it is definitely true that he makes Alma look stunning several times over. So maybe the award is deserved. (I must admit that costumes and makeup are two awards where I don't feel much competence in judging!)Ultimately, though, this is Anderson's movie, and its successes, and failures, fall on him!. As the writer and director, the movie is his brainchild from conception to delivery. The movie definitely has some good points. It is a powerful personality study that delves into one particular man with a curious combination of strengths and weaknesses. He does a great job in developing Woodcock's character, and, although we may not fully like him, we do gain a sufficient understanding that we can respect him. His use of the two women, his sister and his muse and lover, to more fully explore his complexities is commendable.But in the end, and especially at the end of the movie, I don't think it works as well as it might have. Without giving away some critical plot points, there is a climactic development between Alma and Reynolds that just isn't consistent. We know that Reynolds discovers something important about Alma, but the film doesn't tell us how he got there - the development of the plot point almost seems like a scene or two is missing. And yet it is exactly this development that determines the final outcome of the couple's relationship, and the denouement of the movie plot. As a result, I felt bewildered and uncomfortable - Anderson just sort of abandoned me out in the ozone somewhere. It is a difficult scene and I think both Day-Lewis and Krieps had hard times understanding it themselves, and yet it is perhaps the most important scene in the movie.But it might be the case that this was just me. Out of the 27 movies nominated for this year's general Oscars awards, Phantom Thread received the highest IMDB audience rating and the fifth highest critics metascore. The audience reaction, in particular, surprises me as this is not, generally, the kind of movie that kindles positive audience reactions. It is a beautiful movie to watch, but can be slow at times, focusing on personalities, not actions. Couple that with, what for me was an unsatisfying ending, and you get a curious set of ratings. (Nice to occasionally have things that remain unexplained.)"
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,5/10,"An overly mannered, deliberately slow-paced film, sumptuously filmed, with a knockout performance by Lesley Manville as Daniel Day-Lewis' sister. However, despite the posh trimmings, the film underwhelms."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 January 2021,1/10,"This movie made me feel depressed, cheated and perplexed in equal measure. Why on earth all these glowing reviews? Yes, great cinematography. Yes, great acting. Yes, amazing editing. Yes, beautifully rendered 50s London, and yes, great dresses, if you like the style. Also, the slow pace did not bother my wife and I at all. In fact, for us it was a refreshing change from all the noisy, instant-gratification tosh that seems to be the norm today.The reason we hated this movie, despite all these positives, is that the morality or message underlying it was deeply sick. I've seen tons of European art movies depicting people doing sick things, but one could normally sense the film makers' underlying vision, portraying the sickness as a warning, something not to be glorified or admired. Instead, this movie glorifies sickness, and what left us most depressed is that, looking at the reviews, nobody seems to realise, or care.So DDL acts a self-obsessed, narcissistic, control-freak of an artist. So far nothing new. Some reviews mention that the movie portrays ""toxic masculinity."" Are you kidding me? This may be so, but in fact he's upstaged by a far worse case of ""toxic femininity."" In the oldest trick in the book, playing on every single misogynist trope around, the main female character poisons DDL to get her way. And the movie rewards her for this. Does no-one see a problem with this? My wife was not impressed, to put it mildly.Far worse still, DDL eventually realises the manipulations she's up to, and allows himself to be poisoned, a little, as a way of submitting to her. And so at the end we have two deeply unpleasant and damaged people riding off into some bizarre sado-masochistic sunset, with a baby to boot, and we're supposed to applaud this life-destroying, vacuous, manipulative, value-free rubbish because... it's art??? Seriously????I fear it's another one of these movies that everyone likes because... everyone likes it. Nobody wants to be the kid pointing out that the arty-farty emperor has no clothes.This impression is also borne out by the many glowing comments about the score. I'm a composer, and while tastes clearly vary, this score was in no way remarkable. Perhaps the makers senses this, because the music was for almost the entire film mixed very far to the back. It seems the only reason for praising the score is that it was done by Johnny Greenwood of Radiohead, the epitome of chic, arty cool."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 January 2019,3/10,"Yeah..... The tired old cliché of the obnoxious arrogant male 'genius' (he makes boring Norman Hartnell-esque creations) finding his (30 year) younger 'muse', a klutz he can boss about while he treats her like a doormat. He has an unnatural obsession with his mother (run away -run away now!), looks and acts frightfully gay, to the point that his relationship with her is all but celibate, and is a toffee-nosed bully who believes his life is the most important thing on the planet; a raging narcissist, in short. The girl hangs on, and snivels, like his other muses before her, until she decides to render him helpless so he'll 'need' her again (or at all). There's jealous who-runs-this-house? conflicts with the equally weird sister, and so it goes on - and on. Eventually doormat girl decides to make a habit of rendering him helpless, while she continues to annoy him, and so they find - well, what? Happiness? Seriously?It's a sad testament to what is supposed to be seen as 'deep ' when what you are being offered is just two damaged people wounding each other and passing it off as love. If they were poor, unbeautiful and living on a council estate it would be perceived as a squalid kitchen sink drama with zero believability and little charm. Which just about describes it. A big fluffy confection of utter nonsense. It's amazing what a smear of designer brand glamour can do for a t*rd - and here the real designer brand is Anderson & Day-Lewis his muse - but it's still a t*rd. Stick to watching the McQueen documentary, at least he actually had some genius to sweeten the narcissism."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,9/10,"'Phantom Thread' is written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and stars Daniel Day Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock, a fastidious fashion designer in 1950's post-war London. Vicky Krieps stars opposite as Velma, a confident strong willed woman who completely disrupts his entire way of life when they meet in a countryside hotel. Lesley Manville has a scene stealing role as Reynolds' sister Cyril who helps him design and make dresses for royalty and the like. The film has a very deliberate pace as is often the case with PTA movies and he uses long takes to elevate tension and suspense very well here. He evokes Hitchcock very much in this movie not just with the story but with something as simple as the way the driving scenes are shot with the camera placed behind the car. That element was particularly reminiscent of the driving scenes in 'Psycho'.Everything about this film from the cinematography (shot by PTA himself), the Oscar winning costume design and to the trio of great performances is full of attention to detail- Rather fitting considering the meticulousness of the protagonist. The script is also worthy of mention which is very witty and starkly funny. However perhaps the strongest element is the beautifully haunting score by Johnny Greenwood which permeates virtually every corner of the movie and drives home the ghostly atmosphere of the story to which the title refers.The only contrivance I have with 'Phantom Thread' is that it is very slow in some parts and although it seem intentional within context it did take me out of the movie a couple of times but other than that the picture is stellar. I wouldn't say this is PTA's best, that moniker still belongs to 'There Will Be Blood', but it's certainly up there as one of his finest films."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 April 2018,5/10,"I had to see this movie, since it is supposed to be the last for Daniel Day-Lewis. He's always excellent, and he didn't let me down.The problem is, Vicky Krieps simply cannot play her part. She's bland in every way - bland looks, bland voice, bland characterization. The part of Alma is a tricky one indeed, and not for an amateur. Even a seasoned actress might find it difficult. Yet here is Krieps, thoroughly lacking in the necessary skills, making Alma a true mess.Granted, she's written as rather one-dimensional. We know nothing of her background - her country of origin, her family, how long she's been living in England, etc. A good actress, however, would create a character out of what details we do have. Krieps does not, and cannot. Watching Krieps for two hours was hard. Very hard. If the entire movie had been about Reynolds Woodcock slowly coming to terms with the fact that he is aging and that women are no longer having their dresses made by him (if, indeed, they have dresses custom-made at all), it would have been a much better film. Seeing this portrait of dysfunctionality, with excellence from Day-Lewis and mediocrity from Krieps, is a chore.I hope Daniel Day-Lewis makes at least one more movie. I want to get the taste of this one out of my mouth."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 April 2020,6/10,"I had high expectations and although Lewis was amazing, the movie ended and I was left with a HUGE question mark (???!!!!) I felt I lost 2 hours of my life. No sense whatsoever."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 April 2018,2/10,"Daniel-Day Lewis is a consummate actor capable of channeling and bringing just about any character, including Lincoln, to life for us. PHANTOM THREAD is no exception. Here, he must play a self-absorbed fashion designer in Great Britain, a bachelor attracted to a much younger woman. Lewis pulls it off beautifully, so much so that at the end of two hours of his whining, grumpiness, anger, and selfishness you will want to watch an old Marx Brothers movie.The main character ""Reynolds"" in this movie is the male equivalent of Scarlett O'Hara - spoiled rotten, insensitive, ungrateful, moody, and downright obnoxious. This is why I can only watch GONE WITH THE WIND once every 10 years. Scarlett kills it for me.Likewise, watching ""Reynolds"" for 2 hour's is like watching spoiled children misbehave. Except THEY'RE ADULTS!Watch the 1939 Selznick movie instead. Even though it's 4 hours long, at least you'll get spectacle and a Clark Gable to counter the obnoxious Scarlett. In PHANTOM THREAD, you'll have no such alternative.Other critics have praised the soulful silence and deep meaningful stares of the characters in this movie. A little bit of this technique goes a long way. In PHANTOM you'll think you're watching a yacht race, not a movie. It's exceedingly slow and difficult to endure.PHANTOM eventually goes psycho here, with the young female character (in love with Reynolds) actually poisoning him with mushrooms for attention. This is called factitious disorder imposed on another, which refers to the abuse of another person in order to seek attention or sympathy for the abuser. This was a totally unexpected (and frankly revolting) development that only strengthened my impression that PHANTOM was most definitely not a true love story. There's not a hint of true love, only sick love, in this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,1/10,"Intolerable people everywhere. Everyone grosses you out. You can't even pretend it's a love story, because the characters are so gross."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2018,10/10,"Phantom Thread is the latest film from acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson, director of films such as Magnolia and There Will Be Blood. The film is Anderson's second collaboration with Daniel Day-Lewis (the first being There Will Be Blood) and is a strange portrait of a dominated man and the women who control him. Set in 1950s London, Day-Lewis plays a highly regarded couturier named Reynolds Woodcock, Lesley Manville is his sister Cyril, who from the opening minutes gives a very strong impression of omnipotence and dominance without having said anything. The other key player in the film is Vicky Krieps's Alma, a waitress who Reynolds meets in a B&B for his breakfast. Woodcock then takes Alma on a date, and then returns to his house where Reynolds takes her measurements to discover that Alma has the prefect shape for his dresses. What then follows is spiraling obsession and jealousy from the three players. Alma becomes obsessed with Reynolds and jealous of his own obsession with his work and loyalty to Cyril. So she contrives to make him dependent on her, by any means necessary. As this continues the audience becomes acutely aware that Reynolds himself is powerless in his own world as the Cyril and Alma control him and manipulate his being to their will. By the end of the film each party has had to make compromise to leave them all as happy as is possible. It is worth noting that the costume design, unsurprisingly for a film about making clothes, is sublime and Jony Greenwood's score perfectly encapsulates the era of the piece and of course the performances are stunning. This with Anderson's pinpoint direction leads to an entrancing viewing experience that is a pleasure to watch."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 January 2018,2/10,"I've always had mixed feelings about P.T. Anderson -- on the one hand, he has a brilliant touch as a director, and as a fan of his dad's role as ""Ghoulardi"" on local Cleveland television growing up, I always had a soft spot for the kid. But this film is a puzzle: its gender politics are stuck in the 1950's along with its fashion choices (at one point, Day-Lewis's Woodcock crows ""Don't say the word 'chic'!""), its main characters are utterly flat, and the only interesting changes are brought about by poisonous mushrooms. No one grows, no one really steps out of themselves; trapped within Anderson's brilliantly-framed shots, they talk, argue, raise their eyebrows, and sometimes noisily crunch their toast, world without end, amen. A film must go from one place to another; someone in it must grow or experience change; we have to be somewhere different at the end than at the beginning. Here all we have is beautiful stasis -- which ultimately make this film, despite its rich artfulness, an ugly one."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,7/10,"I will be brief. I enjoyed 98% of this movie. The acting, art direction, cinematography, script (mostly) are exquisite. I was delighted and amused as well as intrigued and riveted. Most of the movie made sense, but without giving it away, the ending is pure madness, utterly impossible, sick and deranged.
I am not charmed by such ludicrous fantasies."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 March 2018,,"Phantom Thread **Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis reunite after the intense There Will Be Blood with Phantom Thread.Phantom Thread is a psychological Drama about a emotional dysfunctional highly regarded dressmaker Woodcock (Day Lewis) who after he dispatches his current girlfriend begins a new romance of kinds with a waitress he just met Alma.Woodcock is basically a emotional crippled highly sensitive perfectionist who catching him smiling is about as often as the full moon who can make life for those around him pleasant or painful.Women are drawn into his life as his muse as he make dresses for them and they become the face of his label but they all fall under the hammer once his interest or patience runs out which is frequently.Woodcock regards little or no need for the permanence of Love treating his girlfriends coldly and like staff not quite Romeo but point made. Alma however is going to try to break Woodcock and get into his life whatever the cost.Loyalty to the script is paramount with the direction painfully slow and purposefully dated, it looks as through this could have been made decades earlier in the directorial style employed here. This helps the style but certainly not the pace which moves with the urgency of a snail. We are here to engage with every single character trait exposed at every single point.It's effectively a punishing watch to get through, much like Silence was but Silence pulled it off where as here unless your hardened fan or have the patience of a saint this film will deliver a outcome that may require repeated viewings I was told I understood it in one and one was enough.Day Lewis puts his all into his role but after Gangs Of New York and There Will Be Blood it's a shame this performance will be his rumored last in a love or hate film that may be interesting in a film study class in a University classroom or in film journalist coffee room but to the average viewer this film will be hard painful work like making a wedding dress."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 January 2019,7/10,"The production of the movie is amazing the cloth design the environment really great.the acting is also amazing . Vicky Krieps is very beautiful and fit the role very muchthe big down side of the movie is the writing the first half of the movie is amazing u feel like big thing is coming but then nothing happens what?!the ending is very poor , disappointing like make no sense and should had been richerbut if u like the movie depending on acting , environment u will like it ."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 February 2018,5/10,"Unfortunately, this film happened to be the biggest disappointment of 2017 for me so far. And I had super high hopes for it too. The trailer was incredibly intriguing and I had recently watched the other Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Thomas Anderson collaboration, There Will Be Blood, in order to prepare for this film and I was astounded by it. The masterful craft made it feel as though it were a well-oiled machine with zero expendable pieces that paced slowly forward in a formidable fashion, destroying all life before it. But in the decade in between these two films, the machine has begun to rust, gears have started slipping, and its efficacy has greatly depreciated. I think where it faltered was that where Blood felt as if it were a slow motion journey towards the ever more looming Mt. Doom, Thread was a meandering tale towards nothing more interesting than having the final destination as the supermarket.
It's not all bad, but I think most of the good comes with an equally negative trade-off. It feels like a skilled director is behind the camera and a lot of the shots are intricate although not that memorable. The characters feel real, but come across as incredibly annoying. Day-Lewis's character honestly gave me a headache, and perhaps an obnoxious character was intended, but it still gave me a headache and I began wondering why anyone involved themselves with him anyways, especially Vicky Krieps' character, Alma, his lover. He was not charming, he was not that enigmatic, he was rude, and most of all, he was just kind of a dick. So I couldn't understand the strife she put herself through, and the big ""reveal"" felt really quite pointless and confusing and muddled to me. Alma was the only character I really cared for, and I think if the entire cast fell into a volcano, it would dampen my heart a little, not too much, that I had to watch her flesh boil and mingle with the burnt flesh of the other cast members. I also found it irritating how hard they drilled the OCD-storyline portion into the story. Like I understand mental illness is something that affects all of your decisions, but this film drew on this concept so often that the well was dry before a third of the film was over (maybe it was a quarter, it's hard to tell, this movie really dragged hard). There are jokes - not all that funny, felt to me like small talk humor - made about it, the plot is about it, his dresses are affected by it, his relationships are affected by it, in a way the perfectly plotted shots reflect perhaps PTA's OCD. And for the OCD of a ""genius,"" I didn't find his craftsmanship that compelling as a dressmaker. I really wanted to love this movie, but it's wont for litanous dialogue and uninteresting situations really put me out of it."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 August 2021,5/10,"There are two great sequences. The sensual measuring sequence between vicky creeps/ddl & all the scenes involving the porkly woman. They are fantastic, masterful sequences which give you the sense that PTA is finding the footing that led to his masterpiece There Will Be Blood. After those sequences, the filmmaker said everything he wanted to say. The film ends after they reclaim the green dress. The rest feels painfully sarcastic as if the director is making fun of love, and making fun of you for watching a puffy period piece. Once the vehicles of Paul Thomas Anderson's cruelty fall in love, they cancel each other out and that cruelty has nowhere to go but the audience."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 June 2018,7/10,"When Reynolds announces, ""I have made the biggest mistake of my life."" I'm apt to agree. By the end of the movie, you will understand why. I enjoyed it enough that I watched it twice on DVD. The first time I watched it to enjoy it. The second time I watched to understand the story and the relationship dynamic between the two characters. The story is about Reynolds, a genius obsessed with his art, and a woman who becomes obsessed with the artist. The story begins when the two meet, in a restaurant where the woman, Alma, works. Reynolds is infatuated with Alma, and makes her his model and muse for his dresses. They are soon in ""love"" but after some time, Reynolds tires of Alma. Reynolds is a fragile sort of man, demanding and easily agitated, especially in the morning and Alma is determined to change him not realizing how set in his ways Reynolds can be. Upon realizing he cannot be changed and she is as expendable to him as the women who wears his meticulously designed dresses, does the unthinkable. Unthinkable in a way that we learn that Alma is a socio-path. Not because she is determined to have the man she wants, but the way she goes about it."

PHANTOM THREAD,11 February 2018,6/10,"I'll start by admitting the target market for this film isn't me. But I like Daniel Day Lewis and I've got a moviepass. I enjoyed parts of the movie, but not many. The character played by Lewis is bizarre and, to me not at all interesting or likeable. Unfortunately I didn't find any of the other characters to be captivating either. I did think the movie ""looked"" cool. I thought they perfectly drew me into the location and time period. Post war London in the 50s just looks cool to me. Other people seem to like it but I couldn't get into it."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,5/10,"Maybe i just don';t like movies directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Long periods of non-conversation and silent glances leading up to a big who-cares climax. The movie is a well-shot, well-acted, pretentious bore, Give me my 130 minutes back."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 October 2019,5/10,"Well shot and well acted. What's the point? or Purpose? To poison someone to force them to fall in love with you? Did she finally replace his mother? Nice story, slow. Leads down one path and then... Worst part, or, did I miss something? I research the movie after I watched it. That's his sister? Really? I thought they were going away for a 'Rendezvous'. Yea. It would have been nice to know that earlier in the movie, verses not at all. It makes some scenes make more sense. In my ratings book, not worth a second screening..."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 April 2018,1/10,"This movie's 7.7 rating is clearly due to the unjustified hype surrounding its unfortunately revered leading actor. It cannot be due to the substance of the movie itself - because there is none.It is unoriginal, depressingly vacuous, beyond slow, and as entertaining as watching a dishcloth dry.It is boring. The viewer will only find value in it if the viewer is of equally low quality.Save your time. Don't waste your sand on this disgrace."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 October 2019,10/10,A great and engaging story line and a surprise find for me as their was no prior knowledge of the movie. A selection by mistake if you will.My father was an Engineer and spent countless hours concentrating and focused on problem solving and developing those ideas into tangible things.This captures an element of the human spirit that is overlooked and brings into focus everyone has a someone.This is a keeper and worthy of a 10 out of 10.
PHANTOM THREAD,11 October 2020,5/10,"Set within the opulence and colorful fashion world of the wealthy, there's a hidden and very honest study of human relationships. Unfortunately, there's very little depth to this movie making me feel like an outsider and emotionally detached from the characters."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 October 2021,3/10,"It was mesmerizing, interesting and beautiful... then it started going off course... And then it got completely lost. Very disappointing. Had I know, I wouldn't have seen it."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 August 2020,10/10,"Phantom Thread is a simple, rich film that acts as both a comedy and a quietly devastating drama while also showcasing Daniel Day Lewis' acting prowess, Paul Thomas Anderson's skilled filmmaking, and Johnny Greenwood's beautiful score."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 February 2018,4/10,"This is a thoroughly boring and meaningless story. Great acting from all 3 main characters. But they are remarkably selfish and unlikable characters, each in their own way. The dressmaking is boring, there is almost no story line to speak of. At the end, one asks why - why did anyone bother to make such a beautiful movie with absolutely nothing worth watching except nice sets and some great actors doing nothing but being boring and unpleasant, albeit it very well. 
If you are interested in dressmaking and fashion, watch a movie about Coco Chanel, or even ""The Devil wears Prada"". At least you will be entertained. If you want to see interesting fashions from the 50s, watch ""The Crown"". This movie is a waste of good acing and time. I give it 4 stars because of the cast, but otherwise it's not worth more than a 2 for beautiful sets."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 December 2018,9/10,Daniel and Paul both geniuses. Incredible. This is the art of film. The definition of a toxic relationship.
PHANTOM THREAD,13 June 2021,7/10,"I loved the film but the loud music ruined it, to the point l had to put subtitles on to understand what they were saying. There was no need for the dramatic loud music which was annoying but acting and casting was spot on."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,6/10,"I want to hate this film but for some strange reason i can't . Maybe the black humour from the movie has infected me. Enough of this claptrap, what about the movie I hear you cry. Gorgeous sets . Beautiful score. Lovely pace and atmosphere. Some great dialogue, almost tarantinoesq, especialy the asparagus scene. The question is, is it meant to be viewed in such a manner? If not then most probably you'll hate it. Open your eyes a little and watch the comedy of the situation and me thinks you will enjoy it.Hope this review confuses you, so you may make your own mind up ."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 August 2018,5/10,"I Agree entirely with Michael Wood, ""London Review of Books"". A rather poor imitation of the cinematography, music, and plot themes found in 1940's and 50's gothic films. I love the old gothic movies but, this film left me unmoved and uninterested in the characters. I seem to have missed the tension or romance promised by critics. Unless I need to discover the erotic in characters as cold as a slab of grayish mudstone. I feel left out, just watched a robotic performance of an imitation of the films of a by-gone era. And Mr. Lewis, seems like he so often is Daniel playing Mad, Sad, Happy, Confused, Detached, blah, blah, Daniel Day Lewis."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 May 2018,3/10,"I'm sorry but I just can't see what all the enthusiasm around this movie is about. Acting and soundtrack are alright I suppose, but there is simply no story. I kept waiting for a point to be made, some interesting twist to show up, some sort of an ""aha"" moment... but it never came. By the end of it I was bored out of my skull."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 May 2021,2/10,"Count me in with those who believe this movie is a total pretentious bore. The main character (played by Daniel Day Lewis) is a pompous, affected, sociopathic, self-absorbed dress maker in a movie that is as tiresome and pompous as he is. The movie is deadly dull and the people are unsavory and icky despite the high brow settings. The 'romantic' relationship is unbelievable from the get go and much of the drama - what there is of it - arises from mental illness or petulant cruelty. The biggest mystery, however, is why this film was ever made and who in the world paid for it? More to the point: who keeps funding these wretched PTA movies? This is on par with the nonsense and psychosis on display in The Master. His films are freak shows dressed up as art, and trust me, not in a good way. The sister played by Lesley Manville was excellent and provided some sense of character in a film otherwise bereft of any feeling, humour, or plot. I suppose Phantom Thread was supposed to be about obsession and dominance but instead it is a horrible waste of two hours that grows more excruciating as the minutes grind away. To be clear, the cinematography, the production design, and the acting are pretty good. But it is the hollow, pompous and relentless pretense of being a serious art film that is most egregious here and ultimately excruciating to sit through. Let's face it: the people who think this movie is a 10/10 are kidding themselves or trying to kid everyone else, and they wouldn't be alone. PTA certainly did."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 January 2020,10/10,"Disappointed to read the negative reviews on IMDB, but I do understand them to an extent I think. I tried watching this late at night when I was tired and I couldn't engage with it at all. Gave up and then watched it instead bright-eyed at 9 in the morning and was completely captivated from start to finish.
So you do need a particular mindset to get the most out of this extraordinary film. It's slow and deliberate, a highly focussed examination of a three-way power struggle. The tension is of the slow-build variety, there are very few fireworks. A very subtle and compelling piece of film-making.
If this really is Daniel Day-Lewis' final film, it's a gem. He is superb, and I suspect the part was written with him in mind, possibly with one eye on The Age of Innocence. He inhabits the role completely.
All the acting is in fact top notch. Lesley Manville's performance as the icy sister is superb, chills you to the bone, but with such depth too. Vicky Krieps plays the complex role of Alma just right, with a just-right mix of strength and vulnerability, elegance and clumsiness, each conveyed with great power and subtlety.
A quick mention of the cinematography too - simply exquisite. And also some excellent music from Jonny Greenwood.
Paul Thomas Anderson has never made a bad film. This one is right up there with his best. I recommend it massively."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 December 2017,,"Inspired by the life and work of nine great fashion designers -- all of whom were gay -- Anderson sends the gayness right back into the closet. Neither he nor his costume designer have any notion of how the art of fashion or the world that supports it operates, nor do they understand the relationship gay artists have to the women that inspire them. And no I'm not talking about ""Will & Grace."" This film s a depressing travesty. Daniel Day-Lewis began his career playing a fearless gay man in ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" he ends it played a closeted stick-insect."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 March 2018,3/10,"I found it very hard to sit through all this film. I felt no real empathy for any of the characters - except the seamstresses, but their role was secondary to whatever it might be that was going on.
As the film developed it seemed pretty apparent to me that Woodcock was highly neurotic and possibly autistic. No laughing matter, and my progress through this film was marred by my fellow audience members laughing at his behaviour and outbursts.
Having mused on this film for a while now, I still find it simply empty of any real interest for me. Not one I will watch again."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 January 2019,3/10,"If you're having problems sleeping then this pretentious snooze festival could cure you.
'there Will be Blood' is one of the best films of this century. phantom thread is one of the most uninteresting."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 February 2018,4/10,"It's obvious that this is Anderson's goal, even the name of the protagonist (Woodcock) resembles the one of the grand master, but trying to be Hitchcock will only result to you falling ""on your back, helpless""...
There are some qualities in this film, the cinematography is great, music is also very nice, some of the supporting actors are really good (especially Lesley Manville) and Vicky Krieps is supurb in the first half, mediocre at best in the second. Everything else seems like a disaster, Daniel Day Lewis is really at his worst, the screenplay is filled with profound bulls**t, hinting at all the cliches that you can imagine and, of course, Anderson is NOT Hitchcock. There are some good scenes in the film, he is not Hitchcock but he has some talent, but fifteen interesting minutes can't save a two-hour movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 August 2019,9/10,"Another period piece by PTA, Phantom Thread is the story of a two way abusive relationship.The film is incredible but what I want to talk about is the problems people have with the film.A lot of people have problems with a decision made halfway though the film and the ending, I'm confused about why people think it doesn't work because without that decision this film would be a weird depiction of an abusive relationship.Another problem I've heard is the relationship feels too rushed, but that's the point. He meets her right after leaving another woman, it's obvious he hops from woman to woman gets infatuated then getting bored."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 April 2020,2/10,"The movie was well acted. But the movie rhythm too slow,if move below plot more early will be better:
restaurant scene - order breakfast, met almasick after finish wedding dress - dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock customer design the wedding dress
can early to show. This plot is so important, alma first suspected spy killing.Score : 2/10
Grade : E
Label : customer design wedding dress is so beautiful"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 February 2018,6/10,"I could understand any psychological crap that one might apply to the movie, but save me the troubles because it is just not a very good Anderson movie, especially compared with There Will Be Blood.The leading actress (whoever she is called) is a disaster...She is just a disaster...Day-Lewis portrays a true craftman. That is why I gave it a six. Anyway, he is a great actor, isn't he? But the movie itself is so dellusional, and I just feel everything about the movie is but a ghost story about the dress maker's mother."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 December 2019,2/10,"I have a feeling that critics seem to feel that they have to give high praise to anything starring Day-Lewis as what I experienced watching this was utter boredom and irritation, hoping that it would suddenly get better and make sense but it didn't. It was pedestrian, odd, boring and seemed to be pretending to be creepy and gothic but in my view failed miserably. My two star rating is being generous. An awful film."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 September 2018,1/10,"I wanted to get into this movie, with its stylised ambiance, dresses and brooding score.. Half way in, however, I was asking myself what I was doing there, much like Alma."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 June 2018,2/10,"I love PT Anderson and Daniel Day Lewis. I tried very hard to like this but the story really had no substance. Realistically, nothing happened at all for what felt like 5+ hours. The entire time I was waiting for something interesting to happen and it never does. I kept thinking he was going to kill her or some kind of incredibly unexpected twist was coming. I am amazed at how much I hated this movie. Everything was shot beautifully and well acted but it doesn't matter how well the actors portray their characters when the characters are dull morons who just stare at each other. There was no balance here and constant unrealistic plot points. I was unfortunately bored to death."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,10/10,It's one of those films which will be rated 10/10 by those who get it and 1/10 by those who don't. Give it shot. Robbed of the Oscar by the dimwit jury. Nevermind!
PHANTOM THREAD,28 February 2018,4/10,"It's difficult to disagree with film lovers who are so enthusiastic about Phantom. But we will. Let's say you are searching for a movie to enjoy, to maybe even analyze or critique with friends. Let's say you choose Phantom at mall or at an art house.Were you to be unaware of Anderson's rep, of the Kubrick influence, etc., you might just walk into this movie expecting to connect with characters on some level other than psychosis. The overwhelming effect of noir, of dark, of shadow, of neuroses is claustrophobic. We simply wanted to leave - physically and mentally - after the first half hour. There was not, for us, a moment of caring or connecting to any character. Yes, the actors are brilliant with their delivery and their body language; and the fashion scenes are interesting (gowns are gorgeous); but ultimately we didn't give a hoot who slept with whom or who slept at all (or who lived or died).Because the plot line is so tenuous and so random, there's no real link to establish engagement.Without being a spoiler, it's a challenge to even review this. You'll just have to decide whether your time and money are available for a couple of hours of dull pain. Read the review in the New Yorker mag some months ago for a more literate and critical explication."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2018,1/10,"What are people smoking to give this movie such admiration. It was the most soulless, painfully boring movie I've ever seen. The plot and quality of the film were a phantom thread, they were nowhere to be seen.Best part was when it finally ended"
PHANTOM THREAD,10 February 2018,7/10,"I was excited as I can be when sitting down to view ' phantom thread ' by the great master Paul Thomas Anderson . I was introduced to his work towards the end of high school with 'boogie nights ' and became a certified PTA fanatic after ' magnolia '. Every film he releases is met with that same anticipation . I turn off phones , shut the blinds , restrict distractions and prepare for an artistic vision of the highest order . Phantom thread is what were come to expect from Anderson . Immaculate scenes set up with precision and grace . Impeccable cinematography . And career defining performances . But to me , the film had me doing something I've done with his work . I looked at my watch mid film . Actually , I did it twice . Does it mean I disliked the film ? It couldn't . As I thought about every element I require in film was ticked off . The story . The story didn't grab me . Not the way it should . I didn't care for the overlong glances with no dialogue . "" inherent vice "" Anderson's previous film had so much going on . The story and characters flew in every direction . PT was the opposite . It was at a snails pace and that left me not caring for the characters . Daniel day Lewis was dominating the scenes without having to really stretch himself or get out of first gear . I may need to watch again in a month to have another perspective . But a 7/10 . 7.5 if I could . Phantom thread is still better and worthwhile than most other films day and age ."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 December 2017,9/10,"It's very rare in this day of poor movies only designed to make money, to see something as elegant and well made as Paul Thomas Anderson's new movie ""The Phantom Thread"". This seemingly simple love story between a self-absorbed dressmaker (Reynolds Woodcock) and yet another model (Alma), has much complexity lying below the surface. As director Paul Thomas Anderson explained in a recent interview; the script is thin, because the story is told through looks. This sort of storytelling works well in a period piece, which this very much is. Anderson came up with the story researching fashion industry mogul Cristóbal Balenciaga. Set in the 1950's England, Woodcock played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a self-absorbed career-minded dressmaker, who is seemingly only interested in women for their shape. He's obsessed with finding the perfect shape to help guide his dressmaking and after he kicks out his previous in-house girl, finds Alma (played by Vicky Krieps) a cafe worker near his sea-side home. He falls madly in love with her body and Alma has nowhere to go, so she's dragged into his world. At first, she loves being pampered and dressed, but eventually realizes Woodcock is a very difficult and distant person to be around. His obsession with work is nearly constant, which puts their relationship into uneven territory. This is not helped by Woodcock's sister Cyril (played by Lesley Manville) who lives with him as well. She's seen these relationships come and go, seemingly dozens of them in recent years. She's there to protect and manage her brother and rightly so, he needs managing. Alma does truly love Woodcock and tries desperately to save the relationship because she knows deep inside, he loves her too. After many failed attempts, she goes for the jugular and like a Shakespearian play. Her very rash and dangerous thought process, puts them back together again in an unexpected way. Woodcock eventually catches on to her madness, but instead of punishing her, accepts it's the only thing that will keep them together. This wonderful, beautiful and lush story is acted with impeccable precision and love by three brilliant actors, some who've already won awards for their performances this year, even though the movie isn't being released until January. The story goes that Paul Thomas Anderson wrote the story years ago for Daniel Day-Lewis, who is long retired from acting. It was about convincing him to come out of retirement, that was the delay in production. It was Lewis who found the movies leading lady Vicky Krieps, who until this point had not played a leading lady in an American film. The two of them have amazing chemistry, to the point where they seem like old mates from another life. This is one of Daniel Day-Lewis's best performances of his entire career. It's incredible seeing him on screen, he is a tour de force and constantly amazes the viewers at every moment. Even in static shots of his face, you can see him thinking, he really is Reynolds Woodcock. Then there is his sister Cyril, what a magnificent performance by Lesley Manville, a British television regular. She is the glue that binds the story and Woodcock's life together. Since this movie is a period piece, costumes, vehicles, buildings, everything needed to be adjusted to fit the period and there were little to no ""touch ups"" done in post. The costume design was outstanding, not just the dresses made by Woodcock, but also the normal clothes people wore. You could feel the fabric as it was being worked with, you could smell the rooms and hear the creeks as people walked around. The entire movie was shot on location, both in London and a near-by seaside town. This allowed the production to focus on just a few places, which makes the art direction that much better. This movie is the first time Paul Thomas Anderson worked without a cinematographer. His normal DP Robert Elswit, was unavailable but his normal crew was available. Since all you really need is a vision, great gaffer and camera crew, the role of a DP isn't AS important. Michael Bauman was credited as the ""lighting cameraman"" which is incidentally the same credit as Kibrick used on his movies. It's not easy to shoot a period piece, mostly taking place in a small ""practical"" (on location) rooms, but the cinematography on this movie was impeccable. Shot in 3 perf 35mm with Kodak Vision 200T and 500T stocks, the movie looks absolutely stunning and fits the period perfectly. Anderson works entirely photochemically, producing his movies the old way, striking dailies, watching film prints on a daily basis during production and cutting negative. Due to Anderson's obsession with high quality theatrical distribution, the film is being presented in 4k digital OR as I saw it, 70mm blow up's from the original camera negative. The print at the Arclight is directly from the negative, which is quite astonishing. There were moments when I shed a tear because of how good film looks when shot properly. Things like dynamic range, the delicious blacks and soft highlights, there is just no other way to put such a beautiful image onto a screen in my opinion. Then there is Johnny Greenwood, or should I call him, the best composer for 2017. His score is by far, one of the best scores I've ever heard, could be one of the best scores in cinema history. He did this with Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood"" in 2008, but this time he's outdone himself. Not only did he reference period music, but also the classics, integrating many themes from classical composers. The theme can be heard on nonesuch records youtube page if you so desire to look it up. That piece is only one of a dozen pieces which lead you to remember the beautiful visuals and storytelling. In retrospect, one has to admit this could Paul Thomas Anderson's best movie and looking back on the year's movies, by far the best movie of 2017 in my opinion. It has everything anyone could ever want in a movie, wonderful story, brilliant acting, set on a stage that's entertaining and provocative. Then you add all the technical accolades and the entire picture is perfect in my mind. As the movie finished and the credits came on, the finishing touch was the photochemical credits, something that nobody does anymore and it just reinforces the artistic beauty of the format. This isn't just a movie about what's on screen, but also a swan song to the photochemical process and the beauty that lives within. This is a movie that MUST be seen by any film buff, anyone who cares about the artistry and photochemical process. I can't wait to see it again."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 July 2018,10/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis recently said, ""there is nothing more beautiful in all the arts than something that appears simple."" When you have the greatest living filmmaker and greatest living actor working together, still at the top of their crafts, the product can certainly almost appear simple. Day-Lewis, who may be appearing for the final time on-screen, shows a more nuanced side to his acting abilities (especially compared to a boisterous role like Abraham Lincoln) but is still as strong as ever. Newcomer Vicky Krieps, who holds her own opposite the best ever, is an instant star and one of the year's breakout talents.The movie is a love story with a dark twist. The best reference point that comes to mind is Gone Girl - not in plot, but in escalating power plays and destructive behavior despite mutual dependence. Like mother!, it shows the dangers of obsessive artistry and toxic masculinity, but never damns anyone. Phantom Thread bluntly shows the egotistical side to human nature and the paradox that is coexistence, yet it never fully succumbs to cynicism. It embraces it's sentimentality and captures the feeling of truly needing the love of another. Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood sets the tone throughout with his perfect score, and ""House of Woodcock"" especially entices you to fall in love too."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 February 2018,10/10,"Despite appearing a drama through the trailers, Phantom Thread can embrace other types of films, such as ""Romance"", Thriller and even Comedy ... Well, it's not an intentional comedy, sometimes you laugh for reasons I can not explain. The productions of the film are gigantic, well made, especially the Design: what beautiful dresses! PTA always manages to excel, in creativity, in the script and in the direction always giving a well done work. I think the main thing about this movie is how they get together, in a strange way, but who can manage to explain love, do not they? The movie only has a high point, always leaving you intrigued, wondering what it was going to give, from the first look to the last fight. Great actors! Daniel Day Lewis always showing why he is the best actor to date and the others doing a magnificent job.
It's a beautiful movie, although it's melancholic, but it's worth watching, to see what a well-made movie is in all areas."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 March 2018,9/10,"Actors and actresses were absolutely amazing, the story is twisted, complicated and beautiful and the events are accurate and unexpected. It's truly a masterpiece. Phantom Thread was miles and MILES ahead of Shape of Water IMHO (in all aspects, from story to music and acting) and it was the movie that deserved the best picture and direction. Definitely a must watch."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,5/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson gets into constructing these hermetic period piece movies (i.e. The Master) where no one knows what he's obsessing about, but everyone is so baffled they assume it's genius. Phantom Thread is another one, like Anderson watched a slew of 1950's Hitchcock movies and wanted to imitate them but forgot the point. The initially-fascinating relationship between a meticulous dress-designer and his muse turns into a shapeless contest of wills, never going to far in any direction. The costumes and period design are great, but it all starts to feel like an episode of Mad Men except across the pond; dramatic loitering."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2018,10/10,"This movie has haunted me since I saw it a week ago. Daniel Day-Lewis' agonizingly beautiful performance of a man haunted by his mother, his personal ghosts, his passion and his allergic reaction to anything remotely human, creates an ache in the viewer that goes beyond understanding. His relationships to his sister and his favorite model, as he goes through his daily business of creating beautiful clothes for his rich clients, are a complex puzzle that defies understanding yet somehow feels achingly familiar. Hitchcock fans will find a Mrs. Danvers and a Madeline in this ""types"" who are not types at all. We suspect and begin to see a dawning of understanding as to why he detests noise, intimacy and surprises, and then the whole thing is turned upside down on us. Then again, we begin to see the human side of this strange genius and his equally strange, and, we think, accommodating model; again the world does not unfurl the way we expect it to. If this doesn't win the Oscar then, well, shame on them, but I suspect it is too subtle, too unnerving and too complex for the committee. 
Just a couple of clinkers I noticed: A man who has created gowns and dresses for a princess since she was born, would not ask her, ""Are you a silver or gold person?"" With the kind of mind that he has, which is obsessed with detail, he would have known those details years before. Also, there is no such thing as Welsh Rabbit, it's Welsh Rarebit and it is a melted cheese and beer concoction which is served on toast. No cheese appears on his order of ""Welsh Rabbit."" Neither would such a fuss budget accept a piece of asparagus on which the side ""nubs"" have not been shaved. This is done in even the most ordinary homes. But these incidentals aside, this is a film of extraordinary beauty (including the clothes) in its simultaneous psychological insights and left turns. A mother. A mother. I think it was all about her, and I adored the way it neither defined nor ignored such a seminal relationship. You will not be disappointed."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 November 2018,1/10,"Running out of movies to watch that are rated over 7, I gave this one a try due to its 7.5. About 15 minutes into it, I had the sneaking suspicion that once again I'd been had, with people with some financial interest in the movie giving all the gushing reviews. I was finding myself becoming physically sick, subconsciously reacting to the utter dreariness of what was unfolding on the screen.Putting this dreck-masquerading-as-art on pause, I went back to IMDB. As I have learned to do in such cases, I started to read all the 1-star reviews. These tend to be from people who've learned to cut through the hype. Yep, they confirmed my suspicions spot on, 100%. I stuck with the movie as long as I did hoping it would pull itself out of the pompous pit of self-importance I could see it was embracing, only to be forewarned, mercifully, by others who stuck it out to the incredibly bitter end, that nope, it doesn't get any better.Save yourself and watch something that won't drain you, bore you, depress you, and leave you less of a person than when you started. For that's what this utter abomination will do to you, trust me."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 April 2020,8/10,"This is a movie about an off-the-charts fastidious man with a mother complex by the name of Reynolds Woodcock who is a world class London fashion designer. Woodcock has many of the predictable characteristics of a man with a mother complex: artistic sensibility, narcissism, compulsiveness, irritability, and the inability to maintain long-term relationships with women who never measure up.Woodcock lives in an apartment within his fashion house. The house is fronted and managed by his sister Cyril, a tough-as-nails British matron who understands her brother fully, and manages him through his many mood swings and failed relationships. As the movie begins, Woodcock has tired of yet another of his many muses and the sister is dispatched to tell the girl the bad news that her man is never going to fall back in love with her.Before long Woodcock meets Alma, woos her into his world, and the rest of the movie follows this relationship. Will Woodcock tire of Alma as he did all of the women before her? Will she be able to tolerate his off-the-charts obsessive compulsive disorder and unpredictable mood swings? We see scene after scene, and at times we are convinced this relationship is headed for the skids, while in others it is apparent these two have a deep and abiding love for one another.Make no mistake. This is an unhealthy relationship. He is an obsessive-compulsive control freak, and she is a an extremely insecure nourisher who desperately needs him to need her to take care of him. Given their personality clash, it seems apparent that the relationship will devolve into darkness, and of course it does.I will say no more out of respect for those who have not yet seen the movie. However, I will say that the final reveal was unbelievable to me. Given all we had learned about Woodcock's character throughout the film, I found it impossible to believe he would willingly compromise himself to the extent that he does in the end, and for me that made the ending a disappointment.I forgive the ending because the film itself was so artfully made by director Paul Thomas Anderson, and the acting so spot on by all three leads (Daniel Day Lewis, Leslie Manville and Vickie Krieps), that Anderson could have ended the film by showing monkeys flying out of his backside and I still would have liked it."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,1/10,Not since Holly Hunter tied herself to a falling piano has a love story reached a climax that moves the audience to tears of laughter.
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,9/10,"Let's cut the slice, we're not going into this movie like we would other movies: We only get a Paul Thomas Anderson film twice a decade; This is set to be Daniel Day-Lewis' (front runner for the greatest actor of all time) final movie ever; and the last time the two worked together, their movie won two Oscars - including best actor for Day-Lewis - and was nominated for another six. I, for one, walked into this picture with a monocle and mustache wax on.From the onset, let me just say that this wasn't something you had the capacity to ""like."" At best, you could merely hope to ""appreciate"" it. It was tedious as fuck, it was easily the most screwed up love story I've seen since Gone Girl, and it was the final installment in 2017's barrage of brilliant filmmakers making movies about the plight of the genius artist and the torment of being their muse.Daniel Day-Lewis, of course, was infallible, and the sadness of knowing this will more than likely be the last performance we ever see from the thespian made his every mannerism that much more haunting. 
Usually watching whichever poor bastard they cast opposite Day-Lewis play dress up next to the king is like watching a lamb going off to slaughter, but Vicky Krieps held her own. More than that, really, I think her performance not only enhanced D.D.L's, but the entire movie as well. This film marks the end of a legends career, but I think it might also be the birth of a new ones.The writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson practically water-boarded us with frame after frame of color and beauty. All story and acting aside, I'd watch this again just for the wallpaper and fabrics. The man has always known how to fill a scene and isn't afraid to just let the camera run and run.If a normal movie is a kick-ass rock concert, this one is more like an opera. It's not for everyone and you're more likely to drive home in silence than jacked up and ready for a new tattoo, but all the same, I recommend it. If this is playing in film as opposed to digital in your city, it's well worth it to shell out the extra money to see this the way you were meant to.Prescriptions
Checkout Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis' other masterpiece: There Will Be Blood."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 December 2018,1/10,"Luscious musical score and brilliant portrayal of a hateful person by DDL but really one longed for a deliverance from the unpleasantness, a sense of ambivalence or paradox but no, unrelentingly boring and tedious, with nothing of importance. Tragic missed opportunity to say something of value. Hopefully DDL last movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 June 2020,1/10,If your age is 70 and you have no work to do then this is your cup of tea
PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2021,6/10,"This movie had a plot twist that I wasn't expecting. Nevertheless, it wasn't a ""masterpiece"" as some where saying. Very good acting was a good watch but giving it 10/10? Come on."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2019,10/10,"This is a movie for old souls. This is not a slow movie as some has written. I believe that it´s intention was to let you be a guest there in real time and feel all the natural pauses that happens in life, bathing in Daniel Day-Lewis beautiful rhythm. And how well the older Daniel meshed with the younger Vicky in a poetic tango.
Daniel Day-Lewis has said that this would be His last film, and if that is so, then He leaved after laying down His ACE.
Someone compared this to ""Bitter Moon"". I don´t agree. The couples had different obstacles, and the other movie was as the title: bitter.
This movie is art and one should see it with only one expectation:
Daniel Day-Lewis will deliver GOLD."
PHANTOM THREAD,31 March 2018,7/10,"Watched with my partner and his parents. I really enjoyed it and would recommend. Acting could not be faulted, characterisation good. I didn't find it to be too slow because I found myself quite engulfed. My partner and I found it frequently humorous (when the relationship dynamics hit close to home). But I was the only one of four to say after that I really enjoyed it. So go figure. Every pot finds a lid."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 July 2018,4/10,"There Will Be Blood (TWBB) is one of my favorite movies. Paul Thomas Anderson is a director of above mentioned film and a very talented director. A patient storyteller with unique perspective. Daniel Day-Lewis is a star of TWBB and one of the greatest actors alive. This movie has both of these men, but left me bored, not entertained and disappointed.
It's not a story about love - I don't think these people are capable of love.
It's not about one man obsession with perfecting his craft. He was born a perfectionist.
It's one woman'd quest (a struggle really) to belong.
Where she doesn't.
And she knows it.
So does everyone else.
But her obsession finds a way. And then, the unthinkable happens. Won't tell you what! No spoilers this time. You'll have sit through 2+ hours to experience the ""grand finale "".
Of course it's not all bad. 1* is the minimum here, so we just take it for granted (it's only fair - an effort was made). Another * is for Daniel Day-Lewis being in it. One more for cinematography. And another again for DDL - it's a pleasure to see this man work, never mind the material.
4/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,5 June 2020,8/10,"This is definitely my favourite character portrayal I've seen from Daniel Day-Lewis. Cold, eccentric and very believable. Many scenes had me sweating with discomfort. The posh-sounding score complimented every moment and added a lot to the atmosphere. This wasn't really a genre of movie I was expecting to enjoy, but I was very invested.
I don't think I understand what the ending was trying to get at though, I found it a bit tonally confusing.
8.5/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,7 April 2018,7/10,Well this is a classic relationship story when the girl is trying to change the guy to her own image. I liked the fashion related parts and Daniel was amazing but the character Krieps played became more ridiculous towards the end of the movie. Seriously using poisonous mushrooms just to get some love and gratitude back from your husband that is just crazy. I think that was just too much. And Krieps became creepy towards the end with her fake smiles and crazy eyes. It was not about love anymore but some insane selfish craving to be acknowledged.
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,9/10,"Underrated. A fitting end to a great career for DDL. Skillful and spell-bounding this is a movie for the ages. Anderson creates a world like a rich, plush Persian rug: colorful, complex, ordered and yet intriguing. The more you look the more you see. However, the trick is what's hiding under the rug."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 July 2019,4/10,"This movie lost considerable believability for me early in the story when a pretty waitress (age: 23) falls immediately for a man (age: 60) whom she only knows to be a customer and nothing more. From what I've seen, old farts have to buy pretty girlfriends, especially ones that are one-third their age. Geezers looking for ""trophies"" have to lavish their girls with money, gifts, and treat them like queens. Otherwise, what's the point? A pretty young woman can easily find a strapping, handsome, and interesting young man, many of whom also have money as well. In the real world, in the first scene, Alma would've most likely not even paid as much attention to Reynolds as she would have paid to the silverware.The movie continues to trundle down its road of dubious credibility, like when the dressmaker literally strips the expensive dress off of a wealthy patroness that he had previously sold to the same patroness.Daniel Day-Lewis displays his usual genius, this time portraying a narcissistic jerk with perfection.But at a certain point in the movie, Alma asks herself in front of Reynolds, ""What am I doing here?"" I had the same question throughout the movie. Unfortunately, the writers never answer this question."

PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,7/10,"The acting is impeccable. Daniel Day-Lewis is highly skilled in his trade and played the character richly. This drama is worth watching just simply due to the powerful acting alone.The drift of the drama is nicely paced but in certain parts, the editing could have been done more optimally because I felt the momentum was lost during the extended scenes that were slower in pace.The story line is quite disturbing and brings to mind of mentally and clinically ill characters. On the one hand, I enjoyed the story line but, on the other hand, the shocking characters and their behaviors took away some of the enjoyment of the story."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 January 2021,1/10,"Please don't waste your time! Dreary, dreary and dreary!"
PHANTOM THREAD,16 January 2018,7/10,"Let us get this out of the way- Phantom Thread is a beautiful film with a great premise and promise. A couture dress designer (Daniel Day Lewis) is demanding in the extreme and finds a muse (Vicky Krieps). He enjoys using her as a dress model and a companion, but she wants more. Along the way, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, throws hints of intrigue starting with the title of the film. There are empty pretensions of dress-making as high art, secret messages sown into dresses and haunting memories. All of this leads to- exactly nowhere. Everything Lewis and Krieps do is recorded lovingly and meticulously on film with great mood music in the background. But there is no great reveal, no deep insight into human psyche, no higher truth. In the end it comes down to what a woman wants and what the man can live with. Lewis and Krieps are excellent, especially Krieps, but Lesley Manville as Lewis's sister has the thankless job of looking stern in every scene. Nothing in the film sticks with you when you leave the theater except the dresses, photography and the music; because Anderson has not come up with anything really interesting in the story. Unlike his ""There Will Blood"", which was a great film, Phantom Thread is a phantom film. It is a beautiful ghost of what should have been a really good film. See it if you wish to say goodbye to Daniel Day Lewis, but keep your expectations low."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 April 2018,1/10,"This film was so bad on so many levels. First the writing. It reflected the intelligence that wrote ""Run, Spot, Run"". The pace was that of a wounded snail. Now to the acting, what little there was. Daniel Day Lewis is usually pretty good, but this performance is going to be one of those that he wishes he had never committed to film. ""Wooden"" does not do it justice. The music was disjoint, distracting, inappropriate, and just plain soporific. In all, I could not recommend this movie to insomniacs, because this is not even a good way to be bored to sleep."
PHANTOM THREAD,16 August 2018,9/10,"This film was absolutely fantastic in every way. The performances were all amazing especially Daniel Day-Lewis. It's no surprise he did an amazing job but it was shocking seeing how transformed he was into this character, it was truly a joyous time watching a master at work. The score by Jonny Greenwood was elegantly hypnotic, it was as if I was in a trance every time that amazing piano theme started playing, it added so much to the film. It could also get very dark and kind of disturbing at times, all in a delightful way and enjoyable through and through. Although there wasn't anything out of this world with the directing, Paul Thomas Anderson truly made a spectacular film and it's definitely on my top movies of 2017."
PHANTOM THREAD,11 May 2018,3/10,"I certainly could not discern the thread of this movie at all. Pretentious is the word that comes to mind. There is plenty of reviews lauding the artistry, masterpiece, elegance. I am just not one of them."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 June 2019,8/10,Very cleverly layered film spanning decadent luxury to basic attraction. Telling a love story of gripping and unusual intensity.
PHANTOM THREAD,16 January 2019,10/10,"You have to wrap your head around this one but man this is one of the best film of the year 2017. I loved it. Great acting what-so-ever by my favorite Daniel day Lewis. He is riveting as always. Cast is good. Background music plays the trick for them. Direction is very good too. People are saying that it is boring then what i think is that they lack a taste for drama. This is what we call pure drama. Many people are complaining for it being so slow. Some don't understand it at all. Some don't like the idea. Well, you should've known for what you were going. Didn't you watch the trailer? Did they promise Avengers where every character is flying around and bla bla bla. Man, This movie is something. Just like the Florida project, this one is great too. Claustrophobic elegance mate. Thankyou for making my evening this good.
Cheers,give it a try"
PHANTOM THREAD,11 October 2019,9/10,"I would like to begin by claiming that PTA is within my all time top 5 directors. This was the only piece of his work I was yet to see. Finally the time came and I must say, it does deviate his intentions drastically in comparisson to his most recent work prior to this, Inherent Vice, but it does it beautifully.Direction is superb; originality in plenty of shots, adequate positionings and of course, the help of superb actors, are all cornerstones on PTA's film that guarantee it a rather excelent transmission of emotions. Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps own the film in a properly balanced equation, both on alone screen time for each, and also, together. Lesley Manville does a solid performance to bring strong sense into the only developed secondary character. The story basically revolves around these 3, and I must say, it heavily conveys emotional and mental shifts with the help of a wonderful script from Anderson himself. I have never seen any of Kriep's work but I definitively intend to, she did a great job. DDL is simply a flawless actor, he does top himself work after work and it's a shame if he truly decides to step aside from acting.Cinematography, wardrobe and environment are all very strong subjects within the film. 90% of it happens inside a house, and with the gorgeous staging and shooting manner, your eyes are not exhausted but amazed by it. Stairways, artifacts, dressing, all brilliantly approached detaling.Music is of heavy reliance in this film. It is used as a constant tone-set tool, bringing such a precise feeling to the atmosphere. Parallel to other movies in which music is used to highlight suspense or tension, this film often lets those moments intensify with silence and measured conversations.Pacing is rather slow but it's just the way it should be. The story advances in the precise time so to show how they feel about each other and what they intend to do about it.In conclusion, the picture is just another proof of PTA's insatiable talent. With little hints of comedy, and true development of dramatic/romantic situations, the DDL-Krieps formula worked perfectly for Anderson, in my opinion. These actors are the only options I'd buy for the characters. With not many words said about their feelings, gestures, expressions, dialogues and lack thereof communication, they are the most important feature in the movie.Phantom Thread is worth every one of the nominations it recieved, and in my opinion, it was a great year for the film to come out as it joins the Drama/Character Study collection amongst Moonlight, Manchester by the Sea and many others. To my analysis, definitively within the best 5 films of 2017. Paul Thomas Anderson, you are true inspiration and one hell of a cinema director. I wish someday, I'll be at your level."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2018,7/10,"A great looking film that is not a great film. This is the story of an utterly loathsome man that is dressed up, literally dressed up, in the trappings of art. Look beyond those trappings and it's a pretty empty story. We should never let questions of plausibility get in the way of deciding whether a film is worthwhile or not but here one does have to ask if anyone (i.e. Alma (Krieps)), regardless of their long term motives, would willingly spend any time with someone so detestable as Reynolds (Day Lewis). As other reviewers have noted, the pacing is plodding and considering the story told, the film could easily have been 30mins shorter without losing anything. Still, with the stylish garments and elegant interiors of the Bloomsbury townhouse, the film is beautiful to look at. Also, Jonny Greenwood's music works well. So, this is a perfectly enjoyable movie, and after Anderson's last effort 'Inherent Vice,' that is really saying something. But let's not pretend this is anything more."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 February 2018,1/10,"My friend and I left the cinema without saying anything until finally one of us said, 'I hated it' and the other one said in relief, 'So did I!'The characters were utterly without appeal and the reason for the story eluded us. Only truly dedicated Daniel Day-Lewis fans should see this, and only on DVD."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 March 2019,7/10,"""I think it's the expectations and assumptions of others that cause heartache"", a line spoken by Reynolds Woodcock, portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis towards Alma, portrayed by Vicky Krieps, during one of their first meetings. It may not be a memorable line or the most significant line (Unless you want to include a number of times Daniel says ""f... off"" to the doctor or few uses of the word f-word during the argument scene) but in my opinion the line sets up Alma's character throughout the film especially the last one hour of the movie. As for Daniel's portrayal nothing much can be said that is already been said. His performance and commitment to character is well known and most of you heard stories about his method of acting. But what I will talk about is Vicky Krieps. Alma may seemed like any other character. A girl wanting to be loved by a guy but the guy, in this case Reynolds is unable to love her like a normal person do. But what makes it interesting is how her character as the movie progresses, becomes more emotionally complex and complicated. Sure she may do things that are deemed questionable but she will do whatever it takes to make him love her even when Reynolds is becoming more complicated by her standards. That twisty kind of relationship may leave you feeling kinda heavy and complicated despite the relatively easy story. The performances of both Daniel and Vicky are worth noting and of course Lesley Manville who portrays Daniel's sister Cyril is also worth mentioning as her portrayal of a level-headed sister who develops a liking towards Alma and the only one who can tolerate Daniel's character. Overall not an easy viewing but if you don't mind slow-burning drama with a twisty kind of relationship or a huge Paul Thomas Anderson fan, then give this a watch. But other than that i wouldn't put this on my list of films I will definitely watch again on my Letterboxd."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 March 2018,2/10,"After reading reviews and watching trailers, I didn't even want to see it, but I did, because of, you guessed it, Daniel. 
I didn't see or feel any kind of love or even attraction when they first met at the restaurant. There is no chemistry whatsoever. As someone else said, totally unrelatable and I'll add a totally irrelevant story to ever be told. Pointless and bleak, the performances don't even matter. I checked when it will finish 5 times at least."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 May 2018,8/10,"User reviews have not been kind, yet I liked this movie. Daniel Day-Lewis gave another bravo performance. Thought I knew where the plot was headed but was surprised."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2018,1/10,"I'm going against the grain here, but this isn't the film I hoped it was. Daniel Day-Lewis was adequate in the role, but this is what he chose for his last? That's... disappointing. My Left Foot was astounding. Even Lincoln was breathtaking. This is certainly adequate, but he can do so much more. Best actor in the film is Lesley Manville. Easily. But the disturbing thing here is that it's a film trying to pass itself off as art, when it's really just a fantasy about an abusive relationship. Art, this is not. My wife said we should have gone to see Jumanji instead -- at least we would have enjoyed it. When Ms. English Major says that about a film that's pitched directly to her, you know it was bad.Sorry, one star, and that's for the couture. A tip of the hat to Mark Bridges for outstanding costumes."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 February 2018,,"There is love of son for mother, brother for sister, man for woman in this film. Above all this is a brilliant examination of the obsession of a genius for the work that consumes him. The film examines the lengths to which a person may go to obtain their hearts desire in terms of both love and power. The music is magnificent, expertly tailored to mirror the themes of the film; the cinematography is excellent and very moody, brilliant and chilling at times. As for the performances, the casting is spot on, not a weak link with Daniel Day Lewis outstanding, you understood completely this complex difficult man, closely matched by Lesley Manville and Vicky Krieps. I became very irritated by the latter, correctly in the context of the film. In fact she was a manipulative, potentially murderous woman in the way many women have the capacity to be to take power in a relationship."

PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2018,4/10,"It is a pretentious film that masquerades as a work of art. It should have been and could have been an outstanding film. The photography, period pieces, countryside, etc. were all beautiful; however, the story and plot (or lack thereof) suffered and droned on unbearably. I kept waiting for the film to finally take hold of its viewers, but it never did and it never got off the ground either. Such a shame. It's a movie about an aging, single dressmaker to the wealthy with a fetish for his mother, who lives with his aging, bossy single sister and takes on a young female lover from time to time until he is annoyed with them and until his sister bosses them out. He then meets a daughter-like lover who is deadly and is even more manipulative and devious than his sister. Total waste of two hours that I'll never get back. I only gave it 4 stars because of the scenery and photography."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 April 2021,8/10,Not as good as There Will Be Blood or The Master but a great movie nonetheless.
PHANTOM THREAD,12 April 2018,7/10,"I am the adult child of a father who lived for 25 years with a woman who had one illness after another. Each of these illnesses, from allergies to TMJ to back pain would resolve...and then another would present. My father spent two and a half decades being mother hen to her. I dare say that the more attention he gave, the more she rose to the occasion with a variety of medical issues. 
In the end, when he was diagnosed with dementia- she left him. She moved away for several years; she filed security alerts at her place of work and alleged that he was stalking her. She waited until the disease progressed far enough that he was willing to marry. Less than two years into the marriage she committed him to a locked, private pay nursing facility and had full financial control of his affairs. 
This brings me to the dynamic in Phantom. It's not love. It is some type of sick symbiotic relationship. Sometimes one party has the power and is a manipulator but on occasion the roles reverse. It was uncomfortable to watch Daniel Day Lewis's character be subjugated by Alma"
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,1/10,"Girlfriend said this will be great - I watched half an hour of it and I was dozing. Guy next to me was either purring or snoring with eyes shut. Tedious main character played by Daniel Day Lewis was so irritating that I'd've clouted him if he spoke to me like he spoke to the women in the film. 
All in all nothing really happens in the entire film. Daft thing is it is such crap that it'll probably win an Oscar."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 May 2018,10/10,"I have been a long-time fans of DDL, known for his 'method' acting style and of course his handsome face, nobody will deny he is a great actor. I have been a long-time fans of PTA too. PTA is a courageous director, because he keep exploring. I mean, look at his filmography, every movie of his is different from his other movie. Got it? Ok.Suck us to the life of Reynolds Woodcock, this movie, like every good movies, has succeded in building the atmosphere of a dress-maker life and an artist obsession, and of course vintage era love story. It's immensely deserve that costume design Oscars, because that's what the movie talk about, isn't it? Of course they should win, they really enlive, with in-depth description, the life of a famous dressmaker.It reminds me of Punch Drunk-Love (2002), PTA's first romance movie. But this is something different. With Reynolds' artistic obsession as a subplot, this movie still has the 'function' of a romance. Got it? Still touched us to the bottom of our heart the way Punch Drunk-Love or more notable movies like La La Land. With all of this humbleness, that feeling, of strucked, of touched.Day-Lewis is amazing. He never ran out of aura, different aura from his other movies, let's say, Gangs of New York, There Will Be Blood. It takes different aura from this movie. Proving his capability of acting, Day-Lewis actually well-deserved for Oscars if there's no Gary Oldman in front of his way. Vicky Krieps, suprisingly mesmerizing and that she could build the chemistry with an older and talented actor is an achievement. A very very must-watch movie, don't miss this beautiful farewell by Day-Lewis."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 December 2018,10/10,A collector's item........a masterpiece......Ssshhh
PHANTOM THREAD,27 December 2017,10/10,"Intimate, delicate, and a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Paul Thomas Anderson manages to expresses an artist's creative journey through threads of fashion and romance with such subtlety that it could only be conveyed through the medium of film. An atmosphere reminiscent of Kubrick's achievements, this romantic odyssey illustrates a unique perspective of love; a perspective in which love is shaped and manipulated by the fragile strings of each character's hearts.
  To begin with, I will praise an awfully disregarded aspect of ""Phantom Thread"": the cinematography and direction. The style and manner in which Paul Thomas Anderson uses silence and long takes is ingenious, and as stated above, was most likely inspired from Kubrick's works. Similar to the quote, ""The less you say, the more your words will matter,"" the more silence, the more each line will signify. The more long takes, the more each short take will signify. Therefore, this method permits a greater control over the variety of dramatic effects; and in turn, the audience's emotions. Anderson also utilized this technique in many of his other films, including ""The Master"", ""Magnolia"", and his masterpiece, ""There Will Be Blood"".
  Of course, this strategy doesn't always serve well. The more the audience regards the dialogue, the more engaging the screenplay has to be. The more engaging the screenplay is, the more compelling the performances have to be.
  Yet ""Phantom Thread"" has all of this. Magnificent lead performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps, a strong and often overlooked supporting performance by Lesley Manville, and a sharp, dense original screenplay written by Paul Thomas Anderson himself. A few sprinkles of comedy are also blended in the script, which is always valuable for a romance. Not to forget the costume design either, which was essential to establish a post-war 1950s London environment. 
  And finally, the score. Arguably the strongest part of the film, the score possesses Paul Thomas Anderson's signature strange aura that is found in several of his other films. It's not a coincidence that one of his most frequent collaborators is Jonny Greenwood, who composed the score for this film, ""There Will Be Blood"", and many others. While most movies nowadays would use music to heighten drama, Paul Thomas Anderson rejects the common norm; valuing music to form an atmosphere. This atmosphere is crucial in almost all of his works, creating an eerie tone for a mystery that drives the story forward.
  A transcendental and sublime work of art so remarkably subtle- delicately transfixing the audience ever so slightly, exploring the convoluted depths of an artist's obsession, and expanding cinema's horizons for miles of wonder- all woven beneath the intertwined threads of the phantom.
  Farewell, Daniel Day-Lewis. We will miss you."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,1/10,Extremely overused idiotic music. Please make it stop.
PHANTOM THREAD,6 January 2020,8/10,"This film is boring in a good way. Reynolds is so fussy that it drives Alma and us crazy, which makes the events that unfold great"
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2021,10/10,"A proper movie. I look for realism in cinema and this movie gave it me. Beautifully crafted and well there's daniel, just the vibe is enough to make it addictive."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 June 2019,8/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson has knocked it out of the park when it comes to this 1950's period romance story starring Daniel Day Lewis as Reynolds Woodcock and Vicky Krieps as Alma Elson.
Reynolds Woodcock is a stubborn man who fashions clothing for the richest and most noble people from around the world, he has a strict system that he follows and hates it when this routine is disturbed.
He is then introduced to Alma Elson, a waitress who seems to enjoy pushing his buttons and crossing every line Reynolds places in front of her. She pushes him to his very limit, forcing them both to understand each other...to fall in love.This film is a masterpiece if there is any word to describe it, from the cinematography to the score by Jonny Greenwood.
Daniel Day Lewis once again truly envelops himself in the character of Woodcock, disguised behind true british stubborness. A man who no one desires to cross.
Vicky Kreips is also excellent as Alma, as we follow her through her trials and tribulations - trying to get Reynolds to notice and pay attention to her is something to behold.I highly reccomend this film to everyone who has the chance to see it, it may seems like any other romance when it first starts but by the end: All will be revealed, and it will blow you away."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 November 2019,9/10,"It could be the best romantic movie I have ever seen. Simply because it shows the real love complex feelings rather than the ordinary romance in other movies. It is a story of a very successful man obsessed about his work, strong from outside to protect him self and feared from getting involved in love so as not to feel weak or vulnerable or even not to have any commitments. The woman's role in his world is just for amusement and to complete the picture that he carefully made for him self. Once he noticed the presence of a beautiful creature ""woman "" though she's not extraordinary beautiful by his measures ,her presence was capturing. Since then she learned how to deal with him , how to adapt to live his life till she became irreplaceable. She even tried to change him , which was the most difficult part, however at the end she did it. Moreover she was able to identify his need for ""the mother "" role in his life and provided him with it, also the need for rest to recover and to be able to create magnificent work. In other words, she gave him every piece of her with great appreciation and support for his work. All that with brilliant acting, cinematography and directing all these elements have made this movie one of my favorites."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 December 2017,10/10,"Daniel Day Lewis adds a new extraordinary character to his gallery of extraordinary characters. All men and each one of them a total original variety of male. From the gay punck rocker of ""My Beautiful Launderette' to Abraham Lincoln in ""Lincoln"" Now Reynolds Woodcock, an artist in the world of fashion a man who lives his work as his only form of expression. The frustration by any form of interruption by anything or anyone out of place guarantees his private isolation and yet he craves the warmth of human intimacy. The complexity of Ryan Woodcock becomes totally accessible in Daniel Day Lewis's eyes, with every move, with every silence. It is a monumental, beautiful creation. His Alma - the Alma that he chooses - is played with Bergmanesque intensity by Vicky Krieps and she's a perfect framer/embracer/provocateur in a remarkable performance. Lesley Manville is chillingly perfect as a sort of Mrs Danvers. A sister/gate keeper with an eye on everything. Was she the one that protected him from his homosexuality or it's just my imagination? I love Phantom Thread. I will see it again soon. P T Anderson gives us another scrumptious gourmet dish. Tank you for that."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 March 2018,1/10,"No story - no interesting plot - just boredom.
What a wast of time."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,8/10,"I've had the unique oportuniy to see this movie before the whole public could do it in the cinema. This movie is going to be, also, an unique movie. The perfect creation of the atmosphere of the fashion world, the amazing performance of the actors, the rhythm of the movie and the soundtrack. But above all, the disturbing story. An story about a luxury dressmaker and the moment he findes his muse. A muse who is going to mess up his meticulous life in a particular way, even we could say in a sickly way.This toxic couple relationship could be used to show how dangerous is a dependence relationship.In this moment, I think the phrase ""Everyone to his own taste"" has no place."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,8/10,"Haunting, Gorgeous, Witty, and Melancholic. All of these describe Paul Thomas Anderson's fantastic new addition to his legendary cinematic resume. I had been anticipating this film for a good year and a half. Paul Thomas Anderson is my second favorite director of all time, and he doesn't disappoint with this film.Phantom Thread delivered on what was expected; fantastic performances, gorgeous cinematography, and a phenomenal score by Jonny Greenwood (his best yet in my opinion). What was unexpected was how funny the film was. I found myself laughing pretty regularly at the things and interactions that occurred on screen. My only qualm with the film is that I wish we could see more scenes of Reynolds and Alma in love and affectionate that way we can see the bond and tenderness that would motivate the characters to want to hold on to the relationship they have even through all the obstacles they face. I feel that it would feel more warranted that these two would allow themselves to keep alive an unhealthy and masochistic relationship if we saw them holding each other and in intimate times more often than we get. I know these scenes exist judging by the clips left in the trailer but not in the film. Still this film was amazing, and I hope it will at the very least win Best Original Score at the Oscars this year."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 September 2021,9/10,In my opinion this is the best anderson movie and also the best daniel day lewis movie!
PHANTOM THREAD,24 December 2020,10/10,"Everything about this film is beautiful. The sets, the costumes, the music... it's all stunning. The cast are fantastic, Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of his life as the mercurial Reynolds Woodcock. The story is complex with different layers and a lot of insinuation rather than explicitness. It had me hooked from start to finish. A masterpiece."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 February 2018,1/10,"Despite being written and directed by the talented Paul Thomas Anderson and starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis, Phantom Thread is 2 hours and 20 minutes of unentertainment. So what's the move about?Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a dressmaker in 1950s London in Paul Thomas Anderson's new film Phantom Thread. Reynolds makes dresses for wealthy people and members of royalty which makes him a highly sought after dressmaker. Like all creative geniuses he's fussy and very set in his routine. Cyril (Lesley Manville) is Reynolds' sister/business partner; she lives with him and runs the day to day business. Alma (Vicky Krieps) is Reynolds' newly acquired girlfriend/muse. Alma doesn't like his fussiness and sets out to disrupt his routine in the most subtle way possible. What I liked about the movie:Phantom Thread is Paul Thomas Anderson's 8th feature length film. PTA has established himself as a talented writer/director and this film is no exception. It's beautifully shot, PTA even did his own cinematography, there's lavish costumes, Daniel Day-Lewis like always does a fine acting job, and most of the writing is good too, my favorite line from the film being ""The tea is going out, but the distraction is staying right here with me"" LOL.So why did I think it was boring?Most of this film is how I imagine what Americans think watching BBC is like, two rich well dressed people having a tea party bickering over how the other is spreading butter on their toast. I left the theater asking myself too many questions. Why was Alma in love with Reynolds? It's never established, is it just because he's rich and famous? Why is Reynolds in love with Alma? Once again never established, is it just because she's pretty? Okay maybe why they are in love isn't the point; the point is about their relationship. Then why is so much of the film devoted to the dressmaking aspect? What was the point of Reynolds' sister Cyril? Was she like a metaphor or something? Her character never does anything other than give stern looks.We've seen this kind of film before, the struggling artist and the women in their lives who suffer. To me the film comes off as less about the nature of relationships and more of an autobiography about the filmmakers own relationship, similar to Darren Aronofsky's film Mother.I really wanted to like this film but after about an hour I found myself bored, then it became a game of how long I could go before looking at my watch. No I would not recommend this film.P.S.I haven't entirely ruled out the possibility that this film is some kind of inside joke between Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis. I imagine they had a great laugh in making this film, but as someone who paid money to watch it, and then isn't let in on the joke, I'm left feeling like a sucker."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson is at the top of his game, versatile and brilliantly capable of adapting himself to any genre or topic he so chooses to. I usually have a hard time with period romances because of the slow pace and the old fashioned social structures they depict, but it's hard not to appreciate the craftsmanship and the emotion that this one distills. In the 1950's London, a talented, stubborn, complicated, almost obsessed with his work, mama's boy middle aged dress designer, who leads a quasi celibate life dedicated to his craft, lives with his strong willed, impassive but caring sister who serves as his business manager, chief of staff and almost emotional bodyguard. On a depressurizing countryside weekend retreat, he charms a young innocent foreign waitress into coming to live and work with him, falling in love at first more with her ideal body measures and delicacy rather than herself. This evolves into an intricate love affair where each part slowly tries to fall into place and find a balance, him reevaluating his life long cold choices of bachelorhood and work obsession and her, this being the 50s, developing a motherlike caring, submissive but ultimately ground standing attitude towards him; all of it temporized by the all seeing, empowering figure of his sister, who pulls back and forth between them and their vices and virtues.I found it to be a movie about emotional adaptation, about never being too late to switch one's position on life made choices and about how strong feelings can push people to dangerous limits in order to find stability within a relationship.The cast is perfectly chosen. Daniel Day Lewis is mesmerizing, elegant and delicate in every gesture, every line delivery, every look, truly a master of his art. He makes you admire him, despise him, feel sorry for him and again love him in a matter of seconds. I sincerely believe he is now able to actually design and sew a full dress. Vicky Krieps is really wonderful and able to transmit contained, almost repressed emotions with such subtlety, something i find remarkably talented; and Leslie Manville exudes respect and strenght with a touch of protectiveness and consideration. Allround great ensemble.It all comes together rather marvelously. I find myself thinking of the word ""versatile"" to describe the movie. Versatile new chapter for PTA in an ongoing superb career, versatile performances, versatile Jonny Greenwood with his soundtrack, versatile costume designing, versatile camera shots, and versatile script with powerful and rich dialogues and a jaw dropping twist at the end that rounds the story and cleverly epitomizes the ""love can kill you"" saying. A piece perhaps for a more mature audience."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 August 2018,8/10,"All performances are good particularly Day 
Lewis but I felt the film to be a little dull in places and not sure where it would go."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 November 2019,10/10,"Is it CGI saturation? The omnipresence of mass-produced superhero nonsense? An almost interminably long absence of originality?For whatever reason, when a film these days is meticulous about nuance, subtlety and carefully crafting characters, people immediately label it ""boring"" and ""slow."" When a story doesn't develop in the same manner as all romance films that precede it, people say ""there is no story."" I say the problem then lies in the viewer, not the artistry. I've seen reviews giving this film a 1 out of 10 -- in what alternate reality is this film below a 6 for ANY reason?Daniel Day Lewis delivers another career-high performance in a career full of them. Reynolds Woodcock is a brilliant but impenetrable dressmaker, driven by routine and idiosyncrasy. He takes an occasional lover from his well-stocked stable of beautiful women who all wish to be draped in his creations, but soon tires of their own idiosyncrasies, only to dispose of them when his equally regimented and calculating sister and confidante Cyril agrees. Once the debutante is dispatched, the House of Woodcock is in order again, and the master may resume his work.Enter Alma (Vicky Krieps), the diametric opposite to Reynolds Woodcock. She is clumsy, unrefined, prone to whimsy over pragmatism. She also unknowingly possesses an elegance and grace that only Reynolds can access and cultivate. In Reynolds, Alma finds an ingenious if not obsessed creator and strong man; in Alma, Reynolds finds a beautiful muse so powerful he sometimes forgets himself. This is what frightens him most about her.But this careful balancing act cannot last forever, as her lack of structure begins to irritate him all over again, thus repeating his cycle. She begins to take advantage of annoying him, as the stress she induces guarantees he pays her more attention. Reynolds, in kind, does not shy from confronting her behavior in increasingly frustrated and vicious retorts. Alma resorts to ever more desperate attempts to maintain his attention, culminating in one of the most twisted and satisfying co-dependencies I've seen as of yet.There is a generous amount of humor as well. The insults so intelligently and politely crafted, yet so cutting of the ego. Cyril, taking Alma's measurements, commends her figure saying ""You have an ideal shape,"" to which Alma says with much surprise, ""Really?"" -- the slightest inkling of a smile forming -- and Cyril coldly replies, ""Yes, he likes a little belly,"" instantly eradicating Alma's joy and replacing it with a frown and confusion. It's so delightfully rude.Or the breakfast-shattering scraping of butter onto toast, which is apparently enough to ruin an entire day for Reynolds.Another interaction involves Alma's choice of preparation for the asparagus: everyone knows Reynolds Woodcock prefers oil and salt, yet Alma has foolishly used butter. During his tirade against her, Reynolds admires his own gallantry for even entertaining such poorly prepared asparagus, informs her he doesn't need her, and when fully convinced she is part of a cabal against him, asks to see her gun. The lengths he will go to humiliate and shame know no bounds. It's actually hilarious.The acting by everyone is top tier. Day Lewis once again completely inhabits his character: the eye movement, the speech pattern, the rigid adherence to protocol. Whether you like or loathe Reynolds Woodcock, you believe him to be real. His sister Cyril (Leslie Manville) is his better, and expertly acted here. She knows everything about her brother and how to gauge his every mood. She even feels some sympathy for the revolving door of lovers, knowing before even he does that he is through with them. And then we have Alma (Vicky Krieps), who gives such a beautifully nuanced and realistic portrayal of Reynolds' own phantom thread; the one only she can find and manipulate. We get many tight face shots of her earnestness and vulnerability, and it's fascinating to watch her eyes narrow as her hurt rejection turns to anger.The direction and cinematography are gorgeous; the rich wood and white tones of the house or the vibrant fabrics of the dresses, the long single shots, the close-ups of scuffed and gruff fingers threading a needle. This goes hand-in-glove with the audio: it is positively blissful, whether it is soft speaking, the faint rustling of fabric, the creaking of wood floors, the crackling of the fire. Then there is a near-constant piano score that creates an atmosphere warmly ensconcing the film, which also vanishes during most dialogue; the opposite of what most movies would do. There is also an occasional ringing tone, like that of a dying ear hair cell, indicating a character about to act outside of themselves.Phantom Thread is so masterfully and delicately crafted in every detail. It reminds of the class and dignity of the golden era of film, of the very best they all have to offer. Those who give the perfunctory ""slow, boring"" assessment will rue the day when style, creativity and grace are completely absent from film. They near are now, and I'm glad Paul Thomas Anderson is keeping them alive... one thread at a time."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 February 2021,3/10,"Daniel-Day Lewis is, without doubt, the best actor of his generation. His movies are almost all excellent simply because of he is in them. This one, however, is not one of them. It, truly, is a real bore. Pure art-house junk. I hope that he doesn't retire on this snoozer."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 March 2018,7/10,"I would say,the feeling was ""suffocating""
If desperation degenerates into slavery or slavery is amplified as love then I would say, this movie has to be understood using one's own whims.
Reynolds as an elegant man which means he's pretentious,can be tolerated and is understandable.
But the type of womanhood that had been attempted to portray,which initially seemed to be dismantling towards that pretentious grace,
later grew counterproductive if not shameful.
The need of a desperate woman,with some of her unbearable and botched up justifications,have been attempted to sell as love.
That's not the portrayal of a self tormenting kind of womanhood or woman in love,that's slavery being liquefied.
The Piano composition could blend with the inner dynamics of the scenes,that's an achievement of course.Otherwise,nothing to remember of this film."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,10/10,This movie is so convincingly beautiful. Honest approach by the director and writer PT Anderson made this easy for me to sit through. Just how he used the incredible talents. Please don't stop acting Daniel Day Lewis.
PHANTOM THREAD,13 March 2018,8/10,"It's kind of creepy but still romantic! Reynolds is a very decent man and this makes the love between him and young lady looks natural and comfortable. I love the scene when first time he drags her into his bedroom and the scene when they kiss on the street. The turning at the end is very clever, fresh, powerful and fit the whole atmosphere very well."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 April 2019,6/10,"Not bad drama movie but there was boring moments, the characters personalities is the most powerful thing in this movie"
PHANTOM THREAD,11 June 2018,9/10,"The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis was fantastic and the girl was also an attraction to watch.It is a pity that Daniel is going to stop acting in the movie career. I could still remember his acting in Lincoln as his first role I had ever watched.Alma, played by Vicky Krieps , was also very good!
There is no doubt that this movie is a beautiful one favored by the Academy. The love between Reynolds Woodcock and Alma was true but actually they were two different kinds of people in their daily life. As an artist, Reynolds could appreciate this young beautiful girl and work with her happily, of which Alma could also enjoy the process. In the daily life, Reynolds might only need a woman to look after him when he was exhausted enough to lie down and not be able to do anything. In order to get the man's love for him, Alma took some special actions, which led Reynolds to the arms and good care of her. This might seem too dramatic but I (not reasonally)felt acceptable during the watching. After all, the beautiful music by Jonny Greenwood was so touching that it could help the audience to get into the story better.
Lesley Manville was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress ,playing the role of Reynolds' old sister .Reynolds always called her something like ""my old so-and-so"",who Was actually quite Cowardly in front of his sister.However ,in my opinion, the Academy owed the young Luxembourgian actress, Vicky Krieps, an Oscar nominate .The girl was truly Somebody in the life and career of Reynolds. She might be Strange but she is Lovely. It would be unthinkable that we didn't see such an actress to play the role in this movie.
What's the best part in this movie? Perhaps it is the scene that Reynolds and Alma went to the wedding of an old female customer, who wore a new dress by Reynolds. Reynolds didn't want to go but he had to go. Terribly, this old woman was drunk and fell asleep in this brilliant work by Reynolds, who might feel insulted. As a return, Reynolds asked Alma to do a very challenging thing upon the old woman. (Watch the movie yourself!)And they were quite happy on their way back.
This movie was a beautiful one with the hard work of all the staff and the director ,and I'm going to give it a 9!"
PHANTOM THREAD,11 January 2019,1/10,"Boring, slow, tedious, pointless, just a total waste of time. Why oh why did such a fine actor choose this as his swan song?"
PHANTOM THREAD,21 April 2020,5/10,Very long. Didn't sympathize with the characters because they were not humanized. Alma behaves as a petulant child and Reynolds is supposed to have met his match with her as he is also childish and fussy. The plot is silly and ridiculous and the dresses are nice. I gave it 5 stars because it was cunning enough to keep giving me hope that it would be good eventually. So I stuck with it.
PHANTOM THREAD,9 March 2021,7/10,"This is an love story with two very different living habits for two old people. Let two people who have lived most of their lives in their own way adapt to the environment, life and habits of their lovers. And as impulsively as a young man, it is possible to talk about the outcome of an ignorant and irresponsible relationship.
Seriously, Reynolds, who has the ultimate pursuit of life style, falls in love with Alma, a restaurant waiter who knows nothing about the upper class. Unnecessarily attentive audiences discover that those who have seen it know how disdainful Reynolds is to Alma's feelings on the surface, and he is extremely cold in life. Looking at us as bystanders, Reynolds doesn't care about Alma's feelings at all. Even in Reynolds's mind, his female partner Cyril is more important than Alma. Alma is just a ""lover"" with her? ""Model""? This is what Reynolds presented to the audience. However, in contrast, we can see that Alma's understanding of love is manifested. If you love someone, you must take good care of him. Accompanying is her original intention. The film shows that Alma wants to serve Reynolds with tea, take care of him, or create time for the two, but Reynolds stops her actions again and again, and even expresses her incomprehension of her behavior and does not understand why she wants to say it. With so much, readers can already conclude that Reynolds is a scumbag, who has failed Alma's intentions for him. Is this really true? Did Alma do nothing wrong?
There must be a reason for the incident, let us return to the two suffocating poisonous scenes. Maybe the reason she was poisoned was that she thought Renoir didn't love her anymore. She wanted to let Reynolds know that she was the only one who could accompany him when he was weak. She believed that this would make Reynolds love again. Get on her. So is it her fault for poisoning? Was it caused by her ignorance? A momentary impulse made an uneducated restaurant waiter poison her lover. There is no shortage of things that can grind the film to portray Alma as an ignorant and rude middle-aged village woman. If she is a person who has gone to college or graduated from postgraduate, and she does this, I will definitely say that it is her fault, but she does not possess these. Reynolds did show that he needed Alma's company when he was ill, and this did achieve Alma's goal. At this moment, Reynolds only belonged to her. The sick and the innocent, give her an explanation. The meticulous care of the illness also dazzled Reynolds's mind. Those things that were out of place in life, those things he didn't adapt to Alma, seemed to disappear overnight. So much so that they got married ""recklessly"".
However, we can imagine the life after marriage. When we were so unbearable in the past, we couldn't merge with each other anywhere, and history would reappear after marriage. The final result must be a second ""impulse."" Reynolds's indifference and contempt for her, in her heart ""she"" is just Reynolds' everything, a selfless companion, and this companion does not ask for anything in return, but only wants Ray to fall in love with her again, nothing else, Reynolds Perhaps what I did was the ""ignorance"" mentioned above. The poisoning this time is not like ignorance, it is more like a perverted revenge, so ""myself"" can't fit in in life, and can't integrate into it anywhere, so don't make promises to each other as soon as possible.
If you really want to analyze who is right and who is wrong in their love, I believe that they don't understand it. As a bystander, I don't make much evaluation. When conflicts arise, people always think that they have paid the most in love. It's always right, I just objectively analyzed the cause of the rift between the two of them, nothing more."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 May 2018,1/10,Should be marketed as a cure for insomnia.I truly believe the combination of DDL and PTA convinces most reviewers that this movie couldn't possibly be this boring. Sadly - I'm afraid it was.
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,8/10,"As a fan of PTA, i was excited to see this movie. Upon seeing this movie i was satisfied. But i do feel like there was a lot of aspects that could have been improved. The main problem is runtime. I will agree that this film drags on a bit. There's a lot of scenes that don't serve too much of a purpose and just make the film longer. Now i'm not opposed to slow films, but i am opposed to purposeless scenes. That's really the only problem i have with the film, i know it's a pretty minor thing but it greatly effects the pacing of the film and makes it feel dull. That's why i'm giving it 8/10"
PHANTOM THREAD,18 May 2019,4/10,"The thing is there are flashes of brilliance speckled throughout and some of the dialogue is superb. But overall it's sooo boring.
Leslie Manville is outstanding"
PHANTOM THREAD,18 March 2018,8/10,See this movie if you like DD Lewis otherwise don't see it. It is a small isolated story of breaking someone of their ways. I love Daniel Day and therefore this film entertained me cause he always does because of his unbelievable talent. Totally can understand that this movie is not for everyone and the ending isn't going to tie everything up for you nor will it really answer anything for you. I've always loved one-on-one dialogue in movies and this movie was a great listen in that regard.
PHANTOM THREAD,11 November 2019,1/10,"He is old, persnickety and waves scissors in the air, but has a full head of hair. Meets plain Jane at seaside and decides he is love with her. Marries her and turns her into elegant muse (actually she was Hollywood plain Jane, so easy to make her elegant) then falls out of love with her.She realizes he doesn't love her anymore and in bid to save marriage lovingly picks mushrooms for his omelette. He eats them to humor her as he waves scissors and nearly dies!!! They were poisoned!!She takes care of him and brings him back from the doors of death as he looks at pic of his mum or maybe its a vision/ whatever. They are in love again, but because he is persnickety, he starts to fall out of love with her again...La! the ups and downs of marriage...She feeds him mushrooms again, La! they are in love again, they are happy, some voice-over twaddle from plain Jane, I mean elegant Jane about how their love goes from strength to strength. In this case from omelette to omelette. Last images are happy couple walking in the park with ominous looking pram......
But we never get to see the baby, because it is Rosemary's baby and pram!!Possibly the silliest move I have seen in decades. The ending left me totally nonplussed for at least five minutes, but after that I couldn't stop laughing.
Maybe I should give my BF poisoned mushrooms, so he proposes and gives me a big fat diamond ring. I leave this movie with a plan!"
PHANTOM THREAD,26 February 2018,1/10,"Ever notice how Danny either plays a fop(Age of Innocence,Jack and Rose) or a maniac(Gangs,There will be blood)? Can you imagine that if he really had acting skills he could do a different genre? How about the Music man or the screen version of Saved by the Bell( principal Richard Belding).Nope..he can't..has no range.
 During the showing of this flick I keep fantasizing how Trump could be tortured by being forced to sit through this and Fences. No please..even that is too inhumane!"
PHANTOM THREAD,28 March 2018,10/10,"Being a Radiohead fan had nothing to do with my immediately loving the score. I didnt know he wrote it 
until after, but I wouldnt expect any less from Johnny Greenwood. Daniel Day Lewis, captivating as always. I immediately liked Vicky Krieps, who along with a perfect Leslie Manville gave performances worthy of Daniel Day Lewis.I would love to see another film utilizing the same recipe."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 March 2018,1/10,"Arrogant designer to the aristocracy speaks in hushed tones and impossibly naive young girl ""falls in love"" with him for no apparently good reason.I've never been a big fan of Daniel Day-Lewis and in fact find most of his movies dreadful, but I try. . . I try. In my opinion though, this just adds to the pantheon of dreadful work he has turned in over the years. I don't understand how or why people think he is as great as they claim.Every year in awards season there is at least one, and usually more, film that some critics somewhere rave about and unknowing sheep get on the bandwagon and inflate their own egos by pretending to be intelligent movie watchers and continue the raving to the point where the film is grossly overrated. This is yet another example of that.If you want to go to sleep, just take an Ambien!"
PHANTOM THREAD,23 January 2020,2/10,First time a Daniel Day Lewis movie has let me down. Was he just reading his lines from the Dress material or his constant Drawing Pad? He even managed to look bored when supposed to be falling in love.
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,2/10,"I had a small disagreement with the person who invited me to see Phantom Thread. What's your game, I asked charmingly. ""Boredom, bad 90's art-house and actors and a director trying to channel an hallucinating David Lynch I smiled. ""No they're not."" ""Well, yes they are."" ""No,"" she replied with spirited bellicosity and a balletic non sequitur, ""the only thing they are channeling is exquisite cinema, wonderful performance art and an incredible Oscar worthy film"" 
I realised I was staring over the precipice of one of those conversations that the potential to escalate into three managers, a cook with a cleaver, phone calls to the Guinness Book of Records and a sleepless night where you pace the room saying ""what you don't understand is...."" to the wall. So I nodded my head and stepped back from the brink. Anyway the movie was nonsensical and boring as a 5 year old's Christmas pantomime - whoever's in them or directs, dead or alive - invariably are."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,10/10,"Most viewers will find this film incredibly boring and pointless, since the majority of humans are so traumatized, their true feelings have been drummed out of them by traumatized parents, teachers, bosses, love ones and society in general. This means most humans are not ""beings"" anymore, but ""human doings"", you know...... Slaves.
This film, in reality, can not be reviewed, it must be felt with a reflecting heart. Only then you will see the mess the characters are in and in reality what most of us are in. 
It's a meditation on codependency and how love can be mutated into any meaning you wish. MAGNIFICENT FILM MAKING."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 February 2018,8/10,"Just as dramatic as many Anderson's movies, but in a more subtle way, without any spectacular action, as british as the mood was supposed to be.
This movie has some real beauty you must be blind not to see but it takes its time and it's surely not as easily entertaining as most Oscar nominees but we're not talking about a Marvel movie, this is pretty refined.
Actors, costumes, photography (even in cloudy England! Where most fail) and direction are perfect. Just perfect.
The plot almost surely isn't and I have some doubts. Thought it was mostly me but many agree, there's something just not as perfect as any other aspect of the movie.
But I'm going back to acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a monster, as usual and he feels in his perfect habitat. He's not just carrying the movie, the movie is not just a stage for him, he is granted the possibility to do his best in a (bad pun alert) taylor-made role. He just fits perfectly. I was expecting this, that's what I found, so I could just ignore my doubts about the plot (not some secondary aspect actually...)."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 December 2019,1/10,I just saw the movie today and I was impressed of the scenography but NO! At the end I just waisted my time. I don't recommend this movie.
PHANTOM THREAD,1 January 2021,9/10,"From the scene where the pair storms the room of the lady, who's paying for their saloon, just to undress her and take the dress she disrespected away, it was obvious that the characters were very excentrically and illogically absorbed within each other. This is a film portraying an unhealthily codependent relationship and many people somehow didn't seem to get that. Completely deserved the Oscar, wouldn't be surprising if it got one for the score, directing or best performance for Daniel-Day Lewis."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 February 2021,8/10,"This movie is just a joy to watch! It toys with the highs and lows of a relationship that I feel anyone can relate to. I laughed on occasion and was devastated at other times. I went through all the feelings in this! And at the end of the day, this is what I look for in a movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 January 2018,9/10,"This film takes such a fresh (and at times disturbing) approach to love that it might repel some viewers. Yet, for those who possess and open mind to witness the unconventional transformation of the two protagonists Woodcock (Day Lewis) and Alma (Vicky Krieps) luscious surprises await, not the least of which are the gestures of appreciation and jealousy they wreak on each other. The structure of the story brings to light all the internal conflicts within ourselves, the seemingly conflicting feelings and urges of loving someone, growing increasingly jealous of them, and needing the other to love and appreciate us all collide in sequences of unexpected-- but perfectly executed-- scenes of mutual quips turned insults, leading up to understanding and acceptance of these very contradicting qualities. Less abstraction would reveal key details of the plot, but all I'll say is that this emotional pendulum between the two protagonists is wonderful to watch and supplies much fodder for future (self) analysis.The performances are fantastic, across the board. Aside for the two leads who nail each gesture, eye shift, and facial expression of their characters, Lesley Manville (who plays Cyril, Mr. Woodcock's sister) is particularly fantastic. I really hope she makes the Oscar lineup this year. She's simply marvelous.Go watch this movie, with an open mind, and prepare yourself for some beautifully shot and compellingly written surprises."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 April 2018,2/10,Thanks to the writer who mentioned that the Director is the son of Cleveland's favorite horror movie host from the 60's I may now proceed to try to watch the rest of this Artist 's tripe with the appropriate mirth. Thisexplains everything
PHANTOM THREAD,12 August 2018,7/10,I really like the actress Vicky Krieps where did they find her? Her face was sometimes pretty and sometimes evil. I did not understand the ending did he know he had been poisoned ? An unusual role for Day Lewis but as always he was very good. There Will be Blood was a very good film and his character in that film was faultless. I am glad I saw it.
PHANTOM THREAD,26 July 2019,1/10,"I have a new rule of thumb for time wasting movies. If I can't get absorbed into the film in the first 30 minutes, I read the reviews, and even the synopsis, and see if it's worthy of my time to watch the rest. Thank god I came on here to read the reviews. Seems like a pretentious artsy wank fest with a pointless plot and insipid characters. Thanks for saving my time, IMDB!"
PHANTOM THREAD,21 April 2020,6/10,"Visually beautiful. Fascinating cinematography. The cars, the clothes, and the quaint 50's English countryside.
But ....
Hard to put my finger on it. Relationship between Woodcock, his dead Mother, his sister, Alma constantly threatens to shatter, as all of his previous liaisons had done, but in this one with the coy, plain waitress results in a final balancing out of neurotic needs in a dysfunctional, quasi sado-maso, yet happy ending for all involved.
Reminded my a bit of the Addams family.
Does this film represent anything resembling our lived realities?
Yes, perhaps, but not to this order of magnitude, and certainly not to this level of ultimate equanimous, mutually salutary acceptance. Perhaps this is what art is expected to do. It was so unsettling, in a way, got under my skin that perhaps a 7 would have been a fairer rating. In any case, I recommend seeing the film"
PHANTOM THREAD,30 September 2018,5/10,I have seen most all Daniel Day Lewis's movies to date. He actually is a fine actor in all of his movies. This one looks like he is acting maybe its the loss of energy that the movie is absent of. Its about everything and nothing at all at the same time. The characters are as forgettable as the dialogue. The music is even distracting at times as well as the pace. I just couldn't find anything that would ever make me view it again. I watch good movies several times to make sure I can harvest everything being said in manner movement optics and what I might have done different. This movie is pretty much a waste of good talent money and time.
PHANTOM THREAD,23 January 2020,9/10,It had one of best music scores. I think screenplay was amazing. Editing was top notch. Camera was rolled at all beautiful angles. Story was engrossing. Acting was captivating. Direction was enthralling. Tone was just and apt. Hardly a movie rates high on all so many levels. This individual and technical superiority of all departments was blended into somewhat messy but mostly scintillating piece of cinema. With minor faults here and there but overall a joyous expierience of almost perfect cinema.
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,1/10,"Don't give in to the hype this movie is garbage, way to long half of the movie is shots of them eating in different locations.... and some old lady is in every scene"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 December 2017,10/10,"Can you give a film two 10s? If so, it's this one."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,10/10,"What a delicious, perfect film. I'm devastated that this is Daniel Day-Lewis' last film, but what a finish this was! If you have never experienced seriously unwell, dysfunctional characters in your own life, it may not be a relatable film for you, though a viewing is worthwhile for the costume design alone. Superb acting and the female lead steals the show. What a delightfully f-ed up story."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,7/10,"Once again, Daniel Day Lewis as ""Reynolds"" captivates his character to a new level yet the movie itself is a little slow and doesn't hook the audience as much as it could. I would say Paul Thomas Anderson deserves the Oscar for directing but this script was a touch weak."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2020,10/10,"This is one of those movies plenty of people are going to have a hard time with. In many instances through no fault of their own. It's about a man who is obsessive and delusional and a woman who loves him and can see past his nonsense to something worth loving. Her solution to his inflexibility is effectively to give him magic or if you like poisonous mushrooms. This changes him considerably but then his old habits reform and he grasps back onto the structure of himself he once knew. She then does it again but this time he is able to see the prison he is in, the construct of himself and this is the awakening. He becomes a human being, there is now something more to him than just the routines he established that made him so successful at making dresses. An awareness of what he is constituted of.We are all flawed and there is no avoiding that. We can though at least become aware of what we are and in that awareness we can take action to mitigate our routines of self reflection.Effectively this movie is about the benefits of a strong psychedelic experience and it was quite the most majestic way of expressing this I've ever seen. Extremely clever and very well made. I absolutely loved this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 May 2021,8/10,"Phantom Thread, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film entry is a slow moving yet meticulously crafted character study that is hard to take your eyes off. Daniel Day Lewis is predictably excellent in this film, effortlessly transforming into the arrogant, overbearing, and stubborn artist of his craft that draws the respect of his peers via an amalgamation of unmatched talent and unwavering meticulousness. He's inexplicably drawn to a young woman he meets at a diner (Vicky Krieps) who is equally infatuated with his expertise and craft. His fascination with her is initially posited as an ""ideal"" model for his dresses but is clearly established as much more as the film carries on.The relationship between our main two protagonists is confusing and oozing with tension but we don't clearly understand why for quite some time. Day-Lewis is frustratingly particular in a way that frustrates both the main love interest as well as the audience. We observe so much annoying conflict throughout the film to the point where you are almost begging our female lead to leave and move on with her life, but just before it becomes unbearable things take an interesting turn.Vicky Krieps eventually starts doing some messed up shtuff that is so baffling at first you don't know what to make of it, but Day-Lewis's reaction tells you everything you know in such an elegant way. Themes of unhealthy obsession, unexpected bliss, and existential dread are all put on display in such a jarring way it locks you in to the screen. Of course PTA and crew put on a technical display that is top-notch as usual and captures the tone and themes of the film so perfectly.One of PTA's best films in years and a strong recommend from me. Check it out brothers!"
PHANTOM THREAD,9 March 2018,9/10,"What a lovely surprise! Yes, for me was a surprise because some months ago I said that maybe I wasn't seing this movie due to dresses theme. Fortunately I've changed my mind because of the last awards events and in the last few days I was looking foward to see it after all.
Beautiful, and at some point kind of scary, movie with good sound, great cinematography, amazing acting and the message within the film is something else. Far more than a simple love story: the first forgets how to look to the second and the only way to fix it is facing a precarious situation, the second has to provoke something proving its love even if its putting everything at stake. We can't hate them at any moment because we know that they love each other.
I always like the silent pauses when are the eyes that says everything and at the same time dialogs are really good.
Costume Design Oscar Winner its well deserved.""The tea is going out. The interruption is staying right here with me."""
PHANTOM THREAD,6 March 2018,8/10,"Romantic movies, as a genre, is fairly predictable in the aspects of love it portrays. Phantom Thread breaks those molds, and ventures into a world rarely explored in the movies, or literature. It's thrilling, humorous, romantic, scary and depressing all at the same time, and yet it feels real and rooted in a deep seated sense of neediness love infuses in everyone. Performances, across the board, is absolutely top notch. Daniel Day Lewis disappears into the character (as he so often does) of master dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock, down to the fine mannerisms (watch how he holds the pins, or the way he touches a fabric) to the physicality of the character, and is absolutely riveting to watch. I can't think of any actor who can make an act as simple as eating an omelette a very visceral and thrilling experience, and if this indeed is his swan song, then he made sure every note is worth it. Vicky Criceps is equally impressive - and that is as high a praise as it comes - as his muse Alma, and so is Lesley Manville as his sister Cyril. It is one of those movies that would stay with you, long after you have left the theater."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 March 2018,2/10,The posters shouted 'breathtaking' the 'phantom' in the title suggested something intriguing and mysterious. Daniel Day Lewis' presence suggested some memorable acting. It was nothing but an absolute bore.
PHANTOM THREAD,9 May 2018,3/10,"I don't write reviews that often but this was just a big disappointment. The acting, costumes, decor and cinematography were all very well done but to me there just wasn't an interesting story to tell. Just felt like watching a borderline crazy dude who makes dresses go about in life in the 50's. Expected more out of this and felt like it wasted my time."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 July 2018,3/10,"Sorry Daniel, but this was dull,dull, dull. Possibly best bit was Daniel ordering his breakfast wondering where he was going to put it all - apart from that I fell asleep at the lacklustre story."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 July 2020,9/10,"If you are a fan of CGI and all-together super heroes movies stay away from this one.
It's like a piece of classic music that most of people would refuse looking for a 3 minute pop song.
I don't know where to start but i can honestly say that if you would like to enjoy some great acting, directing, cinematography and music being mixed elegantly into a so nice classic type movie, so go for it and be sure you will get a great deal of real cinematic art.
But if you are looking for a fast paced action empty movie that gives you nothing but some explosions scenes and some adrenalin rush so go look for that somewhere else.
This is a movie for people who really appreciate the value of good pieces of classic cinematic art, not for fast-food-movies fans with all respect to their taste of course.
And am not having this opinion upon the academy nominations because sometimes i wouldn't even like some movies with many oscar wins, but this on really desreved those nominations and sure it deserved more than one win."
PHANTOM THREAD,27 July 2019,9/10,"Only someone who has lived with a narcissist could understand the allure behind this drama. I could relate too well to Alma and her predecessors about living with a man who needs absolutely no interaction, no drama in his life. He wants what he wants and steps over others to get what he wants with no regard to the feelings of others in his life. I hated that this man procreated in the end, because I know how the children of such beings suffer from neglect and emotional abandonment."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 February 2018,9/10,"This is a seriously good movie. It does not follow the conventions. The main character is a couturier, but we see more of the workshop than we do of frocks and balls.
The acting is extraordinary. I found I completely believed in the characters, and wanted to understand what they were thinking. The cinematography and music are wonderful. For example, we see the seamstresses coming to work in the morning. What was it like to work in a London fashion house? Were they well paid? Was it cold? How did one couple - Reynolds and Cyril - manage to build the business?
There is no big plot development. But we see how Reynolds, Cyril and Alma adapt to living and working together."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 December 2018,4/10,"Sure it was pretty, I liked it it at first but way too long and way too boring. Big pass. So happy I watched it at home for free."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 April 2018,1/10,"Sorry, this film left me frustrated and angry. Other than enjoying the costumes and dressmaking, I was completely bored. DDL's character was a jackass, and his girlfriend/muse/wife was a sociopath. The ending was ridiculous. Really sorry I wasted 130 minutes on this."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 December 2017,7/10,"Christmas Eve, a sad evening, holding the overpriced ticket, waiting for the premier, singly and solo-ly.This isn't (ain't no man) There will be Blood (not butt), first of all, it's a women movie, not for men. Not talk about ideal, only some small home-y family cookie. And where is the ambitious PTA? And I don't think No Country for Old Men could be on par with There will be Blood, at all.
I'm gonna go to sleep (sleep all these off, 2017 is such a bad-movie year)."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 June 2018,1/10,"Congratulations to Phantom Thread for being the first movie that I have awarded a 1 to! I always try to be fair to every movie I watch including the obviously bad ones, however to do this I normally watch the movie in its entirety. With Phantom Thread I could not do this. I first tried to watch with the family and was given a please change the movie after only 10 minutes. I then thought I would give it a go on my own as I would probably be able to get into the movie if i was left alone to get a feel for the characters. Unfortunately, I was not able to relate to any of the characters in the slightest and as the movie wore on, i increasingly found my mind wandering to other things until I eventually paused it after 80 minutes to ""go do something less boring instead"", like painting the wall then spending the next 2 hours watching it dry! I just could not bring myself to go back and finish it. Not that the movie was in the obviously bad category, it was just that the story line (or lack of storyline) was going nowhere fast and I was just so bored during the 80 minutes I watched, I figured that I could live with myself for not going back to the final 50 minutes rather than add to the 80 minutes of my life I would never be able to get back!DDL tried his very best to inject some life into his mundane character but the rest of the utterly boring and irritating characters just helped to make him just as irritating as the rest. I do not know how this movie is rated so high, it seems like the arty farty movies we are being inundated with lately are the ""in thing"" and the sheeple just think that it is a good movie because that is what the media and the ""Academy award nominations"" tell us to believe! Not for me I'm afraid and the fact that I just could not bring myself to finish the movie leaves me with no other option than to score a 1. Do yourself a favour and use the 2 hours that you save by missing this movie to find some real entertainment and not be fooled by the in-crowd"
PHANTOM THREAD,5 January 2021,3/10,"I thought I'd enjoy this. I settled down one evening and started to watch. By the end I thought it tedious; it really dragged.
I did watch it until the bitter end but wished I hadn't bothered. The two main characters are deeply unpleasant. By the end I just wanted it to."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 October 2018,9/10,"In a generation of predictable plots hits and immediate gratification, this film is a slow churning process that isn't for the novice viewer. It harks back to the Hitchcock era at its prime. Like any well wrought script (a rarity these days) this one takes you to the end, and it takes a keen eye and patient mind to truly appreciate it. The acting is eloquent, and Jonny Greenwood's score fits like a glove. While the union of Reynolds and Alma is predictable, nearly everything that follows isn't - moving toward a deeply psychological twist for the viewer that's as refreshing as ever."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,8/10,"Phantom Thread is a complex tale of a meticulous tailor/designer that lives a life of routine as if it were clockwork. One day at a regular diner he befriends the seemingly mundane waitress Alma and is fascinated by her handwriting and detail to attention. He soon realizes after measuring her that her physique is one he has been looking for a long time and it is here his fascination of her creature grows. She soon accompanies him everywhere and the chemistry between the two gets stronger day by day, not without its tension of course. The pairing resembles chalk and cheese, however the saying that opposites attract holds firm in this scenario. Reynolds (tailor/designer) who seems incapable to feel and show love distresses Alma who has fallen head over heels for him. Reynolds is of the view that marriage would make him full of deceit yet still this does not deter Alma's affection. Eventually after some doing by deceitful means Reynolds accepts Alma's affection, leading to the marriage between the two. His world has quickly turned upside-down thereafter, affecting his work, his routine and his life as he knew it. Oddly enough he hates and loves the change at the same time. Love is strange and cruel but it is lovely. Love is poison but at the same time the cure.Cinematography : 10

PHANTOM THREAD,20 April 2018,3/10,"This movie is a classic display of the problems with fallen human nature. We need new natures, to have our human natures ""changed"" by supernatural power that is beyond ourselves, that is why Jesus came to help us, make a way of escape from all the evil, and to die for our sins: ""What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel..."" (James 4:1-2)"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 September 2020,9/10,"Phantom Thread is far more than its chic and lavish stylings from director Paul Thomas Anderson but rather a deep introspective on the toxicity that love breeds within any and all relationships. The film in essence follows renowned dressmaker Reynold Woodcock who crosses paths with Alma a young woman who soon becomes entangled with his career as she becomes both his muse and lover. Within the first half of the film the two enjoy each other's company as well as Alma becoming further involved in the tailoring businesses of Reynold Woodcock however the film progresses into its second half with much more melancholic themes where the the relationship is no longer tender but brutish and hostile we see these two foster a disdain for one another with Reynold Woodcock driving himself deeper into his own work in solidarity where in contrast Alma seeks to constantly be in his company.
Intercut within the film is Alma giving her views and perspective on Reynold often times mentioning his infantile and spoiled behavior towards others when all is not preordained to his liking. She states it's only when he's emotionally or physically vulnerable that he becomes, ""tender and open to others."" This notion influences Alma's actions to poison and render Reynold ill in secrecy which in turn enables him to be in that state of openness that Alma gravitates to. We see their relationship flourish once again as Reynold is nourished inches away from death back to health by Alma. Once more that same cycle continues with a brief phase of endearment to each other than falling back into a growing disdain. The film concludes with Reynold and Alma at odds with each other once again and Alma preparing to poison Reynold and push him back into that state of vulnerability, however Reynold acknowledges that Alma plans on taking these drastic actions that he willingly indulges in the poison to preserve their love.
The interpretation that I have of Phantom Thread is that the story at hand is a constant pursuit of a toxic relationship. This film is the epitome of a constant hankering for something unsustainable. Our two protagonists constantly stuck in a cycle of love and hate only salvageable by harm. The beautiful yet somber score and intimate framing of our characters all tie this film wonderfully in all aspects with little to no complaints."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2018,5/10,"I am THE demo for this movie: Boogie Nights, The Master, Unbearable Lightness, Age of Innocence, There Will Be Blood....love them all and can re-watch endlessly. Waited patiently for this one to go wide so I could see it, used up all my football- widow chits to get my husband to go. It was well-acted, of course, and lovely to look at. For about 1/2 of the movie, I was mildly underwhelmed but still enjoying the journey. Then the mushrooms. OK, so that was odd. Kinda re-engaged with the plot for a bit after DDL recovered. But then that ending. That kiss in the bathroom. The small crowd in my theater exclaiming, ""ewwww,"" simultaneously. At the end, most of us were either laughing or saying ""WTF just happened?"" PTA, what happened to you? Inherent Vice, now this? Please go watch The Master, or There Will be Blood (invite DDL) and get your groove back. You are better than this."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 February 2019,7/10,"The actual movie was good but the ending i hated....wtf your ok with your lady making u poisonous omelets to spice up your love life?

I hope dumb men learn from this to beware of devil woman"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 January 2021,5/10,"A rather ambitious film, this story attempts to apologize for a man's ambition who's committed to his craft at the cost of his humanity, sanity and the people around him. That it takes a woman such as Alma to feed and nourish his soul both literally and figuratively for him to remain functional, sane and human. In Spanish, the name Alma translates to ""soul"" as in one's soul or my soul such as ""la alma de uno"" or ""mi alma"". Most commonly derived from the Latin word almus which has various meanings such as nourishing, kind, or fostering, often seen in phrases like alma mater which translates to ""nourishing mother."" As a feminist, I believe it's a message that's been perpetuated repeatedly by patriarchal society knowing full well that a man who would reciprocate the same attention, care, and affection for a strong woman would not be as highly praised. A more realistic take of this story would be Emma Thompson's magnificent screenplay for Effie Gray (2014) starring Dakota Fanning. This film fully discloses the irreversible damage and destruction an ambitious man leaves on a woman. Therefore, I give this film a 5 star rating for it's unrealistic premise, anti-feminist attitude and tone deafness towards women."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2021,3/10,"I keep coming back to PTA's films, hoping beyond hope that I get something that remotely resembles the work he did back as young director in his 20s. Hard Eight (Sydney), Boogie Nights (thought it was basically a rip off of Scorsese's Raging Bull and Goodfellas), Magnolia (his Altman ripoff errr uhhh ""homage"") and Punch Drunk Love all had energy and life. Then came 2007 and There Will Be Blood, and all of the Oscar nominations I'm sure he's always craved. This really turned PTA into a dull, lifeless, meandering filmmaker who basically is chasing Oscars and not making good films. This film was no different. Just totally dry, insufferable, and pointless. I don't care how good DDL is, his performance alone can't bring this dreary mess to life. Hopefully, one of these days, PTA can stop telling stories nobody cares about and stop Oscar chasing. 3 stars solely for DDL."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 April 2021,9/10,This film took me to whole another world . Such a comfort film💙💙💙
PHANTOM THREAD,15 March 2021,1/10,Last 10 minutes ruined everything. Characters in this movie make no sense.
PHANTOM THREAD,19 January 2018,2/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis must have thought to himself, ""Why not go out in a blazing streak of fatuous pomposity?!?"" If only the endless, repetitive scenes of characters walking up and down the fancy-dancy staircase had been mercifully edited out, then it might have been closer to 90 minutes of my life I can't get back."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 November 2018,7/10,"Top performance when it comes to acting and directing and cinematography but there has to be a story and there was no story , very sad this movie has to be Day Lewis final film , what an end to such an epic career."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 April 2018,9/10,"This is by far the most close that someone has ever bring a mix of character from Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. That's pretty much what this movie show me. 
Love it !!"
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,2/10,"""Phantom Thread"" is an Oscar-nominated stinker. Some of the scenery is beautiful, the costumes are extravagant and the bizarre, meticulous process of 1950's era dress-making for the social elite is a mild curiosity but the story is threadbare and the actors may as well have been cardboard cut-outs for all the prolonged shots of them staring wordlessly at each other. Even when speaking, they didn't have all that much to say. In the end, it's not enough for characters to be eccentric. They have to be interesting eccentrics.Spoiler Alert: There are one or two points at which the viewer might suspect that something interesting is about to happen. It doesn't."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 October 2018,,"I have no idea why this film was made or for what purpose, except as an ego manifestation of the director/writer. The cinematography is excellent, but not exceptional; the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is, as to be expected, excellent (his portrayal of Reynolds Woodcock is so good,it makes me want to slap him up side the head!), but other than that, Phantom Thread has no common thread. Reynolds Woodcock is an obnoxious, arrogant, self-absorbed, controlling man-child who is incapable of deeper personal relationships. His sister and co-owner of the atelier is a stone-cold business woman. There is nothing to like about these people, nothing to engage the viewer and elicit even the slightest modicum of sympathy. And there is no depth whatsoever--the film just moves from one vignette to the next, shallow and unengaging. As for the ""phantom thread""--there's nothing to it! So Reynolds Woodcock sews little messages into the hems of his creations. So what!?! They'll never be seen again, never be understood--so what's the point? There is none! The ""phantom threads"" have nothing to do with anything. As for the dialogue--much of it is done in whispers which are unintelligible. Except for giving Daniel Day-Lewis another opportunity to display his remarkable talent, the film is an entire waste of time."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 June 2018,8/10,"PTA's films if nothing else are at least one's that gives one unforgettable characters wrapped in an experience. this latest creation of his i'm happy to say is nothing less than that, as well as a beautiful farewell to arguably the best actor of the last couple decades, daniel day-lewis. a beautiful shot, glacially paced, phenomally acted, and just all out wonderfully weaved together gem.i am a bit let down that i couldn't just now relate that's it's a 5 star film at this point. But hey, that's what rewatches are for.farewell, mr. lewis. you are, and will always be remembered as one of the top bests."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 March 2018,3/10,"I can't stand the way the characters are. It's the kind of movie where you are waiting for something to happen.........and in the end, you understand that nothing is going to happen. This is the story of a horrible couple. That's it. 
It's supposed to be a romantic movie, but there is no romance and certainly no love in this story."
PHANTOM THREAD,24 February 2018,9/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread"" casts a remarkable spell; it wraps around you, like a delicately scented cashmere shawl woven from music and color and astonishing faces.He may have outdone himself with his latest. 
The attention to detail, the use of certain colors, the lush and vibrant photography of the dresses Reynolds makes and the clothes he wears - they're honestly breathtaking.A fitting exit for one of the greatest screen actors in history.If this is indeed the end for Day Lewis, it is a fitting final bow. It's a treat to watch him drink your milkshake one last time. writing is perfect. cinematography, direction everythins is top notch. i think you all should give it a try it's not of everyone's taste but still it's a classic drama. The new age just wants superpowers avengers panther bla bla. This is nothing like that. Pure classical drama this is. A masterpiece."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 November 2017,10/10,"We had all been waiting for it. For Paul Thomas Anderson to bring out another amazing movie, one as good as There Will be Blood and here it is.The acting 10/10 Direction 9.8/10 cinematography 9.5/10Overall I am extremely pleased and won't give any of the plot away. Please just go and enjoy this movie when it officially comes out.Thankyou Paul Thomas Anderson and thankyou Daniel Day Lewis, what a way to end a career!"
PHANTOM THREAD,27 December 2020,10/10,Daniel Day Lewis plays a fashion designer whose clientel are the rich and royalty. He is capricious and everything seems to bother him. You can never please him and he complains ad nauseum. He falls in love with a waitress in a diner while on a road trip. They hook up and she becomes one of his models. I won't tell you anymore because I don't want to be a spoiler. The acting is superb by the entire cast. Phantom Thread reminds me of Downton Abbey with a sinister twist. I really enjoyed this film.
PHANTOM THREAD,31 March 2020,10/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson has proven, one again, that he is the best movie director of his generation. In this film he reaches Kubrick's level, no doubt.
And Daniel Day Lewis is the best actor of his time.
This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece, it is intimate and delicate as much as it is powerful.
In 30 years time we will still remember it as one of the best of the 21st century."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 January 2018,10/10,"Phantom Thread was a great movie. I highly recommend it to film lovers like me. The cinematography is incredible and Daniel Day Lewis is like always an excellent actor. This was the first Paul Thomas Anderson movie(I know I'm sorry), and he is already one of my new favorite filmmakers. It's a great movie though, but not for those who get bored easily. It's pretty slow. I liked it and I can't wait to see how many Oscars it swipes away."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 February 2020,1/10,"The overuse of adjectives like, expression, illumination, comfortable silences, Kubrick, observation, study....I could go on. Utter poppycock. If you have trouble sleeping, chuck this yawn on. Arrrrghhh!!!"
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,1/10,"Caught this last week in an actual movie theater (remember those?). Ultimately, it's about a BDSM relationship without the sexy accoutrements of BSDM. In a healthier world, if the female partner needed him ""flat on his back ... helpless ... tender ... open ... with only me to help"" so he could ""settle down a little,"" some BDSM play would have been the more fun alternative. Instead we have poison mushrooms. Because the stuffy movie viewing public would find this sexless alternative perhaps less offensive? Give me the kinky shenanigans seen in Professor Marston & The Wonder Women any day of the week please! Where's Charles Guyette, the G-String king, when you need him? That's the doctor they needed to call! I found this film oppressive and dreary. Utterly sexless and depressing. The director is very talented and the actors are great and the scoring is brilliant, just disliked the story intensely. A dislike that carried with me for days, like food poisoning!"
PHANTOM THREAD,22 February 2018,10/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson really made an amazing movie here. Where the movie can seem boring at times with long passages of silence, eye contact, and smoldering gazes, the end makes up for it all. The end sets up for the entire movie of uncomfortableness through the character of Alma.
Alma, a waitress, falls in love with Reynolds Woodcock, a renowned tailor and owner of a fashion house. She gains his attention, alas she can't keep it. She tries everything, but can't seem to regain it, as her love for him is ever growing. His love is where the tailoring and fashion is, and due to his mother's death, and the following superstition that tells him, he is forever to be a bachelor, he won't even bat an eye. Alma tries to regain his attention and love by poisoning him with poisonous mushrooms, so as to care for him, and thereby make him realize, that she is invaluable to him. Her plan works, and they get married, but soon thereafter, his attention shies away from her. She plans to poison him once more, but to her surprise, he knows of her plan now. Even though of her plans to poison him, he lets her, because of his wish to be cared for; he knows that their love will blossom thereafter.An amazing movie about a love that can appear out of nowhere, with very different people, and very different ways as to make the love blossom."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 February 2018,9/10,"London-50s,Reynold Woodcock is a top fashion designer.He is rich,obsessive,genious and a little nuts with a few excentrical explosions and he needs to have everything in order.He doesent have a wife,only occasional mistresses.His sister Cyril helps him run the companyWhen Woodcock wants to relax for a few days he heads out to the sea.He finds in a hotel restaurant a young kind waitress Alma,which he invites to a luxurious dinner and then to his house where he wants to show her something.Here he shows her more then his penis and there begins a very weird relationship.Even if Paul Thomas Anderson didnt shoot too many movies in his career,he is currently one of the most unique filmmakers.In comparison to raining frogs or ""I drink your milkshake!"" is Phantom Thread a a movie with a standard plot twist and storyline.But its still better and original then what Hollywood makes these daysI do not want to spoil it, but I would not do well enough, because a dry factual summary of what happens during the film on the screen would sound a lot demented, like some bad soap opera.The triumph of this movie is that the characters are phenomenaly written and acted out well,that the crazy events kind of make sense, because ""yes these two people would behave that way,because in this situation it would seem like a reliable option""This is an actress concert not only of Daniel Day-Lewis but also of both ladies.It is usually shown with a hand gesture or with a look from the actors(actresses).The morning routine of Woodcock dressing up shows us more then long dialogues.When it comes to dialogues they are brutally effective.With regards to that Woodcock is a destroyer of human souls,his inevitable conflict with a vulnerable, trustworthy, and more or less immaculate Alma must strike terribly.But....it develops more complexly and when it actually turns out really wierd,it makes sense-it belongs to these people.I wouldnt want to be anywhere near these three people.But to be honest, I loved to watch them suffer for 2 hours.Tell me if Im wrong but all of these characters arent real and Woodcock isnt inspired by some real fashion designer.Which is bad otherwise this would be the best biographical movie about a fashion desginer ever"
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,4/10,"Sorry, i thought it was beautiful, and obviously acted well. but the plot was odd, the characters poorly defined and the ending maddening. i can appreciate the work done but disappointed in the overall flow of the film. should win for best costume design for sure though."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 October 2018,,EAT A PIN CUSHION JOHN FORD! REYNOLDS WOODCOCK IS 10X THE MAN JOHN FORD EVER WAS!
PHANTOM THREAD,26 December 2017,2/10,"There's nothing worse than a drama without conflict, and that's what most of Phantom Thread is. Lots of scenes of Daniel Day Lewis taking measurements, a scene where he orders breakfast for almost 5 minutes.This film was flat out boring.It took about an hour before we see any semblance of a plot forming."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 December 2019,10/10,"A visual delight, uncomplicated narrative and great music composition highlight this tale set in the Haute Couture world in London in the 1950s. Both Danie-Day Lewis in his swan song act and Vicky Krieps give us a performance that rises to the level of an Oscar winner"
PHANTOM THREAD,12 June 2020,4/10,"I was initially enticed with the classic theme and breathtaking scenery, not to mention the mysterious personality of the male character. However, I don't really understand how the woman's approach to making a behavioral change and eventually mutual acceptance to do nasty things that could endanger another's life is admissible at all.It was also challenging to know that a poisonous sprout wouldn't kill him but only enough to make him unwell, and the woman later gladly takes care of him in order to put a halt on his madness?? Sheesh! I think they are both mad to accept such terms.Maybe I didn't understand the entire film because I wasn't paying enough attention the entire time, but I felt disappointed in the end. Probably it was unique?? Crazy. I must watch another film."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,5/10,"A deeply unpleasant movie without any characters to like. Good performances from a strong cast, but I will be disappointed if this is really Daniel Day Lewis's final film."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 May 2021,10/10,"How often will you find a movie that makes you actually think? It's rare. This movie will leave you pondering if certain actions were justified and good, even though most people will say that such actions are universally bad. Films like this push the boundaries of how we simplistically view morality and how one should care for themselves and others.Spoiler: This movie is reminds me of the bible verse that says that it is better to cut off one's own hand than to sin. It relates to this movie because a married couple should see themselves as one whole... and sometimes there is a cancerous and rotten bit within the couple that needs to be stopped. Sometimes the answer to that is chemotherapy. Sometimes it is cutting off access to that which is destroying. It isn't the ideal situation to be in. But that is life. That is real. It isn't the happiest of endings where nothing bad happens where every character gets all their desires and needs. It's better than that. They get the best they could get realistically in the circumstances and embrace it.Also, the visuals/music/acting is top notch. Perfect movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,,"Cinematography wonderful, frocks gorgeous, acting top notch, script ....lost, sorry this is tosh and should be avoided"
PHANTOM THREAD,20 April 2018,3/10,"Waaaay to much music. 
Its like one almost feels like the Director dont trust the audiences eyes,and therefore paints the whole film with an overstatement in music. Its not that the music isn't nice,because it is... 
its just TO MUCH of it..."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,10/10,"A film with characters who are neither good nor bad. They are real, raw individuals, brilliantly brought to life by astounding performances.
Daniel Day-Lewis is phenomenal. His glances, slight moves of the head, his intonation, his everything belong fully to the character and carry so much realism. It is impossible to think of the actor while watching him embody the role of such a complex person. 
Once again, DDL achieves perfection."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 September 2020,5/10,"The last 10 minutes felt rushed and totally out of character. The movie had so much potential, though wasting a substantial amount of ""film"" only to rush the end into a hasty, unlikely, and deplorable ending."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,1/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis should have retired after ""Lincoln"" as opposed to making this absolute waste of two plus hours the last movie he will ever make. Every minute drags on like an hour, and each hour drags on like a day. Watching grass grow is more entertaining than this film. Save your time and your money.What a shame that this is the way Day-Lewis chose the end his career."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 July 2018,10/10,"I read some reviews here before watching the movie which made me predisposed to dislike and reject the movie. Contrary to claims in negative reviews, the movie is a brilliant piece of art, a unique illustration of genius screenwriting and a very well crafted style. It's a movie that looks in depth into core human themes and is lees ""action-oriented"", which explains why many of the viewers here didn't like it. Unfortunately, viewers are formatted to appreciate certain kinds of movies. This is a movie for viewers with a mature mind. Excellent!"
PHANTOM THREAD,14 October 2021,5/10,"Yeah, I was so into this - watching the couple's relationship evolve and devolve - until the 9th inning of elected gastric distress and poisoning. I get the power struggles and kink behind it all but the glamor and the story just went down the toilet. So to speak."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 March 2018,9/10,A film for lovers of a certain style of cinema. The pace rewards when the twist comes. A gem of a film. I have been left with knitwear envy........
PHANTOM THREAD,31 October 2018,1/10,I'm not going to waste your time with some pretentious and condescending critique of this movie....since if you watch it you'll be wasting enough of your life that this would be overkill. Thankfully I recorded this movie and was able to minimize the loss of quality time in my life which would be non-recoverable as it dragged along resulting in the feeling that I lost the full two hours of my life....by the end even I wanted to eat the damned mushrooms!
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,9/10,"Phantom Thread is a movie about the love and competition between Reynolds Woodcock, an eccentric dressmaker, and Alma, a young waitress fashioned as a model.This film is fantastically crafted, with plenty of small details and themes throughout that true film lovers will appreciate. The performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps are excellent, and they together form an unconventional yet appealing on-screen duo, just not in the conventional sense. However, I can't recommend this to everyone; the average American may find this type of film boring and uninteresting, and feel as though nothing happens. It runs a little slow at times, so if that type of drama isn't your type of movie, you won't enjoy it. If you generally like film, or Paul Thomas Anderson, then you will probably really like it.
4.5/5. The R rating is pretty much entirely for language."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 August 2018,3/10,"Miss it! You don't need to waste a couple of hours of glorification of a selfish, spoiled, self-centered ""artist""."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,8/10,"I saw the trailer and thought, ""this is either going to be really slow or really good."" I was wrong; it's both.Phantom Thread is a masterclass in mise-en-scene, a tense and deliberate captive film where I still can't decide who the captive is. Paul Thomas Anderson expertly ties all the elements of cinema together: costume, lighting (look out for many half-lit faces) and music (I wish the orchestra had been live in the cinema). Most notable was the choices of camera movement and shot composition. When Daniel Day-Lewis' Woodcock feels threatened by the change imposed by the trolling Alma (a marvellous turn by Vicky Krieps in a conniving yet vulnerable performance), Anderson often zooms slowly in on the action, creating the sense that the walls are closing in on Woodcock. The tracking shots, notably during an early fashion show and in the frantic New Year's Ball, create a sense of rush and clamour in an otherwise meticulously managed world. The first half hour feels slow but never boring. This is the pacing that PTA masters to create the high points of conflict in the film. By making the blossoming romance deliberately slow at its inception, the eventual dinner arguments and suspicious meal preparations play out like explosive action sequences and Western stand-offs respectively. By allowing the relationship between the intriguing threesome at the centre of the film to breathe and develop, PTA creates a Chinese water torture effect whereby the true dynamics drip with mystery and are eventually revealed to a surprising effect. This film is funny too. A satirical take on the poisonous dependency that can come to fuel some relationships, Phantom Thread explores the way in which a shared chaos can bring dysfunctional people to a dysfunctional compromise. By the end, the protagonists/antagonists/both can hardly contain their smirks and grins as they settle into their sadistic ritual. Daniel Day-Lewis has never been more captivating; he is believable and unbelievable all at once, bringing terror and tragedy to Woodcock. Lesley Manville is controlled and wonderfully above-it-all in her portrayal of Cyril. the Chief-of-Staff figure who's no-nonsense management serves as the apex of Woodcock's mummy-issues. A key scene where Cyril shows Woodcock who's really boss is a great insight into why his some of his first questions to Alma are about her mother (not to mention a surprise visit on his sickbed). Vicky Krieps really deserved an Oscar nomination for her performance here; she is rebellious and taunting without ever allowing the audience to abandon her viewpoint. A brilliant mediation on dependency, possessiveness and trust, Phantom Thread is an intriguing drama that tricked me into being thrilled."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 March 2018,9/10,"Madly self-centred and infantile control-freak and seemingly having Asperger's meeting a model with similar divergences. There is not a high degree of commonality in their reasoning thus invites mental hygienists and psychiatrists to ponder upon. There was something about them. He was overall quiet and sophisticated yet with a soul of a tormented quality. They got married but still lived a hermit-style life of a low profile where even the tiniest noise at the breakfast could make him mad and explosive. There is something else apart from passive-aggressive disorder beneath their quiet and seemingly sensitive appearances. They both are personifications whose morals were up the spout. Their relationship seem to be more codependent than based on any kind of love. The setting of the film and Fitzroy square architecture seemed fascinating, though."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 March 2018,,"Daniel Day Lewis gives a subdued, eloquent and dark performance as a man obsessed with his life's work, leaving everyone he loves in near tatters through the process. The music by Greenwood pushes the story through at a beautiful pace and the cinematography is gorgeous. I am sure this will be a film that ages gracefully and rewards with multiple viewings. A lovely story about an imperfect man in an imperfect relationship. Anderson never fails to impress."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 December 2017,10/10,"This is the most unique romance film to come out in all of history. Paul Thomas Anderson has struck Gold again with this masterpiece. The Screenplay is really original and very engaging. Usually when people watch a film, they tend to doze off at times because of slow moments. This film however, you cannot look away, you cannot blink because the timeless beauty and sheer elegance that this film has is unparalleled. What keeps you so engaged is the breathtaking cinematography shot on a 35mm camera, the Stand out performances from Daniel Day Lewis , and Vicky Kriceps and also the amazing dialogue which keeps you drowned in the film. Many people might think ''Oh its a movie about the love story of a dressmaker''so they might not watch it. If you feel that way, its your loss to miss this masterpiece of a film. It is a suspenseful romance film which has never been done before and the fact that you cannot look away from the screen, it proves that this film is the best film of 2017. This film is going to be mentioned for years to come. Just like ''There Will Be Blood'', it will be shown in film classes to learn from and just like ''There Will Be Blood''it will be mentioned as one of the best films of all time. As this is Daniel Day Lewis's last role, i can say that it is worth being called a movie worthy of Daniel Day Lewis's last. In fact, It is his best film to date and in terms of performance, he gives one of the best of his career. I would not be surprised if he wins best Actor for this one over Gary Oldman. Day Lewis totally deserves to be the only actor to have 4 Oscars. If Vicky Criceps is not nominated for Best supporting actress or best actress then we know that the Oscars are unreliable, She equally matches Day Lewis in terms of performance and that is saying a lot because she is working with one of the best. Paul Thomas Anderson continues his legacy in film with this epic, and he deserves a nomination for best director, if not, he deserves a win. This film is one of the best to come out in the past 5 years and i could say its perfect. I give it a 10 out of 10."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 February 2018,2/10,While the film is well acted and has incredible camera work and cinematography my god this movie is unrelatable. Jesus christ except for the 0.001 percent of the population that was alive during the 50's in England and was a fashion mogul. This movie stinks. Lord I'm pissed.
PHANTOM THREAD,6 March 2021,1/10,"Most boring movie ever!
Don't waste your time with it. I am sure you have better things to do."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 July 2020,3/10,"Can we please have a law that film trailers have to actually present the gist of movies? This was yet another movie that pretended to be about a deep, mysterious guy and a passionate relationship and turned out to just be weird and completely unsatisfying."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 December 2017,9/10,"The Phantom Thread is another fantastic Paul Thomas Anderson movie. I always enjoy Paul Thomas Anderson movies. He's always been extremely careful and creative with the material that he is given. But sometimes he can not always deliver. His recent film being inherent vice, which was massively disappointing. But this new film of his, Phantom Thread is stupendous. The movie works like a snake; Playing on your instincts. This movie left me star-stuttered. Paul Thomas Anderson, like all of his movies, even the bad ones, have great direction. He has an amazing way of presenting gratifying content. You always get glued to the screen. Also the cinematography is spectacular. Paul Thomas Anderson always has Robert Elswit. But this time he has the helm of cinematographer himself. And it's pretty good actually. I actually would've preferred Robert Elswit himself, because even though the cinematography is great, it isn't spectacular. Also the writing is great as well, of course. Paul Thomas Anderson has great scripts. I really like the way he writes his movies, it's really amazing. But this might be his best written and directed movie since boogie nights and the master, two of my favourite Paul Thomas Anderson movies. The acting is also exceptional, especially from Daniel Day Lewis who carries the movie. Is acting is marvelous. And the rest of the acting is also great. The sudden, scary, relentless relationship between Daniel Day Lewis' character and Vicky Krieps' character is really moving. You get to see these characters grow and learn from each other. And really, the two main lead roles are fantastic as characters, in term's of how these characters are set-up. The music is actually where my problems lie. The music is constantly nodding you off to sleep. It's the most boring, drifting, lazy score I've heard this year. Usually Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't have good music in his movies which is a shame. Anyway the Phantom Thread is a great movie, definitely one of the best movies of the year. This is Daniel Day Lewis' last role and he knocks it out of the park with this one. One of the best scripts this years. Best direction and superb acting.99%"
PHANTOM THREAD,4 March 2018,9/10,"Let's start with the super-short credit at the beginning of the movie. nothing fancy, straightforward and no nonsense. and it builds up right to the end.music score is love. screenplay is passion. actors are brilliant.Watch this if you love organic film."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 January 2018,3/10,"I waited and waited to see this movie. I was expecting something completely different than what this movie is. I was looking forward to DDL's swan song. This was more like a lame duck song. His portrayal of Mr. Woodcock is excellent as is all of the roles he plays in other productions. But Alma grated on my nerves the entire movie. There are much better actresses that could have played this role. The movie has so many 'loose threads' (pun intended). So many times the story could have fanned out to create a more in depth and cerebral experience. And, once again, a movie that had a perfect time to end (at the New Year's Eve Ball) and it would have been very effective. No hugs, kisses, cries...just grab DDL's hand and walk out. Perfect. BUT, no. It went on for another 20 minutes or so with just a great deal of nonsense and useless information that added little to the movie. It seemed like a desperate attempt to save the entire movie. When I walked out of the theater after the movie was over I was actually ticked off. For me, DDL was great but he picked a dog of a movie to retire on. BUMMER."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 May 2018,1/10,"Do not bother watching this movie!
It's just another one of those money harvesting films that have been glorified and boasted because we, the peasants, are watching it.You know it's a bad movie when you want it to end as soon as possible. I wanted this movie to end so badly. I was bored out of my mind.If a film critic said it's good, then without a doubt we must believe them and also tell all the people we know how wonderful this horribly boring this movie is... right?And please, I don't want anyone claiming how they are a movie expert and how the cinematography or directing of this film were amazing, therefore, the movie must be amazing. That idea is just ridiculous...I'm a simple man...
If I like a movie, I like it (mainly) for the story or the feeling it leaves me with at the very end.
In my own personal opinion, the story is the main and key element in any movie. If the story is flawed, then the rest of the movie is automatically flawed.
Of course, other elements such as directing, lighting, cinematography matter, but they are not as important as the story.And now, for the big question... Why am I giving this movie a 1/10?
Because I cannot give it a 0 because this website won't allow me to do so.The story was boring.The characters were all plain and dull with no life in them (But I suppose that's what's intended.No, Daniel Day Lewis' role was not remarkable in any way (unlike the last 10 minutes of there will be blood)No, scenery and photography DO NOT count for anything. If I wanted good scenery I can just google some pictures about dying trees.Directing was in no way special (But that's just my opinion)I was hoping for some sort of climax, but there was none.The ending was pathetic. And please, no one tell me about ""the powerful symbolism that lies within"". No matter how amazing a symbol might be, it will never be as amazing as the manner in which it is presented.The lighting was pretty dim to be honest. I know the movie is in an earlier time, but colours really do attract the eye."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 January 2018,7/10,"Lewis's gaze upon the female 'objects' of his affection has become his signature technique. You hear his thoughts as he hypnotizes his prey like a cobra. Still, this storyline...young woman, older man needs a rest. Most of the seats in the theatre were taken and the audience was 80% over the age of 65 and 90% female in my estimation."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 September 2020,10/10,The only words i can describe this movie is chic...stylish...elegant...neat...classy...tidy .. this movie was somthing different for me i never watch somthing like this it was soo good and unique
PHANTOM THREAD,10 January 2021,10/10,"I have adored Paul Thomas Anderson for a long time. His take on the pathology of ambition in the form of There Will Be Blood has been my favourite film for many years now.
That is until i was forced to reconsider with Phantom Thread. This film is a masterpiece in film making. The grain, almost animated lighting and meticulous set pieces all indicate that Anderson is a trail-blazer and deep well of inspiration for all art-house filmmakers.
But that achievement pales in comparison to the absolute sorcery Anderson has been able to conjure out of his cast. Day-Lewis and Manville are both as mesmerising as they have ever been, but Krieps was someone who came out of nowhere and blew my mind. She engages the enigmatic Daniel Day-Lewis as Paul Dano was never able to do.I shall watch this film again and again for years to come, and recommend it to anyone willing to lend me an ear. For now I have downloaded Jonny Greenwood's score and shall listen to it with adoration."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,9/10,"If you want a fast-paced melodrama this isn't it. The character exposition is slow and meticulous, like the effort needed to hand-stitch a fitting dress for a lady; it takes some time and great attention to detail. Every shot is well thought out in advance, with subtle touches, i.e. in one scene you see Woodcock, the dressmaker played by Daniel Day Lewis, stitching the hem of a dress he's making. Closeup of his thumb and the sewing needle, with small cuts where the needle has gone through and hurt his thumb, for example; small details like this show the great care that went into every scene in this wonderfully acted movie. The character development, from Lewis as the neurotic repressed self-avowed bachelor trying to make sense out of the relationship he is trying to have with both his ever-present sister and the new woman in his life that is throwing his daily routine out of whack. The subtle expose of the power he has over women with the dresses he makes for them, trying to control not only their appearance but their adulation for him. It is through the dresses he makes that he manipulates the women who wear them to satisfy his need for self-esteem and power.The music composition is well thought out sets the mood for every scene, without being distracting. The attention to detail on the sets and costumes let the viewer get lost into the nuances of post WWII London.Yes the movie is slow and plodding, but ultimately worth it as the viewer has time to take in the excellent acting and character development; this movie is more like a fine wine of the period that once decanted, lets you experience the atmosphere of the period in which it was made."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 January 2019,7/10,"Most people will have difficulty relating to this movie, even though it's scattered with brilliancies, the atmosphere is intense but restrained, the actors are uniformly superb (especially Manville), and the theme (the selfishness of genius) is cleverly presented. It's usually difficult to show geniuses at work, because everything happens inside the head. But with a master couturier, once can see much of the sumptuous work in process. Probably to enjoy this film you have to be an anglophile, an aesthete and an interior decorator. I found the mushroom element of the plot ridiculous, and the music, though clever, derivative and intrusive. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every subtle minute."
PHANTOM THREAD,1 May 2020,10/10,"I traveled to Norway a few years back and, despite all the great paintings of Munch that I saw there, an artwork of a artist called Per Inge Bjørlo is the one I will never forget.It represents, obviously, a self portrait of the artist, but it was it's title that got me: ""Myself, of course"". The expression ""of course"" gives a deep and simple touch to the concept of art: art is the one who made it, and maybe nothing more. There is no product, just the painter or any sort of craftsman.I know this discussion can be an endless one, since we have great horrible examples, like Woody Allen. People tend to distinguish and separate his work and product from his personal life. But I believe there is no such a thing. People can be and are bad since the dawn of time, and at the same time they can possess something you personally like. I enjoy his movies. I laugh a lot due to them. And at the same time I think Allen is a monstrous man for all he did.Sorry, Phantom Thread.If you check Phantom Thread's trivia in this website, the following will pop up: ""Director Paul Thomas Anderson got the initial idea for the film while he was sick in bed one day. His wife, Maya Rudolph, was tending to him and gave him a look that made him realize that she had not looked at him with such tenderness and love in a long time.""These little things, these personal obsessions, these feelings, these dispositions of the will are what make humans produce movies, write books and philosophize (Heidegger - yes, the nazi - has great thoughts on this matter). And I believe Anderson delivered it beautifully. I understood what he felt, and I wish one day I could feel this too to fully experience the film.That is my only parameter to judge art. The rest, all the criticism about camera or clothes or anything else, just serves to show yourself off and have a better sleep at night. That is just my opinion, of course - the only thing I will ever have.Myself, of course."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 July 2020,10/10,"A masterpiece in every sense of the word. The music, the acting, the intensity, the scenery, the plot and all the details in a simple look or touch. I have never been hooked or anchored to any character the way i was with Reynold Woodcuck. I would advise you all to watch it and just marvel at all the colors, beauty and confrontation"
PHANTOM THREAD,18 October 2020,8/10,"I found this movie unusual & disturbing, causing anxiety and worry."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 November 2020,6/10,"Such a difficult movie to go through. Can't say it is boring, every PTA movie has a slow pace so i was expecting that. The frustration kicks in when you pass 2/3 of the movie, and realise that it will not give you nothing. Felt so empty after this one, had to go grab a snack. Praise for the acting and the music, costume design not that bad, everything else though...the story had nothing to it, no supstance, just gibberish from the director in trying to make a romantic drama, failing so hard. Dissapointed"
PHANTOM THREAD,26 January 2018,2/10,"I saw the trailer and thought this movie looked really good - the plot of a dressmaker that mets women and sews secret messages in their dresses. Instead this movie was about a cooky old dressmaker who's intolerable. The trailer is nothing like the picture.This movie made no sense, it was painfully slow. The movie makes no sense and I'm so dissapointed I wasted $17 bucks and 2 hours of time. This movie has given me stress about the decision I made to go see it. Give this movie a 2nd thought before going to see."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 February 2018,7/10,"I usually love Paul Thomas Anderson's films and there is much to admire here, the acting is solid, the shots are well framed and the score blends in with the style and era that the film is set in. However I was waiting like a coiled spring, waiting for Reynolds woodcock and his world to crumble, waiting for their toxic relationship to be the death of both of him or her but....No! nothing happened, the film was stuck in a loop, much like Reynolds woodcock himself, stuck in his own world, repeating his same mistakes.i was left feeling like it was a huge opportunity missed, if only something sizmic had happened or built up to some sort of twist starting in the second half of the film and leading the audience on towards a satisfying final scene but nope it wasn't to be!If a film leaves you disappointed and frustrated then it hasn't succeeded."
PHANTOM THREAD,26 April 2020,8/10,"Woodcock struggles to allow humanity into the most important things in his life: his work and his art. He has a mixture of unhealthy perfectionism and obsessive-compulsiveness which destroys not only people around him but his very soul. He needed to be brought to his knees by poisoning to open up his vulnerabilities. Alma on the other hand needed to do harm to have a semblance of control over one she loved with very much or at least thinks so. She needed to find direction where she had none, being thrown into a world where she is but a cog. Cyril's cold calculated reality bridges one's dogmatic sense of purpose and the other's lack of it."
PHANTOM THREAD,15 February 2018,2/10,"I'd rather stick a sharpened pencil in my ear than see this again. Confusing plot, confusing characters, weird ending, I prayed for the end.If you a into women's fashion, you may enjoy it. Technically, it was impressive, they nailed the 1950's England. However, that's about it."
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,2/10,"This film triggered my 15 minute alarm; I should have listened to my inner film critic and called it quits then. Instead, I stayed and endured until the end, endured being the operative word here. 
I'm fine with talky films that have something interesting to say, some gripping dynamic; but this was just a prolonged slice of miserable life with some vaguely unpleasant people who just didn't impress."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 February 2018,9/10,"What most people won't get in this film is the end. Please don't continue if you haven't seen the movie. 
The one thing you should notice while everyone seems to miss, is that the girl gave him magical mushrooms. a Psychedelic that will make you think you are sick if you don't know that you're hallucinating. While it creates changes in personality and makes the person more humane and emotional. I think he figured it out at the end. when he went back to his old habit, she went looking for some shrooms to tame that cruel monster inside him... and it worked!This is a real masterpiece from Anderson, and choosing this genre in particular to convey such an idea is insane. Maybe another Oscar for Lewis !"
PHANTOM THREAD,5 April 2018,2/10,"The title says it all. This movie is boring and predictable. I have watched it because I really liked all movies of Daniel Day-Lewis, but this was painful to say the least. Go and spend your time on something else."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 August 2018,1/10,Most dreadful and endlessly boring movie made in the last century.
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,2/10,"Ok first things first, give credit where credit is due. The acting cannot be faulted; Day-Lewis, Manville and Krieps are superb - captivating and convincing. Manville's portrayal of Cyril, Reynolds' sister, was highly enjoyable (indeed, I think her's was the only character I liked). The camera work also facilitated the storytelling and the setting was elegant. Now for the bad. SPOILERS BELOW. Try as much as the cinematography might there simply was nothing to tell. Or there was and I simply did not like it. I oscillated between the two whilst watching. Perhaps it was my fault for not doing my research beforehand (I simply saw Day-Lewis name and put it on my 'to-watch' list) but I thought it would be a drama/romance. 
What it actually turned out to be was an extremely dysfunctional and borderline abusive relationship between a work-obssessed fashion designer, Reynolds, and his live-in human mannequin (and part-time muse, part-time annoyance), Alma, who looks 30 years his junior. Only this time it's the young woman doing the sort-of abusing. Call me crazy but any relationship which relies on one party being poisoned every now and then in order to know how to show his 'soft side' and express his affections is not something to be lauded (please don't call it love... might I suggest unhealthy interdependence or obsession instead). Someone should refer them to counselling. Alma openly relishes in Reynolds' increasing reliance on her. His willing submission to her ministrations left me aghast and left me watching their whirling vortex of intense attraction and destruction with increasing apprehension and distaste. Now I don't need protagonists to be potential bosom buddy material in order appreciate a film but I need at least to like them in some respect (even a very small one will do). Unfortunately I found the couple's actions, emotions and motivations simply difficult to empathise with.I've watched plenty of films/tv shows where 'disturbing' was the main course but this film somehow managed to disturb me more than all of those combined. Perhaps it was because I wasn't prepared for it and it therefore amplified my reaction. I watch films to be moved, educated or entertained. I'm sorry, but this was none of the above. Don't watch if you want any more than a glimpse of a good time."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 May 2021,10/10,"This film is smooth with 2% milk cream. I loved it. And I got a good nights sleep afterwards.People may says this is a slow movie. Understandable. I just double-checked, and this did not have Vin Diesel on the cover.It's Daniel Day Lewis, the actor. He can captivate you and slip you a Nyquil at the same time. That's part of his greatness."
PHANTOM THREAD,22 September 2018,10/10,"If you can imagine a perfectly seared and tender scallop along with a crisp and aromatic white wine, that was what the combination of acting and each meticulously framed and paletted shot was like. I couldn't stop marveling at how beautiful the entire experience of this film was. Sumptuous. Succulent. Simply splendid. Instantly a top ten for me, if not top five."
PHANTOM THREAD,29 June 2018,2/10,"This is the movie version of those art paintings which are only a blank page, and they get sold for one zillion dollars."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 December 2018,2/10,"I don't understand the appeal at all, the period atmosphere was well developed in the limited space that they filmed in and there were some good shots but the majority of the film was simply bad. The strange abusive relationship was a superficial plot point and left unexplored. There are films that make you uncomfortable in a good way, that challenge you as the audience member but this just felt like you were third wheeling an extremely forced relationship for a couple of hours. The rest of the film was uninteresting. Even if it was trying to fall under slow cinema, I've seen much better films where the slowness adds to the experience and is used in the film to great effect. This just feels like it drags out the film to pose as ""artistic"", just to be different for different's sake, nothing else."
PHANTOM THREAD,6 October 2018,7/10,"As the title suggest, it is a great movie. I especially enjoy Daniel Day-Lewis' performance. the movies overall mood plus the score by Jonny Greenwood. But there is something about the whole film I find weird.Maybe it is the plot. Maybe It is how the whole love theme is executed. I don't know.
But if I put myself above it and just enjoy the whole journey, it's really good.Not the best Paul Thomas Anderson movie, but good enough to keep one enjoyed for an afternoon."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 January 2018,9/10,Phantom Thread is exquisitely textured. The director creates individual pieces of emotional fabric that are artistically woven into a movie that can be so palpable that it can almost be tasted. Daniel Day Lewis has some classic lines with sometimes humorous undertones. A real delight. Sorry public- no explosions or car chases.
PHANTOM THREAD,3 February 2018,9/10,"It's a slow start but opens your mouth and eyes when the titles roll. Everyone gave their best, the attention to detail was immaculate. A must experience in theater, Lewis was just great but Krieps was flawless in every frame"
PHANTOM THREAD,17 March 2018,10/10,"A perfect 10. The New Shining. Kubrick is back (from the dead...) to haunt us in this layered masterpiece for the ages.Be warned. This is not simply a beautiful film about troubled romance. This is a film about the archetypes and the roles of males and females in society, family life and even in nature itself. This is a film about the mission of art, about the necessity to evolve and to overcome preconceived ideas. This is a film about the foreseen decay of traditional aristocratic values and costumes soon to follow (just as people started eating magic mushrooms and questioning the natural order of things), and also about the fact that to this day many people refuse to accept this, choosing instead to live in some sort of oblivious fairy-tale with an elusive happy-ending. And it is also about so many other things that it will leave your mind spinning at the end. Every line and every frame matters, just wait for it. At this point you might be wondering if you saw the same film that I did. Maybe... maybe not... but if that is the case, watch it again, just to make sure. You may be surprised. Ironically (or not), by not receiving an Oscar in the main categories the film became itself an archetype, making it full-circle, since most masterpieces and their creators were underestimated at the Oscars. Paul Thomas Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis are geniuses of such a high caliber that is not absurd to believe that they could have actually foreseen this. That the pompous academy would be caught by this phantom web, bundled in the plot by themselves, just as the all assuming Woodcock (maybe this is even Weinstein's middle name... who knows) was caught by Alma's phantom web without even realizing it. Fascinated mainly by the costumes, just as the timeless Belgian princess, slowly fading amid everything else that refuses to change. The message is clear though: Whatever you do, do it carefully..."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 March 2019,4/10,I was misleaded by the high score but it was a total disappointment for me. And the musics gave me a headache.
PHANTOM THREAD,22 July 2018,1/10,I just want to say that is the worst movie I ever saw
PHANTOM THREAD,29 March 2018,10/10,"Who would know I would be so entertained in a film about dresses? Kids in my old school would beatt me and shout ""GAAAAY""!!
I don't miss those days at all.Fortunately nowadays I can appreciate art in a safe way. And art is what we get every time with Paul Thomas Anderson. The simple fact that I was never bored in a movie that has no plot its, on its own, an achievement, but I was actually really entertained. I liked this film a lot.
There is so much in such a simple film. The music is absolutely marvelous. I read it ran for almost the entirety of the movie and I felt that, the dramatic moments were pointed with silence which made the scene even more interesting, we feel the lack of music, just shows how much its present in the runtime. The film is beautifully shot as is frequent with PWA, the camera work and lighting is just right in every scene, the cinematography is simple, clean and refined and makes you immerse in this micro society. Direction wise, everything is top notch.Daniel Day-Lewis was amazing, as always he totally disappears in the character, and if I say it didn't felt like I was seeing DDW, its the best complement an actor can get. Vicky Krieps and Leslie Manville were also really good in every moment. Performance wise, everything is top notch.I'm having troubles talking about the plot because there isn't much to it. Its everything about Reynolds.
His behavior, is obsession with is art, his obsession with social interactions, the way he sucks every life around him to please his will, all of this makes the movie so interesting that we just wanna see more of him.
It's an amazing character that deserves all the praise it can get, for the writing and for the performance.Probably many will find it boring and its understandable, its not a film for everyone, specially if you get bored easily, for myself, I liked it a lot."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 April 2019,10/10,"Phantom thread is the kind of movie that you will never forget, a main character with amazing mix of complications, Mr. Woodcock. Alma and it's feelings of weakness and uselessness, and the mystery behind Cyril. Makes you think.
A tremendous and powerful performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Lesley Manville. It's been a while since I saw the movie, nevertheless I still remember a lot of scenes and lines. Thanks for Paul Thomas Anderson for this masterpiece."
PHANTOM THREAD,21 February 2018,4/10,"This is my first review here on IMDb, and it is for a reason. This movie made me anxious and couldn't wait for it to end. It made no sense to me, the girl Alma i really don't understand why would they pick such a character. I imagine she's not like that in real life. She was so so annoying, acting like a teenage girl who is sickly in love with her first love. And the ending.. what was that? the whole two hours of watching their lives for the most absurd and meaningless ending.. it just made me SO angry. Im not very good with words but i just felt I needed to say something about it. Locations and photography were pretty good though."
PHANTOM THREAD,7 March 2018,10/10,"Incredible directing, cinematography and screenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson. Daniel Day-Lewis in probably the greatest performance in his career after There Will Be Bood, this movie is art. Real art."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 March 2018,8/10,Finally a movie that have something to tell in this real flat 2018
PHANTOM THREAD,19 February 2018,10/10,"I was dying to see Phantom Thread, I mean I couldn't sleep normally over the past two weeks (so based on this fact I can call PTA my favorite director), and now I have seen it on the big screen and this is my absolute favorite of 2017.At the very beginning Phantom Thread presents itself as a very light, stylish, romantic and almost magical movie that set in a fasion industry. But as the movie moves forward, little by little it becomes more and more tense and kinda crazier, I guess you can say but at the same time the movie doesn't lose its lightness and almost melodramatic style. I think that alone is very impressive.This time Paul Thomas Anderson decided to be DP himself and his co-workers weren't lying about him knowing a lot of technical things about cameras, lightning and so on. With his debute as a cinematographer he proved himself as one of the most impressive and stylish DPs working today. The way PTA work with practical lightning amaze me, tracking shots became even better, close-ups are absolutely stunning and 16mm film gives the movie unrepeatable vibe.As a writer/director PTA stays as great as he always were. The script is solid and stunning as Woodcock's dresses. Although the movie is drama there are a lot of funny moments and amount of one-liners that are just hilarious. Suspense as grows as grows Alma's love to Reynolds (and vice versa) and toward the end my heartbeat wasn't at a very healthy rate. There are also a strong sexual tense which always please me. And that amazing suspense Anderson created with everything he had: through lenses, music, editing, glances and so on.As for the story itself it's a film about an artist and his muse and their struggle with each other but they find a way to prevent it and live happily and *a bit* crazy.Soundtrack is also a very important part in Phantom Thread. Written by Jonny Greenwood the music sets amazingly accurately the mood for each scene. It can be very romantic and rhythmic or agressive and suspenseful, or even all of that at the same time.Daniel Day-Lewis plays a charismatic, obsessive and capricious dressmaker and it's one of the finest performances he ever delivered. The Rising star Vicky Krieps acts at the same level as DDL and at time even better than him. Lesley Manville plays Woodcock's sister and seriously she's FUCKING great, rich and a cold middle aged goddess (my type!!!).Frankly I can't find anything that isn't great in Phantom Thread. An aboslute must-see!"
PHANTOM THREAD,2 February 2018,9/10,"From now on whenever someone ask me to define the cinematic term ''direction'' I can easily and proudly tell him to just watch this movie.
Paul Thomas Anderson focuses in the characters and the atmosphere and he does a stunning job as always.
I went to see this movie with my brother who doesn't like this kind of movies(drama,romance etc) cause he is getting bored after sometime.
He was amazed that it was so interesting and so well-made and of course he was never bored while we were watching it.
Daniel Day-Lewis is magnificent,heart-breaking.
His perfomance is unique,I really love the fact that he is so different in every movie that he is into.
Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville were awesome also !I just wish this Anderson - Day-Lewis - Greenwood trio to make movies forever !"
PHANTOM THREAD,5 June 2018,1/10,"Total waste of time, the whole story can be written in less than 2 hours, it's only amazing how one can mange to spend a whole movie saying nothing. Very boring!"
PHANTOM THREAD,6 February 2019,1/10,"During the film you are always waiting for sth but nothing is happening , so boring and eventless, give my 2 hours back..."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 December 2018,8/10,"Very good cinematography, like really, i adored it. The plot and structure are fine, but, oh man, the editing, the effing editing. IT RUINS THE WHOLE DEAL. Like, there are effing obvious racord mistakes in the first part of the movie, and it's funny because it's suppossed to be about an obsessioned about detail artist. Also there are marvelous shots that the editor skips to put a plain old boring shot reverse shot. Man, this review it's really about the editor, because the movie is wonderful okay, but when you have a bad editor..."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 November 2021,1/10,"This was the most boring 2 hrs of my life. .monotone voices, saying boring, meaningless things to each other. I hung in there thinking the ending is probably going to be amazing. WRONG! The ending was as boring as the rest of the movie. I gave it one star because the costumes were amazing. The only redeeming factor in this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 June 2018,2/10,"DDL may be a great actor, but this film was just boring. The soundtrack seemed intrusive and the story was tedious.
I was looking forward to watching this after seeing the trailer, which just makes the disappointment all the greater.I really don't understand all the good reviews."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,10/10,"Very good! Very good I liked it a lot! Daniel Day-Lewis, good boy! I'd let him dress me up if you know what i'm saying lol!!"
PHANTOM THREAD,22 March 2018,10/10,"Whilst I realised quickly this film was about sinking into a state, letting it wash over me rather than think my way through it or expect to be entertained, it wasn't until the film finished that I could figure out what I'd just watched. I guess she was the phantom thread holding it all together soundlessly. For me DDL was a perfect example of high-functioning Autism and from that perspective he was so very patient with Alma considering how hard it was for him to manage to ""be normal"". 
He might come across as a difficult person but it was so much harder for him than one might think to be around humans. It was a wonderful experience just falling into the beauty of the visuals and the sounds and the subtle gestures and timings. Wonderful filmmaking. Thank you for such excellence."
PHANTOM THREAD,9 March 2018,6/10,"I can understand why some people found this film to be completely boring/pretentious but I don't think it was bad. slow yes, kind of plot-less sure, but it really was a different film. I don't think all films need to follow the same pattern in order to be considered a ""good"" film, and I also don't think films characters are obligated to transform or grow in anyway, that just happens to be the norm. Could this story have been told differently? sure, but I think if Paul Thomas Anderson was going for vague and sort of unfinished then it works. Not every film can be tied with a bow and explain every little thing to you, that is part of the mystery. I enjoyed it. And I think Vicky Krieps was great as Alma. Daniel Day-Lewis can make any character believable and even charming despite being such a melodramatic and complicated character."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 November 2021,10/10,"Another classic masterpiece by Daniel Day-Lewis. With the sheer perfection of every detail, no need to say anything about the captivating performance of DDL. A mesmerizing storyline with romance, joy, sorrow, darkness, eccentricity, melancholy, and whatnot. Just like the way a masterpiece should be."
PHANTOM THREAD,19 October 2021,1/10,"No story, no plot, no point and about an hour of my life I will never recover. The characters are awful and there is nothing appealing about this film."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 February 2018,3/10,A forced story with flat characters and brilliant acting
PHANTOM THREAD,8 February 2018,2/10,"Sorry , I dont get what the fuss is about this rather mediocre film. It looks and plays like a mid 1950's Hitchcock film without the suspense. Great dresses and score but I kept waiting for Grace Kelly to arrive."
PHANTOM THREAD,14 November 2019,1/10,"This is trash...
Don't waste your time on this!!!!"
PHANTOM THREAD,28 April 2019,1/10,"My Mother and I were so happy to see this was available and had put it on the Watchlist to sit down and watch together today -this movie is an example of what we have been noticing quite a bit:the actors are speaking, you listen carefully to not miss a word or nuance -even with the volume finally way up, we could not make out what they were saying, what ANYONE was saying -no closed captioning as a last resort (my Mom doesn't like CC because it blocks out things in the scene but it helps if you can't understand what is being said)We didn't know what that girl was saying to the person listening to her speaking retrospectively -we could make out that Daniel Day Lewis was portraying a touchy guy and we didn't know why the girl didn't get the hell out of there when that weird sister showed up literally sniffing around - yikes! that was creepy -okay, we loved the sets, the beautiful dresses and the entire business of all those dedicated artisans engaged in bringing Woodcock's visions into reality -but we could not get any idea of what in the hell was happening at the end and I wouldn't even say ""spoiler alert"" because we DO NOT KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED - maybe there should be a ""spoiler alert"" to other veiwers that you won't actually know what transpired, what she was saying to him in the kitchen and later in the powder room - hells bellsI wish and I hope that movie producers and sound engineers would get together and really fix this problem, maybe re-record it - what seems to us what happens is that in the course of filming scenes, there are problems, glitches, one actor or another flubbed the scene and rather than re-do it, a reading is done and then is used as a voice over . . . but the words don't match up with the lip movements and everyone is very mushy-mouthed or literally talking down their sleeves and although there are some very beautiful sleeves in this movie, it does nothing for dialogue.So, please think about this and make movies again ""the old-fashioned way"" insofar as making what is being said, understandable. For example, ""Random Harvest"" is a beautiful example."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 December 2018,7/10,"It's not enjoyable anyway, and I really don't like this kind of aristocratic arrogance. Although it is delicate, the dresses, the photography, and the music, it's still tedious and makes no sense."
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,2/10,"There are three words to describe this movie, SLOW, SLOWER, and SLOWEST. How this movie got nominated for best picture is beyond me. Was not in the least interesting or amusing and was two of the worst hours of my life. The only redeeming aspect of the movie is both Daniel Day Lewis and the female actor did very good in their roles. Otherwise, this was a snoozer with a bizarre and idiotic ending."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 January 2018,5/10,"While the movie was well acted and well put together with interesting camera work and novel use of even the most mundane sounds (such as the amplified scraping of butter on toast transforming the scene at breakfast), a character study simply does not work if you can't relate to the characters. The experience is like being stuck in the beautiful house of an intolerable acquaintance for two hours. This was the worst movie I've seen in quite some time."
PHANTOM THREAD,25 January 2018,9/10,"Never have I seen a movie that made me so uneasy yet had me so captivated the entire two and a half hours. Daniel Day-Lewis created a character that you loved, hated, related to, and pitied all in one. This film was fun, witty, and intriguing all in its own quirky way. A simpleness that made you comfortable but with a wild side that you couldn't turn away from. Ends with a peculiar twist that will have you thinking about the entire film for days to come. Saddened that Day-Lewis is retiring from his art but he definitely brought it home with this one."
PHANTOM THREAD,30 January 2018,10/10,"Paul Thomas Anderson has not only crafted his finest work of cinema, but has made the best film of the 21st century and perhaps the greatest ghost movie of all time.I have never written a review of a film before. After seeing this film, I felt compelled to write out my thoughts on the brilliance of it.
Like the dysfunctional family in Boogie Nights, like the tormented sex guru in Magnolia, like the explosive Barry Egan of Punch Drunk Love, PTA frequents the themes of emotional baggage of the past and how they influence a person's present being. Within Phantom Thread, PTA explores this notion as ghosts that haunt the living. In particular, it are these ghosts that impel and drive the passions of the living, and in essence, posse them.Phantom Thread is beautiful, deep, intoxicating, and tense. The culmination of the lighting, sound, performances, themes, and motifs of this film amplify its essence. The film is greater than the sum of its parts and in turn, develops of life of its own, a spirit. And it is in this spirit where the film squeezes tension in every frame; this film is in fact haunted.This film asserts that artists are haunted people. They craft art to quell or slate an inner yearning for something sublime, rich, and transcendental. Artists can love there craft in the wake of their own peril. This theme within the film correlates to the fearlessness in which Daniel Day Lewis throws himself into the roles he inhabits. After watching the film, one can see how the content of the piece opened scars within the greatest thespian in a generation, driving him to retirement.On the whole, the performances are perfect. The framing, attention to detail, and music all mystify the viewer.Phantom Thread is art. It is art about where art comes from, what it is, how it relates to our own innermost beings.Paul Thomas Anderson has thrown down the gauntlet as being the premier auteur of this generation"
PHANTOM THREAD,13 February 2018,2/10,Maybe in 20 years I will be able to understand this movie. I do not see it as something special nor interesting so far.
PHANTOM THREAD,23 February 2018,1/10,"Knew from Paul Dano, in there will be blud, that Anderson had it in him. His shrill shrieking, haunts me still. Anderson eats way too much of his own cooking."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 March 2018,10/10,"This film is a must see for anyone that has been entrapped into a Narcissist's life under the guise of 'true love', 
A Master Manipulator who swoops his Victims off their feet, breathes them in and spits them out when they longer provide him with the rush he needs.
The Dinner scene between Daniel Day Lewis and Vicky Krieps is a Masterpiece of a Narcissistic Ballet. I cringed in humilitation for her at the hands of this bully, as she tries so hard to reason with a Monster who is incapable of seeing beyond his own needs. It was hard to watch, and it made me uncomfortable and embarrassed for her.
This film tackles a subject that needs to be talked about and exposed, but it doesn't talk about it. It shows you."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,5/10,"This movie was good enough, I guess. It was a little weird, but beautifully crafted. The sets, music and acting were all well done. However, the part that disturbs me is why this movie had to be rated R. I saw absolutely no reason for the f-word being used a dozen times in an otherwise beautiful film. I understand the use of profanity in many situations and films, but it was out of place and unnecessary in this movie."
PHANTOM THREAD,5 March 2018,7/10,"Great acting, both female and male men's roles - excellent indeed. Some dialogues hypnotize. The film as a whole ... unfortunately, it is not outstanding."
PHANTOM THREAD,2 April 2018,8/10,"I like films that show me things I have not seen before. This film showed several of those:
Portrays the cost of passion for workThe dialog is a bit a weird which I found funny. Much is said using body language.Imprisoning a person using only words."
PHANTOM THREAD,13 April 2018,3/10,"The movie was painfully slow and dull with long awkward pauses between the main characters dialogue. A few times during the movie I thought I would just turn it off and go to bed, however I kept watching thinking it would eventually make sense so I continued to watch the movie. It never made sense!! Worse yet was the very end when Daniel day Lewis's well developed character completely flip flopped. This is a personal pet peeve of mine. Throughout the whole movie his personality was extraordinarily selfish, everyone around him had to behave exactly as he wanted (including quite toast eating for breakfast, no crunching allowed) and a relentless workaholic that never smiles (quite unlikable). He required complete control, and withheld love and affection from his wife. In the last five minutes he relinquished complete control by allowing is young wife to poison him to the point of near death rendering him incapable of working. All while smiling at her and professing his love to her. A 100% flip of his personality that was shown throughout the whole movie. Not to mention its just a bizarre plot to have your wife poisoning you with your consent. Weird! Do not recommend."
PHANTOM THREAD,28 April 2018,1/10,"I expected this movie to focus more on the glamour but there was no depth to the characters, only the appearance of depth. We never learned anything significant about them, but by the end I didn't care because their actions were pointless and empty, meant to impress the inexperienced. There is nothing interesting about selfish, ignoble, infantile characters no matter how beautiful the setting or strong the acting. At least there could have been a lesson, a point made, anything. Where are the dramas we used to love? Where is the soul? This was postmodernist garbage. Lazy, unimpressive writing. The glamorization of weak and ugly personalities with no redemption or lesson and no further point but to appeal to the vanity of the audience is becoming such a turn off this will probably be the last movie I watch for a long time."
PHANTOM THREAD,18 November 2018,3/10,"If you've ever picked up a magazine from the waiting room table in a doctor's office. If you stay on your phone to merely occupy the time of one significant event to another in a day. Watching this movie will help you channel that feeling. This would be an excellent movie to be played, out of focus in the background of any other movie(even a non-SuperBowl commercial). Great cinematography and lightning which gives this film perfect periodical timing. If you value your time do anything else."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 May 2018,1/10,"The title is pretty self explanatory. It was incredibly boring and the so called romance is abusive and annoying to watch. I have no idea why they even love eachother, it's never really explained at all. I didn't see any love between the two, every scene that they were in together just made me want to roll my eyes or moan out of frustration. The music made me want to just leave the room because it was so bad. The long, awkward silences and stares were just awful. The only positive that I can think of is the costume design, some of the dresses were actually quite beautiful. The cinematography was also quite good. Apart from that, this is a terrifically boring movie that has absolutely no suspense or interesting factors about it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to even the worst of people, because then they would have to suffer through it."
PHANTOM THREAD,12 May 2018,10/10,"After viewing this masterpiece, I wrote a letter that I am reluctant to send, but will publish here as the best review I can come up with:The only real power in this world is love, and Alma was all-powerful, and Reynolds was all weaknesses, with a relentless hiding in that weakness, in the game of being a great artist, the best place in the world for a man to hide his weakness. Made me think of Hemingway, who, after losing his power to create, his great hiding place, he blew his brains out, just like Reynolds trying to kill himself subconsciously with his powerful psyche when he started to lose his ability to create in the face of the power of love, what only his sister and Alma understood -- everyone else trapped in his grand weakness, a weakness so powerful, indeed, that it reigned over all the women in his life, yet crumbled so dramatically in the face of love, and only Cyril and Alma understood he had to die to it to be freed -- yes, a truly loving sister who helped Alma to kill him. I have obsessed on this recurring notion that Hemingway was so radically weak, cowering inside his art, with those beautiful children and grandchildren who were there to free him into love, the only true meaning in his life, but he was, like Reynolds, too cowardly to free himself from his prison, way too terrified to be freed in love. Yet Reynolds takes the dive into love when he bites and chews the omlette that he is certain will kill him, and discovers enough trust in Alma that he will, indeed, die, but, as she promised, he would be resurrected into love and be freed from his life-sentence of no real love. Yes, he takes the great leap into death, the only door to freedom, whereas Hemingway chose to hide from love for all eternity in death, dying a coward's death. He was simply too terrified of love, which is far more powerful than raw power, which turned out to be nothing but a great hiding place.I credit myself with wanting to die in love, and in great humiliation. That's the real story of my life, but no woman was up to killing me! You and I both never got to that place because of a flimsy surface hiding place, Trenton, that granted me all the time I needed to constuct a prison as artist. But I encountered three women after you that could have killed me to be born again, but each of them chose in terror to possess a man's power and the laughable freedom that goes with it, a freedom that utterly robs us of true freedom. And all three of them landed in the prison men constuct as hiding places.I never ever put my art before my dogmatic search to die in true love. I was always willing to die for love, but no one would accommodate me. And I understand why. My real hope is not to be an artist, but a hope for humanity in this new this millennium, what can only come from women. It's long overdue. I won't be here to see it, but it is my true hope. Women becoming men who keep prisons like Trenton and success-oriented art intact are enslaved to the prisons of terror that men hide in, caught up in man's illusion of power and freedom.When the doctors told me I was near death and I turned down a transplant to save my life, I had this unconscious belief that those I loved would not sccumb to trying to save me so I could remain in my prison of Terror, that they would let me lie flat on my back powerless and reach out to me in that moment in love and joy, but only my daughter and grandkids gifted me with that. My fiance at the time couldn't handle it and left me two weeks before our wedding, after having purchased the wedding dress and arranged for our marriage and reception. She told me to do everything the doctors told me to do and she would stay with me, but she didn't understand that she was offering to help keep my prison intact, and I was looking to be break free from that prison in love.And when the door of death was about to open, I asked my daughter if there is anything I could do for her before I died, and she told me yes, to write out all those books and stories I had written over the years, for posterity. You see, I never typed a single letter when she was around, devoting myself to her in love at all times, and I was really shocked to learn that during all that time, especially after I put her to sleep for the night and I would go out and type, and she let me know that she knew I was doing that all those years, and to please type it all out and leave it to her for posterity. That is when I got serious about writing, for the art now would be in service to love, the only art that I see worthwhile, what PT Anderson understands, which makes him a truly great artist for this new millennium. And although at the surface of life I am still failing as an artist, I am being successful in love, and all that I will finish in my writing will be for love, a love for all of humanity. This is why Kafka was certainly the greatest artist of the novel in the 20th century, and Proust second (Joyce was Reynolds unredeemed), for it was all in the context of refusing to live a compromised love, instead providing the great autopsy on the human condition with a persistent refusal to engage a false escape into success to sustain a relationship of an apparent but doomed love for a wife, a notion that Reynolds first succumbed to, and heroically ending up eating the omlette to escape what Kafka refused to enter into, what Hemingway leaped into to sustain a false image of what love means, the big con that he believed would keep him safe. Alma and Reynolds are the great archetypes of this new millennium, and it can be applied in everything, including world politics, our only hope for the future."
PHANTOM THREAD,31 July 2018,8/10,"Daniel Day-Lewis at his very very best. Proving once more that he is arguably the finest actor of his generation. As in his performances in There Will Be Blood and Lincoln, every second he is on the screen is a wonder to behold and every sound he utters is believable and real. He will indeed be missed. The support from Vicky Krieps and Lesley Manville work perfectly. The script, costumes, sets, lighting and cinematography are faultless. But what lets this film down is the score which although at times is sublime, is at others, intrusive. Someone should have told Jonny Greenwood that sometimes, 'Less Is More'. Given their collaboration on so many projects previously it sounds as if that person is not Paul Thomas Anderson. If only Malcolm Arnold were still alive and composing."
PHANTOM THREAD,3 August 2018,1/10,"Very hard to be very good at very different things. Directing requires knowledge of many things. Story telling/writing/screenwriting requires knowledge of many things. A few people have managed to have both skill sets. They are the exception. But it seems people who go into film and are into shots and camera lenses and directing actors seem to think that they also have something to say. They almost never do. Compare with theatre. How many playwrights direct their own plays? How many theatre directors write their own plays? Very few. But in Hollywood, it happens quite often. And usually the result is garbage. For explainer videos, the key lesson is that all that really matters is plot. But for the whole pretentious ""film"" crowd, concern with plot is viewed as somehow indication that one doesn't really grasp a directors ""vision"" or that one doesn't grasp that ""film"" should not be judged like a play.It's all BS of course. It's story telling. Films tell stories. Small children can explain this to you if you are in doubt. They last about 2 hours just like plays. But if you don't have anything to say about human beings, you are going to bore people. If you are really good at choosing lenses and handling actors and setting up shots, it's really really unlikely that you also have any real insight into human beings and how write that down.Compare all these silly movies to Chinatown. Why are there so few scripts like Chinatown? Is Robert Towne really that unique? I don't think so. I think that, for the reasons mentioned above, Holllwood is just utterly clueless about plot. Anderson may be a good director. But he's a terrible screen writer who knows nothing about human beings. Yes, their are all kinds of weird people in the world. It does not follow that anything goes for plot. The story is idiotic in the extreme. You will learn nothing about human beings at all. If you love somebody poison them twice. Wow. So deep. Evidently actors are just as clueless about human beings as directors. Why else would the star of this movie choose this as his swan song? Hollywood, I know your middle name."
PHANTOM THREAD,17 August 2018,1/10,"If you only see one film this year, please ensure it is not this one. If you want a love story about obsession, passion, even dress making look elsewhere! From the first ten minutes, when the main characters prove themselves to be impossible to sympathise with and hugely unlikable, you find yourself beginning to wonder where the plot will take you. At the film's conclusion, you realise the plot has taken you nowhere and all the despicable characters fully deserve each other. There is no redemption, no deeper understanding of love, relationships or mutual respect. It proves to be utterly without substance and utterly without point.With a soundtrack that appears to be composed for an entirely different film altogether; a script that seems to be, at best, improvised and, at worst, unrehearsed; and a plot that suffers from either too much or not enough editing, you will find yourself scratching your head and wondering how this came to be released without an Alan Smithee credit somewhere. It may be heresy to suggest that Day-Lewis continues to be the most over-rated actor of his generation, and if this proves to be his swan song, it is a poor final act on a career that could, or should, have been so much more productive.As for the 'phantom thread' of the title, I can only assume it is the thread of a plot. Like any kind of spectre, it will appear if you can convince yourself hard enough that it exists. Otherwise, you find yourself looking for something that isn't there!"
PHANTOM THREAD,24 August 2018,6/10,"That was a totally new experience for me in the film's world.I think this is a good artfilm,but only for people who like noetic films.The Phantom Thread is a hard drama about a special relationship.Alma and Reynolds love each other but they have a drastic and crazy solution to stay in this romantic relationship. The film is about this crazy couple and there problems.In their relationship sometimes everything is normal but sometimes not. It isn't very romantic rather it is a bit crazy.Also the ending is maybe a little bit shocking.Anyway the costumes and the scenery are great.The film is a special visual enjoyment for the eyes.I loved the costumes.Paul Thomas Anderson did good job and the actors were great too.Daniel Day-Lewis and Vicky Krieps was amazing.They played their characters fantastic.It was awesome to see them on the screen.On average that was a great film with some unexpected suprise."
PHANTOM THREAD,10 July 2021,6/10,"An enjoyable film. The 1950s London setting is perfect for the austere glamour that the film evokes. The interior of a town house in the centre of London is unlikely in reality to have been so brightly lit, but it did look beautiful and I did appreciate the noisy floorboards and clicking door handles.The characters are all rather irritating, but there is a tension throughout which succeeds in creating a sense of unease, making the film quite compelling.Although the subject matter is apparently serious, and some of the characters (and to an extent, the film itself) pompous, pretentious, and unpleasant, it was often really quite funny - I'm sure intentionally so. I realised after watching it that it has similarities in terms of plot, characters, themes, and the confined setting, to The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant. I may have to watch that again now."
PHANTOM THREAD,4 November 2018,1/10,This movie is just awful. But the one thing that bothers me most is how does a prestigious fashion house finish a wedding dress the day before the wedding??? This does not make sense to me.
PHANTOM THREAD,31 March 2019,3/10,"Daniel Day Lewis is incredible so i watch all his films. With that being said i would not suugest this as there is no sequence of events and no excitement. I tried twice to look for the deeper meaning and i somewhat get it....but other than daniel, the great costumes, and score it really is nothing special. Truly dissappinted at the 2 hours wasted"
PHANTOM THREAD,31 January 2019,8/10,"Mágica, delicada y atrapadora hasta el último minuto."
PHANTOM THREAD,20 March 2020,10/10,"Although this movie is one of my overall favourites, I will try but this aside when reviewing. I feel the characters are perfect, Daniel Day Lewis is ever amazing. For a designer around that time he fits exactly what I would expect. His character is very relatable I feel even though none of us are heads of fashion houses. Attention to detail, OCD and having control freak tendencies lays in many personalities which makes it an exciting viewing experience. The filming with the grain added on every shot links its vintage feel throughout (making it feel loads more 50s). Although most characters are cold and there is many a still shots to create atmosphere, I never felt cold watching. Alma, the main lady, who you don't know weather to love or be weary of, is cast very well also I believe. I love that in this movie you never know who you're supposed to like or not, were usually nudged with costume, warmer colours for nice characters etc. There isn't any of this in this movie, which gives it more depth for me. Not to give too much away, even though the twist is a strange one, its exactly what the viewer needs towards the end of this film. It gives it such a freak vibe overall but I LOVE IT!! 10/10 must watch for me. Aesthetically amazing."
