MOONLIGHT,31 January 2020,7/10,"""Moonlight"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. While this clearly means that the folks at the Academy enjoyed and appreciated the film, this does not mean that the movie is one that most people would enjoy. Like ""The English Patient"", there seems to be a real disconnect between Hollywood and the viewing public...and the film isn't particularly enjoyable to watch...and at times, it's actually rather painful or dreadfully slow. Not a terrible film at all...but I don't understand all the hype.The film is about a young man named Chiron. The film is broken into three distinct phases. In phase one, Chiron is about 7 years-old. His life stinks. His mother is a crack addict and he's often beaten up by neighborhood gangs. The sole positive relationship is with an adult named Juan. Juan is an odd case...he's a drug dealer and a very tough guy. But he's also very tender and loving towards Chiron...and he doesn't seem to have any negative agenda...he just cares about the kid. Phase two is middle school. Chiron is still an exceptionally quiet young man...and he's still beaten up by gangs. He mostly tries to do his own thing...and Juan is no longer in his life. His only friend...well, that's a problematic relationship and I don't want to say more, as it might ruin the film. Phase three is adulthood and I am guessing Chiron is about 30. He now is very much like Juan...a drug dealer, but a very lonely one.The problem with this movie for me is that although the acting was exceptional and very realistic, the plot seemed almost inconsequential at times. Additionally, the movie's plot is quite vague. What's also vague is Chiron's sexuality. I read that the film is a very gay-positive film about a gay man...though this has been so de-emphasized I am shocked anyone really even cared. I wish they'd explored this is greater detail...and provided a lot less slow, uninteresting moments. Overall, a good film but certainly nothing that seems Oscar-worthy...and I still feel very confused by all this hubbub about ""Moonlight""."
MOONLIGHT,16 May 2018,8/10,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary.Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it).'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy. It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable. However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity. Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably. Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders). Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
MOONLIGHT,2 February 2017,,"Moonlight (2016) **** (out of 4)Extremely well-made and lyrical movie that deals with a young black man trying to survive in Miami while discovering who he is through a series of hard times. We first meet ""Little"" (Alex R. Hibbert) as a young kid who is discovered by a local drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) who tries to teach him some life lesson. We then meet him as a teenager (Ashton Sanders) where he is constantly being bullied while at the same time trying to learn his sexuality. Finally, in the third act, we meet him as an adult (Trevante Rhodes) and see how these earlier events have shaped his life.MOONLIGHT is a fantastic character study and I'd argue that it's one of the most interesting ever made. I'm not saying it's one of the greatest films ever made but at the same time I would argue that it's one of the best directed and acted movies that I've seen in a very long time and the end result is something rather special. Yes, we've seen these coming of age dramas for countless decades now but this one here still manages to come across rather fresh and original.What I loved most about the film were the performances by the three actors playing the same character at various stages of his life. A lot of movies try this and it's rare that all three are so believable in their roles that you really do feel as if you're watching one character throughout a period. All three actors really did seem to have studied each other or at least had such great direction where they were all acting the same way, with the same emotions and as the film went along you could see how the teenager was in the younger version and how these two versions played a major role on the adult.The performances here are simply wonderful with Hibbert, Sanders and Rhodes delivering some of the finest performances of the year. The amount of emotional and realism they bring this character is something really breathtaking to watch. Ali is the real standout though as he plays a man we meet and who at first we don't know anything about him. We slowly learn about his character but the presence Ali brings to the role is something truly excellent to watch and he delivers a knock out performance. Janelle Mon√°e is also wonderful as his girlfriend as is Naomie Harris as the boy's mother.Director Barry Jenkins does an extremely wonderful job at keeping the film moving along. There's a terrific visual style including the opening sequence, which just grabs you and pulls you into this world. MOONLIGHT is one of the better character studies out there and it certainly takes you on a fantastic voyage of a boy trying to learn to be himself and become a man."
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2017,7/10,"In a Miami black neighborhood, local drug lord Juan (Mahershala Ali) takes an interest in a small boy named Chiron who is picked on by the other kids. Chiron is befriended by Kevin and his mother is taking drugs. Years later in high school, Chiron is getting picked on worst and he has a gay experience. It ends badly. Years after that, he is a muscle-bounded drug dealer when he reconnects with his past.It's great to have a movie about this lesser known Miami community. It has a different flavor. Ali is an intriguing actor. Despite the darker elements, the visual is beautiful and the characters are fresh. The high school section is compelling. When the bully starts circling, the movie elevates to another level. That part is the climatic high point of the movie. The third section is less compelling and anti-climatic. There are ways to make it compelling but the story peters out. Chiron could befriend a new boy or take his revenge. Either way would be more compelling to finish the movie."
MOONLIGHT,28 October 2019,7/10,"This is an intense couple of hours where the main character is pushed and prodded by the societal elements he encounters. With each passing minute he is forced to push aside a particular direction and go with the influences. Not much new here. No, let's face it, the things he deals with are prominent in our world, and a young man like him would be hard pressed to deal with those things. But there is a bit too much crammed into this film at times."
MOONLIGHT,28 December 2019,,"I saw it as a chain of questions. Behind the good acting, atmosphere and cinematography. Because the evolution of Chiron seems more a question , a large one about the evolution of each from us. The start, the big eyes and pressures and refuges and the first touch. The prejudices and the angry under new pressure. And the adulthood . The end of circle, the vulnerability under the tough look and attitude, the fall in the basic problem of the early years. Sure, it has holes and it is slow it can be boring. But it is is a well crafted interogation and , near the great performances, this is the main virtue in its case."
MOONLIGHT,31 March 2017,6/10,"""Moonlight"" is an American English-language film from 2016 and this is the movie that won Best Picture in a truly controversial presentation at the Oscars this year. It was probably a really really very close win over the suspected front-runner ""La La Land"", so it was somehow fitting the way it turned out. Anyway, this one here runs for 105 minutes approximately and it was written and directed by Barry Jenkins, who won an Oscar for his screenplay. This film is about one character and it is structured nicely into 3 parts during different times from this character's life. One is about him being a small boy, the next about him being a teenager and the final part is about him being a grown-up. Mahershala Ali only appears in the very first part and this was enough for him to win an Oscar. I think he was pretty good, but I am not sure if I'd call him Oscar worthy. Maybe a nomination would have sufficed. Naomie Harris was also nominated and she is in all three parts, even if only relatively short in the final section. And while the third and last part was probably my least favorite, I still want to give a thumbs-up to Trevante Rhodes who despite his strong physicality managed a very vulnerable performance and Andr√© Holland who did a great job next to Rhodes.So yeah, I think the middle part was probably the best (it certainly had the most touching moment namely when the central character gets hurt physically by the one he trusts the most, but it is also a powerful moment because he will stand up from now on), but also most likely the toughest to watch and there were 3-4 really shocking moments in there. One would also be when we hear what happened to Ali's character from the first sequence, even if it is just mentioned in one sentence. The film's strength is perhaps that it really feels very authentic and close to reality. You never have the impression you are watching actors here and also the story works out nicely. When the protagonist enters the world of crime and violence at the end of the second part, he is sucked in it very quickly and his physical transformation fits as well just like his profession. But at the very end (as we also see in the last shot), he is once again the little boy he was right at the beginning. All in all, I would say this is a solid movie and I don't mind it being nominated for Best Picture as it is really very good in its best moments, but the win may be a bit too much. I think it is roughly on par with the equally pretty good but not great ""La La Land"", maybe slightly inferior, but I am quite baffled the film won. Of course, the Academy adjusted their rules recently to help Black movies and actors after all this discrimination talk last year (with which I do not agree at all though), so this certainly helped ""Moonlight"" in getting the edge over ""La La Land"". But I am surprised because the subject is very specific and the Academy has not always reacted that warmly to gay-themed films, but also because ""Hidden Figures"" is a film with historic relevance and not just a personal story like this one here and I find it quite surprising it won Best Picture, also because it is also not a masterpiece from the technical perspective. But maybe they wanted to go for something else this year and honestly I am not too mad about ""Moonlight"" (pretty random name though with the color blue reference on one occasion in the film) winning, even if I would not say it is one of my very favorites from all the Best Picture nominees that year, let alone all Best Picture winners ever, or anywhere near my favorite 2016 films. It's still worth seeing for sure."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,6/10,"This is a rare beast. A film exploring the life of a young black gay man in America.We first see Chiron as a young boy being chased by some bullies in a rough part of Miami. Even by this time some of the school kids have an inkling Chiron might be queer. He is certainly introverted and even lonely, his mother is a crack addict.The only solace young Chiron finds is from a neighbourhood drug dealer called Juan who takes an interest in him with his girlfriend Teresa and his only comfort is spending time in their home.We next see a teenage Chiron, still bullied due to his small stature, his mother has gone deeper into addiction but he finds comfort with lifelong friend Kevin and an awakening of his sexuality but this comes crashing down as Kevin has to beat him up as part of a gang initiation. Chiron leaves this stage of his life under arrest as he tackles the bully who has tormented him for years.We next see Chiron as a young man in another city, he has bulked up and like his mentor Juan, now a drug dealer. However when he receives a call from Kevin he returns to Miami to see his mother and then confront Kevin as well as his true feelings and the encounter they had one moonlit night as teenagers.Director Barry Jenkins has made a small scale, slow paced, low budget drama. Some of the finance was provided via Brad Pitt's production company. It is in many ways a simple, but human tale of a young bay growing up. The first two actors playing Chiron are excellent, although it is difficult to see the resemblance with the more muscular actor who plays the older Chiron.Although a lot of thought has gone in by the director as to the way it has been filmed and the use of colours, some parts of it were far from original. The influence of Truffaut's The 400 Blows is there to be seen.It was obvious that Kevin will have to beat up Chiron as soon as he wanted to join the school gang because I saw a similar scene in the British film Ill Manors."
MOONLIGHT,23 February 2017,6/10,"""Moonlight"" is a dramatic and very well acted film about three stages in the life of a black character since he was a bullied boy and teenager in Miami until his adulthood in Atlanta. The first part (""Little"") is heartbreaking, with the boy Chiron completely lost between the rejection of his crack addicted mother and the love of his new friends, a drug dealer and his girlfriend. The second part (""Chiron"") is inferior but also attractive when Chiron is an adolescent and the problems and doubts he has to face in this difficult phase of life practically alone. Unfortunately, the third part (""Black""} is awful; Chiron has become a strong man (the biotypes totally different from his childhood and adolescence), drug dealer and gay. It is impressive how professional cinema critics love films where the characters are gays (remember ""Brokeback Mountain"", one of the most notorious) and the power they have to influence worldwide viewers with their opinions. A few people dare to say that the King isn't wearing anything at all, like in the ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Moonlight: Sob a Luz do Luar"" (""Moonlight: Under the Moonlight"")"
MOONLIGHT,5 August 2017,6/10,"This is the third mediocre film I have seen being nominated for ""Best Picture."" PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD. ""Little"" grows up being bullied. He is befriended by a crack dealer in a do-rag. His mom uses crack. As a teen Little is now Chiron. His mom still uses crack. He stays with the girlfriend of the crack dealer. He is still bullied. As a man, his name is Black. Mom lives at a rehab center. He now wears a do-rag and sells crack. He lacks a personality. His sexual orientation is a hidden theme, the whole LGBT thing misses its mark.This was not a good Urban tale. It is not a drug film per se. I suppose if you are a Black Cuban growing up in the streets of Miami, with zero personality, you might relate to the film. I failed to relate to it as much as Janelle Mon√°e who played Teresa minus any type of accent. When you say, ""Do you feel me?"" you do so with some attitude, not like some kid from Kansas. Mahershala Ali was convincing in his role and indeed the film was interesting when he was on the screen. He at least talked. Unfortunately the movie centered on a quiet moping kid/teen/man filled with self pity. If you want to make a film about a quiet man, give him a personality. I like Noel Clarke films better.BTW ""La La Land"" and ""Manchester by the Sea"" are the other two over hyped films. These are three cases of the ""Emperor's Clothes"" where lousy films are given high billing because it seems to be cool and intellectual to do so. Skip these three and go see ""Hidden Figures."" Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity"
MOONLIGHT,22 July 2017,8/10,"That Oscar mix-up will forever be attached to the movie winning that final most prestigious Oscar. An honest mistake or maybe done on purpose to avoid another discussion altogether? 2016 was the year where the Oscars got a lot of heat, because all the nominees were white. You could be excused for thinking they tried to make up for it in 2017. Then again, that would not be fair to the movie at hand.A movie that really is going out there and is a movie that has a lot of heart, does go places you might not expect and is about what it means to be or rather become a man. In this case a man conflicted and torn because of his sexual preference. One that goes back to a couple of things, including one inciting incident that some might say has not much of a pay out at the end. But does it always have to have one? Also the ""not"" pay out works fine for the movie.The acting is really good and while the movie is raw this can work in favor of it for the viewer or against it. It does have a neat structure and it really messed with your head. Our main character may not speak a lot, but that's how the character works. And it works ..."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2017,7/10,"I've read a host of glowing reviews for this film, but at heart it's a story of a troubled young boy who grows into a troubled teenager, and finally into a troubled and conflicted adult. If one were to be honest, the film is a depressing indictment of growing up with a crack addicted mother and no father on hand to guide the youngster through the perils of the gang and drug culture prevalent in his neighborhood. In that regard, the character I admired most here was the local drug dealer Juan, ably portrayed by Mahershala Ali. But when I say admire, it's not because he was a fine, upstanding citizen, but someone who could draw on experiences from his own past to try and connect with Little (Alex Hibbert), and help him navigate the turmoil of his lousy family life and the torment of getting bullied at school.What didn't come across as realistic to me was Little's own concept of being gay. I know kids grow up fast these days, but how does a nine or ten year old confront their own sexuality at that age. I guess this is where my fuddy-duddy way of thinking enters the picture, at that age I didn't think in terms of liking other boys or girls in that way. But then again, one wasn't inundated with the kind of explicit material in the Fifties the way kids growing up today are, whether inadvertently or on purpose.With the story taking significant jumps in time, the viewer has to fill in a lot of blanks on your own. The chapter dealing with Chiron's (Ashton Sanders) taking a chair to the bully kid left me looking for a resolution to the assault charge he would inevitably have to deal with. Because the picture doesn't deal with the aftermath, it almost feels like Chiron got away with it, except for being hauled off by the cops. I would like to have known the outcome of that event.When ""Brokeback Mountain"" broke new ground in the film industry, I thought it dealt with the subject of homosexuality in a generally mature way without a lot of sensationalism. It had it's one scene, and this film does too, and for many the discomfort level will be palpable. To my mind, that's when Chiron became a real victim of his environment, unable to confront his own feelings and urges, with the rest of his life heading toward one of conflicted unhappiness. As the adult Black (Trevante Rhodes), that pain and sorrow emerges when he sees his former friend Kevin (Andre Holland) and ruefully asks, ""Why did you call me?"""
MOONLIGHT,2 April 2017,10/10,"You might have only heard of Barry Jenkins's ""Moonlight"" from the goof at the Academy Awards. But you have to see it. This story of a gay black youth's coming of age is one intense movie. I haven't seen most of the Best Picture nominees, but I'd say that this is probably the most important story told in 2016's cinema (I'm not interested in ""La La Land""). Even if you don't end up liking this movie, you should still watch it just to understand what a person can go through when he has all strikes against him (in this case poverty, racism and homophobia).The movie isn't the ultimate masterpiece, but it is a good movie. Probably was the year's best movie. I recommend it.PriceWaterhouseCoopers is going to be forever known as the company that made Faye Dunaway say the wrong thing."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,10/10,"I'm always interested during Awards Season to see the films with the most nominations in the three big ceremonies, this was one of those films getting the most attention, and one I was looking forward to watching the most, because of its critical acclaim. Basically it tells the story of Chiron from childhood to adulthood, in three parts of his life, as a young adolescence, as a pubescent teenager, and as a man. i. Little - Chiron, nicknamed Little (Alex R. Hibbert), is a shy and withdrawn child. He is found hiding from bullies by crack cocaine dealer Juan (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Mahershala Ali), with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e) they help Chiron to open up. Chiron lives with his emotionally abusive mother Paula (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Naomie Harris), but Chiron finds companionship with school friend Kevin (Jaden Piner), and he continues to see Juan, who teaches him to swim and gives him advice. Juan catches Paula smoking crack, he is angry at her using it, but she retaliates reminding him that he sells it, she takes her anger out on Chiron. The next day, Chiron visits Juan and Teresa, telling how he hates his mother, he asks a question regarding his sexuality, and also about drugs, Juan admits he sells drugs, Chiron leaves, Juan hangs his dead in shame. ii. Chiron - Now a teenager, Chiron (Ashton Sanders) experiences frequent bullying, especially from Terrel (Patrick Decile), and he remains close to Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). Paula is now addicted to crack, prostitutes herself and begs Chiron for money, which is given to him by Teresa, who he continues to visit, Juan is dead. One night, Chiron and Kevin stop at the beach near his house to smoke a blunt, they discuss their life ambitions and why Kevin gives Chiron the nickname ""Black"", in a charged moment they share a kiss, and Kevin gives Chiron a handjob. The next day, Kevin is forced by Terrel to beat up Chiron, until the bullies are chased away by security, Chiron does not reveal the identity of the attackers to a social worker, believing it won't solve anything. The following day, Chiron angrily attacks Terrel, smashing a chair on his back, he is subsequently arrested, he glares at Kevin as he is taken away in the police car. iii. Black - Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is now a hardened adult, he is a drug dealer going by the name ""Black"". Having left juvenile hall and moved up since starting dealing, he now lives outside Atlanta, in a similar condition to what Juan did. Chiron is constantly called by Paula who wants him to visit, then he is surprised by a call from Kevin (Andr√© Holland), who is working in Miami, he apologises for his actions as a teenager, and hopes Chiron will visit. The following day, Chiron visits his mother, she is now living in a drug treatment facility and regrets her past behaviour, they have a tense exchange, but Chiron forgives Paula. Chiron travels to Miami to reunite with Kevin, who is a server and cook in a restaurant, Chiron is reluctant to let Kevin speak or drink with him. They both head to Kevin's home, Kevin questions if things could have been different, but is happy with his life, Chiron admits Kevin is the only person he has been intimate with, they physically reconcile and tenderly embrace. The final shot of the film sees young Chiron playing in the ocean in the moonlight. The three actors playing the same character in the three stages, who just about look similar, are each compelling, Hibbert as the quiet boy, Sanders as the persecuted teen, and Rhodes as the hardened but emotionally scarred adult, Ali is brilliant as the drug dealer who becomes a tender father figure to the boy, and Harris is fantastic as the crack-addict mother. It is a beautiful film, it is so simple in its format, but equally as clever, it tackles the subjects of youth, poverty, sexuality, identity, drug use and some racism truthfully and brilliantly, the use of colour throughout is marvellous vivid, the music is wonderful, and it is intimately moving, it is just an extraordinary film, I would highly recommend it, a masterpiece drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year (after the ""envelopegate"" cock up where La La Land was wrongly announced as the winner) and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director for Barry Jenkins, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Nicholas Britell, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Outstanding!"
MOONLIGHT,28 January 2017,6/10,"Mahershala Ali gives a thoughtful, exquisite performance as a generally wise and kind-hearted drug dealer in Miami who takes a shine to a bullied black youngster in his neighborhood, one with no friends and a mother on crack. Unfortunately, the overreaching screenplay by director Barry Jenkins, from Tarell Alvin McCraney's original story, eliminates Ali's Juan from the narrative in its second chapter, wherein the frightened youngster has become a withdrawn teenager. It's understandable that Jenkins would choose to focus on the younger person's journey--the need for a dramatic story arc (i.e., the kind of thing they teach in screen writing classes)--but, as a teenager, the protagonist Chiron, still fighting the childhood nickname ""Little,"" hasn't progressed as a character to the point of retaining our sympathy (he's actually been stripped of character). As a director, Jenkins observes the quiet, wide-eyed boy with compassion, but he doesn't allow the teenage Chiron any personal growth (in his understated but direct way, Juan hopes to instill some of his philosophy in the child, which isn't rebuffed but neither is it utilized). The film's weakest link is Chiron's relationship to his mother (Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris), who comes on like a harried working mom but is soon revealed to be an irresponsible junkie (Harris is the Hollywood version of an addict: pearly-white teeth, clear skin and even clearer eyes). Movies about bullied people ask a lot from their audience; we squirm while they're being victimized, and we wait in frustration for them to defend themselves. When Chiron finally has had enough and fights back, he's not using the advice he's been given (what we've been privy to). Instead, Jenkins has him snap, lash out. Maybe this is realistic behavior, but it doesn't lend itself to a believable third act (which I felt was a little coy). Jenkins and his team probably felt (or, at least, hoped) they were treading new ground in their final act--with drama portrayed 'from the heart' and so on--but ""Moonlight"", though most certainly a noble film, doesn't hang together as a convincing portrait of one man's life. I kept wondering what happened to Ali; his Juan is the only person on-screen who seems to live outside the constricted dialogue. **1/2 from ****"
MOONLIGHT,14 April 2017,,"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. It won several awards including Best Picture.The story itself is based on the story ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" by Tarell Alvin McCraney. Both he and writer-director grew up similarly just a few blocks apart.The central character is Chiron, the story is presented in three parts ... when he was about 10, when he was about 17, and when he was about 27. The first part was coming to grips with his mother being an addict and a prostitute, the second with his accepting his homosexuality as a teenager, and the third as a young adult working in Atlanta, falling back on the street drug trade.It is a tough way to grow up but it illustrates that in this diverse world a young kid has unlimited directions he or she can take and the choices are heavily influenced by where he or she happens to be born. Life is one big crapshoot."
MOONLIGHT,29 October 2016,10/10,"Barry Jenkins is a fascinating storyteller, and in large part because of how he goes about being fascinated by his subject, how his camera roams at times, and at others when he knows to cut between his subjects. But most of all, he is a truly magnificent filmmaker because of how he so deftly finds universal themes from a place and people that is somewhat specific. This is a story about a boy who grows into a man - I'm tempted to call it the 'better, bigger, blacker-er Boyhood', though that's not totally the case - but he is also a boy growing up in a largely black, Southern, lower (middle?) class neighborhood, where it seems drugs are everywhere (including his own mother who is an addict) and no one can be ""soft"". And if you're gay, a ""f***ot?"" Watch out.I grew up in a town and in the public school system where it was predominantly black and brown and Hispanic, and it seemed like even having the slightest effeminate tendencies would make that one a subject for immediate ridicule (I was even picked on and I was pretty sure from a young age I wasn't gay, but was picked on so much for a moment almost though I was, it was that persistent). It may not be so different for white small towns or big cities or who knows what, but it's especially difficult for African-American men to come out. And yet if Moonlight was only about the gay issue then it would be interesting but not overly compelling. I think what Jenkins and his actors are communicating so strongly is being *so* isolated and without any options that it's about one's overall identity. Sex and attraction is a large component, but simply knowing who one is is a major struggle.Jenkins has some very big, emotional scenes in this film, which is told in three parts, in large part coming from the dynamic between the boy, called ""Little"" but actual named Chiron, and his mother (Naomie Harries, I mean, god damn she is amazing in this). However, the predominant mood here is one of subtlety, of a vision that is fairly ambitious but is more about the interior life of his protagonist, this boy having to navigate how he should be in a society that leaves little options to get out and be something more than a drug dealer or the like (eventually, both he and another friend character, Kevin, wind up in jail in-between parts 2 and 3. This can be a difficult way to make someone interesting, but there's so much truth from these young actors, especially the boy playing Chrion in middle-school age, that your heart pours out even more because of the restraint, because of the shyness that is hiding back an entire interior life that's more than what we can see: one of pain and want.The way Jenkins shoots everything gives characters and places an extra texture, how he'll show two people by a beach at night becoming closer together naturally over minutes that feel pregnant with meaning. To use the word 'sensitively drawn and performed' may be a clich√©, but sensitive is the only way I can think to describe it. This isn't to say it's melodramatic, far from it; when we get the bullies that come at Chiron, it feels raw and immediate, like something could pop and violence could erupt at any moment. Sometimes, it seems, it does. A small piece of advice is given to the boy by the drug dealing father-figure (no one else in his life fills that role, and he doesn't realize at first he is a dealer): no one can tell you who you are, you have to figure that out for yourself.When I first got out of the theater at the end, I was wondering if the ending was slightly abrupt, that things come to a conclusion somewhat not so much fast but there's something else. I think writing this review now, I was more touched and moved by the thought of 'I now want to see where this story goes, what happens now that Chrion has had this emotional breakthrough.' It's as subtle as many moments in this film, but there's a poetic side to it that is potent and you can almost touch it that it's so powerful. Moonlight is profound because it doesn't force anything, it lets those moments where things aren't said speak out loud, when characters share looks or someone looks away while another looks straight on at another person, or the movement of boys with one another, and you can fill in the gaps for yourself. It's also a look at the black experience that is both specific to that world but goes beyond that: if you've ever not known who you are in your life, if you've felt lost or abused or abandoned, this is a film for you."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,9/10,"So after last week's mixup at the Oscars in which La La Land was originally announced as Best Picture by Faye Dunaway before one of the Price Waterhouse Coopers representatives gave one of the LLL producers the right one and he then showed the correct card on camera, it revealed once and for all that the one I'm now reviewing is the one that won. A story of a black boy/man growing up gay and being bullied for his withdrawn personality and his eventual struggles with also a drugged-out mom-among other things-I'll just say this was quite a mostly compelling drama with sequences that make it hard to predict what will happen as it goes on its narrative. Mahershala Ali deserved his Best Supporting Actor award for the beginning scenes and Naomie Harris also deserved her Best Supporting Actress nod. I really don't want to reveal anymore, just that me and my movie theatre-working friend highly recommend Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2017,,"This film tells the story of a young boy growing up in a rough neighbourhood. His mother only cares about taking illegal drugs, and he is bullied at school for being the small, shy and sensitive boy. We get to see his personal journey of growing up, and the adult he turns into.""Moonlight"" is a personal story which has an obvious external layer that is passively received by the viewers, and an inner layer that has to be actively felt by the viewers. Chiron's inner emotions are not portrayed overtly, but it makes its presence known. It is a beautiful story. I had no idea the film would end the way it did, hence the impact is maximised for me."
MOONLIGHT,27 January 2017,6/10,"This comes with a lot of hype and awards buzz . There is a danger of instantly dismissing it on the grounds of guilt that came with last year Oscar controversy but on its own terms MOONLIGHT is a relatively well made , subtly acted drama . The downside is that it's probably no more than that You've seen this type of movie before of a child on the brink of adolescence finds himself an outsider in a rough part of society , not too different from John Singleton's 1991 film BOYZ IN THE HOOD . Perhaps somewhat conscious of this director Barry Jenkins shoots the film in a rather poetic way at odds with a gritty realist storyline . This does lead to a problem in that the film becomes somewhat aloof and ultimately uninvolving which is a pity because I wanted to be grabbed by the narrative and the characters contained within it . As it stands MOONLIGHT will probably be the film to pick up 8 Oscar nods butt go home empty handed after the ceremonyUpdate Feb 2017 . So my prediction was wrong ? Sue me"
MOONLIGHT,24 July 2018,9/10,"Altogether a memorable, solidly made film, the 2017 Oscar winning Best Picture ""Moonlight"" has little to distinguish it from the other nominees in the same category of Best Picture aside from its LGBQT content. Despite strong performances by a uniformly gifted cast, director Barry Jenkins' second feature-length film (everything else has been classified as a 'short') looks and sounds familiar. We have another African-American drama high school set in the inner city (Liberty City) of the thriving metropolis of Miami, Florida, and the underdog protagonist Chiron is the product of a broken home who suffers mercilessly at the hand of intimidating bullies. Chiron's mother is just as heartless as the school bullies who harass him without let-up. Predictably, the moment he retaliates against his chief adversary Terrell (newcomer Patrick Decile), our protagonist finds himself clapped into handcuffs and packed off to prison. Sometimes, stories like this appall me, because the lead character-Chiron (variously played at different ages by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and eventually Trevante Rhodes), has found life a challenge from the start and ordeal in progress. To say that Chiron has been treated unfairly is an understatement. Ironically, prison seems to be a break for him because it regenerates him into a strong, intelligent, perceptive man. Meantime, Chiron's single-mother Paula (beautifully played by a dolled-down Naomie Harris of ""Spectre"") is addicted to crack and spends time with a variety of men, often driving Chiron away from home to fend for himself. Briefly, Chiron finds a father figure in a Cuban dope dealer, Juan (Mahershala Ali of ""Hidden Figures""), who takes him in with his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e of ""Hidden Figures"") and raises him during the moments that he has with him. For example, Juan advises Chiron to never sit with his back to a door because he won't know who is sneaking up behind him. Unfortunately, Chiron is as clueless about this as he is about life in general. He knows that the other kids at school ridicule him and want to use him as a punching bag. Eventually, one truculent student Terrel (newcomer Patrick Decile) compels Chiron's best friend in high school, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) to unload on him in the playground, knocking him down three times while everybody else watches but nobody says anything. What bothers Chiron the most is the word 'faggot,' and Juan tells him frankly what it means. ""A faggot is... a word used to make gay people feel bad,"" Juan explains. Nevertheless, Juan adds, ""You can be gay, but you don't have to let nobody call you a faggot."" Eventually, a hopelessly confused Chiron has his first sexual encounter with an apparently heterosexual friend, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) and later feels betrayed when Kevin slugs him thrice at Terrel's insistence. ""Moonlight"" occurs in three phases of Chiron life. First, he is an adolescent dealing with his hateful mother. Second, he is a high school student struggling for help. Third, he is a grown man with a body like Hercules. For the sake of closure, Jenkins doesn't tell us what happened to Terrel. We see him sprawled in the floor of the classroom after Chiron has shattered a chair across his back. The moment that Chiron resorts to physical violence to attack Terrel was one of the more liberating moments in ""Moonlight."" Despite everything that Chiron suffers through from homeless to prison, he emerges as a self-aware individual who doesn't behave like a domino pushing others around because he had been pushed around.""Moonlight"" is a good film, but it is not a great film. The Best Picture Oscar ""Moonlight"" took home virtually guarantees that this social melodrama will never be forgotten. Academy had shunned African-Americans in previous years. Mahershala Ali deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his quiet, restrained performance. The third Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay by Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney, based on his previously unpublished play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" is deserved, too. According to reports, Jenkins and McCraney both attended the same schools in Liberty City, but they were not friends at the time. Although the film concerns controversial subject matter, Jenkins never shows any overt sexual scenes with nudity, apart from a kiss between Kevin and Chiron and the groans of orgasm when they sit together."
MOONLIGHT,29 April 2017,7/10,"Chiron is an African-American child, growing up in Miami. Neglected by his mother, he is effectively raised by a drug-dealer, Juan, and his girlfriend, Teresa. Due to his passive ways he is often a target for bullies. Onto his teenage years and the bullying continues. All this time he has one true friend - Kevin - and the relationship between Chiron and Kevin ultimately forms the spine of the story.Good drama about growing up, the relationships we form and how these are carried over into adult life. More specifically, the experience of a gay African-American child, the issues faced in growing up and how this shapes his life and relationships.A bit underwhelming though, especially considering that this movie won the 2017 Best Picture Oscar. The themes don't feel fully formed, leaving the movie feeling not overly profound. Ending is quite anticlimactic, when it should have been very emotional.The main problem is that writer-director Barry Jenkins concentrates more on the bigger picture, and fitting as much of Chiron's history into a certain amount of time. More character and relationship details were needed. A slower progression was in order - the first two periods of Chiron's life seems rushed and we are just fed the story without having time to contemplate on it. Not often I say this: the movie needed to be longer, about 30 minutes longer.This all said, the story is original and engaging. It is never dull - as mentioned, if anything, it moves too quickly. It just needed more substance."
MOONLIGHT,6 December 2016,8/10,". . . that White House Resident-Elect Donald J. Duck's description of Inner-City Black Ghetto America as being, quote, ""A disaster; they have nothing; it just sad, so sad,"" unquote, could not be more WRONG. When Chiron, aka Little, aka, Black, finally gives in to the temptation to play musical chairs at his high school, you'll surely stand up and cheer, as did the vast majority of my 99%-White Theater Audience. Speaking of Whites, there are absolutely NO European-American speaking parts in MOONLIGHT, which is the main reason that it is the Prohibitive Favorite to snag this year's Top Oscar, according to Oscarssoblack. Brad Pitt, as an executive producer, seems to be about the only Pale-face connected to MOONLIGHT (but now that he's dumped his baby mom Angelina Jolie, Bill Clinton has welcomed Brad into his Blacks Like Me Club). Some Myopic Folks might accuse MOONLIGHT of being rife with Product Placement for Rosetta Stone's latest edition of Eubonics material, or for jumping onto the All-Gay, Every Day Bandwagon, but such Deplorable Quibblers are probably just Trumpsters."
MOONLIGHT,17 February 2017,10/10,"MOONLIGHT (2016) **** Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes, Mahershala Ali, Janelle Monaie, Naomi Harris, Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, Andre Holland. Powerful, poignant and compelling three act harmony portrait of a young, black gay boy from adolescence thru adulthood while experiencing trauma, self-reflection and finally acceptance is enhanced by strong acting by the three actors portraying Chiron (Hibbert, Sanders and Rhodes). Kudos as well to an amazingly realized ensemble cast including Ali in an Oscar-worthy turn as Chiron's mentor and father figure (truly complex turn), Monaie as his mother figure and Harris as his crack-addled mother (hauntingly heartbreaking and equally worthy of an Oscar). Gorgeously shot by James Laxton and wonderfully scored by Nicholas Britell. Filmmaker Barry Jenkins, who co-scripted with Tarell Alvin McCraney, delivers an important film about neglect, family, social strata's life falling thru the cracks and finally love. One of the year's best."
MOONLIGHT,28 November 2016,9/10,"""Moonlight"" may very well be a breath of fresh air to others who are tired to death of our culture's obsession with labeling and categorizing everything in an attempt to understand it. If it can't be easily categorized, it's either frightening and something to be opposed to, or it's abnormal and therefore something to be marginalized.The main conflict at the heart of ""Moonlight,"" a beautiful movie about a young black man's coming of age in poor and drug-afflicted Miami, is our protagonist's inability to define himself in terms that his environment will allow. He doesn't fit into any of the categories available to him, so he sets out to force himself into one that seems like the best option. His name is Chiron, and the movie shows him to us at three stages of his life, portrayed by three different but wonderful actors. As a little boy, he struggles with loneliness and neglect thanks to a crack-addicted mom (played by Naomie Harris) and takes to the first person who offers to be a father figure to him. In a Dickensian twist, this person happens to be a drug dealer who nevertheless offers him sympathy and understanding not to be found anywhere else. The middle section depicts Chiron as a young man navigating his emerging homosexuality and the high school bullying that goes along with it. In the film's final and most breathtaking sequence, we follow Chiron as a man in his twenties to a reunion with a high school friend who gave him his first gay experience and whom he's never been able to completely move on from. This entire sequence is directed, written, and acted with utmost delicacy.I can't think of a movie in recent memory that puts loneliness and anguish on screen more effectively than ""Moonlight."" It's a movie that asks us to see life from the perspective of a very specific individual but then draws universal conclusions from it that makes the superficial differences between him and the viewer (I'm not black, I'm not gay, I didn't grow up in a poor urban environment) melt away until you feel deep compassion and sympathy for a fellow human being who is doing what we all are -- navigating the complexities of living on this world and making the best of it we can.Grade: A"
MOONLIGHT,27 December 2018,7/10,"The title Moonlight alludes to the idea of being Moonstruck / the Luna (or Lunatic) - believed to be different / weird / out-of-the-norm / not behaving ""Normally"". Throughout the film Chiron is alienated for being different. He doesn't relate to the other boys who like to roughhouse, and bully, and fight and such. He's more passive, and shy, and insecure. He's a black kid in America who is impoverished, so much so that a decent meal is something he truly treasures. And to top it all off, he's coming to realize that he is gay as he's coming of age. And so do the other kids and so does his mother, who is a nurse who is slowly becoming a drug addict.A friendly kid, Kevin, advises him how to blend in by acting tough, going as far as to nickname him ""Black"". Chiron's adult friend Juan, a drug dealer of all things, tells him an anecdote: ""In moonlight, black boys look blue. That's what I'm gonna call you: Blue."" then surmises ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you"".But Chiron takes that advice the wrong way as the last chapter is ""Black"". As we see what he's become it's clear it's all just a put-on. It's not him at all. In fact, it's no accident he dresses just like Juan. Appearance matters to him so much he spends a minute combing non existent hair before he goes into a restaurant. He puts up a front and appears tough but the facade crumbles as soon as his friend calls him and when he speaks to his mom.Thus the film is split into three segments of Chiron's life. The first is the introduction to him and what he learns about his place in the world. The second is the moment in his life where he must decide to be either ""Black"" or ""Blue"" (Be something he is not and fight back, or stay down and walk away). And the third is his realization, that he is truly ""Blue"", no matter how ""Black"" he can pretend to be on the surface (with a goofy mouth grill and bling).Under the Moonlight, on the starlit beach, above the vast cleansing water of the ocean, Chiron can find his true self coming to light.This is one of the more subtle Academy Award Best Picture winners, and it took a few viewings for me to get it. But I think it is worth those repeat viewings to do so."
MOONLIGHT,27 November 2016,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's uncertain whether writer/director Barry Jenkins has developed the story from Tarelle McCraney in order to highlight stereotypes, explain stereotypes, or both. The interpretation is up to the viewer, but what's clear is that the film is one of the most sensitive portraits we've seen of growing up young, black, and sexually confused, while being mostly neglected by a drug-addicted mother.Told in standard triptych structure, the film chronicles 3 stages in the life of a young male, with the chapters titled Little ‚Äì Chiron ‚Äì Black, for the names he is known by at each stage. As a 9 year old boy, ""Little"" (a nickname due to his small stature) is a wide-eyed near-mute who gets bullied and called names by the bigger boys. It's at this stage where he is taken under the wing of local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), who offers a ""safe place"" to sleep and eat, with the bonus of swimming lessons accentuated by life lessons from Juan and his understanding girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monea). It's a poignant and painful moment when Little connects the dots between his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan.As a high school adolescent, Chiron is now a nervous, totally-withdrawn kid who simply doesn't fit in ‚Äì and doesn't understand why. His high-crime Miami neighborhood is even more dangerous for him now as the schoolyard bullying is often accompanied by violent behavior. His surrogate father figure Juan is no longer in the picture, but Teresa is still there for him ‚Äì always at the ready with a meal, clean sheets, and a spoonful of wisdom.the final chapter, we catch up with a hardened ""Black"" (another nickname) 10 years after high school followed by a stint in prison. He has moved from his Miami roots, and it's at this stage where we fully understand the influence of a role model on a boy who has few. When he reconnects with childhood buddy Kevin, we see the shredded remnants of young ""Little"" still present in the older, experienced ""Black"". This circle of life is understandable, while at the same time being nearly unbearable.In addition to Mr. Ali and Ms. Monea (both who are excellent in the upcoming Hidden Figures), and the standout work of Ms. Harris, the six actors who play Chiron and Kevin through the years are fascinating to watch. Alex Hibbert perfectly captures the confused ""Little"". Ashton Sanders plays the awkward, dreading-each-day Chiron; and Trevante Rhodes (former University of Texas athlete) plays the adult ""Black"" with a quiet uneasiness that resonates on screen. The 3 Kevin actors are Jaden Piner, Jharell Jerome, and Andre Holland (a standout as the adult Kevin).Beautifully filmed in all three segments by cinematographer James Laxton, the film reiterates the importance of role models, especially in the life of those whose path seems pre-ordained by circumstance. The harsh realities of drug addiction, absentee parents, schoolyard bullying, and the almost inevitable stint behind bars are contrasted with a plate of fries, the chef's special from an old friend, and the soothing effects of sand and sea. Encouraging our kids to be true to themselves is a lesson that can fall on deaf ears when surviving the moment is first and foremost. This incredibly sensitive film is likely either a necessary reminder or an eye-opening education ¬Ö depending on your own situation."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,10/10,"Much of the impact of this superb film is the ensemble feeling among the writers Tarell Alvin McCraney and Barry Jenkins (who also is the exceptional director), the entire cast, the cinematography of James Laxton, the musical score by Nicholas Britell (with a bit of help from Mozart et al), and all the crew that is responsible for this exemplary film. It restores faith in the artistic community voting to see that it won the Oscar for Best Picture ‚Äì perhaps there is truly hope for meaningful films to continue to be made despite the public's obsession with Marvel comics and cartoons and paranormal stories. For a film to so successfully survey a period of time, of coming of age, of racial factors, of same sex issues, of bullying of young children because they are different, of drug abuse, family disintegration and of redemption and hope is a major feat and the entire company of MOONLIGHT deserves honor.Without seeming to be a gimmick, the film follows the life of one Black American through young adolescence, mid-teen and young adult. A child, Chiron aka Little (Alex R. Hibbert) lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula (Naomie Harris) in a crime- ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin (Jaden Piner), Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali), who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e), whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself. The actors who portray the teenage Chiron (Ashton Sanders), the teenage Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) as well as the adult Chiron/Black (Trevante Rhodes) and the adult Kevin (Andr√© Holland) are outstanding ‚Äì the final scene between Black and Kevin is completely unforgettable. This film is not only engrossing in the brilliance of the production, but it also carries so many important messages that represent a significant advance in the purpose of making films. Outstanding achievement on every level."
MOONLIGHT,20 June 2017,6/10,"I would expect from an Oscar winning movie that it is going to be mindblowing, certainly when you see the amount of good movies that are available now. It has to be better than all those ones. But unfortunately Moonlight isn't. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad movie. The actors are all good, the shooting of the movie is good, and even the story is good. But it's a bit too slow, and it definitely lacks of action, just to spice it up a little bit. Okay it's not an action movie but it could have used an extra punch to make it more interesting. All the different actors playing Chiron were good so I can't complain about them. But as an Oscar movie I think it's just overrated. I really hoped it would be better but it wasn't. But to watch once it's an okay movie."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,,"In the bonus segment of the DVD of ""Moonlight,"" it becomes apparent that writer-director Barry Jenkins was the true star of this brilliant independent film.Jenkins' choices in casting and his work with the actors paid dividends in an ambitious chronicle of the life of a young man named Chiron. The challenge of the film was to dramatize the life of Chiron at ages 11, 17, and 25. Three actors were cast, and they never rehearsed or saw film footage of the other performers' interpretation of the role. Somehow, Jenkins made this biographical drama a seamless one as fourteen years passed.Beyond the technical challenges of the film, there was the challenge of developing many themes around the conceit of ""coming of age"" for the young man. Themes of crime, drug use, family dysfunction, violence at school, and sexual identity were woven together in the narrative. Once again, the multi-faceted issues were deftly handled by director Jenkins.The ensemble cast of ""Moonlight"" was stellar. But the standout performance was that of Mahershala Ali, who played the role of Juan, a drug dealer in Miami. Juan takes the eleven-year-old protagonist under his wing to provide both parental and spiritual direction in his life.In the closing section of the film, it is clear that Chiron was superficially modeling his life on the souped-up classic vehicle driven by Juan. Somehow, he found a similar, wide-bodied vehicle. But, on a deeper internal level, the positive guidance provided by Juan was having a long-term effect on the young man. While the film's ending may be ambivalent about Chiron's future, it does appear that Chiron had connected with the soulful expression of Juan that might prove to be a turning point in shaping the next chapter of his life not addressed in the film."
MOONLIGHT,17 January 2017,10/10,"Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, 'Moonlight', Written and Directed by Barry Jenkins, is a film, that uses Cinema as a Weapon to deliver a strong & timely message to its viewer. And this dramatic film, not only pushes Cinema to its supreme, but comes across as equally as important. Jenkins, tackles a subject so disturbing & real, you'd have to be inhuman to not to feel for its characters. Its a Taut & Vivid film, that demands our attention.'Moonlight' is A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, 'Moonlight' chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighborhood of Miami.'Moonlight' is about finding your place in the world. You can black, white, a heterosexual or a homosexual, but you need to make that space for yourself, despite all the odds. We watch Chiron, our protagonist, (played by 3 wonderful actors - Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders & Trevante Rhodes, in different ages) struggle with the unforgiving surroundings & face constant bullying, as well as a reckless mother & a society pressured by masculinity. Jenkins hits you in the gut & asks you ask ""why hate, when you always have the option to love? And why is one over judged for being who him/her maybe? Jenkins chooses a theme so timely & disturbing, I found myself emotionally exhausted by the time the protagonist grows up & comes to terms with his life. This is a highly dramatic film, about the odds one has to face. Jenkins' Adapted Screenplay is strong. The Writing explores the journey of a troubled individual with feeling & the relentlessness of life. Jenkins' Direction, on the other-hand, is terrific. He has handled this important & staggeringly sad story, with rare command. Jenkins has certainly topped himself here & 'Moonlight' is a film that will be remembered for a long time. Oscar Chase is sure to happen next month.James Laxton's Cinematography captures the complexity of the atmosphere, fabulously. Joi McMillon & Nat Sanders's Editing is well-done. Nicholas Britell's Score is fantastic. Art & Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders & Trevante Rhodes bring Chiron to life. All the 3 actors, are top-notch! But the film belongs to Mahershala Ali. Despite limited screen-time, Ali is monumental in his portrayal of a man who does bad to the society & yet finds his humanity to help a boy. The Academy better do him proud. Naomie Harris is very effective as the reckless & drug-addicted mother. Janelle Mon√°e is wonderful in a brief role. Andr√© Holland is natural to the core. On the whole, 'Moonlight' is not to be missed. Its an important film, that's been told magnificently. Two Thumbs Up!"
MOONLIGHT,8 November 2016,,"""At some point you've got to decide for yourself who you gonna be. And let nobody make that decision."" Juan (Mahershala Ali)Because I favor minimalist drama to florid or overheated melodrama, Moonlight fits my needs perfectly. The story is about a kid, then as a teen, then as an adult, somewhat like Richard Linklater's Boyhood in its sweep of a young man's life. Only this story is more unusual, originally created by Tarell Alvin McCrane in short story form called In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.Little or Chiron (Alex R. Hibbert) is indeed a little adolescent finding out slowly his sexuality is not like most other boys'. He's black and gay while barely knowing it; what he does know is that the bullies know and pursue and persecute him for being different.The first of the three sections deals with his unfavorable youth (druggie mom and absent dad) and his favorable association with kind adult Juan, who gives Little love and life lessons but who has a dark secret waiting to explode. Little is learning about love in its many forms, and he's better for that discovery. Life proving to be a mixed bag of good and bad is a strength of this film.In his teen years, Chiron's (Ashton Sanders) segment begins to lag as nothing new occurs including the lingering bullying from a dread-locked antagonist. Yet the moment of gay connection occurs with Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) in a love scene of such delicacy that other directors could take lessons in this sensual minimalism.Finally as an adult, Chiron (Trevante Rhodes), now called ""Black,"" drives a vintage sedan just as his early adult friend, Juan, did and becomes a dealer like Juan. He even physically resembles the ripped and low-key Juan. Indeed Black is not the weak kid we knew through two thirds of the film. Writer/director Barry Jenkins has done the magic of character arc-making, for Black is gentle and lonely the way Juan didn't seem to be. As the arc gently goes down, with repeated plays of Aretha Franklin's One Step Ahead, so does Kevin (now as an adult played by Andre Holland) become again the vulnerable but now stronger Little grown up. His life is not as we might have hoped it to be, but what it is, it is: minimal and with goodness he always had.Moonlight bathes itself in small moments of love and coming of age. Through it all the director has kept Little's character intact and our attention locked into a narrative with enormous wealth. Moonlight is one of the best films of the year; I hope Oscar is paying attention."
MOONLIGHT,19 November 2016,8/10,"Director Barry Jenkins is one that I've never really heard of, but here I've just checked out his latest the character study film called ""Moonlight"", and I was pretty well pleased. It shows and proves that many people develop from their past experiences and they are indeed products of their environment. As with people and life it's simply a passage a journey of time and discovery.""Moonlight"" is broken into three different chapters as it looks at the life of Chiron a young black boy from a little boy growing up all the way up to an adult. I'm sure all of us remember someone growing up from our past that was picked on or bullied as a kid or who grew up with a single parent the way that Chiron did.Chiron's a little black boy who's growing up in the rough slum projects of the Miami, Florida streets and he's doomed from the start by having a crack addicted mom and he's never known his father. In fact Chiron's only direction is that from the local street drug dealer named Juan(Mahershala Ali).Plus Chiron is shy and timid he has a stutter problem and he's bullied and picked on at school he's beat up on quite often. As Chiron grows more self discovery and identity is formed especially sexually as Chiron discovers he's gay.More touching is how we see Chiron as a grown man in the end as the final scenes take him back to it all with memories and thoughts of how he was shaped and molded as an adult. Overall well done film of character development and it shows how people are products of their environment and the people that surround them have influence over them just like in Chiron's case."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,8/10,"In an exigent movement to redress the prevailing ""Oscar so white"" controversy in past years, indie filmmaker Barry Jenkins' second feature MOONLIGHT, a Bildungsroman about a black gay boy growing up in Miami, has received unanimous adulation from the critics since the onset of this awards season, as the apotheosis of American cinema in 2016, after Nate Parker's Sundance hit THE BIRTH OF A NATION (2016) being damningly scuttled by the re-surface of the director/star's erstwhile involvement of a rape charge. Cropping up in the right time with a quirk of good fortune, MOONLIGHT becomes the ""chosen one"", the go-to recipient of all the laurels and attention with both guilt-ridden and progressive voters alike, as a result, it is heaped with 8 Oscar nominations and it will not go home empty- handedly, but its chance to dethrone LA LA LAND (2016) for the top honor has been on the wane, mostly because of Theodore Melfi's HIDDEN FIGURES (2016), a late-comer, but massively successful in the box office front, headlined by a triad of black actresses, will inevitably split the votes and even supersede MOONLIGHT as everyone's favourite atonement pick (as SAG awards manifest). As if knowingly constructing its story as a black-version of Richard Linklater's all-white BOYHOOD (2014), MOONLIGHT doesn't have its luxury to capture the real sense of time-passing, but opts for a trichotomous strategy by casting three different actors to play our leading character Chiron from a small child (Hibbert), to a high-schooler (Sanders), and finally an adult (Rhodes). Ghettoized in an exclusively dark-skinned milieu where school bullies, drug dealers are his daily-to-daily encounters, plus a perennially drug-addled mother (Harris) hovering at home, Chiron's formative influences encompass his parents surrogate: the avuncular cracker pusher Juan (Ali) and his sensible girlfriend Teresa (Mon√°e) and his best friend Kevin (correspondently played by three different actors: Piner, Jerome and Holland), who will later engender his sexual awakening. Jenkins doesn't put any of these controversial issues under the spotlight, not his sexuality, not his race, and Chiron and his bullies have the same skin color, let alone allowing any subplots from the subservient characters, Juan, as much as a pivotal figure in Chiron's life, who simply disappears after the first chapter, and his premature demise would only be passingly referred in the next chapter; so is Kevin, much of his backstory vanishes into void. Ali and Harris are bestowed with career-boosting Oscar-nominations, yet in my book, as charmingly affirming as Juan is, the former remains only the second best among its male cast (after Hibbert, an enthralling discovery for his searing intensity in his almost wordless incarnation), and the latter is benefited from a showier character arc, Harris compellingly proves that she is a force to be reckoned with in her unflinching effort to bring honesty to her repugnant screen avatar in all three stages of Chiron's life. Jenkin has a particularly keen eye to transmit an aesthetic palette against the quotidian surroundings and a slithering camera-work doesn't hurt either, which render an artistically beguiling flair to elicit a transcendent atmosphere (blue is indeed the warmest color) around the film's unerring subject, Chiron and Chiron only, whose most salient attribute is his taciturnity, depicted with disparaging impact - the youngster Hibbert's fixated glance is soul-stirring, whereas a rangy Sanders and a beefy Rhodes gear it up to gnawing distress and a charade of social impediment respectively, which precipitates a natural barrier between him and the audience since most of the time, we are dangled to outguess his much internalized emotional morass, but the outcome often leans towards a frustrating side, there is not much zest in him to keep us hooked although it is a frank tack to portray him like that, one must do love human race to really and deeply care about a character like Chiron, that's one of the reasons why the film has become a word-of-mouth favourite apart from its obvious political correctness, no one wants to be labelled as a misanthrope, still, hyping it up as ""the"" best American film of the year can only hurt its cachet, someone must dare to be the devil's advocate and say it out loud!"
MOONLIGHT,21 January 2017,8/10,"I personally think this film is getting the praise it does because of the subject matter. I think it's a really good movie, but not something that is mind-blowing or amazing. When it comes to the acting and the character development is solid. I thought the actors that played the character Chiron all put a lot into this role. Everything, when it comes to the characters to the interactions all seemed very believable. All 3 actors put on amazing performances as a character that is withdrawn and sensitive. Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Janelle Mon√°e and Andr√© Holland are all fantastic in this as these. What hit me the most was how it showed how very sensitive people are treated in a insensitive world. And how having sympathy and empathy for others can be tough when it comes to being in a harsh environments like the hood. Despite the film taking place in the hood, it has orchestral scores instead of gangster rap music which fits when it comes to the context of the story. It's a coming of age movie of how the environment and relationships can have an affect on someone. How struggles and obstacles can shape people and how sometimes people try to hide their sensitivity in order to survive. Overall this is a harsh and yet heartfelt movie that I don't regret seeing.8/10"
MOONLIGHT,30 November 2016,9/10,"'MOONLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This critical darling, and Oscar hopeful, stands as one of the very best reviewed movies of 2016; and it will likely earn multiple Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture). The drama film tells the story of a young black man growing up in a crime-ridden section of Miami; it chronicles his life from childhood to early adulthood, by covering three different stages of his life. Three different actors play the lead role (in these three sections of the movie); Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders and Alex Hibbert. The film also costars Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Andre Holland, Janelle Monae, Jharrel Jerome, Jaden Piner and Patrick Decile. It was written and directed by Barry Jenkins (from a story by Tarell McCraney). I think the film is a flawed, but near masterpiece; it's almost as good as the critics rave it to be.As a child Chiron (Hibbert), who's nicknamed 'Little', has to grow up in a rough neighborhood of Miami; while also dealing with his crack addicted mother, Paula (Harris). Chiron is very small in size, and he's also very shy and introverted. For this reason he's severely picked on by other children in the neighborhood, and he hardly talks to anyone. Another kid at school, named Kevin (Piner), befriends him though; and so does a local drug dealer, named Juan (Ali), and his girlfriend Teresa (Monae). The movie also covers Chiron's difficulties with life as a teenager (Sanders), and as a young adult (Rhodes); who's then become a somewhat hardened drug dealer, as well. I think the film is beautifully directed (and written) by Jenkins. The performances are all very powerful, and emotional, as well; especially Ali, in his scene-stealing supporting turn. What I most like about the movie though is it's stunning cinematography, striking music, and superbly effective editing; also (of course) the fact that I could really relate to the lead character. I have very much been an introverted outcast for much of my life; and I've also suffered from different, but in many ways similar (as well), adversity. The only thing I was a little disappointed with, about the film, is it's third chapter. I think the actor was miscast; and the character didn't seem to match the same character, from earlier in the film. I can see what Jenkins was trying to do with the story, but it didn't quite ring true to me.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM"
MOONLIGHT,18 January 2017,9/10,"That word: subtle is the best way to describe this fantastic movie. Well, that and REAL.Yes, this movie felt incredibly real and extremely subtle. It's what is not said that you feel every single emotion, where you want the characters to end up, when you want the pain to stop. It's nice, for once, to get a different perspective, new settings and characters to tell a coming out story. Especially from all the internal battles fought along the way. This did remind me some of Brokeback Mountain as some people cannot simply express their emotions as easy as most. (SEE: Internet.)I'm getting ahead of myself. The gist of the story tells the split-into- three tale of a boy, teen and adult who has to simultaneously deal with his druggie mom, being bullied, gangland and the inner turmoil of growing up gay. Despite this being fiction, this felt like a more real version of the so-called ""real-time"" Boyhood. The movie was shot perfectly ‚Äì gritty, artsy but grounded and with a great narrative. Again, it's the subtle scenes and lack of dialogue, mostly by the lead, ""Black"" or ""Little"" that make this engaging. The stages in this kid's life felt like this boy/teen/man are truly one and the same. Each actor plays the same role with complete continuity from the previous portrayal. If you're not homosexual or haven't yet come out from being closeted in your youth, you can still see the struggle in this character's life on what those who are have to endure¬Öamongst all the other obstacles all other humans have to overcome. ***Final thoughts: C'mon Academy. You WRONGFULLY snubbed Brokeback Mountain. I'm not just pushing this movie since it's a gay-themed film. It truly deserves it, just like Brokeback Mountain. Open your minds. Open your eyes. And for the love of GOD, stop homophobia. Take off the judgmental glasses and see a great film despite your own flaws."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,7/10,"I went into Moonlight afraid that I would find it too grim and upsetting, but ultimately, I didn't feel anything that strongly while watching the movie. I rarely felt bored, and the movie had some solid performances (the mom was great) and interesting moments, but it just never connected with me.So why didn't I love a movie the critics were ecstatic over? In part it's simply that I don't like episodic character studies; I like stories. Also, the movie is pretty deliberately paced.I sometimes suspect that some critics get very excited about movies based on what they're doing rather than what the movie is. This is a movie about a black kid growing up in poverty, and it's an unusual subject. It's also the rare movie where every single person you see on screen is black. It's my same explanation for Brokeback Mountain; I found it tedious, but critics thought it's bravery made it important even if it wasn't really that good a movie.On the other hand, my girlfriend, who is not a film critic, thought it was great. She described it as ""beautiful."" She found it deeply moving. So I probably shouldn't be too cynical about those who love this movie. Of course, people tend to like movies we can relate to, and movies about gay drug dealers or gay cowboys aren't that relatable to me. At the same time, I totally relate to getting bullied, so why didn't that part, at least, resonate with me? Anyway, I know it's important, I know it's well done, but I still can't understand the universal love for this movie."
MOONLIGHT,30 September 2017,7/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Chiron is a young kid, who grows up alone, bullied by the other kids, and with a crack addicted, neglectful mother in the shape of Paula (Naomie Harris.) Without a father figure in his life, he finds himself falling under the wing of Juan (Mahershala Ali), a local drug dealer who tries to give him a stable path to follow. His only other companion is Kevin, a kid from school, with whom he first begins to discover his feelings of homosexuality. Years later, when they reunite as adults after a testing falling out as kids, this experience will have a profound impact on their lives once again.In a world where the struggle for equality still seems to be raging, and creeping into as many diverse, unexpected areas as you can imagine, this year the Oscars got a taste of the pressure to acknowledge minority performers, which even a slip up with the auto-card couldn't undo. Although La La Land was received much more broadly, and had much more of a cultural impact among the masses, the Academy decided nonetheless the gong for Best Picture must go to this coming of age tale set in the black community, from writer Barry Jenkins, also making his feature length directorial debut.While LGBT rights are one of the main things the diversity crowd strive to push, it would still appear to be a taboo matter among the African American community, and Jenkins has certainly taken a brave step in making a film which highlights this matter to such a wide audience. He's managed to tell this young to old tale probably in a far more condensed way than many non-minority writer/directors would, and as such has maybe missed out on some extra potential his script may have possessed, leaving you with a film that perhaps doesn't hit the mark as much as it could have.You can see where it's going, but it's still a commendable enough effort, with a host of young and old black performers commanding their roles respectively. It's no black Brokeback Mountain, just an off-beat, distinctive film all of its own. ***"
MOONLIGHT,16 February 2017,7/10,"You have this little boy who's so enclosed by a secretive pain that it takes the patience of a Buddhist monk to pull out a word from him. Two adults he meet try to help him, a drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae)... the little boy, nicknamed ""little"", won't say a darn thing.But his silence doesn't matter because we know, we know ""little""'s problem; far from a little problem, especially in an environment that isn't all 'rainbow and sunshine' about it. That's a tough deal treated in a rather nuanced and tasteful way by Barry Jenkins. It starts with Kevin, Little's best friend encouraging him to be or act tougher, then you have 'comparative' games played by little boys and finally, the mother (Naomie Harris) who after being so hostile to Juan, reveals herself as a crack whore, not oblivious to the way her son ""walks"" and ""behaves"".It all comes down to that moment where Little asks Juan what a 'faggot' is, this is an emotional culmination and Juan's answer is just perfect. ""Little"" will have time to figure out what he is, but he sure ain't what that word describes, if anything, he'll be gay or he'll be whatever he wants to be. This is Juan's point, it's not about knowing what you are, but sticking to it once you know, because no one can change you, not without your consent anyway. When the first act ends, you know you're onto something very special. Then comes the second: Juan is gone, Teresa is still here and takes care of Little, now Chiron, like a real mother should do. And the real one is in an even worse shape than she was, she takes Chiron's money to do her stuff while Chiron must deal with bullies in school and they sure have grown up too. The teenage part is the best thing about ""Moonlight"" because it transcends the whole 'gay' issue and becomes a heartbreaking denunciation of bullying and harassment. And while not gay, I could relate to Chiron more than any other character from this year's movies, this is a guy, torn apart at a crucial time between homophobic thugs and even his mother who 'bullies' him on the basis that she's his mom, his blood, using emotional blackmail which is even more painful than fists. Naomie Harris does a terrific job in a rather ungrateful part but she's an essential element of Chiron's soul deterioration as she embodied the cruel reality that sometimes those who 'love' you harm you more in life than those who physically harm you. But Chiron will pay the biggest price to that lesson as a teen. He meets Kevin again who's a rather popular guy and whose taste for girls worked like the perfect decoy to his hidden homosexuality. When he encounters Chiron on the beach, there's a sweet and tender discussion that ends with an intimate contact, then you can see that something has just clicked in Chiron's mind, positively. But the day after, Kevin is asked to hit Chiron. The conflict is obvious, if he doesn't play the game, he blows his cover, if he does, he won't destroy Chiron's face but his heart as well... and soul. And Chiron's reaction is just the perfect response to mindless violence: he stands up and forces Kevin to hit him again, because he knows that's exactly what he fears. This moment has the emotional power of a climax and I couldn't believe it came halfway through the film. Teen Chiron was the soul of ""Moonlight"" because he was all 'torment and conflict' and the way he finally takes his revenge left me conflicted myself. I didn't know if I was supposed to gasp or cheer when he broke that chair on his bully. But at that time, you could tell his soul and faith in life were so shattered that it didn't matter. I think I felt sorry for him but deep inside, I thought he did the right thing. It derailed his life so much he became an adult full of muscle and confidence, everything I'm lacking. But was he still Chiron? The first two acts are nothing but masterpieces that could have been successful and acclaimed short movies if they were released alone... but the third act makes such a big leap in the time-line that Chiron feels like a whole new character. You could tell the teen and the kid were the same introverted and uncommunicative persons but adult Chiron could have belonged to any gangsta movie, so obviously, we're waiting for something to connect him with his past, and not just recalling memories. ""Moonlight"" is obviously intended as a coming-of-age story, but it doesn't really come in a satisfyingly full-circle way. All through this reunion with his friend Kevin, I was on-guard. For all I knew, Chiron could have wanted to kiss him as much as kill him, since he's partially responsible but it never really comes out from their talk, it's all about ""where have you been?"" and stuff of such trivial level that I kept my eye on the running time and expected something big to close Chiron's journey. I know life can be authentically anticlimactic but how about just confronting Kevin to his responsibilities and ask him: ""Why did you hit me?"".That says a lot when even the talk that used to be captivating leaves you cold. I expected more and I felt a bit let down. I also kept asking myself whether Mahershali Ali's performance was deserving all the hype. When Juan is gone, we have time to forget about him, and there are so many great performances you wonder why they picked that one, if anything, teen Chiron (Ashton Sanders) deserved a nod. So, this is a great movie for the two thirds, but the story never tops the emotional knock-out of the second act."
MOONLIGHT,28 November 2017,7/10,"This wonderfully shot and beautifully scored piece quietly yet passionately brings to life a soulful story which, even just a couple of years ago, wouldn't have graced our screens simply due to the diversity (of all kinds) it displays and ultimately promotes in its own low-key but important way. It isn't a loud or consistently exciting piece, even if a number of moments do successfully bridge that gap, but it is constantly engaging and plays to its realistic yet powerful performances. Unfortunately, due to its segmented structure, some key players don't get nearly as much screen time as they deserve (though this leads to the arrival of not one but three brilliant new leads who all play their role expertly) and, as such, don't always manage to resonate with the audience quite as much as they perhaps could. 7/10."
MOONLIGHT,13 February 2017,10/10,"""Moonlight"" arrives garlanded with prizes. It is, I am reliably told, the movie most likely to give ""La La Land"" a run for its money at this year's Oscars and a very fine movie, perhaps even a great movie, it is, too so why am I surprised at its success? Because ""Moonlight"" is not really a commercial film; it's an art-house movie that has crossed over into the mainstream, bolstered I have no doubt by the controversy over diversity. A year ago it might have slipped under the radar.It seems to me a deeply personal movie. I know nothing of the history of its writer/director Barry Jenkins but surely, I kept asking myself, there must be some element of autobiography at play here. It is the story of one man through three stages in his life; boyhood, his teenage years and as a man in his thirties and he is played, quite magnificently and seamlessly by three actors, (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes), through each chapter in his life. He is African-American and he is gay, though he never really acts on his sexuality so you can't say the picture 'accurately' reflects what it's like to be black and gay in America today.Perhaps a more accurate title would have been 'One Boy's Story' and on this level it works beautifully. This is an extraordinarily empathetic study and it's deeply moving. It's also a love story, a gay one I admit, yet almost totally devoid of sexual contact. Chiron, who is the central character, is in love with his best friend Kevin, who loves him back but in the macho world of African-American male culture, where your race and skin colour rather than your sexuality determine your path in life and the choices you make, neither boy is free to act on their feelings. Crime, violence and drug use seems to be the mark of a man if you're not white; even the sympathetic adult Juan, (a superb Mahershala Ali), who takes the boy under his wing, is a drug pusher and even with a drug addict for a mother, (an equally superb Naomie Harris), this is the path Chiron finally chooses for himself.On some levels, of course, this is a deeply depressing picture. There is little in the way of social uplift to be found. What it does have, however, is a depth of feeling that is overwhelming. Love, it would seem, conquers all if you are prepared to work at it and to wait. I came away from this film feeling hopeful, for Chiron, for Barry Jenkins and for cinema in general."
MOONLIGHT,5 February 2017,7/10,"Moonlight is such an important film, especially in 2017. There's no denying that it won't get as much attention as most films, and even most of the other Best Picture nominations, but you'd be hard pressed to find a film more fitting for people to view in this screwed up world we live in.Directed by Barry Jenkins and starring Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes as Little/Chiron/Black combined, Moonlight tells a story of self-discovery through the eyes of a young boy growing up in a harsh neighborhood where trouble always seems to come his way. I myself am not black nor am I gay, but Chiron is undeniably easy to connect with in spirit. Even if the world he lives in is a far cry from how I grew up, there's something to be said for vicariously going through experiences and hardships in a film and growing to understand their vantage point. I thought in that sense, Jenkins did a wonderful job of establishing a connection between the character and audience.The cast is notably getting universal praise and it's well-deserved. Mahershala Ali, in limited screen time, adds so much validity and charisma to Juan. In fact, when he departs as the film time jumps a near decade, it's missing something without his voice. Each actor who plays Chiron does a nice job as well, which calls for more credit towards Jenkins way. Although I knew it was 3 separate actors, the transitions felt seamless to me. Each actor bringing the same subtleties and soft touches to Chiron's guarded personality.Much like Boyhood from a few years ago, Moonlight sometimes struggles to create cohesive narrative. But I guess the goal wasn't necessarily to do that. It's films like these that need to be told so that people can experience other worlds and lives that they wouldn't otherwise be familiar with. I can't say I fully understand what it feels like to live with a crackhead mother, daily bullying, and identity crisis, but Moonlight certainly does its best to develop an experience unique for cinema-goers everywhere.+Performances+A look into a new world-Sometimes the cohesiveness in narrative isn't there7.7/10"
MOONLIGHT,20 November 2016,,"Words cannot express how I felt after watching Moonlight. It's hard to write a review for a film that touches you so powerfully, so emotionally, because there is nothing else you can say aside from just how deeply you felt it. I felt it, possibly in a way I haven't felt a film in years. So simple in its premise, but incredibly written, directed, and acted. It may very well have one of the best final scenes I have ever seen. Something that also stood out that I didn't particularly expect was the amazing cinematography, so free flowing and so acutely able to capture the characters' feelings. This is a film that is not to be missed, a film to be celebrated through and through."
MOONLIGHT,17 June 2020,8/10,"As for character development and pull of the story, ""Moonlight"" may not be impressive, but structurally, which I think is arguably more important, it's masterful. The title denotes the cinematography--lighting effects traced back to a story told by Mahershala Ali's Juan in the movie, but the three-chapter plot is based in the waves. A few forceful events hit us, followed by fades to black before the next wave catches us up with Chiron days if not years later. There's a formal elegance to this focus on the protagonist's formative life moments. We watch how he's raised by his drug-addicted mother and his drug-dealing father figure (a memorable Oscar-winning performance by Ali), then it's on to his first sexual experience before his life is altered by violence and legal punishment. The motif of the breeze coming from the seas off the Miami beaches is apt, too. They mark the three happiest, if not cleansing in their symbolic connection to water, turning points in his life, from learning to swim as a child, the sexual encounter on the beech, to his pausing in a parking lot during the final episode.I suppose the focus on African-American and gay characters, along with however that comments on issues of masculinity, is what may have garnered ""Moonlight"" a lot of critical praise and, ultimately, led to its surprise Best Picture Oscar, but this is less a social message picture than an exercise in reconstructing the ""hood film"" genre, as it's more of a mood or thematic piece rather than following the usual psychological motivations of characters out to achieve some goal or exploiting some controversy for sensationalism. In some ways, although not of the same genre, ""Boyhood"" (2014) was similarly impressive. In ""Moonlight,"" though, it doesn't even really matter whether the three Chirons thoroughly resemble each other or not. It's plot and theme over story; place and atmosphere over character identification. It's not that this informs us less about the character and his journey, either, as we, instead, get a better sense, following figures from behind or bobbing in the water beside them, of how it feels to be transformed by the place beside those crashing waves and how events ripple through to determine that hero's journey. And, even if the spectator isn't likewise affected, at least there is the exquisite cinematography and editing to admire."
MOONLIGHT,21 January 2017,,"A powerhouse of raw emotions that's handled with care, shot with compassion & told with composure, Moonlight is a riveting character study that covers the themes of identity, masculinity & sexuality in a highly authentic manner, happens to have an in-depth understanding of its subject matter, and presents it with absolute honesty to deliver a timeless tale that resonates on a personal level.Moonlight chronicles a young black man's struggle to find himself and is told in three stages, each capturing a defining event in his life. In the first segment, he's introduced as a shy & withdrawn kid who finds solace in the company of a drug dealer. The next part covers his stint with love & heartbreak in high-school, while the final act finds him with a tougher exterior yet carrying the same fragility beneath.Written & directed by Barry Jenkins, Moonlight takes ample space & time to shape up its character and expertly utilizes the peripheral elements to add more flesh to his arc. The three-act structure helps in keeping the narrative focused but the space between each segment still leaves a void of its own. Also, while the supporting characters have defining attributes, the main character is more of an empty shell.The technical aspects are finely executed, as Jenkins experiments with different camera angles & colour grading techniques to provide a distinct look n feel to the final print. Editing allows the plot to unfold at an unhurried pace but there are instances when a few sequences overstay their welcome. And lastly, the background score is always in sync with its unraveling plot and silently uplifts the whole experience.Coming to the performances, each one of the three actors playing the leading part leave a lasting impression, for Alex Hibbert & Ashton Sanders express Chiron's suppressed emotions with precision while Trevante Rhodes takes it a step further by perfectly demonstrating a longing soul beneath his sturdy persona. Mahershala Ali chips in with a strong input but isn't around for long, while Naomie Harris renders her character brilliantly.On an overall scale, Moonlight is undeniably an emotionally absorbing & powerfully moving cinema that's all the more strengthened by muscular performances from its cast and skillful execution from its filmmaker. While I'm not as enamoured by it as everyone else seems to be, I do admire what it translates on the silver screen. All in all, Barry Jenkins' sophomore effort makes up for a sensory experience that will reverberate most with those who can relate to it. Definitely worth your time & money. Don't miss it."
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,,"It makes little difference that this was festooned with Oscars this year. I would have come to it regardless for its promise of a youthful look into back streets that we don't get to see very often. I would have come to it eager, for the same reason I've been to Killer of Sheep and Shadows before. It would be about young people, young black people in Miami. It promised both hardship and discovery as movies about youth ought to. Any opportunity to inhabit a time and place, explore the horizon that life acquires for people that could be ourselves, is invaluable to me, exhilarating. It counts as education of the highest order for me, the visual and intuitive kind.It does take place in those streets, Miami here but you can imagine it goes on the same way across America. It does offer hardship and discovery; one centered on broken family, the other on sexual awakening. It has a lyrical camera, some marvelous music. Viewers looking for a film that castigates social ills by looking for who's to blame will be disappointed. It's not the vehement kind of film, the Spike Lee kind. We're better off for it. Anger is a meaningless waste of energy, its grown up versions are cynicism and bitterness, not awakening.In spite of best intentions however a movie must stand or fall with the awakening of gaze it permits. We see not particularly far here; not farther than the cycle of becoming his drug dealer mentor because it's the only decent man he knew in childhood. The filmmaker has plucked a few broad threads and unspooled across time until pain and irony are revealed. An abusive addict mother who years later regrets it. The sexual relationship becomes a handjob by the beach and the awkwardness of meeting again years later. I find overall that it streamlines to a Lifetime movie hook; can we begrudge him becoming who he does? I do think we're all richer when people reflect on their own worlds from within those worlds. But when faced with a film like this I also find myself hankering for more filmmakers like Cassavetes, black or otherwise. Real souls who will not settle for things being so or in some other way, who can send us back home with none of the comfy words we try to explain with. It's a noble attempt here but I urge you to know Killer of Sheep at some point."
MOONLIGHT,28 December 2018,2/10,"I know that Moonlight is ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" of movies, and you're not supposed to say anything bad about it, but the emperor isn't wearing any clothes and this movie is terrible. It's a completely pretentious and horribly tedious film in both structure and content. This feels like a student film, only not as enjoyable. The Academy got it wrong -- this should not be a Best Picture winner."
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2017,9/10,"The reviewer's dilemma (and it is a dilemma reviewers LOVE to encounter) is, in a superb film with superb acting all around, a superb script, and superb directing, you still need to pay special attention to those actors that, in such a competitive environment, stand out as something ""extra"" special.In this mesmerizing film, special attention has to go to two actors who steal every scene they are in and silently promise the viewer that the long and bountiful careers ahead of them will deliver even better performances down the road.I am referring first to Mahershala Ali, whose magnetic presence made him the centerpiece of Luke Cage (where he competes with, and surpasses, actors with much greater experience). If you watch this actor closely, not only is he in the moment, but his body seems to be in constant motion even when he is sitting still. Like a hummingbird. Awesome to behold and although he has been lately playing characters of ""dubious morality"" one gets the feeling he could play a hero just as easily.And then there is the performance of Naomie Harris, a performance so strong and memorable that I began to recall that, in the Golden Age of films, they used to refer to performances like hers as ""searing"" -- but lately I have not seen the term used very often in a review.So in honor of Ms. Harris I will say for the record that her performance in this film -- with minimal screen time -- is searing and unforgettable.Highly recommended."
MOONLIGHT,27 August 2021,6/10,"The plot is interesting, but it is a very, very exaggerated movie."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2017,6/10,"""At some point you gotta decide for yourself who you're gonna be."" Chiron is a young man struggling to make it in school and in life. He is left alone most of the time since his mother Paula (Harris) is a drug addict. He finds a mentor and a friend in Juan (Ali), the person who sells his mother drugs. He imparts wisdom that sticks with Chiron from a young boy, to teenager to an adult man. This is a tough movie to review. The acting is really good, but there is essentially no plot and it reminded me a little of Precious in the way you are just watching a child struggle to get by on his own with no real guidance or story. The acting is very very good but this is the first Best Picture nominee of the year where I question why it was nominated. I'm not saying the movie isn't good because it is, but on the other hand this is really less of a movie and more of a two hour character study. Overall, not a bad watch but one that is emotionally draining. If you liked Precious and want to watch another movie like that again then this is the movie you have been waiting for. I give this a B."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,6/10,"Moonlight  The number one thing that young black males want to be when they grow  up is alive.  Followed closely by loved, as confirmed by this drama.  When a drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend (Janelle Mon√°e)  take pity on Chiron (Alex Hibbert) due to his circumstances, their  kindness ends up influencing the person he will become.  As a teen, an act of intimacy with a childhood friend (Andr√© Holland)  results in humiliation that finds Chiron (Ashton Sanders) incarcerated  and repressed.  As an adult, Chrion (Trevante Rhodes) has become a dealer himself with  the need to reunite with his first love.  A brave rendition of the acclaimed stage play, this cinematic  interpretation does the theatrical one justice in terms of acting and  direction. Nevertheless, neither of these add-ons can quicken the  story's sluggish pace.  Incidentally, since it is no longer a play the audience may now text  throughout the performance.   Yellow Light"
MOONLIGHT,19 February 2017,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Moonlight"" (2016), given all the buzz surrounding it and the praise and awards it got (and will have) lived up to my expectations. This is a great character study movie. It feels like i have seen 3 characters in one person, but that is because this man changes during his hard life - it is one of the best character study movies I've seen in many years.Directing, writing were superb, but performances in this movie were more then great - they are amazing. Mahershala Ali (who i always like in ""House of Cards"") played a performance of his life time (period) - this is a spellbinding acting. Naomie Harris was stunning as a mother of the main character, complex and not so one sided as it might seen at first. Three actors who played main character during the first three stages of his life were also all great. Overall, ""Moonlight"" is an excellent character study drama. It is superbly crafted small movie, but it is done so good that i couldn't take my eyes from the screen during the whole 1 h 45 min. Music was also superb. This is a great, slow paced and excellent drama in every possible way."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,6/10,"This is an exceptional film, but only from one perspective and that is, LGBT. I totally respect that, because I'm a big supporter. But apart from that, particularly from the filmmaking aspect I did not like it. I felt like this film took place somewhere in Africa, but the accent was American. Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background.The happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative.More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best.7/10"
MOONLIGHT,17 August 2020,6/10,"This film is not quite a masterpiece but it had the potential to be one. I can definitely see what everyone else is talking about - the cinematography allows us to ponder the surroundings, the acting is compelling and the overall feel is rather emotional and unique. The main problem is just that the whole film runs out of steam in the third act and feels really slow and aimless."
MOONLIGHT,26 November 2017,8/10,"Growing up in a rough, disadvantaged neighbourhood proves tough for a gay African American boy in this independent drama set across three stages in his life. Described by some as a film in which nothing happens, 'Moonlight' certainly is not for all tastes; it is more of a mood piece than a narrative and given how introverted the protagonist is, the film is more focused on what is left unsaid in each scene. It is an approach that takes a bit of getting used to, but which generally works. Effective casting is a big plus with all three actors playing the protagonist feeling like one and the same despite changing from one stage of his life to the next. Alex R. Hibbert, who plays the protagonist as a boy, is especially well cast with deep and haunting eyes. He also makes a terrific contrast to the actor who plays him as an adult as the film causes us to ponder how we are all essentially the same person at various stages of our lives with our experiences merely shaping us in different ways. Add in intimate camera-work that intrudes on the characters' personal space, an unusual yet potent music score and accentuated audio effects and this is an oddly compelling movie. The somewhat inconclusive ending initially seems a misstep, but it is hard to think of a more fitting end to this probe into a young man's development in a world where he is a minority no matter how he looks at it."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2017,9/10,"Nobody was more surprised at the Academy Awards on February 26th 2017 when Moonlight was announced as the winner of Best Picture than the cast and crew behind the film, especially since it followed a colossal balls-up that saw La La Land handed the award before the people behind-the-scenes realised that Warren Beatty was reading from the wrong envelope. It was one of the true underdogs in the line-up, and one that I suspect that most viewers at home hadn't even seen. Diversity has long been an issue in Hollywood, and the #OscarsSoWhite debacle of 2015 certainly drew attention to the problem. But anyone thinking that Moonlight, with its all-black cast and African- American writer and director, was handed the trophy as a sort of guilty apology to a minority that has struggled to find a voice in cinema, is simply wrong: Moonlight is one of most engaging and powerful films of the year, and certainly the most personal.Based on the play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney, Barry Jenkins' film chronicles the journey of Chiron from childhood to manhood in Liberty City, Miami. Living with his emotionally abusive, crack-addicted mother Paula (Naomie Harris), the young Chiron (known as 'Little'), is bullied by his schoolmates and is found hiding out in boarded-up apartment by Cuban-born drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali). The youngster is taken under the gangster's wing, and becomes a surrogate by offering him a place to hang out to escape his troubles. In one of the most moving scenes, Juan tells Chiron that there is no shame in being gay, and that he should never let anyone call him 'f****t'. A few years later and now a teenager, Chiron is still being bullied, but finds comfort in a friendship with the outgoing Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). It is with Kevin that Chiron has his first sexual encounter, and one that will trouble him for the years to come.As a young adult and now fully immersed in the gangster lifestyle in Atlanta, Chiron is beefed-up and blinged-up, seemingly growing into his once-guardian Juan. Apparently living a life of isolation and emotional disconnect, a phone call from an old friend takes Chiron back to his hometown to discover who he truly is. The third and final segment is where the film is at its most emotionally exposed, and it's while watching these tender moments that it becomes apparent just how little we see gay black men portrayed on screen, and especially with such vulnerability. Not only does it champion both black and gay cinema, but it opens up a whole new world, fixing its eyes on a forgotten and ignored part of society, essentially one that is not dominated by characters that are white, male or heterosexual. These are numerous independent coming-of-age tales released around the same time each year, but never have I seen one with such a strong personal touch.Clearly inspired by the work of Lynne Ramsay, Moonlight is social realism with a dreamy, otherworldly tint. While what we see on screen is incredibly naturalistic and believable, the fantastic soundtrack, combined with James Laxton's graceful cinematography, makes it feel like we're witnessing this world through somebody else's eyes. Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes all play Chiron at the three stages of his young life, and they are all incredible. A shy, near-mute child, a lonely and scared teenager, and then a lost, regretful adult, Chiron suffers inwardly, and the three actors do a staggering job of emoting the many subtle aspects of the character. It's shame that we get to spend such little time with Juan, but that is only due to the strength of Ali's performance - one that won him the Best Supporting Actor gong. It's a triumph for low-budget, ambitious film-making, and of course one for equality. But most importantly, Moonlight will resonate with anyone who has felt different, alone and ignored in this world."
MOONLIGHT,27 January 2018,10/10,"A fascinating and surprising film about being black in the USA today. The story of a black boy starts in early middle school through to adulthood. He has a family environment that does not help him a lot since he has no father and his mother is practicing home prostitution which kicks the boy out when she has some guest. She adds some drugs on top of it. At school he is ostracized and maybe even bullied if not victimized as being different though he does not know how. In middle school he has a contact with another boy, one night on the beach, very flimsy and light. But that contact is strong for him, like a compensation for all the suffering. A few years later, in high school or so his friend is forced to beat him up in the schoolyard to prove he is not a ""fag"". Chiron takes it hard and has his vengeance on the following day in class. That will have him arrested. We then jump to adulthood.Chiron is living a very solitary life, though we do not really know what he is doing. Probably some drug dealing. One night he is called by his friend from school who tells him he is a chef and has a restaurant. He invites him over but everything stays vague. Later on after a visit to his mother who is institutionalized in a way or other he drives to his school friend's restaurant. Communication is difficult.But little by little, from chef's special to special record he goes to his friend's place to spend the night and some communication comes when he finally tells his friend that since the episode on the beach there has been nothing at all, total abstinence. The door to some emotional contact opens up then.For black people it is difficult to be gay because of the family structure of their childhood and teenage. Strong opposition exists among black males against anything gay. It is an easy reason to have violence and to assert one's virility by beating up others. Bullying is also an essential force for some black boys to keep control of everything and everyone, knowing that none of their victims will press charges, nor their parents.The film is delicate in how it shows the frustration, the desires, the suffering of this Chiron and yet his capability to remain resilient and to negotiate some way out of the trap in which he is. It is this nice reserve and close empathy that makes this film kind of attractive and appealing. It is neither a manifesto about gay blacks or gayness in black society. It is a very sensitive story that remains entirely subdued, humble.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
MOONLIGHT,19 December 2016,7/10,"Moonlight (2016/I) was written and directed by Barry Jenkins. It's basically a coming-of-age story about a gay black man growing up in a poor neighborhood of Miami.The film is divided into three parts. The first is ""Little,"" the nickname given to the protagonist when he is young. (Portrayed by Alex Hibbert,) As a high school student, Chiron, he's portrayed by Ashton Sanders. As an adult. ""Black,"" the role is played by Trevante Rhodes.In my opinion, the best acting in the movie is done by Naomie Harris, as Paula, Chiron's mother. She's hardly the finest mother--she's a crack addict, and at one point she calls her son a faggot. Harris portrays Paula as a weak, addicted person. She's not evil, but she's truly inadequate.As I write this review, Moonlight has an IMDb rating of 8.5, which is incredibly high. I just didn't see it that way. Yes--Chiron is bullied horribly, and he has to get his revenge by violence. He's befriended by a dope dealer. As an adult, he has gotten stronger, tougher, and taller. But, it's clear to me that he's going down the wrong road. So, from my perspective, even though nobody's going to bully him, he won't have a truly successful life. In most coming-of-age movies, there's hope in the end. I didn't see any real hope for Chiron.We saw this film at the wonderful Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen as well."
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2017,4/10,"Every now and then a film comes along that gets a ridiculous amount of award nominations, primarily only due to its message - and that's it. This is one of those films. Sure it was perfectly cast, directed and written, but it was too slow and didn't really have anything exciting to offer except for a story that's been told before - only a little fancier. Not a bad film, but not great either. It's way too overrated. It's only a 4/10 from me"
MOONLIGHT,17 August 2017,8/10,"Moonlight (2016)Plot: Winner of three Academy Awards including best picture, ""Moonlight"" is a breath-taking coming-of-age story and the best reviewed film of the year. ""Moonlight"" follows the story of Chiron (Ashton Sanders) from his early childhood in his depressed Miami neighbourhood to adulthood in Atlanta as he navigates the dangers of drugs, violence, family, love and sexuality.Review: I really enjoyed this emotional drama, mainly because the performances were great, and the storyline was unique. Its about a young boy, called Chiron, who is bullied through his childhood, and becomes friends with the local drug dealer, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who tries to guide him down the right path, even though he sells drugs to his mum, Paula (Naomie Harris). Chiron also becomes friends with Juan's girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monae), who he always can turn to, no matter what. The movie then skips to Chiron as a teenager, who is still getting bullied at school, and battles with his sexuality. With his mum being a crack addict, he still turns to Teresa for comfort, even though he doesn't speak about his problems. After an encounter with his best friend, Kevin, the movie skips to Chiron as an adult, dealing drugs in Atlanta. After getting a call from Kevin, Chiron decides to go back to Miami to visit his mum, and face Kevin, who he is deeply in love with. The fact that this movie is based on emotions more than dialogue, made it emotional and a great watch. I would have liked to have seen what happened to Juan but apart from that, I really can't find a fault with the film. Its written beautifully and the cinematography, really did show Miami in a different light. It covered many different elements of a child growing up in the hood, having to fend for himself, and having to deal with being gay, so I have to give the director the thumbs up, for putting together a movie that certainly stands out from other movies in this genre. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Barry Jenkins, 37, who also brought you Medicine For Melancholy in 2008. For his first major release, he certainly made a big impact in Hollywood, by winning the best picture Oscar, along with the best Screenplay. Mahershala Ali also won the best supporting actor Oscar, which he really deserved but his storyline was cut short in the movie, for some unknown reason. The audience are left to put the pieces together, during the transitions in time in Chirons life, so it felt like there were gaps in the movie, which could have easily been explained. Apart from that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I think the director was brave to tackle issues, which people usually sweep under the carpet. This movie also proves that you don't need a huge budget, and massive action scenes to make a unique film, which is original and a joy to watch.Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $65millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramas, starring Mahershala Ali, Shariff Earp, Duan Sanderson, Alex R. Hibbert, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae and Jaden Piner. 8/10"
MOONLIGHT,13 November 2016,9/10,"In its depiction of black people living in poverty, selling and using drugs and neglecting their children, Barry Jenkins' Moonlight might be accused of trafficking in racial stereotypes. What refutes this spurious accusation, however, is the film's ability to create intimacy, compassion, and understanding of its characters as human beings caught in a system that degrades them and strips them of their humanity. Adapted from Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, the film focuses on three chapters in the life of Chiron, a gay, black boy living in near poverty in Miami in the 1980s. In the first section, Chiron (Alex R. Hibbert), known as Little because of his diminutive stature, is singled out for being different and bullied by those at school who are caught up in the herd mentality.He rarely speaks, hiding his feelings from those around him, even from his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) who is a drug addict. Jenkins talks about Chiron's silence in this way. ""The way I grew up,"" he said, ""I was kind of a quiet kid. I ended up watching people a lot, more than interacting, in a certain way. And I think you can learn a lot more about people when they're not speaking than you can when they're speaking. People say, ""Oh, you can learn more by actions than statements."" But I do think that when people are in repose, you really see beneath the surface."" The film's use of an eclectic soundtrack, however, which includes music by Aretha Franklin, Boris Gardiner, Jidenna, Barbara Lewis, and others, often expresses the conflicting emotions that Chiron is unable to put into words.The film is focused on two key relationships in Chiron's life, that with his mother and with his only friend Kevin and opens as Little, being chased by bullies, hides in an unlocked apartment. There he is discovered huddling in a corner by Juan (Mahershala Ali), a local drug dealer who, together with his girl friend Teresa, (Janelle Mon√°e) becomes the boy's mentor, giving him food, shelter, and a place of refuge. In a scene of warmth and beauty, Juan teaches the boy how to swim and, in another deeply moving moment, when Chiron asks him, ""What's a faggot?"" Juan's response that it is ""a word used to make gay people feel bad,"" seems to resonate on Chiron's face.Their relationship continues to grow but sadly, after Chiron has learned to trust him, he finds out that his mother Paula takes drugs and that Juan is her supplier and he disappears from the boy's life. In the second section, Chiron, now played by Ashton Sanders, is a high school student who confronts his sexuality in a sensitively handled scene in which he and his friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) sit beside each other on a beach as the deeper aspect of their relationship is revealed. Unfortunately, it is only shortly afterwards that this friendship is betrayed at the instigation of a conscienceless bully. In the final section, however, It is Chiron (Trevante Roades) and Kevin's (Andr√© Holland) renewal of their connection after ten years that allows us to get beyond the now burly, muscular Chiron's macho posturing and find an entrance into the heart of both characters.In the scene which partially takes place in the coffee shop where Kevin works as a cook, Chiron, who runs a drug ring in Atlanta tries to hide behind his masculinity but his act is betrayed by the revealing softness of his gaze. Though the film's focus is on the life of one black individual, it is not a character study (its main character has few defining characteristics other than sullenness and repressed emotion). Neither is it a film of social protest, a gay love story, or a film with a political message, though it contains elements of each.Moonlight transcends race, gender, and sexuality to become a universal statement, a tone poem that resensitizes us to a renewed understanding that we are people of compassion and empathy, elements that are in danger of becoming obsolete in a culture that values selfishness and greed. Author Charles Eisenstein said, ""Dehumanizing narratives are never the truth. The truth can only be sourced from the sincere question, ""What is it like to be you?"" That is called compassion, and it invites skills of listening, dialog, and communicating without violence or judgment."" This is the kind of inspiration that Moonlight provides."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2018,10/10,"Once in a blue moon, I witness a landmark in cinematic history. A film so masterful, that it is near impossible to fault. I can say with the utmost of confidence, Moonlight is that film. Wow. The story centres around Chiron, as he grows up within the boundaries of drugs and violence. Trying to place himself in society and discover his sexuality, Chiron navigates the dangers of life but most importantly family and love. I'm going to review this slightly differently. We all know Naomie Harris, Mahershala Ali and Trevante Rhodes were exceptional. There is no question that many view this a cinematic masterpiece. Barry Jenkins direction and screenplay being outstanding, particularly his utilisation of blurring the background so that the focus is always on the characters. We all know this, it's the reason why it's the best reviewed film of 2016. For me, Moonlight is an experience. It is so utterly relatable to me. The portrayal of being afraid of yourself. External environments preventing you from being your true self. Undergoing the process of discovering yourself sexually. Absolutely and undeniably dealt with attentive care and professional delicacy. To have an important film affiliated among the best of the best means so much to me. Films aren't just a medium for entertainment, they can be used to evoke emotions. Journeys so personal and relatable, that it's as if some of your life is onscreen. As if someone out there understands you. Watching Chiron grow, as we witness three distinct stages of his childhood, felt real. His development is never forced, it's not a means to further the story...it's all natural. How he yearns for a father that he never had. How his drug abusing mother confines him into a world of reclusive solidarity. The moment he shares his first sexual encounter. It's just a thing of beauty. I can't fully describe how powerful and important this film is. Not just to cinema, but to me. Without a shadow of doubt, Moonlight gets the perfect rating."
MOONLIGHT,9 June 2020,7/10,"Moonlight (2016) :
Brief Review -A slow paced but effective journey of finding indentity through complexities in the life. All 3 Oscars were Unworthy though. Moonlight has been bashed by many people but also loved by many people and the reason is some people find themselves involved in the film and some people found nothing new in it. The film is certainly slow paced for the kind of content it carries for 110 Minutes which could have easily been told in 90 minutes. The pace makes it look even dull if you have already found it in the category of nothing new but just the same old stuff around self-soul-search. On the opposite side if you find yourself involved in the the film because of central character then you won't mind holding patience till you get those answers. Moonlight won 3 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Actor in Supporting Role and Best Screenplay and i personally think all 3 were unworthy. First, Best Picture, definitely arguable because the concept is nothing new and hasn't been told smartly. Second, Best Supporting Actor to Maheshala Ali for hardly 10 Minutes role. Are you serious? Third, like I said film was too slow to fetch the audience interest then Best Screenplay is out of question. Now coming to the positives, The Storytelling is effective as it devided the narrative in 3 parts in the life of the protagonist. The brutality and issues of the community makes it more brighter to spread the light on people's mind. Barry Jenkins direction is fairly good but it could have been much better, more detailed and profound if wanted. Despite several issues the film stands tall because of it's writting but unfortunately that deserving field didn't get Oscar. Overall, Moonlight is a very good attempt and almost succeeded in reaching till the core of the concept, it deserves to watched at least once. Not a Classic but, i must mention.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2017,9/10,"Belonging, love, identity ‚Äì not everyone grows up a gay black man with a drug addict mother and no father like Chiron, the main character in Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight,"" but his struggle to find and be himself resonates across all lines of race, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientationA coming-of-age story in three parts, ""Moonlight"" gives us a glimpse into critical periods in Chiron's life, each stage portrayed by a different actor. Alex R. Hibbert plays 9-year-old Chiron, a.k.a. ""Little,"" a quiet boy who gravitates toward a local drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) to escape being bullied at school and ignored by his mother (Naomie Harris); Ashton Sanders plays teenage Chiron, a near-brooding adolescent forced to face who he is and can become; and Trevante Rhodes plays ""Black,"" a physically transformed but still emotionally fragile Chiron as a young adult. What it took Richard Linklater more than a decade to accomplish in 2014's ""Boyhood,"" Jenkins does in a film that's an hour shorter and was shot in something like three weeks. Nothing can substitute watching a character actually age before your eyes, but the three actors who play Chiron all seem to share his essence. Of the many things Jenkins does well in this film, ensuring Chiron's soul comes through so authentically in all three performances is one of the more underrated.As an ensemble, the cast of ""Moonlight"" ranks among the year's best if not the year's best period. The film's roots as a play (written by Tarell Alvin McCraney but never produced) assure the actors some powerful dialogue and scene work. The dialogue drives the drama, as do the unspoken relationship dynamics. Only a few scenes, mostly in the second act, have a distinct physicality to them, otherwise it's Jenkins who must utilize the camera to facilitate conflict, tension and feeling.Jenkins experiments with a whole host of techniques, mostly visual but also in the form of Nicholas Britell's fragmented orchestral score, which sneaks in and out of the film as emotional punctuation, and in many instances completely disappears to leave the viewer with contemplative silence. There's an intimacy to Jenkins' approach and to the story as a whole that the film's vignette structure would seem to prohibit, but Jenkins is able to generate a profound amount of sympathy for Chiron almost instantaneously. His quiet, non-verbal nature in all three life stages gives us ample time to consider his point of view and participate in his journey of self-discovery.All three acts of the film possess moments of tenderness, optimism and heartbreak, sometimes simultaneously. It speaks to the fragility of life for Chiron, who has the bare essentials to rely on but little else, and how so often the things that leave the biggest imprints on our lives are both good and sad. We even get a sense of just how true this through the only other character who appears in all three acts, Chiron's mother. Even though the role is fairly small, Harris is able to give a full sense of the mother's journey too, and brings complexity to a character who's otherwise easy to despise.We can safely say that Chiron's story, background and experiences will be unlike those of most people who see ""Moonlight."" Often times even the best movies that feature characters and situations we know exist but are so different from our own create a safe amount of distance, that is to say the viewer gets to observe, seemingly from afar, what life is like some kind of ""other."" We leave the viewing experience feeling better educated about and more compassionate toward those whose realities most resemble that film's story. ""Moonlight,"" however, erases more of that distance than films of a similar premise. Jenkins creates an intimacy by telling the story in a way that taps into the most universally human aspects of the story. We've seen stories like it done before countless times, but Jenkins changes how we watch ""Moonlight"" by bringing us closer to everything, to the point that we get more tangled up in Chiron (all three of them) and see parts of ourselves, our lives and our experiences in this poor, black, gay, young man from Miami.~Steven CThanks for reading!

MOONLIGHT,14 November 2016,9/10,"""Moonlight"" (2016 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Chiron. As the movie opens (and we are in ""i. little"", the first of the movie's three chapters), we see Chiron, a young boy of maybe 8 or 9, being chased by bullies. He ends up hiding in an abandoned motel where he is found by Juan, who takes pity on the boy and takes him home. When Chiron refuses to tell Juan or his girl friend where he lives, they let him spend the night. The next morning, Chiron does give his address, and Juan drives him home, where Chiron is berated by his mom. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is written and directed by Barry Jenkins, who previously brought us ""Medicine for Melancholy"". Here, he tackles a topic near and dear to his heart (but it is not strictly auto-biographical): watching how a young boy grows up in the tough part of town in Miami. The movie follows three specific phases: youth, young adult, and adulthood. The story is at times devastating to watch. I can't really say much more than that, you'll just have to take my word for it. The most complex of relationships that the movie focuses on is the one between Chiron and his abusive and addiction-riddled mom. , When once again they get into an argument, Chiron's mom blurts out ""You're my only, and I'm your only!"", as if that somehow justifies the abuse and the neglect suffered by Chiron. The movie is chock-full with outstanding acting performances, from the 3 actors who play the lead roles of Chiron and his friend Kevin, to Naomi Harris as Chiron's mom. But the movie is almost stolen by none other than Janelle Monae as Juan's girl friend Teresa. Couldn't help but notice in the movie end credits that this was Executive Produced by none other than Brad Pitt. I can't help but compare ""Moonlight"" to that other recent movie, ""Kicks"", also about what things are like growing up in the brutal African-American community. ""Kicks"" was okay, but it pales in comparison to ""Moonlight"", which is an outstanding movie on so many levels. Bottom line: the buzz around ""Moonlight"" has steadily been building in the last month, and justifiably so. I am going to go on record right now that this movie will score a bunch of Oscar nominations.""Moonlight"" finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely but frankly I had expected even better than that. Maybe this movie is going to get bigger and bigger crowds as word-of-mouth gets around. Either way, ""Moonlight"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2016,5/10,"Moonlight represents the end product of a collaboration between Barry Jenkins who wrote the screenplay based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. It has an amazing score of ""99"" on Metacritic, with the lowest score being ""63."" When I saw this score my immediate reaction was that this film is no ""99."" It's a lot closer to that ""63,"" a score attributed to a review put out by Slant Magazine.Moonlight is divided into three segments, first focusing on a young African-American boy named Chiron (whose nickname is ""Little"" in the first segment). When we first meet Little, he's run away from home, alienated from his crack-addicted, abusive mother, Paula. A crack dealer named Juan discovers Little inside an abandoned motel and after learning he's been the victim of bullies, he brings him to the home of his girlfriend, Theresa. Little is mute until he opens up the next morning and tells the couple where he lives. Juan eventually forms a relationship with Little, acting as a mentor, despite hostility from the boy's mother. Unfortunately, Juan plays no part in the rest of the film and we eventually learn in the last segment that he's no longer alive. Despite the lugubrious pacing, Moonlight chronicles the tragedy of how drugs can play such a ruinous part in the lives of African-American men and women, residing in the inner city.Just at the right moment, Jenkins introduces Chiron as a teenager in the second segment. Here he is referred to by his true name. The withdrawn child is now a withdrawn teenager who is still coping with his crackhead of a mother and is taunted by other teens who regard him as not only passive but possibly homosexual. Jenkins isn't afraid to chronicle additional problems in the African-American community, especially the scourge of bullying. The story becomes more interesting when Chiron hooks up with his old childhood friend, Kevin, who leads him to a homosexual encounter on the beach. There's more drama when Kevin participates in a hazing ritual, betraying Chiron by slugging him a number of times in the face, at the behest of the usual suspects of high school bullies. When Chiron smashes a chair over the bully in front of his high school class, he's taken away by the police and placed in a juvenile detention center.The third segment focuses on Chiron ten years later‚Äîhe goes by the name of ""Black,"" an appellation given to him by Kevin when he was in high school. Jenkins makes the mistake of casting the older Chiron with an actor who doesn't resemble the younger high school student Chiron, at all. We find out next to nothing about the older Chiron, except that he's now a hardened drug dealer living in Atlanta.After getting a phone call from Kevin, who now works as a cook in Miami, Black goes to visit him there. He first visits his mother who is now a resident at a nursing home and begs his forgiveness for her earlier deleterious behavior. Naomie Harris does a fine job as the repentant mother and the son hugs her, still acknowledging their bond.Once Black walks into the small restaurant where Kevin now works, the story is virtually over. You can guess what happens next: Black acknowledges that he's been alone since their encounter in high school‚Äîand he agrees to send the night with Kevin, who still has feelings for him, despite having a child with a woman from whom he is now separated.Moonlight really runs out of gas in the third act, as Black (Chiron) remains a completely underdeveloped character. The reconciliation, highlighted by tender feelings between two men, is simply not enough to bring the story to a fitful conclusion. Jenkins' final 30 minutes is dragged out where there are no surprises. Moonlight has quite a bit of atmosphere (particularly in the first two acts) and some raw performances (particularly by the child actors), but ultimately the denouement was not thought out clearly enough to pass muster as a film rated almost 100 by an overwhelming majority of major film critics."
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,5/10,"I do not like homosexuals and therefore any gay movies. I don't like to see two men kissing, making love. So, an attempt motivating them becoming gay due to a heavy childhood and devoid of parental love doesn't convince me. However, this film has qualities. It is well done and well played. Actress Naomie Harris in particular (Moneypenny in ""Spectre"" and Eve in ""Skyfall""), here, Paula, the irresponsible mother of the main character. Of those three actors playing the main character at different ages, the best, in my humble opinion, is Alex Hibbert(as Little). After other opinions, the film is boring. Yes, but it's a boring well done."
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2021,10/10,"Moonlight (2016) is a movie I watched on a flight a couple years ago after seeing the amount of accolades it was receiving. The storyline focuses on a young man in a troubled home and area that struggles with dealing with his surroundings as well as his sexuality. He tries to be accepted within his culture but realizes he will have to conform to be successful and keep what he needs covered hidden. Will he ever be allowed to be himself? This movie is directed by Barry Jenkins (If Beale Street could Talk) and stars Mahershala Ali (The Place Behind the Pines), Janelle Mon√°e (Antebellum), Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) and Jaden Piner (Boo!). The storyline for this is very well told and portrayed. The struggles of a black man being gay within his community and being accepted as a sigma was very well told. The acting is out of this world good. The cast does a great job with interactions, dialogue and their expressions. The end leaves you craving more and wanting to know more about each character and how the story plays out throughout everyone's lifetime. This is a great and unique coming of age picture that I strongly recommend. I would easily score this a 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,19 October 2017,8/10,"An understated coming of age film, ""Moonlight"" presents a triptych of stories about a gay African American youth living on the hard streets of Florida. A purely character driven film, there is not much for viewers who can't identify or empathise with, or at least take an interest in, the main character(s). The acting is uniformly outstanding, especially (IMO) Naomie Harris as Chiron's slowly deteriorating mother and Mahershala Ali's ""Juan"" (I thought that the swimming lesson/baptism scene was beautiful). I can't say that I enjoyed ""Moonlight"" as much as I did ""La La Land"" but I can't argue that it was in fact the more deserving of the two films when the Oscars were handed out."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,,"OK I watched it. None of its Oscars were earned. Pedestrian and over-long film about coming of age. Been there, done that. So we have a bullied kid growing up in a drug-infested neighborhood, a druggy mom, lots of unintelligible dialog, a strange older man (a drug seller) who disappears after the first act (but he wins an Oscar), and a slew of actors I never heard of even if a couple of them are on TV shows I never watched. The kid is nearly catatonic until he cracks.The only good acting performance is from Andre Holland as the old Kevin in the third act.MOONLIGHT ranks with AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS as the worst film to win a best-film Oscar. Adding insult to injury, it also won an Oscar for writing. This is an after-school TV special with some graphic scenes thrown in to help pad out the running time to 110 minutes. If you want to see a coming-of-age story about a black kid, stick with SOUNDER."
MOONLIGHT,26 January 2017,7/10,"Anything you read about ""Moonlight"" will tell you about how the main character, Chiron, ""grapples with his sexuality"". Everyone who reads that will know instinctively that it means he is gay. Why is it that only gay/bi people ""grapple with their sexuality"" in movies? Is sexuality totally cut and dried for anyone without same-sex attraction?The movie is a moving character study of a young black man, played by different actors as a child, teenager, and adult. The character doesn't say a whole lot, but the actors that play him are able to convey a multitude of emotions.Chiron is the son of a drug addicted single mother. The only people who give him any attention are a local drug dealer, played by Mahershala Ali, who also keeps Chiron's mother supplied, and a school friend to whom Chiron develops a sexual attraction.Aside from the young actor who plays Chiron, the standout is Ali. His character is, on its surface, hard to believe. A crack dealer who shows an interest in playing daddy for the kid of one of his addicts? But Mahershala Ali makes the character real and nuanced.Chiron's mother is less convincing. The scene of forced reconciliation between her and her son wasn't as moving as I felt it was supposed to be.Overall, ""Moonlight"" doesn't quite cut to the bone, but it does give you a lot to think about."
MOONLIGHT,21 January 2017,9/10,"The Moonlight in Miami shines brightly cinematically in Writer- Director Barry Jenkins' outstanding movie ""Moonlight"". It revolves around an African-American boy named Chiron, nicknamed Little by his peers. Little lives in the poverty project of Liberty City in Miami, Florida. While running away from the bullies who torment him, Little escapes into a presumed crackhouse. There he meets the gentle drug dealer named Juan, who cares for him as a surrogate-type father. Little has big problems at home because his mother Paula is a crack addict and also bullies Little. ""Moonlight"" then moves in two other chapters in Chiron's life; next as a insecure teen wrestling with his sexuality, and then as a brawny young adult. Jenkins marvels in presenting Chiron throughout his young life. And all the three young actors that play Chiron sure are on; Alex R. Hibbert as the young Little, a stunning Ashton Sanders as the teen Chiron, and Trevante Rhodes as the young adult Chiron. Mahershala Ali's work as Juan was a powerful Ali thespian punch; even though it would have been nice to see Ali in a few more rounds in the picture. Naomie Harris was a force to be reckoned with her stunning performance as the verbally abusive mother Paula. Andre Holland was a revelation as Chiron's longtime friend Kevin. James Laxton's cinematography was a work of Miami art. Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" is very subtle but very effective. ""Moonlight"" is more than just one small step for a man, it is one large movie that must be seen by man & woman kind. ***** Excellent"
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,7/10,"The beauty of Independent film making (the ugly part, paying for it) is that it allows the director to play auteur more than studio directors under contract who have to answer to backers daily. The filmmaker can change things on the fly without going to committee to discuss, usually to play it safe and dilute the power. In Moonlight writer, director Barry Jenkins, free of these restraints delivers a powerfully imaginative and painful story about making one's way through life as an outsider. Chiron aka Little is bullied in his Liberty City community for being different. With a crackhead mother Chiron finds understanding and friends hard to come by with the exception of classmate Kevin. Cracktdealer Juan takes pity on Little and plays father figure much to mother's dismay. Divided into 3 acts, the next two cover the following twenty years of Chiron's life.As the noble crack dealer Juan, Mahershala Ali displays the strutting confidence of John Wayne and the gentle understanding of Ben Johnson in The Last Picture Show. His scenes of patience with a silent Little, especially when teaching him to swim and explaining the slur for what he was hiding. Naomi Harris is simply outstanding whether loving, terrifying or drying out. Ashton Sanders in the teen role is painfully convincing as he suffers from all sides.Tight schedule, tight budget Jenkins probably through necessity bombards us with intense close ups interspersed with 360 shots of dizzying suspense that makes for an excellent introduction to Juan and an ugly lead up to a schoolyard confrontation. Eschewing angry rap and hip-hop in favor of a more reticent score compositions float. But the brazen informative close-ups begin to linger, the camera movement become repetitive while the third act falls into a funk and fails to ignite like the first two. Aging process or running out of ideas it pads to make things worse.Moonlight is a remarkable feat under the conditions it was made. I'm sure the studios will come a calling for Jenkins. It remains to be seen if money will ruin him like others these days. Either way he'll always have Moonlight which is impressive enough."
MOONLIGHT,26 February 2019,7/10,"I still have a hard time believing this film won Best Picture over several other nominees the least of which was La La Land. It is good movie and the script is quite solid. The triptych-like narrative structure is an interesting way to grapple with coming of age and how a person's identity is fractured. Likewise, the critique of traditional masculinity in African American contexts is quite strong. I like how the script tends to complicated the emotions you have for the characters. Juan, played wonderfully by Ali, is both a touching father figure and a great source of pain for the main character. Likewise, the two central scenes of the main character and Kevin being intimate followed by school bullying is horrifying and quite emotionally powerful. It really shows the box cars of the system that can have queer men hurt each other and themselves. The story is quite good and it is of lives rarely put up on the big screen.Unfortunately it is also greatly marred by the direction. I imagine a lot of this is intentional and I am sure some film school professor has a 20 page essay for why this stuff is OK. But for my money too much of the film is simply (literally) out of focused with too much lens flare and overexposure. Some of the blocking is quite bad. The extremely small budget shows up repeatedly. Worse the way the film fades to black and has each part of the triptych have a title on screen robs the film of narrative momentum. The emotion is sometimes muted because of this. I am sure it is thematically OK (the main character's identity is fractured the way the narrative is and has to make himself anew each section) but it doesn't play right while watching it. A better set of editing and directing choices could have preserved the fractured self without losing the momentum. The film doesn't build correctly due to this.This is a good film. It is sad a better version doesn't exist

MOONLIGHT,1 November 2017,8/10,"(Flash Review)This is the story of a man in search of who he is while living within a rough and tough environment, which is told through three points during his life; as a boy, teen and adult. The story unfolds poetically through soft-focused visuals and expressions rather than spoon-fed dialog. There are several heartbreaking moments that shaped his life's trajectory with raw acting and feelings. The music score was rather unique and helped punctuate various scenes. Will he be able to fully become who he wants to be? Overall, the tale was told in a non- conventional manner which allows atmosphere to help guide the viewers understanding."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2020,5/10,This seems like a cheap knock off of Boyhood. The characters and actors are all great in this film but the story seems to be a bunch of stereotypes. In the end the main character was supposed to find himself. You can be the judge if that is the case.
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2018,6/10,"Moonlight examines the trials and tribulations of a black man from childhood to adulthood. The man's negative experiences are exacerbated due to the fact that he is gay. Although the characterizations do not match the intensity of those in Brokeback Mountain, the film does offer a unique perspective from a gay black man; a subject seldom found in cinema. The script is tight and not overly sentimental, and the supporting cast does a good job, along with the director. Not as good as Philadelphia, but reasonably good."
MOONLIGHT,8 April 2017,1/10,"I've said for some time now that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is completely out of touch with the real world. The last time I think they got it right was when LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING won and that was in 2003. If you disagree that's fine but then name at least 5 movies that have won for best picture since then not including the most recent. Which is what I'm here to discuss. MOONLIGHT.The story of MOONLIGHT follows the life of Chiron aka Little. Divided into three sections we see Little as a young child, later as a teen and finally as an adult. As the film opens Little is being chased by several other boys who are calling him gay in the most slang term kids can figure at that age. Running away he hides in an abandoned motel where he is found by Juan (Mahershala Ali). Juan is the local supplier for crack on the street but he's taken an interest in Chiron.Chiron's mother Paula (Naomie Harris) isn't happy that Juan has taken this interest. To her the boy only needs his mother and not some local drug dealer in his life. Unfortunately she is well acquainted with said dealer as she is one of his regular customers. When she goes on a bender, Little ends up at the home of Teresa (Janelle Monae), Juan's girlfriend. He also find's comfort in the friendship he has with Kevin, another boy at school.The second chapter deals with the events in Little's life that change him forever. Still battling the bullying he gets at school one night he and Kevin hang out on the beach (the film takes place in Miami). There the two young boys have a sexual encounter. Before anyone goes ballistic this I will say that it is tastefully handled when you consider what most straight sexual situations involve. The next day one of the bullies, friends with Kevin, reminds him of an old game they used to play where they would pick someone out of a crowd and challenge each other to knock them out. Of course he picks Little. Unwilling to let them know his true feelings, Kevin follows through, crushing Little emotionally.The third chapter involves Little now going by his given name of Chiron. His life is completely different now, altered by the fallout from the final moments of the second section of the film. Street smart and following in the footsteps of Juan he re-encounters Kevin. Where things go from there is anyone's guess and deserves to be seen rather than discussed.Trust me when I say I've not revealed too many details of the story here. It is the bare bones description with more around it. What those words don't do though is inform you of just how bad this movie it. It commits the ultimate sin in a movie for me: it's boring. At no time did I find myself feeling an extreme amount of sympathy for any of the characters found in this film. Perhaps a smidgen of empathy for young Little but his unwillingness to stand up for himself slowly eases away your caring for him. None of the other characters have much of a redeeming quality about them either with perhaps the exception of Juan but the fact that he deals crack makes that a little hard to take.The pacing of the movie is incredibly slow. With each passing minute I found myself clicking the remote to find out just how much of the movie was left. But this was supposed to be the best movie made last year having just won the Oscar for Best Picture. So I hung in there, never fast forwarding and roughing it through from start to finish. By the time the credits began to roll I couldn't wait to hit stop.This movie is one of those films made to appeal to both critics and fellow actors. It is an attempt to justify film as an art film and in so doing it degrades that possibility instead. For some reason those in the business think that to qualify as art a movie can't be entertaining or popular it seems. If you don't believe me tell me how many of the Best Picture winners from the last 10 years have you seen. I've seen all but 2 and can tell you that only 4 of them are in my collection and they are ones I rarely revisit.Hollywood needs to stop trying to prove to the worlds that they are an art form and carry on making movies that entertain. And when doing so they need to ease back on the remakes, adaptations of comics (even if I love those movies) and never ending sequels. There was a time when movies were made in weeks rather than months, when they came out in droves rather than a slow release and when even drive in movies provided entertainment and creativity. As for this movie I can't recommend enough steering clear of it. That is unless you're in need of something to lull you into sleep and pills are not available."
MOONLIGHT,19 November 2018,,"This is a film for those who live the story. The whole movie is well polished. It is well acted. And it has its nice touches. I appreciated how the boy mutes out the world. But the fragments are quite far apart. In the end they do integrate into the end story, but I never felt something like when I have seen Pulp Fiction.Oh, and given the reviews, it's also a film for White folks to parade their ""special"" way of being anti-racist."
MOONLIGHT,8 April 2020,4/10,"Can't believe it won best picture. Yes the cinematography is great and so is the acting, but storyline is meh, it's just another life movie, it's slow and not much happens."
MOONLIGHT,21 March 2020,8/10,"A movie that helps define a decade: race, sexuality, identity, and most importantly, the blessed state of filmmaking today."
MOONLIGHT,10 October 2017,7/10,"Moonlight shows us the coming-of-age story of a young black man in Miami. He follow him through 3 important stages of his life as he deals with the poverty of his upbringing, his confusion with sexuality, and the issues of masculinity and race for a young African-American.This one seems to be a lot more divisive amongst audiences than it is between critics. An Oscar winner and critical darling, I came in with supremely high expectations and hopes for this movie; maybe that was where my problem was.I enjoyed this movie, don't get me wrong, but I felt underwhelmed after all the hype surrounding it. I understand why it won an Oscar: never before has cinema really explored the life and struggles of a homosexual black man who must cope with the struggles of an impoverished upbringing. It's an important story to show and no film before this has really been able to mix all this heavy subject material in one pot and produce something meaningful.My main issue with this one is the third act. What starts off as a promising character arc quickly comes to a halt as Black hits adulthood. The first act gives us such an outstanding performance from Mahershala Ali. His scenes are far and away the best acted of this movie. The second act gives us the most touching scenes. The third act gives us... what exactly? Black hasn't developed anymore as a character. His muscles and shiny car are all superficial aspects of a man who truly has yet to find himself. That quiet, scared teenager is still in there underneath.Maybe that was the director's point, to leave us with an unfinished story. Are we as the audience suppose to decide Black's future in our minds like some kind of choose your own adventure book? His reunion with Kevin hasn't accomplished anything that we can see. Black's throwaway line about no one touching him since Kevin doesn't hold any wait for me as the viewer because I don't know enough about Black. I haven't watched his struggle with sexuality through the years. I haven't seen his transformation from scared, scrawny teenager to tough, successful drug dealer. Our transition from Act 2 to Act 3 leaves us with too many holes for me to be 100% emotionally attached to our protagonist.Besides my issues with the ending, I did like this movie. The cinematography borders on self-indulgence at points but it is always able to creep its way back from the brink. It's rather well done. I've already mentioned Ali's acting. I completely agree with his Oscar win. Naomie Harris also deserves accolades for her performance.While I didn't love this movie, I understand the significance of the story it is telling. I recommend checking it out if you haven't already. It may not blow you away but it will tug at your heartstrings here and there."
MOONLIGHT,12 November 2020,5/10,"Not the typical gangsta film you might be expecting or even the usual Gay film either. I suppose I would say that it is somewhere between ""Boyz N The Hood"" and Nathan's story from ""Queer As Folk (UK)"" as it references drug culture and homophobic bullying.Honestly, when I first started watching it, I thought it was going to be just another ""Boyz N The Hood"", but it turned out to be a lot better than that. A Boyz for a new generation maybe, but without all the shouting and N this and F or C that! Although that still featured quite a lot. I'm not generally a big fan of gangsta's and shouting and swearing films about the hood or the ghetto or the wrong side of the tracks, whether they be about white boys, black boys or any other boys or girls, so I was surprised, when this one calmed down a short way in, that this one was a much simpler version than those I've seen before. I had been close to turning it off.I still struggled a bit to watch it as it wasn't playing specifically to my interests and I have to say that I only really tuned in because of the gay storyline. In some ways it doesn't make a fuss about it, which is good, but in other ways, I think I would have liked to see his journey as he discovers his sexuality a little bit more. A bit more glue to piece the time frames together.Although I quite liked it, I don't feel that it really went anywhere in the end. Perhaps they were going for a snapshot of life in Chiron's shoes and not trying to make too much of a statement, but it felt like it needed an ending.Chiron's journey from 'Little' to 'Black' is a tough one and I can only hope that he has a better life in the time that follows this film. It seems to be set up that way, but we are left guessing.I think they have made an LGBT film that is maybe more accessible to everyman, which shows that the queers are just like everybody else and might inspire sympathy and understanding and not just tolerance if that.One of my biggest criticisms of films like these is that I struggle to understand what they are saying, not just because of the diction, but also because of a language barrier that subtitles can't translate. I'm not down with the kids enough or experienced in drug culture to know half of the terminology used. I do appreciate that it's what makes it more authentic though. They may also not be making the film for the likes of me in that case.I can see that the film might be considered interesting, different and even ground breaking, but I'm not sure it would get an Oscar from me.
Having said that, they all give great performances as actors and it's insane to think that the film was made on a budget of just $1.5 Milllion.It might be interesting to see this broken down in to a three part TV special that gives more detail about Chiron during each time period and perhaps to see a fourth special that shows what came next?"
MOONLIGHT,5 November 2016,10/10,"One of the most interesting and touching stories of the year presents the life of a young man in three acts. He is introduced as a young boy, thin and smaller than his peers, consequently, he's harassed and bullied by several boys. Although it is not obvious, he has a sensitive nature and this also makes him the target of many, including his own mother. Luck intervenes to have him meet Juan and his girlfriend, who become surrogate fathers who manage to keep him sane and alive. In the meantime, things get worse at home when his mother becomes addicted to drugs. In short,life is hell.Next, he's shown as a teen, still looking vulnerable and pretty much a loner. This time he's been chosen by the school's bully, who constantly picks on him, with plenty of insults and physical trauma. It's during this phase of his life that he realizes who he truly is, giving him a little hope when he thinks he has met a kindred soul. However, events take a darker turn, and he must resort to become harder in order to survive.The last third of the film continues to show his evolution. Now he is physically different, but when the camera sets on his face, we can see turmoil and pain. His mother is still around, and they are able to finally understand some of the tragedies they have endured. A voice from the past calls, and he sees a glimmer of hope and confusion.When the two friends meet again, feelings become more and more complex. Years have gone by, choices are made, and matters can't be resolved easily. Because violence has always been a threat, the meeting is tense, with new disappointments lurking and more darkness seems to be imminent. Words exchanges are kept to the minimum, with much being told with furtive looks, sighs. This piece shows the strongest performances, and it grows more intense as it reaches the shocking resolution. Like most of the best films, it will lead to conversation. Many will argue it doesn't provide enough. Others might be satisfied because there's a hint of what is possible.""Moonlight"" is full of emotions, twists, and amazing acting. It delivers powerful punches, never boring, and with much insight on its subject matter. 2016 is proving to be quite a strong year."
MOONLIGHT,8 July 2019,10/10,"I had only seen this film once before my rewatch, and that was years ago in theaters. I remember thinking that ""Moonlight"" was a masterpiece, but not just necessarily for the story it told, more for its ability to capture an intangible emotion and make it feel tactile. There are so many scenes in this film that I can point to and say; ""This scene perfectly captures how it feels like to feel safe"", ""This is how it feels like to feel loved"", or even ""This is how it feels to be alone."" Barry Jenkins has a way of crafting a scene so perfectly that the characters need not even speak for us to know exactly how they're feeling and why they're feeling it. There's something so ethereal yet so human about the way Jenkins crafts this drama about love and its relationship to identity.

MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,,"The false high rating on IMDb only further proved how false the rating system that a dominant film reviewing website could lure people paying their hard earned money to see a lousy deadbeat movie and regret when they left early and stepped out of the theater and cursed themselves as stupid morons who once again were fooled by the false media. I think Donald Trump should twit to allow people to know that besides what he believes CNN, BBC, LA Times...are bunch of garbage news media agencies, this movie reviewing website should also be included.I'm not a racist as all of you out there who would not usually dare to admit what they really think about peoples' races and skin colors, but I have to say that if this ""Moonlight"" would be considered a BEST movie of 2016, then you guys have to know that black or the third world voting members of the Oscar organization might be now a majority force just like the Republicans are the majority members of the Congress that could manipulate the laws, the white voting members are losing their voting power like fields elsewhere in America! People are blindly kissing the behinds of the black people, their creations and their products. I'm not a white American, so my view both to the Whites and the Blacks should be unbiased and fair. I have to remind people in America: Stop kissing the Black so blindly, enough is enough. What's wrong with Hollywood now, after pushing the gay right, gay marriage and inter-racial relationship and marriage, now you guys start to push black gay stuff? This movie is so boring and so mediocre, yet you guys still tried so hard and succeeded to push it down to our throats as ""The Best Movie of 2016""? Yeah, right, was it like our Presidential Election, there's Electoral Vote System, so the Popular Vote meant jacksh@t? What a joke!If this deadbeat boring ""Moonlight"" could be the BEST movie of 2016, then all of your home made videos could be national treasures. If Americans could have voted a white moron and re-elected him for the 2nd term, or voted a 70-year crazy Narcissus brat into the White House, then ""Moonlight"" as the Best Motion Picture of 2016 was not but an understandable surprise. God help America!"
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,,"On the evening of the very day I went to see ""Moonlight"" at a cinema in London, it received the highest accolade of the Aacedmy Awards in Los Angeles, but only after the most dramatic mess-up in Oscar history when originally ""La La Land"" was announced as the winner of the Best Film Award only minutes later for it to be declared that in fact ""Moonlight"" was the actual victor. Even without this memorable fiasco, it would have been a stunning event: the first LGBT film to be awarded the Oscars' top honour and Mahershala Ali as the first Muslim to win an Oscar.It is a remarkable film that tells a moving coming-of-age story of a young gay African-American from Miami in a compelling fashion: a triptych in which each of the three segments is titled by the name used for the central character at that time of his life and in which a different actor pays that character. So Alex Hibbert is Little (around 9), Ashton Sanders is Chiron (about 16), and Trevante Rhodes is Black (approximately 26) - each giving a laconic but mesmerising performance. In a rare movie with an all-black cast, there is strong support from the likes of Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris as Chiron's drug-using mother and Oscar winner Mahershala Ali as Little's protector and mentor. Above all, though, this is a triumph for writer and director Barry Jenkins who adapted Tarell Alvin McCraney's unproduced play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" and utilises a wide palette of techniques and styles to communicate his message.""Moonlight"" is a million miles from ""La la Land"" (which I loved) and will take only a fraction of the box office achieved by the musical. It is slow and painful and will not be to all viewers' taste. But this is what makes cinema such a wonderful art form. We can admire both and the Academy Awards can acknowledge both."
MOONLIGHT,25 November 2016,9/10,"(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Excellent acting fills in some plot holes in a coming-of-age story.GRADE: B+ SYNOPSIS: A child grows up in a harsh world and learns to survive.JIM'S REVIEW: A young black boy grows up in Barry Jenkin's fine film, Moonlight, a thought- provoking character study about a child growing up poor and gay. The episodic structure of the film focuses on the various passages of a boy's life. We sadly watch his troubling initiations into adulthood, told in three acts. In the first chapter we meet Little (Alex Hibbert), a reedy slip of a boy, stooped over and afraid to relate to anyone. Alone, downcast and rejected, he is a survivor. His life consists of a mother (Naomie Harris) addicted to crack, no father, a close friend named Kevin (Jaden Piner), and a drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who becomes his temporary guardian. The odds are stacked against him from the start.In the second chapter, we see him as a teenager, now called Chiron (Ashton Sanders). Still friendly with his buddy, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), he continually battles homophobia, hate, and the mean streets of Miami with varying results.The final section of the film takes us to his late adolescence. Renamed Black (Trevante Rhodes), this boy is a man now. Toughen and savvy, he walks the streets as his turf and continues to exist as a solitary stranger to most he comes in contact with, yearning for a human connection.The events imposed on this child as he goes through life are startling and make the film more profound. Seeing his limited choices for success remaining so far out of reach is powerfully rendered. Little / Chiron / Black is a perpetual victim and we watch his humanity slowly eclipsed by drugs, poverty, and crime. It is all the more effective due to the director's sensitive handling of his subject and the fine ensemble of actors he has assembled.Moonlight spans a number of years but its narrative structure seems to skip some major plot strands in this script adaptation, also by Mr. Jenkins. Essential changes in characters and their situations are stated but not clearly explained. Characters tend to come and go without any conclusion. The moviegoer is expected to fill in the plot holes and needs to contribute to the leaps of logic that are abruptly shown, especially in the film's third chapter.That said, the filmmakers takes its serious subject and makes its point efficiently with its realistic tone, well developed characters, and top-notch acting. The three actors who play the main character in various stages of his life are superb as are the supporting roles, especially Mr. Ali, Andre Holland as the adult Kevin, Janelle Monae as Teresa, and Ms.Harris, who is the only actor who appears in the same role in all three sections of the film (This actress deserves Oscar consideration for her transformative acting range.) While the film never becomes emotionally devastating due to its disjointed episodes and an ending that seems unresolved, Moonlight still remains compelling and casts a haunting glow in this shadow-land of lost souls.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com"
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,8/10,"This movie will break your heart. We start by seeing Chiron as a young boy, largely neglected by his drug-addicted mother, and bulled by other boys at school. He only has one friend at school, Kevin, who seems to be a on-again, off-again friend, and a 20-some drug dealer, who becomes like a father to him.When he's in high school, the bullying gets worse, and Chiron finally strikes back, which lands him in jail. We never find out what happened to the drug dealer from Part One.There he evidently gets into body-building, and comes out a handsome, very muscular young man. What he does for a living I couldn't figure out. Not all the dialogue is comprehensible for those who don't know street slang.He finally gets back together with Kevin, who provides him with about the only tenderness he ever seems to have known.Some reviews say that Chiron is gay. I don't think so. (Not that it really matters, I suppose.) He is a young man desperate for affection, as any human being in his situation would be. He happens to find it with another man.There isn't much dialogue in this movie. Which means that much is conveyed with facial expressions and glances. The actors have to act with their faces, as the great movie actors of old did, and they do a fine job of it. Every i is not dotted, every t is not crossed. But it doesn't matter. You can figure out what's important - a young man finally finding some human warmth in life - and your heart breaks until the very end when you see what his life is like without it."
MOONLIGHT,15 March 2017,4/10,"Moonlight is a film that lacks depth and a plot that would weave it together. If anything it is a display of somewhat random and uninteresting events in a person's life. It is as if the director decided to make a documentary on a random person's life who grew up in a poor part of town with no special significance attached to that person. Through the three stages of the film we see no significant or key events that engage the viewer. Perhaps I need to be a lot more artistic to appreciate it but it may be that viewers create or invent artistic moments in the film because it does not contain it. This was literally a film about nothing. I found myself asking so what? There was nothing gripping and remotely interesting. The critics got this wrong and please do not believe them. I often find that they shove too many big adjectives or words in a single sentence that they believe make them look intelligent. The result is poor grammar and a sentence which makes no sense. So do not trust the film opinion of those who struggle forming basic sentences. I find it a very poor decision that this film won best picture. It is astonishing it was even nominated. We are starting to let go of coherent, deep and well thought of films in favor of incomplete, slow and dull films. In its essence Moonlight is characteristic of new art films that ask you see something that isn't there. To conjure up a feeling or a depth that simply does not exist through its writing, symbolism or directing. Some of the critics for this film will go so far as to say you didn't see the point and then fail to explain it coherently themselves because the reality is you can't. Hot air only gets you high enough. Sadly these films are attracting more sheep or bees to an artificial honey."
MOONLIGHT,26 July 2017,8/10,"When Moonlight won the Oscar for best picture in the biggest shakeup in Hollywood history, it changed the face of how Black Hollywood is recognized by the awards industry. This film, divided into three chapters totaling an hour and 50 minutes, tells a coming of age story of a black man and his family and friends set to an eclectic soundtrack and amazing cinematography not to mention some dramatic acting despite moving at a slow pace."
MOONLIGHT,12 November 2016,8/10,"The first thing that really strikes you about Moonlight is it's all so painfully personal. Perhaps it's the way our earthy, understated and un-glamorous characters are portrayed. Perhaps it's the work of director Barry Jenkins who thrusts us into the story with expressionistic tones and flourishes. Perhaps it's the way our protagonist's near catatonic state forces us to truly drink in his surroundings. I cannot attest if those who have never been to southern Florida will feel the same way, but for me I could actually smell the lightly perfumed ocean breeze and actually felt the sticky humidity that permeated every frame of this film. I felt it all.Moonlight is equally divided into three distinct episodes though given it's intimacy they might as well be called movements. The first, entitled ""Little"" concerns the tortured existence of a 9- year-old boy (Hibbert) living in a rough neighborhood in Miami, Florida. He's bullied by his peers and emotionally abused by his mother Paula (Harris) who throughout the film slowly sinks into ruin with the help of crack cocaine. It is at this point in his life Little is introduced to Liberty City's preeminent drug dealer Juan (Ali) whom he first asks a defining question, ""am I a f****t?""""At some point you've got to decide for yourself who you gonna be. And let nobody make that decision."" - Juan's words sit in the air throughout each movement like a cloud of mosquitoes over dense swamp. As time wears on Little becomes the invisible Chiron (Sanders) then the hard, drug-dealing Black (Rhodes), whose identity and sexual orientation is constantly being defined by the world around him. He speaks very little, choosing instead to silently judge as his mother morphs into a junkie and quietly rages as bullies abuse him. Eventually, after years of turmoil and paths taken in anger, Black finds his defining moments, pursuing and being pursued by schoolmate Kevin (Piner, Jerome and Holland).There is so much to love about Moonlight including the way in which Barry Jenkins lovingly approaches both his themes and his subjects. Through effective use of color and the ever present sheen of the easterly sun and moon, the film glistens with entrancing beauty. There are echos of Terrence Malick and Lynne Ramsay in Moonlight with every extreme closeup a provocation to feel and absorb.Each of our three actors does a tremendous job playing our protagonist with the same raw grace that defines and serves the visual mis en scene of the film. In-between each movement there is a sense that time has past. Things have happened but it is on the audience to infer what, through what is said, and more importantly by what is not. Moments of deep contemplation are not just airless voids but rather miniature mysteries all struggling to answer the central question; who is Chiron?It is at this point the narrative stumbles slightly under the weight of its own socio-economic and political messaging. There are times when Chiron, with his 30-yard stare and ramshackle poverty, is impressed upon to be an empty vessel. The assumed hope is so his tale can be more superficially ubiquitous to the black, gay experience which by this point has only been calcified in film by Pariah (2011). But while Moonlight's larger social themes are enough to label it required viewing, one can't help but think its gambit for universality is a lost opportunity to make the film truly life- changing.Still for every edge to appeal to all, there are half a dozen parts to the story that are glowingly and lovingly singular. Late in the film there is a reunion between Chiron and Kevin whose slow emotional simmer resembles a delicate dance laden with machismo and sweetness. Additionally the customs, attitudes and unique verbal drawl are enough to settle the film's audience into a certain place in time.Moonlight is ultimately a sad but life-affirming film that's not only an important watch but a darn good one. There is a paralyzing, fascinating, beautiful truth to this film. One in which every audience member regardless of race or sexual orientation can walk out of the theater aware of."
MOONLIGHT,16 November 2020,5/10,Yiu gotta be kidding me right? I know how this movie even got an Oscar and please don't fool around we all know why
MOONLIGHT,26 December 2017,,"Moonlight appears to be yet another movie with the backing of the agena pushing P.C. brigade - rave reviews - awards, with a leaning towards questionable propaganda. Its laboured, episodic approach, drains the story of the all important momentum necessary to generate involvement. Its scant script offers little dialogue - making it too difficult to get to know or care much about the troubled characters . Visually, we now all too often see movie makers copying one another with overlong, 'trendy' shots of performer's backs - as they stretch out the time it takes for them to move from one scene to another. The stories main theme is scratched out in predictable fashion with all the expected clich√©s strung together and again, padded out - so it seems to take forever to go virtually nowhere. Some well played, sensitive scenes leave the viewer hoping it may be improving - only to be chopped short by transitioning into another 'chapter' - making it necessary for the viewer to work out who has become whom and what has transpired during the missing years. The string of rather biased critical raves and Academy Awards will leave many viewers disappointed (as it did those at this screening). It features a better than average music score, that has the feel of needing a better vehicle to make full use of its scope. Sadly, this is unworthy of the 118 mins needed to suffer it all the way to the finale - it might have fared better as a short."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,10/10,"Chiron (Alex Hibbert), a shy and withdrawn child dubbed ""Little"" for his meek personality and size, is found hiding from a pack of bullies by Juan (Mahershala Ali), a crack dealer, who takes Chiron to his house where he lives with his girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e). After being fed dinner and allowed to spend the night, Chiron begins to open up. The next morning, Juan delivers Chiron back to his emotionally abusive mother, Paula (Naomie Harris).The only other person in whom Chiron finds companionship is Kevin (Jaden Piner), to whom he begins to grow attached. Chiron and Juan continue spending more time together, the latter teaching Chiron how to swim while advising him to make his own path in life. One night, Juan notices one of his customers smoking crack in a nearby car with Paula. Juan berates Paula for smoking crack while Paula rebuffs him for selling it to her. Nonetheless ashamed, she takes out her frustrations on Chiron. The next morning, Chiron admits his hatred for his mother to Teresa and Juan. After confronting Juan about selling drugs to his own mother, Chiron leaves as Juan hangs his head in shame.Now a teenager, Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) is frequently bullied by one of his peers, Terrel (Patrick Decile), though continuing to remain close to Kevin (now played by Jharrel Jerome). Paula has since become addicted to crack, solicits herself, and coerces Chiron to give her money given to him by Teresa, with whom he continues to spend nights over, despite Juan now being deceased.One night, Chiron has a dream in which Kevin has sex with a woman in the backyard. On another night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a blunt, they discuss their ambitions in life and the nickname Kevin has given Chiron, ""Black."" After a charged moment, the two boys kiss and Kevin gives Chiron a handjob.The next morning, Terrel pressures Kevin into partaking in a hazing ritual, ordering him to punch Chiron, to which he reluctantly complies. Chiron refuses to stay down, forcing Kevin to hit him multiple times. Once Chiron is unable to get up, Terrel and others nearby stomp on him until they are chased away by a security guard. A social worker urges Chiron to reveal the identities of his attackers, but Chiron believes reporting them will not solve anything. The next day, he walks into class and smashes a chair into Terrel's back. Chiron is subsequently arrested. As he is put into a police car, he glares at Kevin, who is standing by."
MOONLIGHT,24 June 2021,7/10,"Moonlight is a well acted film, I thought the acting was pretty good, but not as special as I was hoping for. Ali and Harris have both been nominated in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories at the Oscars, with the former ended up winning and although I thought they were both good, I don't think they were awards-worthy.What is really impressive with was the music. The blend of the original score with pop tunes and classical compositions was perfect in the way it was used to create a feeling of what was happening on screen and in Chiron's head at various points of the film. One of my major problems with the movie was the pacing. A lot of the movie was pretty slow - which sometimes worked, but sometimes didn't. During the first act Chiron didn't talk much, which left most of the heavy lifting to Juan. For me, when you get past the fact Juan is just being a really nice guy, there was little else to be interested in. Harris' role as Paula was good, but she could have been even more dramatic and shocking. The middle act was probably the strongest. Chiron getting bullied, experiencing 'love' and, in a brilliant scene, standing up for himself, did keep my attention.The third act was by far the weakest. Partly it was because it was really slow and partly because it felt uncomfortable. This might just be my perception but for the majority of that act I just felt like it was leading towards a possible love scene, which I didn't want to see. I can appreciate that's not what was intended and it was really more about reconnecting and thinking about how people change."
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2019,8/10,"I don't remember this movie too well. I know it was good the two times I watched it. Some scenes are incredible. The ones that follow the main character. It depicts the thug lifestyle a little too expensively. It's not rough. It's all tainted in the glamour of Hollywood. The acting was good. All the actors were memorable, even the kids. The homosexuality was not very vibrant in the movie.Good. Go see it8 stars"
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,10/10,"Director Barry Jenkins brings a hefty hand to this powerful drama drawing the brooding life of a young boy who grows up to be the man he never expected. Sprawling with powerful storytelling and striking visual heft, this emotionally riveting tackles the harsh truth of what it is like to grow up in a world where no one understands you and having no one standing by your side in your times of tribulations, even the ones you love. And to add spice to the plate, it's all very realistic to the point where you feel like you are witnessing a story of a character but a real-life person. What is it like to be a young African-American growing up in a broken home and struggling to find your place in this world? This film answers this question without pulling many punches. This is not a fun one to watch, it is very hard to sit through at times; but it is very powerful. This film tells the story of a poor young boy named Chiron (played by Alex Hibbert) growing up on the ghetto streets of Miami. He's constantly bullied by kids in the neighborhood, his mother (played by Naomie Harris) is a crack-addict, and has no father. He soon finds levity when he meets a local drug dealer name Juan (played by Mahershala Ali) who becomes a fatherly figure to the young lad. He soon grows up as a young teenager (played by Ashton Sanders) who makes a friend named Kevin (played by Jharrel Jerome) and begins exploring his sexuality while facing against bullies at school. Eventually, he grows up to be a man who's force to face the repercussions of his past.This film is similar in the essence of Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood' as it authentically captures the tribulations of growing up in a mysterious world. The movie however, paints a much bleaker picture where the humor is very few and far in between and the harsh reality of growing up as a young African-American hangs on our shoulders. Beneath the bleak atmosphere however, is a sense of hope that beautifully transpires in the final ten minutes. As the film is divided into three acts, each paints an emotionally absorbing picture of Chiron trying to discover his identity and how to into a world where everyone is at odds him including his mother who is on the crack pipe and displays more anger and frustration to than motherly affection. As he grows up to become a teenager, be begins struggling with his inner demons which eventually puts a price on him when he later grows up to become a young man. Barry Jenkins does an astounding job at mapping out the lead character in each act to the point where each act can strong as a short film of their own. He makes a grueling effort to flesh out each character, and the results are character that powerfully resemble real people with real problems. And to add icing on the cake, the film shines with alluring visual storytelling that is generated by striking cinematography by James Laxton. With nearly every scene shot in tints of blue and yellow, the movie sheds the usual dark, gloomy visual contrivance in favor of a more glamorous visual appeal that speaks emotion for the atmosphere. By all means, it never feels out of place.With the story driven with an episodic narrative, the lead character is portrayed by three separate actors of various ages. The first one on screen is Alex Hibbert who steps in the shoes of the young elementary-school aged Chiron who faces tyranny by the hands of neighborhood bullies and lack of affection from his mother. The kid proceeds with only little dialogue and instead relies on his facial expressions for this performance. From his first few minutes on screen to the end of the first act, he nails it. However, it may not be nearly as impressive as his heartwarming chemistry with drug dealer Juan who's played by Mahershala Ali. Once Juan takes him under his wing, the bond between the two transpires into a powerful chemistry that is greatly flourished not only by Barry Jenkin's direction but also by Ali's mesmerizing performance. Naomie Harris gives an engrossing portrayal as Chiron's mother who wrestles with drug addiction that places an obstacle on her relationship with her son. Although she is painted is a woman consumed with demons, it becomes clear that she deeply loves her son. The lead role is then switched over to Ashton Sanders when Chiron grows up to be a teenager, and his performance stands quite strong as does Jharrel Jerome as his faithful, but troubled companion. The final act consists of Trevante Rhodes in the lead roles who delivers an incredible performance that greatly shines in the one scene with his mother and the final scene with his best friend that is deeply emotional as well as an honest reminder to how life isn't always as how you expect it.Moonlight is an astounding cinematic gem driven by a powerful narrative and visual scale, and greatly stands as one of the most uncompromising films of 2016. It is a story of love, redemption, loss, hope, and one of those rare coming-of-age tales that captures the authenticity without a shed contrivances. Without a doubt, it is a masterpiece that will likely meet great cognition at the Oscars."
MOONLIGHT,27 November 2016,9/10,"Richard Linklater's 2014 Boyhood boasted the tagline ""one family's life; everyone's story,"" but in doing so, courted its most prevalent criticism. The experience of a heterosexual Caucasian boy growing up with a broken family in midwestern suburbia, while impressive in scope, was an oft-told Hollywood parable, fraught with contrivances so familiar they near the archetypal, and hardly representative of its encompassing claims. Simply put, the ""everyone"" Boyhood championed was a cross- section of the country accustomed to having their voices heard. Well, here is director Barry Jenkins' companion piece of American life: a young African-American boy growing up in low-income housing in Miami, told with equally affective, lyrical intimacy, but finding truth in its singularity rather than archetype. Confidently understated, tenderly fragile, and heralding harrowing and heartwarming twists in kind, Moonlight is pointedly not everyone's story, but it's beautiful and resonant enough to be a story that everyone - yes, everyone - should see. Jenkins revisits the recurring motif of Miami waves throughout Moonlight, and they begin to shape the film's form and heartbeat alike. With gentle but propulsive editing, Jenkins lolls back and forth between the formative events of protagonist Chiron's life, drifting between calmer spells and moments of agonizing hope (learning to swim; a tender, seaside first kiss) with the gentle cadence of a seaside swell, amidst a perennial undercurrent of trauma. Jenkins' flair for naturalistic pacing is effervescent, dwelling on the vibrancy of moments, while leaping years forward in time, excluding seminal events in Chiron's life, perfectly bottles the lyrical dreaminess of memory. Carefully unpacking the truth in each glimmer of clich√©, Jenkins courts sympathy, not empathy - this is Chiron's story, not ours, and our job as audience is to bear witness. And this job, thanks to beautiful work by Jenkins and his talented cast, is nothing short of an honour. Beset by chronic bullying (which, Jenkins clearly outlines, extends well beyond the schoolyard), confusion over his sexuality, and the encroaching drug addiction of his mother (the superb Naomie Harris, who masterfully avoids Oscar-bait grandstanding in favour of a more brittle portrait of impotent anger and desperation and bitter humour), the life of ""Lil'"", as he is insultingly branded by his peers, is not a carefree watch. He finds a sole island amidst his sea of hardships, at the home of a kindly drug dealer and his wife (Mahershala Ali and Janelle Mon√°e; both magnificent, and voluminously emotive in their disappointingly fleeting screen time), until his young mind connects the dots to their profiteering off his own mother's downward spiral. It's an almost overwhelmingly devastating moment, and Jenkins doesn't milk it, but allows it to just sit, and the nuances of each character's silent pain to soak in. And if you think that's a flooring scene study, just wait until the film's third act, heralding the most wrenching diner sequence since Robert De Niro and Al Pacino crossed scowls in Heat. Still, Jenkins' adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney's theatrical play is anything but dour. Poignantly concise, Jenkins instead dwells on the vastness of what is left unsaid, as Chiron struggles with the various performances of masculinity thrust upon him by his socioeconomic status throughout the three chapters of his life, and the multitudes of physical and emotional abuse he's still beset by. For a film with so little dialogue, the wealth of feeling Moonlight conveys is staggering. This affective infectiousness is thanks largely to cinematographer James Laxton's harsh contrast between the glaring starkness of daylight, and the vulnerability and exposure it brings, and the meditative, chiaroscuro solace of nighttime, when Chiron (and his audience) can finally find peace. But above all else, Moonlight is Chiron's story, and it would be lost without the phenomenal work of Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes, portraying Chiron in his youth, adolescence, and young adulthood respectfully. Although the three actors are fairly physically dissimilar (itself a commentary on the rampant character growth Chiron experiences), Jenkins stated in an interview that the three were cast for having the same haunted eyes, and it's a bold, wholly lucrative creative choice. All three actors are astonishingly magnetic, bleeding out Chiron's soul in their silence, averted glances, and shrunken nonchalance betraying such a depth of longing. In Chiron's foundational relationship with childhood friend Kevin (equally majestically essayed by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, and Andr√© Holland), the three sets of actors concoct mutually overlapping character arcs that capture some of the year's most jubilant and heartbreaking moments, while always tenderly believable. More lyrical, poetic, and visually inventive than most comparable contemporary portraits of social realism, Moonlight may sashay between moments, emotions, decisions, and regrets with the inevitable lilt of the tides, but leaves a beautiful memory trail infinitely more resonant behind it. Jenkins does not spoon-feed, and the film's artistic stillness and ambiguity may not befit all cinematic sensibilities. But this is fundamentally truthful, essential cinema, and, like his mythological centaur namesake, the story of Chiron is one that should be heard far and wide, and is liable to stay with us for many years to come.-9.5/10"
MOONLIGHT,13 March 2017,8/10,"Before I watched it, my expectations towards ""Moonlight"" weren't all too high. To me it sounded like a bit too much drama, like if you mix every issue dramas tend to deal with together and see what's the result. Gladly I can say that this was not the case. Even though you do have a lot of different topics touched by this film (Poverty, Bullying, Homosexuality, Drug abuse, Growing up and some more), you don't get the impression of being overloaded. In fact, ""Moonlight"" remains a rather slow movie, giving you time to dive into the setting and accept the circumstances one after another, so they don't feel unreal or exaggerated at all.The idea of dividing the movie into three parts according to the main character's names is of course clever, even though I'm not fully convinced because it kind of rips the movie apart.Indeed this is the thing that bothered me the most. There are huge time jumps between some scenes where you aren't really provided context what happens in between. And at that point the character development appeared to be highly unrealistic to me. When he hit his bully with a chair, that seems like an outburst of frustration held back too long. But that doesn't change your personality 180 degree and turn you into a cold-blooded dealer. I just don't buy all that. As much as I liked the film in general, the character development over time became quite lazy just creating facts and not asking about the inner logic.To me, the strongest part was the first part when I could still follow the emotional battles of the lead quite well. Nevertheless, this is a movie that deserves its audience and even though I'm not convinced it is the best, it is certainly one you can award."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,9/10,"Moonlight in my view is the movie that deserves to win Oscar, a spectacular drama, the film has 3 acts, such as Chiron Child, Teenager and Adult, my favorite is it Teenager, the three actors that Chiron does, Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes, all excellent, and the highlight is the incredible performance of Naomie Harris who is a favorite of Oscar, and Mahershala Ali who is great, photography is beautiful, especially in the light of the moon, the relationship of Chiron With Kevin is very well portrayed, and they are adults who understand this relationship more and more, the soundtrack is good, the script is great, and the film has strong moments, it is not a violent movie, stronger, and where we see the Chiron's limit, Moonlight is one of the best films of 2016, if not the best, and deserves very much to win the Oscar for best film of 2016. Note 9.9"
MOONLIGHT,2 April 2017,8/10,"'Moonlight' is a fine example of how a great piece of cinema can be made without an over-the-top plot, unnecessary action and special effects. This is a story about life, told exactly how it is. The story of a young man and his struggles of growing up as an 'outsider'. The film is brilliantly written, acted and directed. All three of the actors who play Chiron are outstanding - as somebody else has pointed out, we know exactly what Chiron is thinking and feeling throughout the film without him even opening his mouth. By the end of the film it felt like I knew him personally.One of the must-see movies of the year. It inevitably won't satisfy everyone, but this is a quality piece of film making and a film I'll remember for a long time."
MOONLIGHT,24 April 2018,7/10,"In three stages of life - youth, adolescence, and young adulthood - the life story of Chiron is told. Chiron is an African-American who grows up in a poor, black community in Miami and later moves to Atlanta. His early life is plagued by bullies and a difficult home life as his single mother is very troubled. During these bad times, he is consoled by surrogate parents that he visits occasionally and his friend Kevin with whom he shares a sexual attraction in the teen years.The scenes of bullying are so accurate that they are sometimes difficult to endure. They include the ""blame the victim"" mindset that too often accompanies bullying. Luckily, there is relief in lighter scenes such as when Chiron visits his surrogate parents where a bond is clearly growing.There is a brilliant scene at the end when the adult versions of Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) and Kevin (Andr√© Holland) are reunited. The mutual sexual tension between the actors under Jenkins' guided hand create a very unique scenario leaving the viewer on edge, wondering what will happen next. Will they actually connect? (It's also fascinating how they resemble the pair in ""Brokeback Mountain"" where one partner is more outgoing while the other is more reserved and afraid due to his difficult past. The same match also occurred in ""Being 17"".)This perfect scene is unfortunately cut too short. If it had continued at the same pace and the viewer saw the men connect, I would have given this film as high a rating as most others are giving it. It's hard to guess why Jenkins (also the film's writer based on a story by Tarell Alvin McCraney) made this choice. It may be the general sexist attitude among filmmakers regarding love scenes between same-sex couples. When such scenes are between two women, their naked bodies are seen flailing across the screen for several minutes but this is rarely, if ever, the case when the bond is between two men. To use the clich√©d excuse of ""leaving the rest to the viewer's imagination"" is a cowardly cop-out. Another reason an extended love scene would have worked: the love would have helped balance the many hardships exposed in the beginning. This criticism is not so much against ""Moonlight"" but against the film industry in general. In fairness, ""Moonlight"" is more courageous than most films.There is much else to praise in ""Moonlight"". In addition to the great performances by Rhodes and Holland (who also create great chemistry together), there are also praiseworthy performances by Naomie Harris as Chiron's mother (her final scene is a standout) and Mahareshala Ali as Chiron's surrogate father in the film's beginning. Credit must also be given to the young actors who played the younger versions of both Chiron (Alex Hibbert and Ashton Sanders) and Kevin (Jaden Piner and Jharrel Jerome). Much discussion has occurred lately regarding the under-utilization of the very talented pool of black actors. When movies like this one use such talent so generously, all moviegoers benefit."
MOONLIGHT,20 November 2016,10/10,"Juan tells ""Little"" Chiron that a little old lady nicknamed him Blue when she saw him among other boys fishing in the moonlight: ""Running around, fishing in a boat of light. In moonlight, black boys look blue. You're blue. That's what I'm gonna call you: 'Blue'.""But Juan rejects that name. He won't be Blue. ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you."" Ironically, Juan refuses to be identified with a colour. But his life leads him into a Black stereotype nonetheless: the flashy drug dealer. The film's focus on black alienation and disenfranchisement makes the film seem like a parallel universe that occasionally intersects with ours. White characters are few and emblematic: a cop, the obese customers in Kevin's greasy spoon, where the American flags are the only sign of America's ideals, and ineffectual at that. In that key restaurant scene where Chiron and Kevin reconnect, the white customers act as if the blacks were invisible. Kevin treats his customers graciously ‚Äî with no response whatsoever. One white man sits alone as if in his own bubble, not responding to anything, as bleak an existence as the blacks'. The very setting of the restaurant evokes the civil rights struggle, where a black man at a counter was a challenge to the social ""order."" When Chiron enters he checks out the scene, then sits at the counter. Kevin moves him to a booth for his personal service. As a barometer of the African American's place today the film reveals the races in desolate isolation from each other. Chiron and Kevin both pass through prison. But vertical bars are a constant motif in all the interiors, the houses, the school. Even the outside world is the black man's prison. Food is another motif that unites the three stages in Chiron's growth ‚Äî the community and love expressed in cooking: the meals Juan and Teresa give the boy starved for affection; the meal the adult Kevin makes for the grown Chiron, rekindling their lost and furtive intimacy and love. In the intervening food scene, set in the school cafeteria, Chiron is fragile and alone and the brute Terrell prepares young Kevin to assault Chiron.But the reticent Chiron is not himself until he drops his pretence to casualness. He tells Kevin he hasn't touched or been touched by any other man but Kevin. The touching is emotional as well as physical. Now the massively muscled Chiron and the warm, generous Kevin finally find grace in each other's arms. This blues song ends happily.Significantly, the two men's tenderness happens in Kevin's rental near the water. Water scenes mark key turning points in Chiron's life, mobilizing its association with the subconscious and the origin of life. Juan slips into a fatherly role when he teaches young Chiron to swim, to keep his head above water and advance. His sexual initiation by Kevin happens over a joint at oceanside.Perhaps the film's dominant theme is the mystery of manliness. In his boyhood Chiron doesn't have a father, just a druggie mom bringing in strangers. Juan becomes his surrogate father. Though Juan would determine his identity for himself, rejecting the Blue nickname, he breaks down when Little Chiron rejects him: ""Do you sell drugs?"" We don't see Juan again after he weeps at Chiron's rejection. The teenage Chiron finds refuge in Teresa's house, not Juan's. She only refers to him when she recalls him giving the boy gin. When he's neither mentioned nor seen again we infer Juan is another of those disappearing dads, perhaps a casualty of his drug trade. Juan has broken his promise: ""Never let you go.""Juan's influence is clear when we meet the adult Chiron as Black, his nickname an echo of Juan's rejected Blue. Chiron has grown into a Juan lookalike with his powerful build, the result of his jail time, his drug dealing empire, the black bandana, the diamond ear-rings and golden chains and silver teeth. At that vulgar flash many whites tend to sneer ‚Äî but it's not unlike Donald Trump's golden furniture and guilt-edged estate. Chiron has to remove the silver teeth to eat Kevin's meal. The flash fails to nourish. Chiron's essential choice is between the Juan's flash and Kevin's tenderness.Juan seems sensitive to Little Chiron's nature when the boy asks what a faggot is and if he might be one. ""A faggot is a word used to make gay people feel bad."" Chiron will only later learn he is one. In the school scenes Terrell and others bully Chiron mercilessly because they read his ""softness"" as a lack of manliness. Young Kevin has learned to play the game, so he flaunts his hetero success to explain a detention and however reluctantly obeys Terrell's orders to beat up Chiron. This after they've had sex. The film's climactic manliness is the tenderness when Kevin and Chiron meet again."
MOONLIGHT,25 April 2021,7/10,"Tho I think some points could've been well-developed, I genuinely loved the experience of watching this one. The story is sensible, well-conducted and all performances are great. It'll definitely leave you wanting more."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2018,4/10,"Good effort at depicting low lives realistically but too many gaps in the story while too slow at other times. Maybe they tried to do too much for a single film while a miniseries would have filled the gaps. But it is doubly tough to hang on a story of mobster/homersexual. Then again, I suspect all mobsters are homersexuals. Like the romans in the roman empire..."
MOONLIGHT,28 November 2016,1/10,"Everything you read about this one is a lie. It's not a masterpiece,  will not ""open your eyes"". What we have is a man-on-man love story  about a boy called Little who suspects he's ""different"" and is told so  (in no easy terms) by his classmates. When he slams one of these guys  in the head with a chair his life of crime begins, as he evolves into a  successful but lonely drug dealer (Sweet!). When he reconnects with the  guy who seduced him it becomes a happily-ever-after affair. As a Street  Drama the movie is lame. The makers of this film, and the reviewers,  are spineless deceivers. If they had the courage of their convictions  they'd be up-front concerning what the movie is about."
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2020,9/10,"Love, hardship and the danger from those who just don't understand who you are. Moonlight goes from uplifting to heartbreaking in two hours, but it's a stunning portrait of vulnerability that has gone unforgotten in film history. That's a beautiful thing to know. Moonlight can and will stand the test of time. Consider this The 400 Blows for the tech age. You really can relate to Chiron here. He's an innocent boy who catches hell through no fault of his own. A victim of his upbringing and his environment. But lucky for him, he has a mentor and friend in Mahershala Ali's character Juan. Well, that's not even an good enough description. Juan is a guardian angel, and to tell you the truth, not just in the general sense. He only appears in the first chapter and disappears. Where did he go? Where did he come from? Who is he? Barry Jenkins may have purposely left all of that information out. Mysterious or mystical? I'll let you be the judge."
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2017,7/10,"Oscar buzz is always something that garners excitement. I'm always enthralled to see a critically acclaimed award worthy film to see what the hype is about myself. Moonlight is a film about a man named Chiron. He is a gay black male growing up around bullying, hate, and an uncaring and unresponsive mother. Chiron's life is told in three phases: as a little boy, as a teenager in high school, and as an adult. Three actors portray Chiron and all of them are impressive. The subject matter is heavy and delivered with an unhinged feeling of reality.Young Chiron has to deal with a mother who is inattentive and is addicted to drugs. He seeks help and comfort from a caring couple played by Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monae. The second segment is probably the toughest to watch as teenage Chiron in his quiet and withdrawn nature has to deal with his first experience of homosexuality and all that comes with it. What comes with it? Bullying, which is intense. He gets picked on and suffers emotional and physical abuse. This causes him to snap and violently attack his bully which leads to his arrest. The third segment, Chiron is an adult and a drug dealer, however this is the most satisfying segment as Chiron gets closure on a lot of relationships and problems that previously plagued his life.The cinematography in the film is excellent. There are times where the camera-work is personal, such as in the school fight. The camera takes a first person view in this instance, which allows you to be in the fight and experience the blows firsthand. This also happens a few times when portraying Chiron's drug addicted mother. The score is also fantastic at points and becomes touching towards the end. The film looks crisp and refined behind the lens of the still relative newcomer, Barry Jenkins.The films authenticity makes it so powerful. Chiron could be any real disadvantaged kid growing up in a shady area filled with fighting and drugs. Chiron can't help that he was born into this ugly life, and no matter how hard he tries to get away from it, something pulls him in. In spite of his disadvantaged circumstances Chiron tries to find solace and inner peace with the problems and relationships in his life. It does not always have to be bleak, the past is the past the future is what you make of it.The performances from just about everyone is great. There are a few newcomer performances all of which work very well. I especially liked Naomie Harris as Chiron's drug addicted mother. The final scene with adult Chiron and older Harris is tense but relieving. Overall, its a strong film by Barry Jenkins, one that is loaded with very beautiful scenes and some really harrowing moments. Its a very solid effort one that you will think about long after seeing the film. We could have a strong award season contender here.7.5/10"
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2019,6/10,"Based on the surprise win of Best Picture at this year's Oscars, I had high expectations for Moonlight (2016). There were some fantastic, motivational, and inspirational films in the running for this award, including the ""follow your dreams"" story of La La Land (2016), the ""communication is key"" story of Arrival (2016), and the ""overcoming adversity"" story of Hidden Figures (2016). So, what did Moonlight have to offer? In my opinion, not much; but maybe that was because I'm a straight white (you could argue, privileged) male and there was little to relate to in this film.Sure, the cinematography was impressive at times, but there wasn't any story that I felt was impactful enough to warrant its award. I will give credit to Mahershala Ali, as his performance was certainly deserving of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. So, what lessons does Moonlight give us? Do we need to find good mentors in life? A nurturing home life can prevent many problems? Life is hard, get over it? It seems to me that these lessons are self-explanatory. If anything, this movie should give an emphasis to parents. If you're a mother, don't do drugs. If you're a father, be there for your family.As is usually the case with most Best Picture winners, I can't help but think that this movie won because something else should have won before. If you want a better ""coming of age"" film, Boyhood (2014) had a much more impressive production. If you want a better ""coming out"" film, Brokeback Mountain (2005) could fill that spot. If you want a better ""black"" film, Do the Right Thing (1989) is a fantastic example. Maybe it's the combination of its parts; I don't know. What worries me the most is the thought that this film won because of the social pressures put upon the Oscars from last year's #OscarsSoWhite controversy. Should a sub-par film win just so the Academy can prove that they have ""diversity""? But again, I'm just a privileged, straight, white guy, so maybe I just don't get it.An OK movie with nothing significantly new to offer, I give Moonlight 3.0 stars out of 5."
MOONLIGHT,6 January 2017,9/10,"Remember the movie Boyhood? The one that took twelve years to make and followed a child from Texas from childhood through his first college year? I certainly did and it was even my favorite movie of 2013. I felt that it followed childhood in an honest method that was very entertaining and had a lot of rewatch value. Whenever I brought this up with people, a lot of them told me that they didn't like the movie as it didn't speak to them. At first, I felt their opinion was simply over the movie and that their frustrations were not justified. After I saw Moonlight, it got me to rethink my perception on those people.I realized that while I felt Boyhood was personal, it doesn't speak for a lot of people who grew up differently. Some children have even harder lives given their circumstance. While I cannot reflect honestly, there are a lot of unfortunate people that have to see the world in a darker fashion. What I might have seen are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and supporting adults, may only be seen as privilege to those that only see criminals and drug use. Moonlight shows a different kind of childhood. Sort of like Boyhood, Moonlight follows our main character through different stages of life. In the first part, young Chiron is nicknamed ""Little"" for his small size and quiet personality is the target of bullies who see him as an easy target. He hides in an abandoned motel where he's later found by crack dealer Juan (played by Mahershala Ali). The man takes the young boy to his house where his girlfriend Teresa (played by Janelle Mon√°e) lives. They feed him dinner and let him spend the night. These kind gestures get Chiron to open up to them. Juan returns him to his home where his emotionally abusive mother Paula (played by Naomie Harris) scolds her son for not coming home after school.It seems that the only other personal that Chiron can open up to is his friend Kevin who remains his best friend through high school. The rest of the movie shows his world as his mother descends further into crack addition and his neighborhood becoming tougher. In the next two segments, one being him in high school and the last of him being a young adult, Chiron starts to discover something about himself that he's scared to talk about.I don't want to give too much away as what makes Moonlight unique is its portrayal of the African American community. Not that I haven't seen it before, but the direction understands that with the direction that it went, very few movie have courage to talk about it in the open. What is it exactly? I honestly can't say or I'd spoil it. Like Boyhood, it's smart with it's decision to let the side characters have more personality until our main character gets older. All three actors that play Chiron (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes) are phenomenal in their segments. Each of them capture a unique kind of evolution that is often played too over-the-top in sitcoms.In fact, I'd go as far to say that all the acting in this is great. I'm serious when I say that this is an amazing ensemble cast where everyone is perfect. Though it's hard to pick, I'd say that my favorite came from Mahershala Ali who is the closest thing to a father that the main character has. I can understand why Moonlight is at the top of a lot of best movies of 2016 lists.I'll give this nine Miami sunsets out of ten. Though this is really hard movie to watch, I think everyone should watch this at least one. Moonlight is a little movie with large ideas. I'd say give it a watch if you want something that's more engaging then entertaining."
MOONLIGHT,10 November 2016,8/10,"Berry Jenkins gets the credit and the blame. This is the kind of movie critics love. That doesn't mean you are going to have a good time at the movies. It is tough and gritty and at times hard to watch. Would you expect any less in a story of growing up poor, black and gay in Miami? The performances are riveting and will be noticed in awards season.The only flaws might be in technical areas. The cinematography tries to be arty but at times is a distraction. The sound was such that you strained to hear the dialogue. The other problem is the written and directed syndrome. It is a tad too long. Sometimes scenes seem to start too early and go on too long. The many fades to black feel long.This movie effectively transports the viewer to a environment not usual seen. It is done with passion and sensitivity. The movie is in limited release but worth seeking out. The shared audience gasp at the chair to the bully scene works best with an audience. If you can't find it in a theater, be sure to see it on another platform. It's not a good time, but it's a very good movie."
MOONLIGHT,22 February 2017,8/10,"Moonlight tells the story of an African-American man & showcases his life, from childhood to adulthood. Chiron(Ashton Sanders), also known as Little(Alex Hibbert) & Black(Trevante Rhodes) struggles with various aspects in his life, while growing up in a shady neighborhood in Miami. Moonlight is a great movie. However, it is a bit dragging with nothing significant happening for most of its run-time. This works in the film's favor because this way, there are a handful of scenes that stand out. Director Barry Jenkins has put the spotlight on a life, that many people might have gone through or, are still going through now. The performances are the highlight of the movie. All the three actors namely, Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders & Trevante Rhodes, who play Chiron at different stages in his life, are phenomenal. Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome & Andre Holland are impressive as Kevin(9), Kevin(16) & Kevin, respectively. Janelle Monae is superb as Teresa. Naomie Harris is spectacular as Paula. Mahershala Ali is awesome as Juan. The rest of the cast is effective. Moonlight is not a must watch but is worth a watch, if you want to watch all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture."
MOONLIGHT,3 December 2016,7/10,"It's that time of year, boys and girls, time to head to the Art House Cinemas to catch out little Independent Oscar contending films. ¬†We start this year's journey with MOONLIGHT.Written and Directed by Barry Jenkins, MOONLIGHT tells the story of an¬†African-American male¬†growing up in the drug-riddled streets of Miami. ¬†MOONLIGHT is actually three films in one as we catch this story when the male¬†is young, as a teenager and as a twenty- something adult. ¬†Each story is self contained in and of itself and when put together the three tales build a larger picture.Ultimately the larger story that the three tales tell don't¬†payoff well and, therefore, this film falls short of the lofty praise - and Oscar contention - that it was billed to be, but, despite that, there is much, much to like here.Starting (and ending) with the performances. ¬†The main character, Chiron, is played by 3 different young men (Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and, especially, Trevante Rhodes)¬†and each one brings poignance, strength¬†and vulnerability to the screen. ¬†Chiron is shaped by his environment and each one of the actors portraying Chiron acts and reacts to the the forces in his life.And these forces are strong and interesting to watch through the first part of the film.Starting with the strong work of Mahershala Ali (House of Cards, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay films) as a drug dealer that takes the young Chiron under his wing as a father figure and shows him some love and compassion that is missing in Chiron's life. ¬†Chiron is also influenced by the two mother-figures in his life - ¬†drug¬†addicted¬†Paula, his birth mother (portrayed with great intensity by Naomi Harris) and the loving Teresa (an under-used Janelle Monea) each steer Chiron in ways that will influence him later on.But it is the 3rd part of the film, where Chiron is an adult and is still searching for love and compassion where this film, ultimately, falls short for me. ¬†Despite strong performances ¬†by Trevante Rhodes (as the adult Chiron) and Andre Holland as his childhood friend, Kevin, the resolution of these chapters of his story end quietly and a little disappointingly. ¬†The build up does not resolve in a worthwhile payoff.A good enough film - with great ambition and good acting - that could have used a little more script polish and a stronger conclusion to the story. ¬†Writer/Director Barry Jenkins is one to keep an eye on in the future.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
MOONLIGHT,14 May 2017,2/10,"Viewing this movie is like watching paint dry and no matter what good features it has the film is mostly boring and tedious. For all sorts of political and other reasons ""the media"" et al have decided to laud this picture as some kind of masterpiece; I respectfully but strongly disagree.And it is insulting to black people that Hollywood has decided to now go overboard in its' praise to try to atone for years of ignoring black minorities.The story shows different phases of a young black man's life, who comes from a broken home, has a gay experience and eventually becomes a drug dealer. Are we meant to have any sympathy or even empathy for him? The majority of people, black or otherwise, do not turn into criminals just because of their upbringing or their possible sexual orientation.The film moves along at a snails pace, the acting is underplayed to the extent of being not interesting. And the truth is nothing really happens in the movie except that everyone in it is usually either unhappy or feeling sorry for themselves. Maybe if they put a few white people in the show it would have livened things up:2 and a half, rounded down =2/10."
MOONLIGHT,14 November 2016,9/10,"Subtlety. It's a rare commodity in film. Most movies seem to feel that they have to beat the Movie Fan over the head with their message ‚Äì or are so loud and/or flashy that the Movie Fan doesn't really get much of a chance to consider the message. Making a movie built around the concept of subtlety takes talent, patience and guts. ""Moonlight"" (R, 1:51) is such a film. It's the story of a black boy growing up in Miami and learning to deal with the challenges of being raised by a drug-addicted mother, getting bullied by his classmates for being different and trying to come to terms with his sexuality and find his place in the world. This movie, loosely based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unproduced play entitled ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"", comes right out and tells us very little¬Ö but manages to say much.The film, adapted and directed by Barry Jenkins, is divided into three distinct sections, each opening with a black title card and white letters which give us only the number of that particular chapter and that chapter's name ‚Äì the name that Chiron, the main character, is known by during that period in his life. ""i. Little"" introduces us to Chiron (Alex Hibbert), a small, quite boy who seems to get no joy from life. He has only one friend, a boy named Kevin (Jaden Piner), and is constantly bullied by the other kids. Chiron's mother (Naomie Harris) alternates between neglecting and verbally abusing him. ""Little"" meets a drug dealer named Juan (an Oscar-worthy Mahershala Ali) who becomes a father figure to Little and encourages him, with the help of Juan's kindly girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e), at whose house Little sometimes also gets a meal and has a place to sleep when things get especially bad with his mother.""ii. Chiron"" features a teenage Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders), who is as joyless and nearly as quiet as he was when he was known in the neighborhood as ""Little"". His mother has become even more desperate and pathetic, and the bullying continues, but with more severe consequences. Chiron maintains his relationship with the few positive influences in his life, especially Teresa and Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), who are the only two people who seem to really understand Chiron and accept him for who he is. In ""iii. Black"", Chiron (Trevante Rhodes), now going by the nickname that Kevin gave him years earlier, has moved to Atlanta, but takes advantage of an opportunity to reunite with Kevin (Andr√© Holland). Seeing how these two young men turned out continues to showcase this film's subtle storytelling style.""Moonlight"" is an artful, subtle and powerful film. The three actors who played Chiron at different ages were chosen not so much for their overall physical resemblance to each other, but based on the similarities in their eyes, which are easy to notice in the movie poster. Beyond that, the three actors (as well as the three actors who played Kevin) had no contact with the others playing their character during filming, allowing all of them to portray their own interpretations of their character. Those eyes and those character portrayals effectively and engagingly tell an especially potent coming-of-age story, while Jenkins gives us an artful, creative and unforgettable film. ""A"""
MOONLIGHT,30 March 2017,5/10,"You always get the feeling that the Oscars are more of a Hollywood PR event than a real competition. Many awards seem to be presented to even things out from previous years. Moonlight won the Best Picture award, but it certainly wasn't my favourite movie of the year. Having said that there are very few Best Picture awards that I'd agree with!Moonlight is a coming of age movie about Chiron who we see develop across three different ages. It is an all black cast and Chiron has some considerable challenges in his life. His mother Paula is addicted to drugs and he lives in a very poor neighbourhood. Paula is played by Naomie Harris and her acting is probably the stand out part of the film. Ashton Sanders also does a pretty good job in the lead. It's hard to feel too much of a connection with any of the characters though which is the thing that lets down the movie.It's worth seeing just to see if you agree with the Oscar panel. Personally I didn't."
MOONLIGHT,14 January 2017,9/10,"In a brilliant telling of a young man's rough upbringing and struggles with life and love, Barry Jenkins's award winning film is moving and poetic. The movie is separated into three parts starting with a young boy nicknamed Little (Alex R. Hibbert). Little falls under the tutelage of Juan (Mahershala Ali) when he is found in an abandoned crackhouse. Juan brings Little home to his house where he meets Teresa (Janelle Monae). With almost no dialogue, Little conveys the early life of a world-weary young boy who has seen too much too soon. When he does start talking, he asks tough questions of his new mentor.The movie jumps to high school where Little, now going by his given name Chiron (Ashton Sanders), is tormented by bullies and witnesses the decline of his drug addict mother Paula (Naomie Harris). He struggles with his sexuality but finds affection in his childhood friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). Eventually, he stands up to the bullies and winds up arrested for his bravery.

MOONLIGHT,31 January 2017,7/10,"Seldom do I go to see a movie where I know so little about the plot as this one. I knew it was a ""coming of age"" drama about a young man growing up in a black neighbourhood in Miami. Period. That ignorance was bliss (so that's the way this review will stay: I will avoid my usual high-level summary here). For there are twists in this story that you don't see coming, and moments of such dramatic force that they are cinematically searing.Playing the young man, Chiron, over three stages of his life are the actors Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes. However, Mahershala Ali, who plays Juan - the drug dealer with a heart - has been the one with all the awards visibility (having this week won the Screen Actors Guild Supporting Actor award, as well as being within the ensemble cast award for the upcoming ""Hidden Numbers""). For the avoidance of doubt, Ali and all of these other actors are excellent, as is Jharrel Jerome (in his feature film debut) as Chiron's 16-year old friend Kevin. But the performance that really spoke to me was that of Ashton Sanders, who has both an uplifting and heartbreaking role as the ""middle"" Chiron and delivers it supremely well. A real breakout role for him.Also shining with a dramatic and extremely emotional performance is London's own Naomie Harris (""Spectre""), justifiably nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar. Unlike last year's insipid and dull ""Our Kind of Traitor"", where she was given criminally little to do, here she is blisteringly real as a caring mother spiralling down an addiction plug-hole. A career best.Grammy-nominated musician Janelle Mon√°e, in her feature film debut, is also eminently watchable alongside Mahershala Ali as Juan's girlfriend Teresa.Above all, this powerful ensemble is the best evidence possible that the diversity arguments all over last year's Oscars were 100% correct. These are all blisteringly realistic performances by black actors that must surely move viewers regardless of their colour or creed.The film has eight Oscar nominations, and I definitely agree with the acting nominations to Maharhala Ali and Naomie Harris. I'd also agree with the award for music to Nicolas Britell (""The Big Short"") which is astonishingly eclectic and jarringly appropriate to the story that unfolds. I could even go along with the Best Film Editing nomination, although I am hardly an expert in the subject.The remaining nominations are for Best Picture, Best Director (Barry Jenkins), Best Writing Adapted Screenplay (also Barry Jenkins) and Best Cinematography (James Laxton). However, there my opinion diverges with the Academy and - I suspect - many critics. Yes, this is a really engrossing film with a fine and surprisingly non-standard Hollywood ending. It is certainly well worth watching, but is it a top film of the year? No, I don't think so. There are some aspects of the film that just plain irritated me.Firstly, the camera work is frequently of the hand-held variety, particularly in the first half of the film, that leads to a serious case of seasickness if you are sitting anywhere other than the back row of the cinema.More crucially for me, the film introduces two fantastic and atypical characters, but then - inexplicably - the script just unceremoniously dumps them with hardly any further reference made. I found that enormously frustrating and mystifying and spent the rest of the film waiting for a closure that never came.There is also enormously pervasive use of the ""N-word"", right from the opening music track, which is shocking (at least to a white audience). It is probably designed to shock, but after a while the shock wears off and it becomes more tiresome than offensive.Based on all the Oscar hype then, this was a bit of a disappointment. But that view is purely relative to all of the great Oscar Best Film candidates I've seen in the last few weeks. It is still a very interesting film due to the story that goes off in a novel and surprising direction, and one that is worthy of your movie dollar investment.(For the graphical review of this film please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook)."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,9/10,"I mean I suspect the subject matter might be hard for some to overcome, and rate this film on its own merits. If one does, you'd have to come to the conclusion that anything under a 7/10 is ludicrous. I'm stuck between 9 and 10, and a little disturbed how so many films hover in the mid-8's for so long and then this is at 7.7.This is a fantastic work of art. ""Moonlight"" follows its protagonist through three segments of his life, each powerful on its own. All the actors cast to fill the roles make the transitions seamless, even though the characters change physically and emotionally. Production-wise, ""Moonlight"" is a ray of light; each frame, in my opinion, a work of perfection. The cinematography, lighting, and soundtrack create a rich, deep world of pain, healing, hope and style. This is near flawless story-telling, and the films balance between the homosexual drama, and the tough ghetto setting shreds stereotypes, and makes everyone rethink the subject.The 'boring' reviews are flat-out ridiculous! At first the ""Boyz in the Hood(10)meets Brokeback Mountain(8)"" comparison sounds crass and ridiculous, and both are good films and worthy company. This might be as good as Singletons similarly groundbreaking film(the acting is even stronger)and it IS clearly better than Brokeback -a far more in depth examination of its protagonist and those around him. It's really more like Scorcese's Goodfellas in how the film looks, sounds, and in the end, works. This is a clash of two worlds in part because no one has told the story. The entire film took guts to make, and obviously a deft touch to make it so well. .SUperb film! 1/10 to 3/10 reviews are as ridiculous and as unfair as any I've seen, especially in these numbers, but then again, what did I(or should we) expect. Take your agendas out of movie-rating. Well-deserved Best Picture nod. No controversy here about anything, unless you're the one bringing it to the table. Moves in front of ""Hell or High Water"" for the current top spot in my top-25 for 2016, 49/90 through the watchlist.Let me put it this way. Even if one thought the films' story or characters, or acting was subpar(which im having a hard time even typing), you still would have to concede this film looks superlative. The camera-work, lighting, and sound alone would deserve a 6, All by themselves. And the realization that this is a feature film debut, from a reviewer who's seen nearly 4400 films, is truly mind-boggling. One film in, I will watch everything this director makes."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2020,9/10,No way La La Land even comes close to this movie. The movie plays like a slow and sad symphony that blossoms into something more beautiful.
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,10/10,"I'm in a dilemma! I saw Moonlight today and now have a tie for the movie I'd vote for the Best Film Academy Award. My sentimental favourite is La La Land which I've seen twice and think it's the most original and .entertaining film of the year but If Moonlight wins I'll be happy too. I was very moved and affected by this movie perhaps because of being bullied and bashed in my childhood for being gay. Moonlight takes us on a journey of a young African American boy Chiron or Little who knows he's different and battles with his unhappiness and his mothers drug addiction coupled with his classmates bullying and cruelty, and children can be cruel I know. We follow Chiron as he's befriended and shown the first kindness in his life by Juan, a superb supporting acting role by Mahershala Ali and his girlfriend Teresa Janelle Monae .Then the journey changes to Chiron's sexual awakening and the consequences of a cruel betrayal and denial by the object of his desire and affection. It's a wonderful movie deservedly nominated for 8 Academy awards and if La La Land loses to this movie I won't be too sad. We saw this with captions and I think it helped in appreciating the movie ."
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2021,3/10,"Slow pretentious oscar bair. I gave this movie 2 shots, and both times I was left bored. Sure I can see that its a good movie, with compatent features. But man does this story feel hollow and senceless. If you make a life movie, at least make it more interesting than mine.3/10: sjoop"
MOONLIGHT,3 November 2016,9/10,"Decide for yourself who you are, or others make the decision for you. Moonlight showcases three stages of a young man's life and his struggles to counter the toxic masculinity that pervades the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. Wounds inflicted by classmates as well as by his mother, are not nearly as harmful as those he causes for himself. Feelings of worthlessness and shame are aggravated by a solitary nature, predilection for silence and denial of intimacy. Still, there is hope that others who are generous, patient and kind, will show him a better way to live. There is light that illuminates and uplifts, other than that from the sun.This atmospheric, sensual and luminous film gives strength to those who wish to live authentic lives and who grapple with identity in the face of adversity. The writer, who is from Miami, appeared after the showing to discuss the ""events that made me the man I was."" He claims, rightfully, that a story ""has to touch you in order for it to touch other people."" So he made the story personal and real. It is well that he did so, for the film resonates deeply with our hearts. The film's beautiful cinematography is up close and personal too, the frames bring us close to the characters and their experiences. A sizzling soundtrack includes Brazilian crooner Caetano Veloso. I love that the main character finds refuge in the ocean. So do I."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2017,7/10,"This is an emotional independent ""arty"" film set in the 1980's Miami, a coming of age drama / character study. With an all black cast, the protagonist has no father figure, but finds a surrogate father in Juan (who heads a local drug-dealing gang), he lives in an urban ghetto, life is harsh. His mother is a drug addict, who is a prostitute to earn money for feed her drug problem.The story is played over 3 acts.Act 1; the child ""Little"" - He has difficulty making human connections except for Juan. Act 2; the teenager ""Chiron"" - Suffers bullying at school, begins to discover who he is and his sexuality, is betrayed by Kevin after his first homosexual encounter with him. Act 3; the adult ""Black"" - Grows very strong, a confident drug dealer, comes out.An interesting plot, but not without problems. After Juan was painted as an important influence on ""Little"" I was left wondering what happened to him in acts two and three. The film ends very abruptly, I'm sure the intention was for the viewer to fill in the blanks, although I anticipated this might have been the type of ending to expect and this made the anti-climax frustrating for me. Though a good film, it isn't excellent. I really wanted to like this film a lot more than I did. Over-hyped for me, or I probably missed something! (Sorry B.F.I.)"
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,7/10,"I am always worried to watch films that gives a hype. Oscar winner Moonlight was also such a film. Totally disappointed.The movie is very light. Do not expect something from it, then you may love it.Three stages of a person (Chiron) are depicted in the movie, as shown in the famous poster. The three stages are divided into Little, Cheron and Black. That is what he is called in the film through the stages. He had a very bad childhood of getting bullied by the school kids and ignored by his drug addicted mother. Juan, a drug dealer was the only hope for him. He took shelter at Juan's house when kicked out by his mother. Then comes the teenage. He was touched by his friend Kevin. Some dramatic situations changes his life. The last stage is his youth. By the time, there was a great physical change in him, but did he really change...?Some of the frames in the film were notable and worth appreciating. Camera work was also excellent. The lighting and color selection was brilliant. Actors also did a great job.If you are going to watch the movie, do not watch with high expectation.#KiduMovie"
MOONLIGHT,2 February 2020,8/10,"On its face, the story of Moonlight might seem to be a ¬®woke¬® victimology morality tale. There¬¥s the poverty, the drugs, the plight of young black males in the United States born into urban slums, often in fatherless households, and where their most obvious route to ¬®success¬® is to become involved in the perpetuation of the very drug trade which has destroyed so many of their brothers¬¥ lives. Overladen is a tale of the added difficulties for gay black boys born into a hyper-macho environment. But neither of these obvious ¬®woke¬® plots is what Moonlight is about.Instead, Moonlight forces us to see how all people have been shaped by their contexts and, despite their best intentions, can be propelled into a lifestyle, which they never consciously chose, as a result of completely chance encounters. Yet wherever they end up, human beings always possess the potential to empathize with their fellow human beings and are capable of letting down their guard just enough to reconnect.What I find exceptional about Moonlight are the perfectly executed individual scenes. Each is beautifully constructed, well-acted and shot. The cinematography throughout is top notch.My only criticism of this film is that the chapters were too abrupt, because the change in appearance of the lead protagonist was too dramatic, so it took a bit of time even to recognize that the third version was the same as the boy in the first. But all in all, I agree with the critics, not the naysayers. It may be that the ¬®woke¬® elements were selected as a result of our peculiar moment in cultural history, but the story is universal."
MOONLIGHT,6 August 2017,10/10,"I didn't know what the movie really was about when I decided to watch it and I'm not going to spoil it for you (even if most synopsis around there already tell you) because it feels so much richer to find it at the same time as the main character.This is a brilliantly directed film with an amazing story behind it. Barry Jenkins perfectly captures the very harsh and difficult environment that Chiron has to grow up in, especially during his younger years where he and everyone around him are trying to find out who he really is.With no father figure beside him and a mother with a severe drug addiction, he finds comfort in Mahershala Ali's character, Juan, and Ali's work is just amazing. He definitely deserves an Oscar nomination (and win) for this role, he's really great as well as Naomie Harris, who plays Paula, Chiron's mother. Two great actors with two Oscar-worthy performances. I really don't want to spoil anything from the story so I'll just talk about Jenkins's direction.I don't have words to praise Barry Jenkins beautiful directing. Everything from the pacing to the camera's work is on point and nothing, NOTHING feels misplaced! Most people might find this film not captivating and even slow, but the truth is that due to the excellent direction by Jenkins, I'm able to live the same environment as Chiron. It's filmed in such a raw and non-clich√© way that I find this to be one of the best-directed movies that I've ever seen.Moonlight is one of the best movies that I've ever seen when it comes to depicting a true, very difficult and harsh environment growing up. With a perfect (all black!) cast and a great story involving every stereotype that today's society (unfortunately) still despises, Barry Jenkins has a pitch-perfect achievement in directing this movie and its story is heartbreaking and emotionally transmitted to the audience.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
MOONLIGHT,15 June 2020,9/10,"The ending was one of the most most intimate and moving things I've ever had the pleasure to watch in theaters.It's one of those moments that just fills your heart with emotion, not to the point of crying, but to the point where you're holding so much in that you want to cry."
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2017,8/10,"Moonlight was a wonderfully made movie.The main purpose is to make the audience, all of us dwell into the psyche of the protagonist's mind and be the protagonist, feel him, become him to his journey of growth in lifeThe Director has done a profound job in exploring this element of human growth from being a child to adolescent and man.For that the only condition is that - the person who is seeing the movie has to be a sensitive soul to accept the journey of the protagonist.What is that journey? It is shown in three phases of a person's life - Age 9, Age 16 and Age 25. How a shy, lonely, fearing kid grows up to a person who can be identified and labeled by society as gay and drug dealer.But basically it is a journey of LOVEIt is a journey of a child named Chiron (played brilliantly by all three actors - Alex Hibbert - age 9, Ashton Sanders - age 16, and Trevante Rhodes - grown up) who is bullied by his friends and abused by calling him a faggot (derogatory term for a gay man). There are a few characters that influence Chiron - his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) is a separated psychotic drug addict A drug dealer.Juan (Mahershala Ali) and his girl friend Teresa (Janelle Monae) who show parental love and care to ChironHis only friend Kevin (played by Jaden Piner - age 9, Jharrel Jerome - age 16, Andrei Holland - grown up) is the one who befriends and gives Chiron confidence and shows care in his lonely world - with whom Chiron develops LOVE feelings.The beauty of the Director Barry Jenkins (his first full feature length directorial venture film, till now he made short films and TV episodes) - who has also written the screenplay - is that it leaves an untold back story with us of what may have gone within the kid's mind - on how one becomes what one becomes when he grows up.It could happen to anyone in the society.It was a beautiful and sensitive portrayal of a kid growing in a black neighborhood in Miami, United States.Kudos to the team, Three Oscars!Best Movie 2017, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best supporting Actor Mahershala Ali for his sensitive role as a guide and mentor to the kid.Moonlight is also a subtle nuanced portrayal of a lonely child trying to find identity and how he imbibes the identity (without any good or bad connotations) that he becomes when he grows up.All of us feel many a times identified with labels the world want to see us in a certain mold.Because accepting a label will unconsciously make one project an image that is ""not exactly what one is"". Read the importance of this last sentence carefully. People start behaving in a certain way because of the influence the society has on us.The cinematography is superb especially the shot where the camera follows the back of Chiron (and they are plenty in the movie)I would rate this movie as an excellent class room/ text book course for those who are interested in knowing about writing a script and making a movie. Rating (8 out of 10)"
MOONLIGHT,5 June 2020,7/10,"Movie is great! It brings the difficulty of the life of the black boy Chiron living in Miami state of Florida - United States. Unfortunately, nowadays there is prejudice against blacks (in the past centuries, there were also whites, but it was not debated), but blacks suffer more than we whites and I understand that.Nowadays (there is no such thing today) about being drug users (I am only in favor of the release of marijuana because it is a medicinal plant and in Uruguay it was the first country to release the use of course in small quantities) and this makes it harder with other heavier drugs it makes the person's body.Chiron with the passage of time was discovering what it is to be homosexual with the passage of time.Movie seen on May 28, 2020"
MOONLIGHT,2 February 2017,4/10,"I was watching the movie and the truth is that what I thought is that at least it was not the typical movie that blames society for the misfortune of its protagonists. In this house it is certain people in particular.The film has bored me a lot, it was another film of the same social theme. What happens is that even believing you the movie, in the end things have happened, that I will comment on spoiler, that I have demolished the film.He has some good performances, I do not know if to be nominated, I think not, but hey. It's another movie that talks about double standards and that surprised me seeing the character of Mahershala Ali whom I have not found much sense as contradictory.The photograph I did not like anything, did not make me feel, or helped the story.The direction is simple, the typical camera plans that you observe and neither count nor compose. But the worst thing is that he does not mind having casting mistakes.Spoiler:The final part has seemed long, too long. I do not know if all that part is to show that he is locked in himself, but I have enough and he bores me.What does not block me from the final part is that we see the character of the protagonist change so much of how to be, just like that. In addition and this it supplements in the film with a phrase that would not be necessary if there were no error of castings, and the friend tells him that he was very thin and now he is strong. But does anyone think that big man is the kid? That drug passes and is scary."
MOONLIGHT,20 March 2020,9/10,"Even if you haven't experienced what the main character goes through, you can truly empathize with his situation. That's the true power of Moonlight. Making you care about someone who is an outsider and lacking any kind of love form others. The acting is subtle and not in-your-face, which works well for a more toned down story. This film is an emotional dissection of the human condition and is one you shouldn't go without seeing."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2021,7/10,"You looks at ratings, you looks at responses of critics, then you watches the movie and you catches facepalm. What so praise the movie for? Well the stylistics of the movie are allocated, 3 stories aren't badly registered, each hero isn't similar to previous. But the 3rd part with Black escapes from a plot, too fragmentary history has turned out. And the most important, I watched the movie for the sake of disclosure of a subject of love of gays. After all such films are shot seldom, but I haven't received it. Simply good cinema, about a difficult life of the ordinary guy gay."
MOONLIGHT,27 December 2017,10/10,"Had you told me this plot, I would likely have responded with, ""That's it?"" But this movie shows what filmmaking can be. Even with minimal plot and dialogue, I was riveted. Because compelling characters, unique stories and beautiful visual storytelling will tend do that. Every moment seemed poetic, and the story somehow left me breathless with both its sad reality and its genuine hope."
MOONLIGHT,4 February 2017,8/10,"This is a sweet, quiet coming-of-age story about a bullied gay kid in a black neighbourhood in Miami. It brought me back to my youth, and the bullying I experienced for being gay. My sense of hopelessness and being trapped was only a fraction of what Little must have experienced.I enjoyed the immersion into this world. The movie shows you what it's like for some black people in Miami. The dialogue was authentic and fun to listen to, but I'm thankfully it was subtitled (into Dutch) because I wouldn't have caught it all.In the end, I didn't really connect enough. Maybe it's because I'm not American, not dirt poor and not black. I'm not sure. Chiron is a fascinating character (brilliantly played by all three actors) but I didn't identify with him and his world.I felt the movie was a little slow. The person I went to see the film with thought the movie was very slow.The film didn't blow me away. The glowing reviews raised my expectations too high, I think. We both felt it was worth about a 7.5. I enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone."
MOONLIGHT,10 January 2021,9/10,"It isn't too often when films tackling LGBTQ issues are tackled in films with predominantly black casts, so when works like Moonlight come out, they become all the more unique. Written and directed by Barry Jenkins, the film was inspired by an unpublished play that was derived loosely from the life of homosexual playright Tarell Alvin McCraney. In addition to receiving critical acclaim, the film became notable for being the first Best Picture oscar winner to tackle LGBTQ themes in an African-American coming of age tale. So now with the film being in its fifth year of existence, how has it held up recently?Mostly set in Liberty City, Florida, the film is told in three act structure about the childhood, adolescence, and early adult life of Chiron, who struggles coping with his sexuality and identity, such as the physical and emotional abuse that people expose him to growing up. As each act shows a different side of Chiron's upbringing, these periods in his life also end up developing Chiron further and further into maturity, even if he himself has never felt mature with bullies and his own mother lashing at him for being gay. Although Chiron did have some supporters in his life, from his father figure Juan to his childhood friend Kevin, they weren't quite enough to latch onto the little guy as possible, making his youth years rather depressing in the long run despite all the good times he did have. It's ironic that Chiron ended up playing up a complete facade in his later years that did not make up what he could have ended up becoming had the support he got overshadowed his neglect and abuse. After all, when you grow up in the closet around the hood, survival is vital from your youth onward.In addition to the harsh life Chiron faces, the supporting players are just as vital. His guiding parental figures Juan and Teresa, played so well by Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monae, in many ways do their best to look out for Chiron more than his crack-addicted mother Paula. However, likewise with the life of a drug dealer, other factors of Chiron's life getting in the way make it more challenging for the two. It also doesn't help when Chiron is the target of bullying, particularly with Terrel and his gang, who love nothing more than picking on anyone, let alone Chiron. This in turn leads into how much masculinity can damage the persona of someone who was hurt for so long, but with Kevin being his one bright light during his otherwise miserable school years, the occasional moments of softness come out within the film. It seems that masculinity is such a toxic word now, for if one delves too far into it, they lose the kind warmth they once felt with someone who cared for them, and all those years of pain in Chiron's life would have won him over if not for those moments of cleansing.Despite being made on a relatively low budget, the filmmakers made the most out of their limitations with creative cinematography and editing. As hinted by the film's main thesis of black boys looking blue in the moonlight, the rare moments where the general color palette is blue are reserved for Chiron at his most vulnerable, indicating that for all his aggression, the guy is still soft on the inside. Some interesting camera rotations and compositions also allow even one whole take to stand out on its own, almost as if the audience is flowing around in the world of the characters. Beyond that, the editing by Nat Sanders and Joi McMillon makes exquisite usage of both the calm dramatic sequences and the more tense thrilling moments, from quick cutting, to appropriately timed panning, and even musical undertones to let a simple shot say more than any dialogue ever could. What's interesting is that Sanders and McMillon were university schoolmates of Barry Jenkins himself, so it's quite clear that them working together mashed like peas in a pod (hence their own voices being displayed on screen).With a tightly structured narrative on a struggling gay man being beaten down by masculinity and drugs, Moonlight is a remarkable cinematic achievement that is not seen as often in film that much. This is not only a worthwhile watch for film aficionados and those into coming of age stories, but also for those who may be going through similar hardships growing up gay as well. Even if you yourself have not grown up in a similar way as Chiron or Tarell Alvin McCraney, it is still important to acknowledge the pain that many people who identify as LGBTQ still go through today. Besides, it's not as tough of a movie as you think."
MOONLIGHT,24 March 2017,10/10,"A feat in modern filmmaking, Moonlight's budget of 1.5 million dollars was a David amongst Goliath's. Arrival had a budget of $47 million, Hacksaw Ridge $40 million, and the Best Picture frontrunner, La La Land had a $30 million budget. For such a disproportionately financed film to win Best Picture, Moonlight hopefully is a sign that the tides are turning for more artistic films to take home top honors. Starring Mahershala Ali, Janelle Mon√°e, and Naomie Harris, Moonlight follows a young boy as he traverses the struggle to accept himself and his sexuality against the backdrop of abuse that has filled his life. Sexuality in the black community is an issue largely ignored, especially cinematically. Moonlight's willingness to so beautifully explore and give a voice to a subset of the population that more than deserves one was a brilliant choice and one that the audience benefits from immensely. Moonlight zeroes in on one person, Chiron, played by three different actors depicting three different points of his life. Starting out with an exploration of Chiron as a young boy dealing with the absence and abuse by his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), Chiron lives in an impoverished and crime-ridden city. Worse yet, Chiron is bullied at school for various reasons, most notably because he is gay. While running away from his school tormentors, Chiron hides inside a condemned house where an adult, Juan (Mahershala Ali) happens upon him. Juan takes Chiron to lunch attempting to learn about him, but Chiron isn't talking. Thankfully, Juan became a fixture in his life providing a male influence and a single area of happiness. Juan and his significant other Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e) provide a sanctuary for Chiron throughout his life. As Chiron transitions into his teenage years, he struggles with more abuse and struggles at school, more abandonment from his mother, and a deep questioning of his sexuality. After experiencing his first sexual experience with another man, a friend of his since childhood, Chiron is sure of his sexuality but reluctant to openly accept it. As he matures into an adult, Chiron and his mother's roles have reversed, as she is in rehab for drug abuse and he takes care of her, has found himself in perhaps a predictable position where he has become a drug dealer, like Juan his mentor. Chiron has also taken precise care of his body, developing his muscles to cover his body like a suit of armor. Chiron has never accepted himself by the end of the film, he has adopted a complete mask to cover himself with. He is unwilling to let anyone in his life in a desperate attempt to protect himself from the abuse and pain that has filled his entire life. Those closest to him have always hurt him, with the exception of Juan, who he has essentially turned into. Three glimpses into the life of a single person create a beautiful representation of self-discovery and growth in the worst of circumstances.Jenkins uses several film methods to perfection to best tell the story of Chiron. Choosing to break the story into three parts and provide just a glimpse into a point in Chiron's life was a brilliant way to fully immerse the audience into the narrative. This method calls attention to, not necessarily the most defining moments in Chiron's life, but an average day which really brings a whole story to the boy we are watching mature. We are sure not to be shown too much because Chiron excels at keeping people at a distance. Another striking film technique implored, especially during the first chapter of Chiron's life is a constantly moving camera. The swirling camera movements really allow one to see Chiron's impressionistic childhood memories. The world is so massive and incomprehensible to a nine-year-old, Jenkins uses the perfect technique to convey that. Another fantastic directorial choice was that Chiron was played by three different actors. Jenkins has said that rather than looking for actors that especially resembled each other, he was searching for a gaze. The most compelling part of looking at Chiron is his eyes. From each moment he sees for the first time, to the abuse he undertakes, to watching his mother deteriorate the deeper she falls into drugs, Chiron's eyes are the focus of the film.Perhaps the aspect of Moonlight that I fell in love with the most was how many pivotal aspects of the story the audience learns through silence. Maybe not complete silence on-screen, but Moonlight doesn't rely on dialogue to fill the audience in on what happens in the time in which we do not follow Chiron. For instance, in the first chapter, Chiron comes home to see the television that was there the previous day gone. There is no dialogue or narration that tells the audience the television has likely been sold to feed his mother's drug habit. Similarly, Chiron goes to run a bath for himself during his mother's absence, when no water comes out of the spout. The audience doesn't need to be told that their water was turned off, because it is shown. Jenkin's allowance to show rather than tell the audience about pivotal moments in the life of Chiron exposes his prowess as a director for creating an even powerful narrative. Perhaps the greatest takeaway scene is the one in which Paula, Chiron's mother is framed in the hallway when the dialogue cuts and the audiences watches her yelling at Chiron without hearing her yelling. This is powerful for the same reason it is powerful that the audience only hears the shot going off in Robert Siodmak's 1946 film, The Killers. It is far worse to imagine what is happening than to actually know what is happening. We don't have to hear the abuse Chiron is enduring to know that it is breaking him. I can't say enough how brilliant product is achieved by the trust in his audience Barry Jenkins exhibits by showing rather than telling Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,23 May 2017,9/10,"Moonlight follows a young African-American boy growing up in a ghetto. From the opening scene, this is a very well-made movie. For starters, the directing is fantastic. The way shots are composed and the length of them at times is all very impressive, clearly displaying Barry Jenkins' skill as a director. Another thing I noted were the performances. There wasn't a single weak one, and while not all of them were amazing, it's not like they were ever bad. Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali in particular shine. I was disappointed to see that Ali's character wasn't in the movie all that much, but all the same he stole every scene he was in. As a whole, the movie was very well written, with consistent character dialogue and a realistic progression of events. Yes there was the occasional hiccup here and there, but as a whole it was solid. Although sparsely used, the music proved rather effective for most of the scenes that it was incorporated into. And to top it off, the title itself has significance to the movie and it's message, but it makes you think and pay attention to understand it. So where did this movie falter? Well, first of all the music. I know I said it was good, but on occasion it was used poorly, thus making a scene out to be more important than it actually was. And this was an ongoing problem with the movie, regardless of whether or not music was involved. It's pretty self-important at times, which made it a little hard to fully enjoy. Some scenes seemed to exist for the sole purpose of being like this. There's a scene where a man holds a young boy in the ocean like he's baptizing him, and while the scene is just about the boy being taught to swim, the way it's shot makes it out like it's some super important and meaningful scene when in actuality it's just a swimming lesson. Furthermore, the way the movie is divided up doesn't always work. The first act is really good for the most part (save for a couple of awkward scenes), but as the main character grows up it becomes less and less engaging. The flow is broken by the second act, and everything after that feels like a drawn out segment that, in actuality, shouldn't be nearly as long as it is. The first act had some good development and flow, but the other two acts just feel like awkwardly separate parts of the movie. Overall Moonlight is a solid movie that falters in how broken up it is and it's own self-importance. I had a lot of the same problems with the movie 'The Tree of Life' as I did here. They're both very well-made technically speaking, but both are a little slow and pretentious, making it hard to fully enjoy either one. The only difference is that Moonlight focuses more on story than it does on symbolism and artistic stuff. In the end I would still definitely recommend giving Moonlight a go."
MOONLIGHT,18 May 2018,8/10,"I knew nothing about this film aside all the Oscar debacle hype. I'm not sure what I thought I was expecting, but I was certainly surprised. From beginning to end it's delicate, both in the way it's shot and in its characters. The beauty of the cinematography betrays the reality of the harsh surroundings and initially draws you in... but make no mistake, this is a dark world and life is not a happy one. It strives to be though, to find purpose and in the first of several pivotal scenes when it comes, it's a revelation. Three clearly defined acts take us through the lead characters life as he struggles to find himself and find a place in a world that doesn't allow that. It's all very contemplative and even the music throws a curveball, sweeping strings and sympathetic piano that certainly breaks from the norm. I try when writing these posts not to give any spoilers, so I'll stop my waffle right here. If you know nothing of this film, like I did, count yourself lucky and allow yourself to be surprised."
MOONLIGHT,15 December 2020,1/10,The movie is very bad and does not deserve an Academy Award. I preferred it because of the people's anger at the 88th Academy party. The film does not contain a good story and the acting in the film is very bad. The characters of the film are among our worst academic audiences wronged La La Land by not winning Academy Award for Best Picture
MOONLIGHT,15 February 2017,7/10,"Everyone has a pretty good idea about life in an American black ghetto, even without ever having been in one. That's because there are so many television series, films and songs about ghetto life. And usually, they paint the same picture: crime, drugs, rap music, baggy pants, gold chains, single mothers, machismo.The good thing about 'Moonlight' is that it paints a different picture. Sure, the usual stuff is there. Drugs are being dealt, rap music is played, there is a single mother. But there are other things as well. Things you wouldn't expect in a ghetto. Compassion, tenderness, vulnerability, and gay teenagers.Most of all, the film is about identity. Chiron, the main character, seems to be the victim of his background. He has to be tough in order to survive, first at school and later on the streets, although he really is shy and soft. Moreover, by being tough he is unable to acknowledge his own sexual orientation. The result is a troubled childhood, problems at school and an almost inevitable career in drugs dealing. These life stages are shown in three separate chapters, in which Chiron is played by different actors, showing him as a child, a teenager and an adult.This three chapter structure is executed flawlessly by director Barry Jenkins. In each chapter aspects of Chiron's life return: the relation to his mother, his friendship with Kevin, and the life lessons he receives from drugs dealer Juan and his girlfriend Teresa.'Moonlight' is a film about following your own path, and not accepting what seems inevitable. Maybe even about individuality as opposed to conformity. That message is now more important than ever."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,8/10,"This is the movie which (along with MANCHESTER BY THE SERA) has the best chance of blocking LA LA LAND from garnering a record haul at the Academy Awards this weekend. I hope it does. It's not an easy film to sit through, but it rewards giving it your attention.The life of a young gay black man in Miami is told in three instalments, with different actors playing him at three different ages (the lack of resemblance between the three is one of the movie's hurdles). We first see him as a boy, neglected by his crackhead mother (Naomie Harris on blistering form), bullied at school for being weak and 'different' but befriended by a macho drug-dealer and his girlfriend. In Part Two Chiron is a troubled teenager who briefly finds romance with one of the bullies and learns to fight back. In Part Three he is an ex-con with a bodybuilder's physique and gold teeth but still very much a loner ‚Äì and desperately lonely. A dark, bleak movie ends with a faint hint of hopefulness.This is a very different movie from BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN but it addresses the same theme: the challenge of being gay in a gay-hating world. MOONLIGHT suggests that a black neighbourhood in Miami is more homophobic than anywhere else (ironical given that South Miami is practically a gay 'haven' ‚Äì if not a gay 'heaven'). The three actors who play Chiron are excellent, as are all the supporting cast. Much of the dialogue is unintelligible to a British audience and the mood of the movie is probably too bleak for many people, but anyone who admired BROKEBACK is sure to find MOONLIGHT a deeply absorbing experience."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2018,7/10,"Moonlight is an ambitious movie that nails its goals. I was very impressed by the direction, with great shots and script, and methodical pacing that makes you appreciate and reconsider every moment. It was extremely realistic and honest. I did feel that it was a bit too narrow in its characterization of Chiron, showing interactions with very few characters and only showing a couple sides of his personality. It didn't really emotionally touch me, but it was enjoyable to watch and was very well done. A worthwhile movie, but not a game- changing one."
MOONLIGHT,13 January 2017,7/10,"There are three parts to this movie of a young man growing up in a poor black area of Florida. The first is when he is about eight years old(it would seem) where he is befriended and protected by an older man who is also a drug dealer. The second part is when he is an adolescent ‚Äì and being bullied and ostracized in high school. He is also coming to realize that he is gay. The first two parts are the harrowing story of a young person growing up who is different. He is sensitive and self-aware beyond his years. This is all convincingly done. Along with the filming technique you are emotionally drawn into this story. Sadly I felt the last part, of him being a twenty-something person, had all this emotion withdrawn. It was like a balloon that had suddenly had the air let out. The film wilted and became ordinary."
MOONLIGHT,16 November 2016,9/10,"LIFF30 2016 #4People told me this was amazing. Actually a lot of people. But wow, nobody warned me this was going to be emotionally striking. Praising this movie for being powerful is just an understatement.Moonlight is one of best character study movies I've seen this year. The directing, the writing, score, and especially the acting is what this movie so freaking brilliant.Director Barry Jenkins shot this movie in a very different and unique way. And I say ""unique"" as how this movie was filmed in a shallow depth that made the whole thing pretty intriguing. I wouldn't say he's directing is complete perfectionist, as there's plenty of room for improvement. Even if you don't like the choices he picked for a scene, but keep in mind that this doesn't equal bad directing. Lets not go that far. You can see that there's talent and he got a lot out of fantastic performances from all the actors.Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes all did a phenomenal job playing Chiron (the main character). Each of the actors builds on their character that the previous actor did. Despite the changes and the transformation, not once did you see a different person. There was never a moment where I didn't believe in a actor was giving a 100% their all or wasn't invested in the role. In my ""A Monster Calls"" review I said how great child actors are very rare in big budget movies, but not in indie. Several kid and teenage actors were all pretty fantastic in this, which is quite the accomplishment.Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali were both outstanding in this movie. It's one of performances I've seen from them. Even through their screen time is shot as Hopkins was in ""Silence of the Limbs"". And that's kinda impressive. Both manages to give anything in a small matter of time. It's really mind blowing and a real challenge.But what really surprised me the most was Nicolas Battelle beautiful violin score. Why this took me by surprise is because who's expecting a score like that from a movie that takes place in a gangster ghetto setting. This movie is more of a personal film of are main characters experience than anything else. So music like this fits perfectly and I'm glad it didn't go for a terrible R&B song for once.The writing is just top-notch and if you're an inspired writer, you should take notes from this. This is how you write great characters. Nothing cartoonist or anything that's one-dimensional. All the character's feel fleshed out and so natural to the point I forgot it was acting. And the best thing I can say about the film is that isn't predicable. I honestly didn't know where the story was going.When I called this a ""character study film"", that's because of the arks the main character goes through that leads to the next scene. It starts off with Chiron as a shy child living in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami with his crack addict mother. This leads to him meeting Juan (Mahershala Ali), which leads to him taking a lot from him (appearance wise) when an adult. Him being bulled at school leads to him being buffed, strong, and confident so none can pick on him ever again. But at the same time, he's hiding himself even more by being something that he's not. He acts gangster and talks in a American slang that I bet he doesn't fully understand. You can say different arguments to this, but how I see it, he's just getting better at hiding of who he really is. It's are journey through life that defines us as human beings. Same goes to the rest of the characters. I don't know about you, but that's pretty upsetting.You know, for awhile I was pretty close of giving ""Moonlight"" the perfect rating that I never thought would happen. But what stopped me is the little flaws. Some of the editing choices didn't really hit at times and lucky it didn't happen too often. I also notice some sound errors in a few parts, but it's only tiny.Overall rating: ""Moonlight"" is an original film that stays away from following a predicable path. I thought this was absolutely mesmerizing and was quite the experience that I didn't expect."
MOONLIGHT,28 December 2020,10/10,"Moonlight just hits different. It's a story that required its actors to be so candid and vulnerable that at least one of them said in an interview that they weren't sure they would be able to attend the premiere because they didn't know if they could watch the performance back and relive the painful memories portrayed on screen.
Moonlight tells the story of Chiron, a young, closeted homosexual who is relentlessly teased, bullied and beaten up at school and doesn't get the love he needs at home. That is, of course, until he meets Juan, the kindly man who becomes a mentor to young Chiron. The film contains three distinct sections of his life: we see him as a kid struggling with being bullied and referred to by derogatory homosexual names while being mistreated at home; then we see him as a youth seeing refuge in Juan's home (spoilers removed), continuing to be mistreated by his mother and beginning to explore his homosexual urges for the first time. Finally, we see him as an adult; we see how far he's come in life, the people he needs to forgive, and the sexually charged friendship he wishes to revisit.
Sexuality isn't the primary point of the movie, although it does seem to be the most talked-about. What it really shows is a little black boy being neglected and abused and unable to be who he truly is, and it follows him to show how even the smallest little details would go on to have a profound impact on his life. The movie is slow, the movie is subtle, it wants you to put in just as much as you take out. It doesn't pander to the audience, and it doesn't withhold unpleasant images and scenarios.
The actors all showed an incredible level of vulnerability going into these roles, and they're all performed fantastically. The characters come off the script as fully living beings before our eyes and, while it takes a couple minutes to really get into the film, it's well worth the time investment. Because this is an important film that needs to be seen more.
Thank you A24. You restored my faith in you with this one."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,6/10,"Excellent acting and characterisation is the best thing about Moonlight, which otherwise is too slow-paced and isn't engaging enough in its storyline. The directors are so determined not to rush things that scenes tend to go on for too long, without adding to the plot, especially several scenes at the end. It's indulgent and annoying for the audience. The three people playing the main character Chiron (as a boy, teenager and young man) all do pretty well, but for me, the teenager (Ashton Sanders) is the most interesting in having to deal with all sorts of problems, both at home and at school. He has an utterly miserable time at school. The scene where he's just been bashed, yet wisely refuses to snitch on the guy who did it, while a school counsellor spouts empty platitudes at him, is one of the best in the film. He says to the counsellor something like, ""you really have no idea what's going on in my life"" and of course she doesn't hear it. The two most outstanding actors are Naomie Harris, as Chiron's crackhead mother, Paula, and the local drug dealer Juan, played by Mahershala Ali, who, through a chance meeting, becomes the boy's very unlikely mentor. Harris, who is English, transforms amazingly into a super- thin, ultra-unreliable millstone around Chiron's neck, always out scoring drugs, or when she IS at home, is 'out of it', leaving Chiron to bring himself up, and offering him only a very token love. Touchingly, Chiron doesn't lash out at her for her poor parenting; heroically he does cope in fending for himself, but the film spells out all the terrible consequences of Paula's neglect. Mahershala Ali has that amazing screen presence. He's so powerfully built and smart that you're drawn to him. It's sad that such an entrenched drug addict is the only father figure the boy has, but the film shows that heroes sometimes come in unlikely guises. At least Juan is loving, supportive, offers him shelter and protects him. The scene where Juan teaches little Chiron to swim seems to symbolise that Juan will show Chiron to stay afloat, but that ultimately he is alone. But in a vicious coda to Juan's noble mentoring, the boy grows up to be a swaggering, successful drug dealer, just like Juan. Janelle Monae, as Juan's girlfriend Teresa, is a wonderful substitute mother to Chiron, and a welcome friendly character, although you wonder how someone as smart and kind as her would be living with a drug dealer. It's very refreshing to see Chiron as a gay lead character, but there is only one sexual scene and it's not that explicit. I didn't feel that Chiron's romantic reunion later on with his old school friend Kevin (Andre Holland) is convincing. Firstly, why would Chiron want a relationship with Kevin, who was effectively a bully at school, and whose betrayal got Chiron bashed and helped cause Chiron to go to jail when Chiron retaliated? Secondly, Chiron's substitute mother Teresa must have known about Kevin's role in Chiron's teenage downfall, so there is no way she would give Chiron's phone number to Kevin. I felt that overall, the ending of Moonlight wasn't very well done. Yes, it looks like Chiron might have an opening to a normal life with Kevin. But Chiron is a drug dealer, that's all he's ever known, so sadly the odds of him getting over that and living happy ever after would not be great."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2020,9/10,"Moonlight tells the story of the formative years of Chiron, told from three snapshots of his life as he comes to terms with who he is and who he wants to be in the world.What stood out most about Moonlight was how understated it all was. The film used silence in a very thoughtful and provocative way, and was almost a film about what wasn't said rather than what was. This cleverly reflected the internal and silent struggle of Chiron as he came to terms with himself and who he was.The performances from all three of Chiron's portrayers were exceptional. As mentioned before they didn't have an extensive script to rest on, instead producing very physical performances with lots of emotional resonance. Considering that they were three actors of very different ages, the way the film knitted the three of them together in a sense of continuity was extraordinary, and you really do get the sense that you are witnessing the growth of one person.This excellence continued into the supporting cast, with Naomi Harris and Mahershala Ali delivering outstanding performances.Moonlight is vert touching and sensitive in its portrayal of the growth of a young boy into a man, delivering some outstanding performances and artistic direction."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2019,3/10,"It obviously didn't take place in the early 70s, because of the clothes, reference to Freddy Kruger, etc. so why confuse people with the constant music from the early 70s? Then to classical. One thing you have to do as a filmmaker is set the tone and time where it takes place. It was just a little confusing. Having one song from a different decade is fine, but don't drive a whole movie with specific music from a decade unless there is a reason for it.Mahershala Ali was the best thing in the film. However, the silent kid got a little sluggish after a while. I wish filmmakers would be a little more happy with their editing and cut out all the fat and drawn out stuff. It will serve the film much better. The writing was a little forced and phony. Like someone wrote for what he thought the street would sound like, looked up the urban dictionary and then wrote the dialogue. It was just too personal of a story and I didn't buy the guy being gay.Started out good, but then just got slower and slower. Easily cut 20-30 minutes and it would have been a better film. Half way I just wanted to turn it off.The Villain in part 2 was a bad actor. My ratings started at 6, then after 30 minutes, it went down to 5, then down to 4... and so on. I had to force myself to finish... it was dreadful. We've seen this type of movie a million times. Note to producers: Don't make a film unless it breaks new grounds and hasn't been told before or done is a NEW and fresh way.Why didn't they bother fixing the shutter speed to avoid the constant flickering inside with fluorescent lights?Like others have pointed out, It didn't feel like Miami at all. They should have incorporated the city more. And I have issues with the story, but I am not gonna waste any time pointing out the problems.SKIP IT!!"
MOONLIGHT,17 March 2018,10/10,"Standout performances, great script, great direction. Never thought I'd see a movie with such an indie feel win a Best Picture Oscar. Hollywood, take a bow."
MOONLIGHT,18 January 2017,9/10,"Some films are best consumed whole while others give more joy through their fragments. For example, a holistic story with a big legacy is Brokeback Mountain (2005), the modern-day Western with two white gay cowboys as its ground-breaking heroes. Twelve years later, the remarkable film Moonlight (2016) walks into the Brokeback narrative space to echo similar themes but from the African-American experience. Rather than a big story, Moonlight is more a tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail that are best savoured piece by piece.Unlike plot-driven stories with big dramatic events, Moonlight feels like an introspective meditation on human experience. It is framed into the three parts of a black person's search for identity: Chiron the bullied loner kid, growing into the troubled teenager, to become the self-accepting man. Along the way, his physicality transitions from vulnerability, through confusion, to defiant strength, yet at each stage he is the same kid who doesn't fit in. There are only three human anchors in his life: his unstable drug-addict mother Paul, a drug-dealing proxy father Juan, and his only friend Kevin with whom he shares his sexual awakening. He grows with few words spoken from behind a psychological shield that he carries to ease the pain of disconnectedness. The film's all-black cast takes away the focus on race; what remains is a universal lonely man on a path to gay masculinity.The best-fit genre label for this narrative is 'coming-of-age', but this story is less about happenings and more about being and becoming. In so many scenes we are hauled in to share how Chiron physically experiences his forward propulsion. The filming style is key to its intimacy, with its close- framed detail conveying a tactile sensuality and personal connection to Chiron. The film is a swirling montage of memorable metaphors: such as Chiron's deer-like eyes reflecting terror of attacker and rescuer; a single falling tear depicting a torrent of pain; being cradled on water as a yearning for trust; his forgiving glare when Kevin betrays him; the open fingers grasping slipping sand one moment and physical pleasure the next; and his tortoise shell of heavy jewellery as a badge of machismo. Exquisite ambiguity and moral ambivalence is the colour palette of Moonlight, captured by hand-held camera-work that conveys frenzied realism and uncertainty about what is around the corner. No other recent film has such an understated narrative with such an overwhelming richness of moment and detail.Moonlight has more in common with impressionist paintings than modern cinema. It is soft-focused and visceral. It is not about race or sexuality or masculinity, yet it takes us into those spaces to experience the film rather than just watch. It defies holistic labels and compels engagement with its fragments. You do not see this film for entertainment but to share a journey into darkness to find light."
MOONLIGHT,18 June 2021,6/10,"I have watched some A24 films, and I get the impression that all of them are made by the same director. Bibliographical and linear storyline, a few undramatic events thrown carelessly at different spots rather than connecting them with logic and organization, and no ups and downs. 'Moonlight' like all other A24 focuses rather on artistic and abstract scenes with pinterest-ish images and clear color. A24 is trapped in mannerism. When I hear A24, I've already watched the whole movie in seconds. Having its common identity can be advantage, but it can also be redundancy.Very similar to Lady Bird in writing and directing. A boy struggling to build his own identity amidst distorted relationship with a parent, trying to fit in with peers, and being curious but unanswered about sex, and the director tells all these in very plain tone."
MOONLIGHT,19 March 2021,10/10,"Rewatching a few years on, the film only improves - if that's possible. What especially strikes me afresh is the quietness of the film - its gentle power, its refusal to shout when a whisper will do. The score underpins it all, and the heart of the film is the repeated motif of the sea, the waves lapping; a suggestion of time passing, of washing and baptism, of identity and constancy. It's still, in short, a masterpiece."
MOONLIGHT,18 December 2016,9/10,"MOONLIGHT is a beautifully written, superbly acted and confidently directed film about the steps and missteps taken in life by its lead character, Chiron. The pressures on him from without and from within are vividly, viscerally portrayed. My only quibble is with some of its cinematography, which draws attention to itself from time to time, muddying what the otherwise sensible and sensitive concentration on the cast.Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes share the leading role of Chiron, each playing him at different stages of his life. They are paralleled by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andr√© Holland as Ciron's school-friend Kevin. All six give fine performances. They are supported by Naomie Harris who finally gets to show what she can do after years of genre dross; and by Mahershala Ali, who presides over the first section of the film as a hard-nut hard-drug seller who, in a terrific scene, has to reveal the toll it has taken on him.It is very heartening to see a film like this coming out of America right now. Kudos to writer-director Barry Jenkins for giving these characters such powerful and proper focus. Although Chiron's is a melancholy story, it is told with compassion, and understanding of our common humanity."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,4/10,1. The film is too long.2. Many of the scenes are tedious. 3. Naomi Harris' character was completely predictable 4. Very little empathy is garnered because the main character is too aloof.5. With a film this grim you want to see some loose ends tied up and we didn't get that.6. Not something I would sit through again.
MOONLIGHT,19 May 2020,2/10,"(Screenplay written by the director, from a story by an other.)Not absolutely terrible, but completely unilluminating.The screenplay just felt massively underwritten, almost as if someone had, perversely, taken one that was well-written and eviscerated it. Perhaps the actual screenwriter thought he was making it more impressionistic by omitting to give any real depth to the characters?And it was shot in the most decompressed way imaginable: not so much active storytelling as letting things trundle along at their own slow slow pace. (I think you could have easily lost the first of the ""three ages"", i.e. Chiron as a young child; that might have helped keep things a little more focussed.)Not worth drawing the curtains to see this."
MOONLIGHT,26 March 2017,3/10,"There were 3 films that I wanted to see before the Oscars that were generally considered by most to be the best for the 2016 season: Moonlight, La La Land, and Manchester By The Sea. I loved Manchester..., and thought La La Land was just OK. But after it won the Oscar for Best Picture, I thought it was time to finally see Moonlight.As others have noted, it is incomprehensible to me how this film was so highly rated, as well as the winner for Best Picture (although historically, winning Best Picture hasn't meant anything at all in terms of quality and memorability).This film is very slow, and the actors who played Chiron at the three points in his life were grossly under-prepared to play a role like this. Now, as an independent movie, you can understand how they could only afford near-amateur actors in this critical role, but they are surrounded by well-known, and presumably more expensive actors/actresses like Naomie Harris, Andre Holland and Janelle Monae. So why was a decision made to allocate resources in this way? Sadly, the only reason I think this film won awards and was critically lauded was due to the subject matter and to be politically correct. I can appreciate wanting to recognize and encourage a low-budget, independent film, but this wasn't the one to choose."
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2018,8/10,"Moonlight perfectly examples the way people respond to peer pressure and fitting in, in early years as opposed to becoming who they truly are. It's sad to say that in this day that sexuality needs to be something so taboo, but at the same time this film captures many levels of sides to be on. Slow moving, strong, but extremely sensitive at times, the acting was captivating and the story one that puts this film as a reference story."
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,8/10,"Given the debacle at this year's Oscars--when ""La La Land"" was accidentally announced at winner for Best Picture--I knew once I had the opportunity I would have to see ""Moonlight."" ""Moonlight"" tells a story of a young black boy, Chiron, (from childhood to adulthood). He lives in squalor with his crack- addicted mother. He is totally neglected to the point he no longer wants to go home. He is unceremoniously bullied throughout school-- constantly called names he doesn't know the meaning of, yet very aware they are hurtful. He is befriended by an older black man (Oscar winner Mahershala Ali) who helps him ""adapt"" to his world as best he can. I thought ""Moonlight"" was extremely well acted and directed. Some of the scenes that are shot are breathtaking. ""Moonlight"" was a very good film. Was it Best Picture worthy? I don't think so. Rated ""R"" for adult themes and language."
MOONLIGHT,4 July 2017,6/10,"If there was one thing that people took away from this year's Academy Awards, it is the fact that whenever an underdog film surprises audiences and takes home the coveted best picture golden statue, there is usually some controversy involved. While 'Moonlight' is certainly no 'La La Land' in terms of budget, prestige or genre, it clearly made an impression on critics.However, Barry Jenkins' 'Moonlight' never really found an audience with the general public. The film at its core is about identity, the pressures adolescents feel from society and how one's environment during his or her upbringing can have a profound impact on the rest of their life. At the center of 'Moonlight' is a young African-American man from Miami. We get to see snapshots from his life, from his clashes with schoolyard bullies and complicated relationships with his family (most notably his crack-addicted mother, played by Naomie Harris) to repressed feelings for his friend Kevin. At each stage of his life, we see a different ""view"" of this individual - from ""Little"" (Age 9) to ""Chiron"" (Age 16) to ""Black"" (adult) - this is a unique way of telling the story sequentially.In terms of the acting, nothing stands out besides the job Mahershala Ali does as a father figure of sorts to ""Little,"" who is desperately in need of someone like this. Of course, this performance earned Ali a best supporting actor academy award, which was probably deserved. Everything else in 'Moonlight' is kind of a drag. There's only really one or two memorable scenes, and everything kind of just goes on and on with next to no real development.Some best picture winners are revered and remembered more than others, and it's likely that 'Moonlight' will be one of the ones that are cast in the shadows and lost into obscurity."
MOONLIGHT,21 November 2016,10/10,Moonlight is a work of art that you just need to see to believe. This is the beginning of an Academy Aword winning movie in the works. The acting is spot on it is the best acting I have seen this year. I did not know what this movie was about till I read the reviews and I thought this might be a good movie and it was a superb film. There is nothing like Moonlight. It is by far one of the most unique independence movies ever created and I am saying that as a compliment.Parents this movie is rated by the MPAA R for strings reasons including language sexual content and gay references and also Adult the and and content but for all the adults out there you will love it. Moonlight oh yeah that will never get freaking old I mean never FREAKING old.
MOONLIGHT,1 December 2018,10/10,"MOONLIGHT is the story within wet dreams and illusions. We are misfits in the world of homosexuals because your a straight man with care from his parents. But the truth is that homosexuality is like the fact that, we are not relenting to his careful attempt at being unique."
MOONLIGHT,16 February 2017,8/10,"A young man deals with his dysfunctional home life and comes of age in Miami during the ""War on Drugs"" era. The story of his struggle to find himself is told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love while grappling with his own sexuality.A small, little independent film, made for almost nothing that manages to transcend its limitations and be a full illustration of the power of the cinematic language, a real effort in the craftsmanship of images and sound for emotions, a wonderful piece of cinema, that just fell a little short from being a great one for me.As Jenkins has said in many interviews, this film somewhat resembles a lot of his life and acts as a very personal artistic endeavor, this makes for a uniquely developed vision that has a truly personal stamp on it, filled with touches and ideas that haven't been seen before and contribute into making a singular tone for this film, one that never leaves it, it just looms all over this and confers and importance and an elegance to the film that match the subject matter incredibly well even though they might appear different on paper.The unique choices are across the board stunning to see: the use of classical music for example is a stylistic element that works so brilliantly on an instinctual level. You can't really put your finger on it, but the music employed and the way it is developed across the three chapters is just one of those simple directorial choices that makes a world of a difference. It burdens this film with an importance and an intensity in the drama that makes for a perfect combination. Every frame of the film becomes filled with tension and unpredictability.Then you get into the use of color and there is a world to get lost to. This is definitely one of the most efficient visual storytelling efforts I've seen in recent times, the fact that it was so low budget probably made the filmmakers try to come up with the most inventive ideas and they rose to the challenge. The shots, the editing, the way the juxtaposition of colors and composition happens, what do they mean for the story and how they are developed and evolved through it, all of these directorial ideas succeed triumphantly in supporting the concept of the film.Jenkins just shrouds this film with powerful imagery and material, he finds a poetic touch even in the most excruciating and dark situations, he builds a world made of emotions and themes, every frame drips with context and ideas. The bottom line is that he manages to bring to life a vision that feels organic and complete, his style is original, fresh and he keeps it up constantly and is always interested in what the style can do to help the characters, not the other way around.Unfortunately, his brilliant and beautiful vision looses some of its impact because of the story. I feel like there are a couple of missing pieces here. I wasn't overwhelmed with emotion when I needed to be, the film isn't the absolutely captivating piece it needs to be. There are a couple of missing beats in the story that really feel absent, the emotional impact of events further down the line is lessened because of a shortly developed central relationship, you'll never hear me say anything in here was forced or unwarranted, I just feel like it wasn't as impactful and powerful as its cinematic language and it was partially a let down.But, ""Moonlight"" has very little to hide, its sheer sense of power in action and emotion is so well built and personally touching that even in its faults it manages to come out as a triumph of directing and storytelling, a really innovative piece of visuals that is sure to be highly influential and overbearingly imitated in years to come."
MOONLIGHT,16 February 2017,10/10,"This review of Moonlight is spoiler free***** (5/5)HOMOSEXUALITY IN PEOPLE of colour is a subject that has never been seen in film before for no known reason why but if there is any chance to be taken in this crazy world then writer/director Barry Jenkins took it and made Moonlight just the film that we have been searching for. Based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, we see the growth of Chiron who lives in the poorest community of Miami; he learns that growing up in the ""war on drugs era"" is difficult. The story of the film shows three chapters of his life from a nine year old elementary school pupil, in freshman year of high school and ending when he is a full-grown man. Initially we start with him as a child running home from school he is constantly bullied, until he meets with Juan (Mahershala Ali) who becomes sort of a mentor to him as he teaches him some of life's most important lessons, such as being able to swim but also learning to live with difficulties. Not only is school life difficult but his life outside of school is difficult, he is put down by his mother (Naomi Harris) who believes that Juan is trying to take her son away. When she resorts to drugs Chiron has nowhere else to turn from then his life gets worse. The film then shifts to him in freshman year of high school and still can't get away from a life of bullying, some of his class mates are cruel towards him and he is misunderstood and because of that he still has a hard time. Now that Juan is out of the picture he only has his friend Kevin to look after him but it still isn't any easier for him. Finally the film shifts a few more years to when he is an older man graduated from college living a whole new life in Atlanta away from Miami and away from his old life, sure he may think that he is away from it he really isn't as his mother tries to reconnect with him but that doesn't go well. However, his best friend wants to try to reconnect with him with a chance to get to know him and try and remember that time they shared. Sure enough, the concept of the story sounds simple, but, it really isn't he may have a changed life after college it's his life in the previous two chapters that is more affecting, more heartbreaking and much more with the story. As it's not just a story of a misunderstood teenager but it's a journey of self-discovery as he tries to learn what his life is and learns where it will take him. Meanwhile, his mother who is changing every day stays away from raising her child he has nowhere else to go he also hates her for giving her life away to drugs. This is a hugely affecting part of the story as it feels real it feels as if it's happening right in front of our doorsteps. Jenkins' story is so sensational and moving though it does lack sentimentality, but with every image, word and scene he delivers it with a heavy punch it packs so much power that will never leave you. Moonlight is a heartbreaking story of self-discovery, cruelty, and is very powerful this film will leave you with a tear in your eye even well after the credits roll.VERDICT: Jenkins' second film is a pure black-cinema masterpiece with intense awards-caliber performances and a hugely affecting hard-hitting story that's sometimes cruel but beautifully told."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,8/10,"For those who see the movie without having read the synopsis and have not seen a trailer or any news of the movie, ""Moonlight"" surprises, as it gives every impression of dealing with a theme and totally surprises, we see gangster, suburbs, drugs, violence, and The theme of the film is sexuality, or rather, the understanding of it. We have a script adapted from a piece, and very well adapted, following a narrative line to which each act of the film represents a stage of the life of our protagonist and all the people around him also grow and all the actors change, with the exception of your mother. We see the story of Chiron, a young man who lives on the margins of society, living a relationship of hatred and love with his chemically dependent mother, where you seek affectionate bonds in another family, living at the mercy of discrimination for your personality and living with Doubts about their sexuality, we see 3 stages of Chiron's life. The film deals with self discovery in a visceral way, it is not cute or romantic, or seeks the discovery of youth through flowers and love, no, it is heavy, violent, shocking, annoying, as I said before, it is a Visceral way of dealing with the topic. The photograph of the film is completely beautiful, with a blue palette, as foci that blur and mix passages, the photography is sometimes almost experimental, and I particularly enjoyed it, the soundtrack of the film is completely perfect, full of instrumental songs that dictate The tone of the movie, he knows to be pop at the right time, and if he uses the music to talk with the narrative of the movie, we also have a great sound mix and a good edition, and the camera strolls behind our characters and likes to film In profile. All performances are spectacular, although it appears only in the first act of the film, Mahershala Ali completely steals the scene, and Naomie Harris, the only one who appears in the three acts of the film, impresses in all three acts, full of improvisations, he is weaselable, amiable , It enters the camera and almost breaks the fourth wall, and the 3 actors who play Chiron play their role perfectly, and it's amazing how the 3 talk in the film, even if very different, the first participation of Barry Jenkins as director Is great, it gives me the feeling that this is the work of your life, even so, let's follow your filmography closely. Finally, ""Moonlight"" is a good movie, technically very good, sometimes it focuses too much on what it should not and leaves a lot of holes, but this is Barry's choice, although I do not agree I understand, and I really like the movie."
MOONLIGHT,2 January 2018,6/10,"'Moonlight' is the story of Chiron, a small African-American child growing up in the poorer neighbourhoods of Miami. It's told in three 35min blocks - Chiron at ~7 is called 'Little' and played by Hibbert, where he escapes bullying and his mother's drug habit by finding a role model in Juan (Ali). Chiron at ~17 is played by Sanders as he struggles through high school. Chiron at ~27 is called 'Black' and is played by Rhodes after he has moved to Atlanta. The film's a little too arty in parts, putting in sweeping/annoying camera angles and movement when not needed, and a bit too much of the over-dramatic score when one of the actors is just starting at the camera. It does seem to take a while for anything to happen, and - even though you feel sorry for him - I never grew to care too much for Chiron, as you never get to really know him.The character of Kevin (Piner/Jerome/Holland) becomes more interesting each phase, but also seems a bit underdeveloped. There's some nice moments, particularly with Juan and Teresa (Monae) - both underutilized - but it all ends abruptly and you feel like you witnessed Chiron grow up, but not really do anything..."
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2017,9/10,"Director and screenplay writer Barry Jenkins has managed to craft a whole new experience that is one part meditative, another part long lasting and masterful.A simple coming of age story is told through gorgeous cinematography, some of the best I have seen on films in years. The film is awash in a sort of ""tropical drab"", dark hues of blue appropriate moonlight and leaving a refreshed almost improved 80s neon, as the story of ""Little"" is acted during 3 periods of his life by 3 different actors, all of them equally brilliant.The film is like a slow rolling ocean wave, one that builds and builds always having a sense of light climax hitting the screen. Plot aside which is for the most non-existent, the actors simply perform wonderfully (all of them) in the film showing the trials and tribulations of a young boy trying to grow up in a dysfunctional one parent household.I don't think I've ever seen a film where so much expression was conveyed by an actor just simply by the use of his eyes. The 3 actors who play the main character really seemed like the same person, it's astonishing, as they walk through bleached out section 8 walls, between gorgeous palm trees, bright colors, and the beach so nearby that seems to be the respite from the madness so close to home.The culture and the landscape and story is so uniquely portrayed that it's refreshing. The film pictures Miami bathed wet streets, neon, diverse colors of its people and the places and qualities that surround them with a story that's so unique, but must be so common place about grown African-American men who at their even biggest physical prowess are still children inside.I left the theater with a sense of feeling how wonderful this was made, but also not crazy about it being a total masterpiece as some critics have claimed. However, it's strength is in making you remember these characters and what the future holds for Little long after the film ends. I still feel even today that I hope ""Little"" finds out who he really is. I still think about it days after seeing this story, and how Little will be, and perhaps that in its own right makes it a masterpiece."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2018,7/10,"Seeing metascore of 99 I thought this film would blow me away by its story and powerful emotion but - in reality - I was not really moved by pretty much anything. I do say that the storyline is interesting and that the subject of the film - growing up as a gay black man in not favorable environment - is played very convincingly by all 3 actors and those 3 of Kevin, but ... There was something that just did not click (with me).If we see this one as a gay drama - then Call me by your name is 100 times better in emotion and 'realness'.It did kinda feel slow at the times, but ... all in all, it is a good one.7 from me."
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2019,9/10,"I was a little bored while watching the movie, I was confused in some scenes but I didn't understand that when the movie was over I felt like it is good.because it's not like a movie it is real,I felt it was real that gave me that feeling that I've really had in the movie.The reason I had some prejudice in this film is that the year I won the Oscar I wanted more la la land to get the Oscar because I like the movie and I did not watch 2-3 nominees that year.One of them was moonlight so I watched it so late but I never regretted it,I usually read the comments that it does not deserve the oscar but to me it is not true.Afro american people know how hard their lives are at least in the past but our character is also gay that mean having more of this difficulty.he was always silent on every occasion but finally realized that silence was not the solution there was a scene he puts his face into the sink full of ice I don't know what he thinks at the time but it's the beginning of everything.The acting was very good, as I said at the beginning, they never made us feel like we were watching movies.Barry Jenkins is a great director I like this movie very much deserved the oscar award film a little slow a little bit short and there are some boring scenes but I like it"
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2019,10/10,"On living in a country where people still consider being homosexual as a disorder,I can understand how it feels for people who are hunted by homophobic goons.The movie talks about a person's childhood to adult being a black and gay.The bullying scenes are too intense and the movie is so good.Oscars were well deserved."
MOONLIGHT,9 December 2016,8/10,"As I went into this film the only thing I could think was Oscar BAIT! I mean we have a nearly all black cast about a man that is struggling with his sexuality. If this wasn't destined to be Oscar bait I don't know what is. But boy does this film work. It's a movie that excels because of the storytelling. The film takes place with three clearly defined chapters about a guy named Chiron. Each chapter, or act, is titled with a nickname that this dude has. Whether it's Little, Black, or just plain Chiron. As the slogan suggests, it's a movie about this man's life. It's set when he is a child, a teen, and a full grown adult. The story is deconstructed in these three periods to show specific moments in his life.This is a strange movie, to say the least. It's not only incredibly ambitious in a story sense but the subject matter, if not handled correctly, could have easily blown up in their faces. Fortunately 'Moonlight' handles the material with the exact amount of grace you'd want. But in order to fully explain this film, I feel like I have to discuss all three acts in detail to actually get into why it works. But I will do my best to avoid giving too much away.The first act is probably the worst of the three. It recounts the tale of young Chiron. We are first introduced to him as he is sprinting away from children that are bullying him. He is found by a drug dealer that takes him under his wing because of the abusive relationship Chiron has with his mother. As this act progresses it really started to wear on me. It's set up in a rather generic way and the feeling of this never really goes away during this act.If you've seen a coming of age story like this before you already know exactly how this act is going to go. It's predictable, straightforward, and often a bit too on the nose in comparison to what is to come, which is probably the best act of the film. Chapter 2, simply titled, black. This one follows Chiron as he deals with the awkward high school years. And it's here where the film absolutely takes off. Before we got a kind of generic plot with uneven camera work but from here on, everything falls into place.Suddenly the film gets incredibly mature and intimate. For me, movies about gay people are always a little difficult to get into. I'm not gay so seeing two women or men get together isn't something I personally relate to, but this film absolutely drew me in. Because it's less about a gay man and more about a troubled person that is simply trying to live his life.Taking this more human, mature angle lets people that have a hard time relating (like me) and is able to draw you in. It's about a human being a human. The comparison that is being made with this film is 'Boyhood'. Which is also about watching a person develop before your eyes. The only difference between the two being, 'Moonlight' is actually a film. 'Boyhood' is just an experiment, nothing more. This film is impactful because of the humanity 'Boyhood' didn't have.It shows the harshness of the life Chiron lives in vivid, unrelenting detail. Highlighting the specific moments that define him as a person. And as he matures you can see how each moment and person affected him, whether positively or otherwise. This creates a character that we not only care deeply for but someone that feels amazingly real. Barry Jenkins direction is also able to compliment this nearly perfectly. There are times when I sorely wished for a tripod to be used as the shaky cam gets to be a bit much, but the boots on the ground style perfectly captured this world.But this entire movie would've fallen apart if the performances were even mediocre. The entire film rests on the shoulders of three actors, two of which being young kids. And I am glad to say that everyone gives outstanding performances. Even the child actors are really great. For me, the stand out is teenage Chiron. Who is able to show the characters inner turmoil and fears with little words. He gives an exceptional performance that is worthy of note.This is a very well done film that I can't recommend enough. It's well crafted, gracefully told, perfectly performed, incredibly directed, and has a sense of intimacy and maturity that few films are able to offer. You can feel the world around our main character and almost smell the things he can. While I sorely wish for a unique first act and more tripods, this movie is an incredible story about people that shouldn't be missed."
MOONLIGHT,11 February 2017,9/10,"I should preface this with the caveat that I'm a 51 year old white guy, albeit a tree-huggin' liberal white guy.But I'm usually not interested in black films, especially comedies. Many of them seem to dwell on being black and portray negative stereotypes of black people. I'd say the same with rap music, with the exception of Enimem (hypocracy?) and Public Enemy.I went into this thinking I would not like it. I'd heard reliable reviews from people I trusted that it was dull. But my experience was quite the opposite. Clearly it is very well directed, especially considering the shooting schedule. I was surprised the budget was $5 million. I didn't see where that was spent. But the detail was artistic and the tone was consistently engaging, albeit painful from the perspective of the characters. The characters were depicted as very human and the pain and fear that they felt, especially the lead, was evident. The middle act felt horrifying and real. The pain of the lead in the final act was genuine and powerful. The mother's helplessness in her insanity was effective.But I still felt a disconnect about certain elements. The little boy at the beginning was fearful and needed love. He found that from a sympathetic drug dealer. Although it was done well, I really didn't believe a sympathetic drug dealer. As a compassionate man caught in a culture requiring you to always be strong, it was effective. But I have a tough time thinking that a drug deal of any color is compassionate about anybody. Although the element of making the lead character as gay was not used just as martyrdom, I really didn't think the film did an effective job of establishing that other than saying it out loud in the first act. The second act and our lead is very fearful and beaten down by life. The problem is that it was the totality of the character. Fear and loveless who tries to find compassion with another gay student posing as a ""tough guy"". Then in the third act he is an empty man. Apparently he played the role that the street compelled him to. Conversely the other gay student is now a multi-faceted sane man trying to live his life away from the streets. This act had a good amount of consistent smoldering intensity.The whole film had wonderful acting and writing all around. What was lacking was a fully rounded character in the lead. Effective strong emotions for each stage but that was it. As a reference (although a comedy), I have to go to the film Dope that was more effective at showing black people as people. I guess it really wasn't the job of the film to make me understand the black experience. But I found it rather unforgiving when it came to black folk in general. I was shown a ruthless culture where violence, sex and posturing is the norm. (All the clich√© traits that conservative white America is afraid of.) The three redeemable characters were the drug dealer (unrealistic), the gay student (albiet obnoxious) and the grown gay student (very realistic and compassionate). The lead was consistently sympathetic but also very simple.So there you go."
MOONLIGHT,21 March 2017,7/10,"One of this award season's hottest movies, eventually winning the best picture Oscar. The black boy is ""different"" (turning out to be gay) and doesn't know what to do about it. There are three stories, portraying him as a youngster, teen and a grown-up.The movie is good but never exceptional and thus not really worth all the hype it has gotten so far. Sure, it's quality work but not reaching some dazzling heights that 224 movie awards and 204 nominations are hinting at.I am disappointed by Mahershala Ali getting a best supporting actor Oscar for this. I mean, I really like the man ‚Äì especially in Netflix's ""Luke Cage"" ‚Äì, but his screen-time is so limited that he's barely in the movie! Is it really worthy of the Oscar?"
MOONLIGHT,29 May 2020,8/10,"Pros:
1. The argument scene between Juan (Mahershala Ali) and Paula (Naomie Harris) over who's going to raise Little (Alex R. Hibbert) because of Paula's crack addiction, is unbelievably raw and emotional.
2. The tightness and closeness of the camera allows the film to feel more intense and personal.
3. Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Trevante Rhodes (Black), and Ashton Sanders (Chiron) all give brilliant performances.
4. The movie is visually stunning, thus producing many memorable shots. One great example would be when Juan teaches Little to float in the ocean.
5. The transitions between the different life chapters are both seamless and well-executed.
6. The soundtrack and score helps solidify feelings of melancholy, longing, loneliness, and so much more.
7. The movie serves as a touching story on boy-to-man dealing with trauma (crack-addicted mother and bullying), as well as his identity issues (his race and sexuality).
8. The ending is heartwarming, tender, and slightly heartbreaking as Black concedes his inability to love since Kevin age 16 (Jharrel Jerome) touched him.Cons:
1. Naomie Harris's American accent is a little patchy.
2. The inner-conflict with Chiron's homosexuality, and therefore his relationship with Kevin age 16, is not fleshed-out as well as it could have been which lessens the impact of the ending slightly."
MOONLIGHT,4 April 2020,7/10,"No one is to blame, no one is to blame. WHO Doesn't want to be okay. I'm willing to forgive anyone who's ever hurt me. It was fate. The only thing I can do, is to let the generation of lack of love and indifference, until I, as I end, I would like to bear. Maturity is when you can finally shake hands with a painful experience and try to give it as much meaning as possible, rather than running away from it. Accept who you are and appreciate who you are. If the world is not kind to you and you can not grow outwards, grow inwards, and you have an inner world that can be equally lush and Under A Vast Sky."
MOONLIGHT,7 May 2017,6/10,"Moonlight won an academy award, but after watching it, I felt disappointed.The story focuses on Chiron, a young black kid in Miami, who grows up in a tough neighborhood, raised by a single drug addicted Mom. You feel really sorry for the kid, especially when people start bullying him. I kept wondering why the school did nothing when he was bullied, but when he explodes, he is immediately mistreated. Chiron somehow befriends Juan, a drug dealer, who kind of becomes his father figure. time moves ahead. Chiron gets older, and things have happened. But there was poor continuity there. I kept wondering, who are these people, how am I supposed to follow this story, And his mother never seemed to age a day.Finally Chiron grows to adulthood. He tries to repair many broken parts of his life. he tries to become the man he wants to become, not the one he was forced to become. I see he battled all kinds of struggles against all kinds of odds, but this story just left me disappointed. The actors were pretty good, but it was the story that did not weave enough continuity throughout. The story did not have enough depth or details to really draw me in.I give Moonlight a 6/10, for trying, and partial success with some strong acting. But the story lacked depth and enough stuff to keep me interested, much less draw me in."
MOONLIGHT,27 April 2017,4/10,"Very little talking, very little to the story. Beautiful idea and the I felt for the characters, but I was expecting more drama, some sort of climax, but it wasn't much of anything. The acting was great, but a lot of things weren't explained or mentioned and not gone into deeper. Quite a long 2 hours!"
MOONLIGHT,20 November 2016,6/10,"Moonlight is another Barry Jenkins film that is soaked in the exact craftsmenship you'd come to expect from him: powerful screenplay, excellent performances and an all around perfect film. To put this in perspective, Moonlight is so damn good and refreshing that it is hard not to recommend it to everyone. The film puts us on the back of a young African American boy who is living with his drug addicted mother in the slums of Miami. He is exposed to drugs, alcohol and violent tendencies at a very young age. The boy is haunted for his entire life over something his mother says to him in the fit of a blind, drug fueled rage. As the film progresses he thinks about what his mother called him and that singular moment reverberates throughout his whole life.What this film does so brilliantly is it combats the idea of masculinity and homosexuality in the most blunt of fashions. No film has done this and I doubt a film will do this ever again. It is truly a great film that touches on so many topics outside of homosexuality. It touches on race relations, black culture and what it takes to be a traditional man. The performances are all around terrific, with an especially standout performance from Naomie Harris. The filmmaking is top notch and the script is perfect.Overall, Moonlight is a harrowing must see film for anyone who is a fan of cinema. It will make you laugh, it will break your heart, make you cry and everything in between. But what this film will do the most is make you really think about what, if anything, has defined you as a person. No matter the gender, no matter the sexual orientation, no matter the culture, no matter the race...this film will speak to you louder than words ever could. Bravo, Barry Jenkins."
MOONLIGHT,21 January 2017,7/10,"""Moonlight"" by Barry Jenkins it's one of the best films of 2016, it's one of the most wonderful films to come out in recent years, and it's also one of the most loved films of 2016, and I am glad to say that I really liked the film, even with some of its minor flaws.The film deals with subjects such as identity, love, courage, sexuality and maturity, subjects that aren't rare in film, but having a story this engaging with performances this good its something amazing. It feels like a very personal story for the makers of this film, and the viewer feels it, we feel the passion and the love behind the film, maybe that's why this movie has been getting all this love, besides the fact that its an universal story with real emotions. With many movies with a huge hype around them, more often than not, they end up being somehow disappointing, this movie doesn't live to the hype that everyone creates around it, it has a few flaws, like a few not so good performances, or even some off putting moments, that aren't executed very well, some moments that seemed rather pointless, and also a very weak start.But it makes up for it by having brilliant direction, great writing, memorable performances by the main cast, and some strong emotional scenes in it, sometimes the film feels rather beautiful.I definitely recommend the film, if you feel that there has been too much hype around it, I would recommend for you to just watch it, not thinking too much of it, but it is a really passionate film"
MOONLIGHT,12 June 2017,8/10,"It may start with encircling camera-work in the vein of Michael Bay, but ""Moonlight"" has an entirety different agenda with its dizzying, revolving viewpoint. There's still a sense of spontaneity and tensions rising to a breaking point, but the sweltering Florida heat targets a very specific slice-of-life tale about an often overlooked ‚Äì or certainly under-represented ‚Äì fragment of American culture in modern cinema. It's superbly acted and expertly structured, peeling back the layers of an intimate portrait of a boy as he's moulded and manipulated, sometimes tragically, by his formative years. Little Chiron (Alex Hibbert) is scrawny and timid, making him the constant target of bullies. When he's chased by a group of kids into an abandoned, boarded-up dope hole, he's liberated by Juan (Mahershala Ali), a kind man who sees quite a bit of his own upbringing in the disaffected child. Juan takes Chiron out for lunch, and then back to his house, where his equally generous girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae) awaits. Though Chiron says nothing to either one of them throughout the day, as if petrified by strangers or traumatised by the unexpected act of benevolence, he finally reveals that he does not wish to return to his own home in Liberty City until the following morning. Chiron's situation becomes more complicated when it's revealed that his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) is abusive and a drug addict ‚Äì purchasing her freebase from Juan, who deals to a great many people in a large swathe of the community. Though Chiron becomes aware of the destructive behaviour and the unfortunate relationship, he's inspired to continue to return to Juan's place, in turn prompting the surrogate father figure to take the youngster swimming or simply to provide a haven for when Paula is too irritable to have her son around. It's in many of these moments ‚Äì where something as innocuous as driving, or bathing, or playing soccer transpires ‚Äì that the film is given a boost of poetic grandeur through classical music. Elegant notes preside over scene transitions, elevating what could have been mere routines for the definition of explicit existences into breathtaking, thought- provoking art. The most inconspicuous presence suddenly has great power. ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you want to be."" Juan's guidance has a significant influence on Chiron's evolution; perhaps as much of a contribution as Chiron's pal Kevin (Jaden Piner), who manages to have his feet in more than one school clique. In these earlier scenes, the characters have the most impact, as they engage in heavy-hitting scenarios of bullying, fitting in, and coping with the abundance of drugs, followed by frank conversations about sexuality that reveal one of the most staggering themes in the picture: identity.As the time-line jumps into the next phase of Chiron's life ‚Äì that of high school ‚Äì the struggles remain very much the same. He (now played by Ashton Sanders) must still contend with antagonises and deciphering his public image (or reputation), though his tribulations in this rarely explored coming-of-age environment more closely resemble raw, brutal survival than the awkward adolescence frequently depicted in teen comedies. The astonishingly intricate foundations of emotions, sexuality, and behavioural pretences only grow more complex when Chiron enters adulthood (finally portrayed by Trevante Rhodes). This arc of maturation is convincing and monumental, particularly in the way that all of the positive and negative interactions and relationships have fashioned Chiron into not only an amalgamation of these people and experiences, but also a tormented individual who works to hide the less accepted, adopted qualities from his peers. Only with his mother, who eventually seeks forgiveness, and with Kevin, who yearns for honesty, does Chiron reveal heartbreaking genuineness. ""Moonlight"" is, ultimately, a fascinating character study that is sometimes tender, sometimes ferocious, yet always profound."
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2017,9/10,"The first incredible thing I noticed about this movie is the cinematography. I've seen jokes on the internet like ""I can't believe Moonlight invented cinematography"", but I had to say that too while watching. The cinematographer of Moonlight uses both still, calm shots and really effective movements of the camera, which still are super smooth. The colours are incredible, and so is the lighting and the composition of pretty much every shot. This is how movies are meant to look. Moonlight really sets the bar high. I especially loved the swimming scene and how the camera was partially underwater, that always looks amazing.Moonlight has the same challenge every drama movie has. The plot is something very ordinary, and there's no great adventure to keep the audience interested. Moonlight keeps the audience's attention by being such an unbelievably beautiful slice of life movie. It's beautiful, delicate and poetic while also showing the dark parts of Chiron's life. The balance is amazing. And while the movie can be brutal, it doesn't revel in it. This is exactly what drama should be like. Writing in Moonlight is amazing. The dialogue is simple and easy to keep a track of, yet there are so many incredibly touching lines. Also Chiron as a character is interesting to follow. While the actors change, the character is still in there, while also growing up and changing. It clearly is one person's story instead of three characters who somehow feel like they could be the same person but are too distant from each other. One thing that slightly bothers me though is how the kids' dialogue doesn't feel like actual children talking. But children's dialogue usually is very hard to write so it actually sounds real.Of course this movie has that feeling all Oscar winners have - it feels a bit too serious, a bit too important, a bit too artsy and a bit too hyped. but that's often not the movie itself, it's the Oscars. Moonlight definitely deserved the hype it got, it was a beautiful film, even if a bit ordinary. Maybe it's ordinary just in the right way - enough to be relatable, especially to gay black people, but not too ordinary so it's actually interesting.Moonlight is an incredibly beautiful movie and I will admit, probably the best movies made in 2016. However I'm only giving it 9/10 because I did feel a bit bored during certain scenes, but of course it seems like the story style was a bit minimalistic on purpose - not a lot happened, but that's what growing up might feel like."
MOONLIGHT,1 June 2017,9/10,"Apparently, American film colossus learned from the popular debacles of the past, now it starts a thorough inquiry in order to unveil stories implicating everything and everyone. Just a year ago, totalitarian society was embedded in the protests, led by movie personalities of color, for the small amount of participation of any-non-English-speaking actor or filmmaker in different annual film festivals, emphasizing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Months later, either objectively or subjectively, the more than 1,000 Academy members have nominated a heterogeneous movie range, in which ethnicity is preeminent, striving for the most significant awards of the evening: ""Best Motion Picture"" and ""Best Director"" (""Moonlight"" or ""Fences""). One of the most eloquent contenders is Barry Jenkins' neo-creation, if we interpret it in a superficial way, illustrates three formative periods in correlative gradation of a gay black male, however, scrutinizing it from the inside out, we notice a limpid treatment about a little-known environment by huge studios, one where poverty, loneliness, orphanhood, violence, drug abuse, and intolerance ravage to any boy residing by such degrading places. Not necessarily you must be African-American or gay to converge your own existential opinions with Chiron's, this is because it's defined as a universal tale both in effect and purpose; an important epic supported by the reality, using to aesthetic and melodic lyricism to remind the spectator a truism that is being ignored to collective will, something doesn't require a harmless seasoned to cover its importance, rough beauty and ordinary human need within a quasi-two-hour motion picture.It begins with a circular tracking shot to place the audience into the perverse place where the main character will have to grow up, an atmosphere which breaths dioxide formed by the miasma of bullets, prostitution, vices, scams, sex, narcotics and death. The films encompassing African-American marginalized populations tends to implement certain hallmarks produced by social disruption, which is caused by deficiencies (social exclusion, police brutality or educational neglect) leading an unsuspected doctrinal starting point. Jenkins, who's devoted to these ""stereotypes"" of films about black race, delineates naturally a Miami punished by the sun, space where Chiron's hilarities, notions, dreams, disappointments, learnings, decisions, and fluids that go from scarlet blood or saline sobs to the experimental sperm were fixed to torrid precarious ground of American ghettos, experiences richly raised through three temporary gradations (childhood, youth and adulthood) marked by three irrefutable denotations of the character in question (Little, Chiron, and Black).""You can be gay, but you don't have to let nobody call you a faggot""Narratively, it can be compared with dense, epic and fatiguing Richard Linklater's ""Boyhood"", ""Moonlight"" employs narrative in sections as standalone episodes comprising altogether an intense realism, an initiative bracing the trip and psychic and emotional spurs of the characters. The whole product is much more than the sum of its parts. It expels conviction, transformation and freedom of all kinds; It's something that concerns you and gets under your skin beyond the closing credits. Fractional exposition allows more intimate contact with what happens to Little, young or mature man; each chapter works as an independent installment, splendidly played by an ardent diverse cast, photography as real as visceral, a soundtrack combines emotional position of a given moment and a series of components employs simplicity and truthfulness as info carrier. It entails entirely the kind of film which is imperative for us more than ever, one that talks about what can happen a common human being and grows apart itself from the oneiric. It's patent the limited trust around nobility of our existence to conceive art, we make other worlds rather than appealing infinity of opportunities are around us. The visuals are marvelous, repel the tendency of those recurring feature films using desaturation and dreadmist to portray real-life occurrences. Here, fluorescent bright colors come together dark contrast in order to animate and give a distinct personality to each planned segment, mise-en-sc√®ne intensifies its fantastic beauty with precise camera movements at the hands of skilled James Laxton. Music, light and camera aesthetically shape the movie, equipping with sensitivity and depth Chiron's life, while simultaneously, it reduces the inherent hostility of the American atmosphere. Visual and writing screenplay combined with tremendous credibility, while John (one of the most humane performances of a drug dealer in the cinema history by California native Mahershala Ali) recites to Chiron the origin of his nickname (Blue), the story applies optionally sparkling moonlight involvement in the last scene, in which he invites us to do the same he did, to try to define us, not to fear, to be who want to be, to develop a global principle entrusted to humanity; living in freedom.Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" officially starts the participation of two of the social groups more unjustly repudiated by contemporary society: black race and homosexuals. Each person can draw deductions, opinions and criticisms, but the truth is that what these men and women‚Äîdedicated to cause a change‚Äîhave made is a fearless and decisive social and filmic feat, which's realized by universal subjects such as youth, rashness, self-improvement, love, masculinity, and life. ""Moonlight"" is a grade-A drama, literally powerful, visually linked to the truth; its power doesn't come from complex intelligible narrative tricks, the charm lies in connection with the characters and the unintentional identification with coexistence human nature: acceptance (tolerance)."
MOONLIGHT,25 October 2016,8/10,"For me, ""Moonlight"" was the story of a boy, who grows to manhood, who seldom knew the tenderness of another human being. Raised in the shadows of Miami, Chiron (also known as ""Little), lives with his crack smoking mother. He is bullied by boys at his school. The only people who are kind to him is a local drug dealer and his girlfriend. When the dealer finds Chiron hiding from the bullies, he tries to get the boy to open up, and talk. This man, for all of his faults is the only one that the boy comes to trust, and talk to.As the boy grows, his mother becomes more abusive, and the bullies are even meaner, and subject Chiron to all types of insults. But Chiron has one friend he can talk to, Kevin. Chiron can talk to Kevin, and the two boys share a rare moment of affection with each other. However, the bullies force Kevin to betray Chiron, and Chiron ultimately snaps and takes revenge on the ring leader.In act three, Chiron is now a man, and he has tried to make a life for himself in the only way that he knows, from what he's seen (no spoiler). He still has issues with his unaffectionate mother, and he meets up with Kevin, whom he hasn't seen in a number of years.Everything about this film is excellent. The writing rings true, the acting from all three ""Chiron's) is wonderful, as well as support from Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae, and Mahershala Ali. The film dealt with themes about abuse (both physical and verbal), the need for role models, and the need for personal contact / relationships. It shows how just a little love or compassion, early in a person's development can mean so much to their life after they've grown.8 out of 10"
MOONLIGHT,8 February 2017,10/10,"This is a timeless movie about human and his relationship with environment that he is part of and how he manages to deal with everything. Movie focuses around Chiron and follows him through three stages of his life and how he deals with really uncomfortable situations. At the very young age he is really unsociable and just tries to old everything inside himself, but he was lucky so Juan took care of him and cared for him. Kevin is Chiron's friend and he followed him everywhere. Now movie jumps to high school period of time and here is obvious Chiron starts to become different person and push back up considering his mother is a junkie and he had to deal with everything. He experiences his first emotional moments with Kevin and it changed him totally. After he got beat up by bullies he is determined to fight back and does so which led to next chapter after he got released, he started his life from bottom. Now he is a drug dealer and he has a nice life which will be changed after he receives a call from his friend Kevin. Chiron goes to mother and after a very emotional conversation he decides to forgive her. Considering they did not hear for a long time he visits him and movie just ends with them sitting like they did before many years in moonlight. It was a inspiring and incredibly told story. Directing of Barry is absolutely insane and he did some of the best work ever. Movie feels so natural and how it flows it doesn't miss anything. Mahershala Ali gives one of the best performances in recent time as he moves us and shows us goodness and how emotional his character is. 4/4"
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,10/10,"This film is impossible to be indifferent to! You have to watch this important film this year, a movie that you can learn something that will give the viewer new perspectives and insights. Watch this film! It is: gripping, believable, engaging, sad, hopeful, bleak and powerful. But it is first and foremost credible about what it's like to grow up in a tough environment. And tells a story of how to hold on and be strong, when you feel different and life can be a struggle.The film is threefold. We follow the protagonist of the three stages of life, as a child, as young and as an adult. The wonderful thing is that the actors portraying the main character, is equally good in all. They all have a great ability to communicate, and we pulled into the story of the main character, Little.What a fantastic film year 2017 appears to be. I recommend that you see this at the cinema. This is a film that demands a lot from you, and must be viewed with full attention. No break or derived. It will catch you and give you something to think about. I guarantee it."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,8/10,"A great movie. Moonlight is another production that confirms the very good vintage that comes to the Oscar this year, with a story that deals with several ""delicate"" subjects, with an undeniable quality.The story, in my view, is the point to be analyzed more comprehensively here, even though the film follows a narrative line that runs away from the ordinary, jumping between the different epochs of the protagonist's life. The message that all the work goes through is very beautiful, showing certain difficulties that people can encounter in life, according to their gender and ethnicity.The proposed narration line works well, maybe let one or another doubt at certain times, with character behavior changes, but nothing that breaks the overall quality.The photograph is beautiful, even getting to ""talk"" with the audience at certain times, using the lighting of certain places, to illustrate something said in history, and things like that.The style of filming varies a bit during the almost two hours of film, and at times it bothered a little, seeming to blur very certain elements that should be highlighted on the screen. But that's in a small part of the movie, overall, the way the film is filmed is very good and runs out of the ordinary.Among the actors I do not think anybody has done a job out of the ordinary, and that deserves a great attention, make no mistake, everyone was very competent, yes, and they do not leave anything to wish for in any moment, however, it is not from here that I would take my Oscar for actors.The soundtrack is also a high point, fitting perfectly with the setting and development of the film.In summary: Moonlight is a great movie, with a story that deserves attention, and that is told in a poetic way at certain times. Given all the controversy in #OscarSoWhite, this year we have in Moonlight a mass representative of minorities, but that is not here based on this, but for very clear merits, based on its undeniable quality."
MOONLIGHT,21 September 2020,7/10,"Most of what Moonlight does well doesn't need dialogue, nor does lean on overacting and musical crescendos. This film is as quiet and reserved as they come, letting the emotional charge of scenes talk for themselves. Whilst it does begin to fall away as the story concludes, this is still an excellent film, tackling a subject many directors and writers would not hesitate to shy away from.Split into three parts, Moonlight charts the stages of one young man named Chiron, focussing on his discovery of his own identity, whilst navigating the tribulations of life that are part and parcel for a gay man today. The first and second parts are works of art: the actors for Chiron as a child and a teenager nail every note, conveying fear, confusion and pent-up anger perfectly. This, coupled with the minimalist soundtrack and some beautiful shot framing, creates a special environment for filming.Whilst the acting is strong throughout, Mahershala Ali (Juan) is undeniably the draw, even with fairly limited screen time. He walks the line between ruthless drug pedaler and compassionate father figure so well that you understand his actions immediately. Ashton Sanders (teenage Chiron) is also brilliant - clearly unnerved and on the edge of breaking down, his silence only makes you even more empathetic to his struggle. Unfortunately, the third act is where Moonlight begins to lose stream: the tenderness of the story becomes muddled alongside some fairly pedestrian scripting and plot, something that may leave viewers wanting more.It also begs asking whether other films were more deserving of winning Best Picture at the Oscars that year (La La Land or Manchester By The Sea, for example). Regardless of this, Moonlight is a beautifully shot and well-crafted story, which does something rare in Hollywood today - originality."
MOONLIGHT,27 April 2021,5/10,"Despite the Oscar buzz and everything, it took me three years to watch this film. Since 2020 was not so good for films, I decided on catching up with popular/ Oscar winning films of the last decade. For some reason I stayed away from this film for the longest time and I finally got myself to watch this today. Having watched La La Land when it first came out and having fallen in love with it, I was super bummed it didn't win. Now I can say that this film really didn't deserve the Best picture award and La La Land was snubbed.This movie is good. It is a simple story, with decent cinematography and some good acting. I only liked the first phase of this film which had Maharshala Ali and the kid actor was brilliant too. It only went downhill from there and I was not expecting that. The other phases shown had almost nothing. It felt like an empty coconut having no substance.Coming back to the Academy awards, while this film was okay, La La Land is god damn art. The amount of work went into making that film was ten fold of what went into making this. La La Land is a technically brilliant film with insane chemistry between the leads and way enjoyable. From gorgeous sets, to colourful visuals, to great great acting, to lively and awesome music and dance, that film had everything required to be an Oscar winner. Moonlight however, had nothing to offer. As I mentioned, the first phase is good with some good direction, story, acting, etc and then it just went downhill. So it is beyond me why this film wo over the brilliant La La Land.I'm giving it a rating of 4 for the first phase and a 1 for some nice music.This is the most undeserving movie to win an Oscar and is massively overrated."
MOONLIGHT,6 November 2016,9/10,"Really beautiful and unique film. The narrative, even the pacing, is very much in the realist mode yet the movie feels dream-like, even delightfully surreal at times. While much suffering is depicted, it feels like a celebration of life, albeit one with a sad but hopeful heart. A growing-up story of someone in fairly specific circumstances, it feels profoundly universal, particularly in its last segment. The circumstances of life lead us to selves that we would never expect going forward, but that seem inevitable in hindsight. These new selves may make us, our histories, hard to recognize, but the pains of our lives spill over into each other, like a reservoir of suffering. Perhaps this is the truest definition of an individual, and the most precious thing we can share with the other."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,8/10,"Right from the get go, you can tell this is an incredibly well shot, well written indie film. Told in three parts from the perspective of Chiron, who has a different nickname for each time in his youth, this is an enriching story about a boy growing up in rural Miami, troubled by his crack- addicted mother (played brilliantly by Naomi Harris) and facing the uncomfortable truth that he is a gay man. What I really loved about the movie is that it tackles all the stereotypes we know about black men and blows the lid off homophobia in the black community. Mahershala Ali plays a drug dealer who takes care of Chiron while his mother occupied (with either drugs or men). And I can tell you right now, he is completely the opposite of what you would expect from a street dealer. He is kind, compassionate and answers Chiron's questions about homosexuality like a caring parent. I was bit disappointed by the ending - as I was expecting something a bit more of a kick, or a passionate argument. There is a small revelation about Chiron, an incident when he was teen that scared him from ever getting close to anyone again, but that's it. Other than that, it's a truly beautiful film that was deserving of its awards."
MOONLIGHT,12 January 2017,2/10,"Within the first five minutes I grasped the vibe, story, and aura. No need to see anymore. Still, to be fair I kept watching with an open mind to give it a chance, and it's just not a good movie. I don't know how it's getting awards hype other than to make up for last year and for political reasons only. I actually enjoyed Sully more and I didn't even like Sully that much, but compared to this I did.After sitting through and being pleasantly blown away and surprised by LA La Land, this movie was a downer right from the onset, and I'm not buying it. It's clearly just ""Oscar bait"", and there are no great actors leading the cast. This is just a depressing film made to garner awards and differentiate a political statement for the sake of it. After seeing many interesting films this year, I can't believe this is getting as much praise and popularity as it is.2/10. Horrible."
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2018,9/10,"This movie was one of the movies I planned to watch from the oscars 2017 highlights and I was really expecting something good since it was the best picture but at the same time I was realistic knowing it's plot resembles a lot to the one of Boyhood. That movie was just fun to watch for the on-screen aging obtained by a 12 year span of filming. This one however I expected to have somewhat of a traumatizing experience since it is about a kid growing up in harsh environments. Now although it's about a gay guy I set that aside and enjoyed this movie for what it was. I will say that it was not the best and most deserving of best picture movie of 2016 but a very good one with some great performances that made me at times forget I was watching a movie and rather feeling like I was in it. Mahershala Ali has a great performance but for me not enough screen time to be really a Oscar-worthy, instead Naomie Harris has a fantastic performance that should have won her the Oscar. Aside from that the story is very good catching me and sacking me into the movie from the first scene. The score is also very good and just enhanced the movie for me. My gripes with the movie are that: 1. It has no plot. It's really about this guy growing up. But the events, the scene and everything that happens is really very dramatic and memorable. And for me that stood out and made this movie better than Boyhood in all aspects. 2. In a african-american neighborhood there is a school with 100% african-american kids? Literally no caucasian people? I might be wrong to assume this but it's just a little bit impossible to be that way. And 3. The gay aspect is very underdeveloped. I knew from the synopsis as many users might know but some people who might not read it would be surprised to see that people were bullying Chiron for being a homosexual but we as viewers find out only around the second act and is very underdeveloped. If there was more development on that before the second stage of the movie's story it might have been a great movie. Either way I enjoyed it. It had wondeful performances, dramatic scenes and a great score. 9/10"
MOONLIGHT,22 July 2020,7/10,"This was a good movie but I can't really say any more than that. Great acting but Ali winning a best supporting oscar for his performance is strange. Don't get me wrong he played his part well but was only in it for a short while. The abrupt way his character just disappeared without ever being mentioned again was very bizarre writing. Good movie but best movie oscar, no way."
MOONLIGHT,16 May 2020,5/10,"For me the connection to the characters was never strong enough for me to be really involved completely in their struggles and indeed triumphs so sadly as a drama it did not work.The film itself is well directed, written and photographed but again with nothing outstanding or memorable for me personally."
MOONLIGHT,13 January 2020,10/10,"This is the best coming of age film I have ever seen. The writing, filming, direction and performances were flawless all the way around. Naomie Harris was robbed of the supporting actress Oscar. This is cinema at its absolute best."
MOONLIGHT,7 October 2021,1/10,"This movie is seriously the worst movie ever made. It tries so hard to have a good message and relies on that and the woke community and critics to succeed and not on the quality of the movie. The message isn't even told that well. The movie is boring and pointless the whole way through, just a kid getting bullied for being gay and how he deals with it through the ages, (it may sound like it was set up good but it wasn't). Nothing happens the whole movie and you could not care less what happens. Do not believe any good review on this movie, they are just people believing being woke is cool. Terrible movie -10/10."
MOONLIGHT,26 October 2016,7/10,"Director Barry Jenkins (""Medicine for Melancholy"" - 2008) adapts Tarell Alvin McCrney's unproduced play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,"" providing an opportunity to step into the life of young Chiron (played by Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes) as he maneuvers life under the not so watchful eye of his drug induced mother (Naomie Harris - ""Spectre"" 2015), and the accepting and nurturing guidance of Theresa (recording artists Janelle Monae) and Juan (Mahershala Ali - ""House of Cards""). Befriending the bullied (for being gay) Chiron is his school friend Kevin (played by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland). As the film chronicles their respective lives, there is an emotional and honest story to be told here. Unfortunately, the first three-quarters of the film falters as Jenkins' relies on the ""shaky camera"" effect and close placement of the camera to his actors. This style of camera work is cheap and lazy, doing nothing but distracting from the visuals and storyline. Luckily for all, Jenkins' eventually sheds this camera style, enabling the viewing audience to experience the film and the lives of its characters without distraction. While the film is very slow paced, enough cannot be said for the acting across the board. ""Moonlight"" is a case where the director got in the way of his own beautiful story. Regardless, it's worth a look see. The film maybe getting all the current publicity because Brad Pitt is executive-producing."
MOONLIGHT,22 January 2017,10/10,This is a very powerful film told in three stages of a man's life. It starts with a young black kid growing up in 1980's Miami with a crack head mother and no father figure. A drug dealer named Juan takes Chirone under his wing and teaches him about being a man. We then see a teenager version he gets bullied at school for being different and gay. Later we see the fully fledged version now distant and looking for acceptance living in Georgia. This film is told in such a unique and quiet way it really sneaks up on you. The man who plays Juan is amazing as a mentor for the kid he is a drug dealer but he really takes care of him and teaches him the lessons of life. I have to mention the score which is beautifully done in orchestra and very moving. This film was based on a play on someone who actually experienced these things. No matter where you come from you can relate to this character. Just to walk in somebody else shoes for a movie of one hour forty five minutes could possibly prove life changing for you in just accepting different races and different people. This film could do really well at the Oscars i hope it does. I couldn't recommend this film highly enough. I give it my highest grade of five stars
MOONLIGHT,31 May 2020,6/10,"A well-made story, with good direction and sublime performances."
MOONLIGHT,19 February 2017,5/10,"When you have issues in your life, you usually have two possible ways to deal with them. First, you could stand up and fight - with people or circumstances - to make it better. Second, you could bend down and take the damage, convincing yourself that maybe, if you ignore it, everything will somehow become okay by itself.There's, however, a third, much more messed up way. You could actively promote your victim state, thus incurring even more damage on yourself, but ""sell"" that victim image to someone else, effectively feeding off their pity. Not because you're utterly helpless, but because you enjoy pitying yourself and others pitying you more than you suffer from the abuse. There's even a special term for this syndrome, maybe ""victimness"" is it. And victimness is what Moonlight reeks of.I only watched this film because of the insane critical praise it received. And maybe I did except something different, something more substantial and complex from a ""timeless story of human self-discovery and connection"". Instead, what I saw was a story of a person's weakness which he constantly blames on something or someone else, bending others into feeling bad for him all along the way.Maybe some overly committed people would call me a racist (which I am not, but who cares, right?), but there's a strange correlation between such victimness stories and their protagonists being black. I wonder why... Maybe because people don't buy into a white man's whining, calling him a loser instead of giving him pity. Which basically is why white people are forced to give up that wretched third way of issue handling and either fight or keep their problems to themselves. And while both the whites and the blacks are equally susceptible to failing, it's the struggle that makes their fate interesting. That's why the film culture has produced a whole line of films about a loser's struggle, from Forrest Gump to Mississippi Grind, and that line isn't likely to break any time soon.On the other hand, just recently we've gotten at least two films in which the black hero's issues are being blamed on someone else. It's 2015's Dope and last year's Moonlight. Both times we have a deliberately weak protagonist who lets some bad stuff happen to him. Dope didn't follow the road of victimhood till the very end though, instead imbuing the once-a-loser with some unexpected (and, to be honest, rather unexplainable) strength to come ahead of his troubles. But Moonlight, this conniving mofo, slides down that slippery slope all the way. It's not just ""pity me because I'm weak"", it's the whole bouquet of racially determined bullsh!t, from ""pity me because I live in a poor neighborhood, raised by a single mom who's a drug addict"" to a new addition to the legion of sob stories, ""pity me because I'm a latent gay"". Seriously dude, what's wrong with you? You get heels over head coming up with reasons why your failures are someone else's fault, but did you take a look at yourself? Did you notice that you're an awkward weirdo who can only speak some deranged ghetto version of English and even with that ugly language are unable to say even a word when it really matters? Or that, despite all the issues you so juicily describe, you put literally zero effort to actually do something about it? Maybe that's the true reason nobody likes you!Do you know why beggars like conducting their business in public transport like metro? It's because they prey on the weak-minded and the gullible who are locked in with them with no way to run. And in those few minutes in between stations, they need to push their agenda hard enough to swindle you out of a few bucks. Well, Moonlight is no better, taking you on a slow train and using the 111 minutes of its turtle pace to squeeze all the pity and sympathy out of you for its own satisfaction. Apparently, this top dollar strategy has worked rather well for a lot of people, hence the ratings. But you're not fooling me, because the only cash I give away is the cash hard earned, with actual talent put in the storytelling. That's why I loved Precious, because that was a story of a person not broken by the circumstances, probably even more difficult than here, and not asking to be pitied. And Moonlight's story, despite a few novel chords added to its social injustice tune, isn't worth more than a rusty dime."
MOONLIGHT,17 April 2020,7/10,"Excellent film. A genuine and sentimentally touching story about a gay black man growing up in a world of adversity, yet ultimately ending in triumph and hope."
MOONLIGHT,17 April 2018,4/10,"I get the significance behind this film coming out when it did, but that doesn't change the entertainment factor. There really was no plot to it, we just watched a young black kid growing up and struggling with his sexuality which is truly award bait. Not my kind of film, but the message behind it was good."
MOONLIGHT,14 December 2016,9/10,"A singular and personal vision. An expression of a feeling, a mood, a time and place that together form empathy, understanding, and art. It's a film of moments, moments weighted with the unseen and the deeply felt with the help of three different superb actors at different times, having to convey all that's changed and unchanged without any exposition.The soundtrack is gorgeous, capturing the sublime and the superficial, the life and the atmosphere of the piece.I want to nitpick the ending but it's not yet time for that. Maybe I just wanted more, but that doesn't necessarily mean the film is at fault. I would simply ask, ""What's the message here, if any? It gets better...eventually and kinda randomly?"""
MOONLIGHT,12 November 2019,6/10,"My main reason for watching Moonlight is because one of my hobbies is trying to see all the Oscar winners. It's a sensitive portrayal of people with confused emotions about their sexuality as I saw it, rather like Brokeback Mountain and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's quite slow in places as some people here have mentioned and I thought a half hour cut out of it would have made it a stronger film but then I think that about most films today. 90 minutes makes a much better picture and modern film makers would do well to look at more old time classics to take their cue from. What did strike me was some of the performances and the five that stood out for me were Mahershala Ali, who I've now seen in several films and is growing on me, a splendid performance from Naomie Harris who I remember from Skyfall, who really ages convincingly as Little's drug addled mother, Trevante Rhodes as Black, who is the older version of Little in the final scenes, Andre Holland as Little/Chiron/Black's friend who he falls in love with and Alex R. Hibbert as Little in the earliest scenes. I can imagine all of these actors doing great things in the future. Well directed but more editing please in future to the director. A couple of violent scenes but not nearly what I expected. Don't go looking for a thriller, it's a film about ordinary people just trying to live their lives when there's not much money in their pockets."
MOONLIGHT,19 November 2016,10/10,"""Moonlight"" is an unflinchingly honest and personal look into a young man's coming of age in a low-class neighborhood in Miami. It chronicles how he was constantly oppressed by the people around him and never given a chance to be himself.The film is split into three parts: Chiron's childhood, his adolescence, and his early adulthood. The first time we see Chiron, he is being bullied. Shortly after, Juan, a drug dealer, finds him and takes him to his house to care for him, most likely because Chiron reminds Juan of himself. Juan finally convinces Chiron to tell him where he lives, but Juan becomes a prominent figure in Chiron's life, teaching him many things he had been forced to figure out on his own.The first two things we learn about Chiron is that he is made fun of in school, and he has a troubled life at home. His mother is almost never home with him, and when she is, she is always angry at him. He is understandably distant from her, and Juan and his wife Teresa serve as father and mother figures to him.The film's shallow depth of field mirrors Chiron's loneliness, and only rarely do others truly connect with him. It is a very subtle character-based film, and every actor truly heightens the emotion and power of the film. They all put in subtle and realistic performances, even the many child actors. The use of color in the film is very smart, with the color blue being representative of a character's submissiveness to others' expectations. It is a genuinely emotional film and isn't pandering to any sort of audience. As I said, this is a very personal film, but the personal struggles experienced are universal, and the emotion isn't overplayed or exaggerated, and there are also subtleties in the editing and cinematography of the film that add extra depth for the viewers paying attention. There are hidden layers to each character, and by the end, it's debatable who is being themselves, and who is hiding their true personality.So far the best film of the year and it's hard to see another film topping it."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,8/10,"At the very beginning I became dizzy by the hand held camera, but it was only used at the very beginning. I have no idea why! I considered leaving the cinema because of it, but soon I got captured by the kindness of the drug dealer. This film is a bit uncomfortable, because it tells a story about how complex life can be. The drug dealer sells drugs to Chiron's mother, who is a drug addict. There is a touching scene where the boy asks the man if he sells drugs. He answers yes. He then asks the man if he sells drugs to his mother. He answers yes, while his head bends in shame. There is a similar situation later on in the movie when Chiron has grown into an adolescent. We suspected that he was gay, and now he has his first sexual experience with a male friend from school. This friend is one of the cool students, and no one knows about their ""friendship"". Then one of his bullies makes a deal with the friend that he has to punch a random student that the bully will pick out. He picks Chiron. I won't expose what happens next, but there is a disturbing scene where the school's counselor says that he is not a man, because then he would not be a victim. I found this totally unacceptable! But this is the kind of difficult emotions and scenes the film is full of. The film might be depressing, but I think if we look, there i a lot of beauty and humanity in it."
MOONLIGHT,19 May 2017,6/10,"Although not bad, this film didn't reach my expectations like I thought it would. This film could have had so much more going for it. I love Indie films and I don't know if this film is considered an Indie but if it is it would have made a great one if more depth was put into it, if I'm saying that right. The fact that this film takes place in the hood, where homosexuality is very taboo, a great story was developed for this it. A young boy growing up in the hood into a teenager then a young man fights to hide his homosexuality from everyone and coupled with the struggles of living in a rough neighborhood causes turmoil in his already troubled life. With a story like that this film could have been simple and very effective but in my opinion it wasn't too effective but I don't want to stop anyone from seeing this film. Judge it for yourself."
MOONLIGHT,1 February 2017,7/10,"Growing up is hard. You're finding out who you are as a person while also juggling friends, family, school work, potential jobs and opportunities, as well as all the pressure and stress that comes with that. Now allow me to introduce Chiron, a homosexual African American boy who grows up and then some. Moonlight tells the story of Chiron's coming of age at three crucial moments in his adolescence. The film is directed by Barry Jenkins and stars Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris and stands as the most diverse film at this years academy awards.The acting as a whole can be summed up as short but sweet. Due to three different actors playing Chiron, there is no lead actor, and so the film is filled with supporting actors and actress' who get a maximum of about 30 minutes screen time. That being said, every actor makes every second of those 30 minutes or less count. It's a beautifully acted film with stand out performances from Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris and all three actors who portray Chiron (Alex Hibbert as Little, Ashton Sanders as Chiron and Trevante Rhodes as Black). It's a film with an emotional impact that wouldn't have worked, if it wasn't for the films outstanding cast.The film is broken up into three parts. Little, Chiron and Black. Each one focusing on an important moment of Chiron's coming of age. The three parts work well as a short film, coming of age trilogy put together to make one film. The individual parts are all well written and directed focusing on the main struggles Chiron grows up with; his abusive drug addict of a mother, his sexuality, bullying, and overall everything that comes with growing up. It's a heartbreaking and hard hitting tale that we can relate to, but also fortunately for some of us, we cannot even imagine.Barry Jenkins wrote and directed this film very well, but there is one choice he made that didn't work for me. The decade long jumps between acts did not work for me. I felt these jumps detached me from the narrative and the character. The jumps would always occur when I was most engaged in the current act. We find out what happened in the last decade instead through passing references in the following act of the film. This minor aspect emotionally detached me from the film, so although I could see how emotional the film was, I couldn't feel that emotion which is a real shame. But again this is my own personal view.Moonlight is an emotional tale about the struggles of growing up in a ruthless environment and persevering through it. It's a heartfelt, heat breaking and heartwarming film that I wish I had physically felt rather than mentally acknowledge. Nonetheless, it's a beautifully written, directed (for the most part) and acted film. Here's to diversity."
MOONLIGHT,21 March 2020,7/10,"Excellent acting performances. Beautiful cinematography also.,but the film did drag on in places. Not bad for a one time watch."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,9/10,"I put off watching this for a long time because the hype was so extreme, and my hopes were so high, but what a thoroughly beautiful and unique film this was. Director Barry Jenkins delivers up a very stylish, showy, tenderly delivered character piece about a man at three formative points in his life: as a young boy going by the nickname Little, as a fragile teenager going by his birth name, Chiron, and as a tough adult, going by the nickname Black. Chiron grows up in a tough Miami neighbourhood getting continually beat up for being soft, though he slowly becomes aware of the fact that this is because he's gay. Each moment of the film explores him as he reaches a turning point and as he must choose who he is and who he will become. To give more details would be to spoil a movie that is beautifully structured and acted, and where the filmmakers trust the audience enough to pay attention to important bits of information that are dropped casually into conversations or in the background. So the structure and the script is phenomenal. The cinematography is phenomenal (just so tenderly shot, such beautiful camera-work that is attention pulling but not overly showy and serves the story well). The actors. Oh my goodness the actors. Mahershala Ali won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his work on this movie, but if I had my way the entire lineup would have been made up of the actors from this movie. Each incarnation of Chiron is embodied by a different actor and all three are incredibly strong, embodying different bits of Chiron as he evolves but somehow keeping the core of who he is consistent. A beautifully romantic movie through and through about characters and people whose lives are usually not filmed with such respect and tenderness."
MOONLIGHT,31 January 2017,7/10,"Tremendously wary on words and even more on emotions, Moonlight is nonetheless powerful on message - not the originality of the story in itself but rather how Jenkins chooses to shoot, photograph and score the complex story of Chiron as a youngster, a teenager and an adult.Served by powerhouse performances of all three actors that embody Chiron - perfectly maintaining the exceptionally contained physical and emotional coherence of a character dealing with physical and emotional abuse as well as homosexual repression - as well as Harris' dysfunctional mother figure, Moonlight is the kind of film that soars not only but especially because of the total commitment and exertion of its actors."
MOONLIGHT,3 April 2020,9/10,"There is only one process of growth in a person's life. The big environment and his inner world together create you now and in the future. Your external can change, become strong and brave, your living conditions can change, and become rich. You can change all external conditions for others to see, but the inner world that grows along the way can't be seen by others. Whether it is bitter or happy, rich or barren, only you know."
MOONLIGHT,6 May 2020,7/10,"This is the simplest story, but also the deepest story. This is the life written by the most personal experience, but it also tells the most common life of human beings. This is the most unique film, while it depends on light and shadow to move the audience."
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2020,10/10,"Created not only to entertain and tell stories, but it has the power to tell them by launching some very strong and important messages, which today, are still misunderstood. Exceptional cast on an impeccable script given birth by a perfect direction, so Moonlight became a unique masterpiece in a decade of cinematic saturation. A masterpiece without equal."
MOONLIGHT,1 February 2017,10/10,"We all have our place in the world, it can just take a little longer for certain people to decide on both who and what they want to be. Our formative years play a big part in the life we choose, as do the people and environments that surround us. Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a quite exceptional piece of cinema that explores these ideas in such a wonderful and intimate manner.Told through three important stages of Chiron's life; the first being as a young boy nicknamed Little (Alex Hibbert), the second in his teenage years where he is actually referred to as Chiron (Ashton Sanders) and the third being in his adult years where he goes by the nickname Black (Trevante Rhodes), Moonlight depicts his journey of self-discovery and sexuality while growing up in a rough Miami neighbourhood.Moonlight is a bold coming-of-age drama from Barry Jenkins that has an important place in today's cinema, becoming a raw and powerful film that speaks volumes in today's climate through evocative performances and a strong narrative that might seem simple upon first viewing but certainly becomes more layered when you look back on it.The idea to split Chiron's story into three important stages of his formative years is a stroke of genius from Tarell Alvin McCraney, whose work as a playwright comes into play with the structure and feel of Moonlight. Watching Chiron's life take shape through certain events in his younger years combined with Barry Jenkins' screenplay, capturing a sense of realism, ensures Moonlight as a film that will stay with me for a while.I mentioned the intimate manner in which Moonlight handles its subject matter and it really is one of the film's stand-out features, the close relationships that Chiron sparingly experiences and James Laxton's cinematography really honing in on this.Coming to the performances, Moonlight is a special film with a cast who each don't get too much time to impress but they sure as hell make the most of their individual opportunities. The narrative dictates that three different actors of different ages were needed to make Moonlight work as a film, leading to Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes giving three impressive and similar performances in the lead role. Chiron is a character of very few words and they all do a lot of their talking with the looks they give to others and their facial expressions.The supporting performances in Moonlight are the ones that are getting all the limelight however. Mahershala Ali is the favourite to walk away with the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Juan, a drug dealer who has a major impact on Chiron in his younger years. Ali is not in the film an awful lot but he left me wanting to see more of his character, which is the sign of a great performance. I loved the performance given by Naomie Harris more, who stars as Chiron's abusive mother, Paula. Harris, who is up for Best Supporting Actress, gives arguably the best performance of the film, where the drug addiction leads to her character having almost two personalities, one abusive the other nurturing, if only seen briefly.To many Moonlight is the biggest threat to La La Land for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, easy to see why with how great a film it is. Moonlight is more than just competition for an award though, it's a lesson in acceptance and how our behaviour towards one another can be more damaging than rewarding."
MOONLIGHT,23 July 2019,1/10,"I cannot think of a movie as comprehensively championed as Moonlight. A 99 metacritic score, a best picture win, sure to be on the very top of dozens of 'Best of the Decade' lists, and nary a single voice of dissent on the internet. It's career suicide for a critic to bash it, and reputation suicide for anyone else to do the same. Am I wired differently than the rest of the moviegoing world, or is the power of potentially being branded with the dreaded label so strong that no one has the courage to speak up and call this thing out for the self-important garbage it is? There isn't any movie that deserves the ridiculous critical fawning moonlight enjoyed. Least if all this tepid indie arthouse trash.The selling point for this ludicrously overrated bore? It follows a young, black, gay, poor boy through life in the drug-riddled Miami ghetto. Quite the card for ""Marginalized Minority Group Bingo"". The collection of victimhood on display gives ample room for critics (leftist gatekeepers is a more apt term these days) and think-piece writers to celebrate the film's ""cultural importance"" or ""revolutionary inclusion"", and to use vaporous phrases like ""the black experience"" to try to sell its worth as a historic work of art. You'll notice, Moonlight's loudest champions don't talk about Moonlight, the movie, but rather, Moonlight, the idea. This film's creators struck some kind of gold with the con job they pulled. It's like a group of scientists spent years trying to create the wokest, art-housiest, most guaranteed critical hit the world has ever seen. And by George, they pulled it off.Let's talk about our main character. Chiron (played by three different actors in different stages of his life, none of whom give good performances), is a parody of an art-house protagonist. A mute, sensitive thinker, Chiron's job is to sit there and be a stoic victim. He gets bullied and sulks, his mom emotionally abuses him and he sulks. He goes to school and sulks, and he sits on the beach and sulks. The closest you get to emotion with this dullard is a slight pursing of the lips. He's a block of wood. Every supporting character around Chiron is better defined, and relative to his dopey ass, more interesting. Mahershala Ali is alright in his 10 minutes of screen time, and so is Naomie Harris. The Oscar nominations and win might be pushing it, but they aren't bad.You know what is bad? What is dreadfully, glaringly... bad? The writing. This whole movie plays like some loner's first attempt at poetry. It's all meaningless platitudes that sound profound, but don't make any sense, and carry no insight into the real dilemmas on display. I couldn't believe it when I heard a dime store, college freshman level line like ""sometimes I cry so much, I feel like my whole body turns to drops"" delivered with complete earnestness. That line, and many others, are straight up laughable. I've met my share of poetry nerds in college. They wish they could write a script this funny.Coincidentally, I saw this film the same day I saw Brokeback Mountain for the first time. Watching this after another celebrated gay story reveals just how empty an emotional experience Moonlight is. Brokeback involved a relationship that was strongly written and acted enough to make a romantic relationship between two men universally understandable. It was genuine, involving real people with recognizable emotional desires. The sense of empathy it created was enough to break your heart by the film's end, no matter who you are. Moonlight, on the other hand, centers on a relationship that feels completely arbitrary. A manufactured, grafted on obstacle for our cow-eyed hero to overcome. Nowhere in the film's central ""love story"" did I feel as if I was watching independent people. The characters behave more like puppets, yanked around from situation to situation with no purpose.Barry Jenkins, today's Hollywood's toast of the town, is really only concerned with the paint job. The showy, arty elements. The ""dreamy"" camerawork (or out of focus and shaky camerawork if you prefer), the poetic dialogue (laughable), the delicate background music. He doesn't much care about the characters as people, but as parts of his little tone poem school project. Moonlight is a lesson in tricking the ""sophisticated"" filmgoer. It consciously tries to look and feel like a masterpiece without creating any genuine feeling of its own. Every time I see this trash at the number one spot in someone's best of list, I get sick to my stomach. I refuse to believe that the qualities, or lack thereof, of this film can possibly merit such praise. It must come from somewhere else. From some desire to stay on the good side, the ""right side of history"" if you will. I could give a damn. I'll say what must be said...Moonlight is garbage.18/100"
MOONLIGHT,14 March 2017,9/10,"My opinion---I can already say that I discovered a magnificent film if any, I really liked this film and the depth that it released felt it all along on a subject how often worked, Barry Jenkins ""M√©decine pour M√©lancolie- (2008)"" might have fallen into the cartoon, but he did very well with this beautiful dramatic story, divided into three parts: childhood, adolescence and adulthood. This film also denounces the wickedness of young people to the difference and the impact they will have on their lives, and Moonlight will not deviate from the rule: a violent father, a prostitute mother and finally the drug and Violence to crown it all. When you read these adjectives, you will quickly understand in what atmosphere the film will lead you, you transpose this one to two young black Americans, you will tie the whole with a great friendship between these two personages who will pass through the childhood, the adolescence And then the adulthood, the whole will be carried out in a great complicity and a great modesty. The realization of Barry Jenkins is perfect, the scenario although already folded is nevertheless superb, the proof, it obtained the Oscar of the The three actors who play the respective roles of childhood to adulthood are wonderful in their interpretation and give even more depth to the film. The images are absolutely magnificent and the shots are chosen with great accuracy. Moreover, he has made a magnificent atmosphere to the film, which makes it even stronger, it is a powerful work and will not spread But by marrying all these sets that will make this film beautiful, there is of course a position on the subject of sexuality (homosexuality itself) but the subject is treated with great modesty and this Film will be even more beautiful having been treated this way by Barry Jenkins. To finally arrive at the music of the film, wonderful and which will accompany each emotion in the film: ""The Middle of the World"" by Nicholas Britell (Moonlight Soundtrack). In conclusion: I can say that I discovered a magnificent film with incredible emotions, saying that it deserved the Oscar in relation to ""La La Land"" there, I'm sure, but I also loved, "" You will not kill ""and"" Fences ""two who would have largely earned the Oscar for best film. This is a wonderful film that I advise to see for all the positives detailed in my review."
MOONLIGHT,28 January 2017,6/10,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Up close an personal. There you will find ""Moonlight"". Up close and personal. There you will find me now: I feel sadness and tragedy when being displayed the ""backside"" of The United States Of America. The trash, the broken society, the mental illness, the melancholy in the ""bada** attitude"".... this make me feel really down. ""Moonlight"" shows this spot on, and at the same time it gives both contemplation and a beautiful thing as strong friendship and a substitute to father ship. The contrast in the attitudes and the Afro Americans relationship in the back alley of America blended with the vivid classical music and violins creates something special.Ever seen the movie Boyhood that won 1 Academy Award? Moonlight is a light (pun?) version of that 12 year epic. You follow a bow to the teenage years and through the adult life.It starts out interesting and caring in the child's childhood. Then, it just becomes more and more slow and boring. Really tried to keep the attention all the way through. I wish I could be more engaged to this movie. I wish I could say that it deserves 8 Academy Award nominations. I my opinion, yes, it is good. Tragic, negative, sad... so much that it turns the rate down. Why have a great display of misery when the display could have been laughter, joy, success and good? Surely, those things can come from a disturbed youth. And still, the latter is more what should be more of.2 minutes before the ending screen, there is an intensive and tense moment staring right into that Academy Award. That moment is great... it is better than great. The solid emotions and understanding coming out of love from ""You're the only man than ever touched me...."" That ending made me put on 6,0 instead of 5,6.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent way of using the innovative music to create emotions. Innovative way to change chapters from childhood to teenage years to adult life. Good audio and good visuals. Effective and striking visual and audio editing! - The actors : Could be a lot of potential here for the future to come. - Entertainment : I wish I could say ""YES, INDEED!"". It is worth he watch. - Age : 156,0 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2017,10/10,"In this film, it uses a lot of silent pauses to tell us some deafening truths, to reveal things we otherwise couldn't hear with speech In three ""Acts"" we learn about Chiron, who speaks very little and his first line is ""What's a faggot?"" He is a shy boy being chased by a band of boys from his school when Juan, a local dealer takes him under his wing As a teenager, he continues to have a connection with Juan and his girlfriend Teresa, played so well and ably by Jenelle Monae (sp?) and still, silence speaks to us in moments where we think we know what's going on Third Act is an interesting one as it doesn't unfold the way we normally see movies like these unfold, and it's a great thing. We've seen it end one way and one way only, but in its reality, we see it more of a beginning.I enjoyed this film and hope to see more from the writer and director. It is a powerful film that only gives us the glimpse of real life without being ham handed and overly zealous. It is not pretentious, it knows what it is and keeps true to home. For that, I give Moonlight a 10."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,5/10,"Wow! I was really looking forward to seeing this after it won best picture, as it obviously was groundbreaking in dealing with a young black boy growing up gay. But as it turned out, this film managed to be minimally involving, probably because there was little dialog, and it was split into 3 sections, where not much really happened. I think the problem was that they chose characters living in the lowest echelon of the black community, where drugs and prostitution are rampant, so that the characters were not particularly interesting. Also, it didn't really deal much with the gay aspects, so ultimately, it was rather boring, and didn't result in the viewer experiencing much empathy beyond the first section. The young boy barely spoke, but suffered greatly. But then suddenly it shifted to young adult, so a lot of the emotional connection had to be regenerated. Anyway, like ""Manchester By The Sea"", this was a major disappointment, though a little less boring, and very well acted. ""LaLa Land"" should have won!"
MOONLIGHT,30 November 2016,8/10,"The biggest strength of Moonlight is the performances. Three actors play Chiron at three different stages of his life, with Alex R. Hibbert playing him as a kid, Ashton Sanders playing him as a teenager, and Trevante Rhodes playing him as an adult. I thought all three did fantastic jobs playing the same character, especially when director Barry Jenkins wouldn't let the three actors ever meet the other, as to prompt them to take the character in their own, unique direction. It really works on screen, as the writing for the character is the same, but each actor brings a new shade and a new element to the character as he grows older and progresses. Although, I think Mahershala Ali was my favorite part of the movie. I loved him on Luke Cage, and I've been wanting to see more from him, and here he brought it. He plays an important role in Chiron's life."
MOONLIGHT,12 April 2020,8/10,"If we put aside the two labels ""black"" and ""gay"" to see this movie, it tells the story of a boy growing up into a boy and finally a man. In terms of story type, it is a Coming-Of-Age movie, which is of the same type as the aforementioned ""Boyhood"", and even the story line is almost the same.This is the most valuable place of ""Moonlight Boy"". Although the protagonist of his story Chiron is a black man, it does not apply clich√© racial discrimination plots to earn audience tears; although the protagonist Chiron is gay Nor does it involve any discrimination of sexual orientation and engage in affirmative action. These two tags are inherent in Chiron. They are like men, women, tall, short, fat, and thin, just for each individual's individual characteristics. ""Moonlight Boy"" is more like a growth poem. It has nothing to do with skin color, facial features, and image. It tells the story of an ordinary introverted little boy.Through the subjective lens and soundscape, the keen sensory experience presented in the film is through Chiron's subjective observation and experience. As a result, the audience was disturbed by his uneasiness, feared by his fear, and lonely by his loneliness. The strong sense of substitution makes the audience care about the character's spiritual journey full of pain. Also because these are the childhood experiences of the original play author Tarell Alvin McCraney (his stage script was originally called ""The Black Boy Looks Blue in the Moonlight"") and the director. They grew up in the single-parent family of the same poor African-American community in Miami in the 1980s, attended the same elementary school, and had mothers with cocaine addiction (and HIV carriers), as well as experience of being bullied at school. There is no food at home, or lack of water and electricity. McCraney was indeed protected by a drug dealer during his childhood and was taught to swim by the church.Chiron's story is almost their autobiographical private memory. The African-American singer and actor Janelle Mon√°e, who plays Juan 's girlfriend Theresa, wept during the filming because the characters in the film were relatives and friends in her hometown of Kansas City."
MOONLIGHT,25 November 2016,10/10,"This is one of the most stunning movies I have ever seen. Really well-made and brilliantly acted. The characters are all so well-developed that you ache for all of them. The mother makes horrible decisions which make life hell for her son, yet you find yourself empathizing with her, too. And when a drug seller shows the boy attention that the boy badly needs, you see that he is a beautiful soul in spite of his drug sales. It's a very complex group of characters, and you really feel the pain of the boy as he struggles to survive. I think at least 5 actors in this movie merit Oscar nominations. The acting really is extraordinary. This is not an action film, but there is some very real violence between teenage boys. It is quieter than most American movies, and more intense."
MOONLIGHT,22 October 2016,10/10,"This film grips you from the very beginning. Its not an easy film to watch as it portrays the struggles many black men face growing up in marginalized neighborhoods. Its survival everyday. And for the main character, it becomes evident from the very beginning that his struggles will be augmented due to the difficult predicament he was born into.But this film does have a human and universal story that everyone will be able to relate to. The message, no matter where you come from, you can always overcome your adversities and turns things around. There is always an opportunity waiting for you, With that said, there is the reality of the surrounding. You are the product of your environment. The film does bring this point home many times. This film has had Oscar buzz and it is definitely worthy of it. The performances were powerful and raw. If this film gets a chance, this could prove to be the little independent that could because its humanity is way beyond the scope of cinematic art any studio could possibly finance. This film has a vision. You will find the filmmaker does not relent or compromise what he's willing to say. Highly recommended."
MOONLIGHT,23 December 2020,9/10,"I had very high expectations going in, and most of them were met, as this was a fantastically crafted and deeply emotional film. Part of this stems from the superb direction from Barry Jenkins which completely immersed me in the film. Part of this is the score, which I thought was absolutely fantastic. The performances are on a whole other level. Mahershala was great, but Naomie Harris was the clear standout for me. She stole every scene she was in and commanded so much screen presence it was hard to look away. The whole three part structure of the film worked really well for me and the storyline was incredibly emotional. It's definitely not a film for the faint of heart. My only complaint is that the film should have been longer just to fully flesh out everything that the film wanted to say. Other than that, it was fantastic, and I definitely need to see some more of A24's films in the future."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2021,1/10,"This movie is not good at all and goes nowhere. It is completely boring and nothing entertaining about it at all. It is just a gay dude in his life and he gets bullied, he grows up and it ends with him kissing a man. Movie had zero point to it completely boring and irrelevant movie."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2021,1/10,"This movie besides being woke, is just not a well done movie, the acting is nothing special, the story is nothing special either and is completely boring. The message has been done many times in less political ways and exectued better. Just a boring movie that could have been a short film. Nothing memorable or good about it."
MOONLIGHT,16 November 2020,8/10,"A difficult and heartbreaking story. Yet, Moonlight is also beautiful, tender and ultimately full of hope.To write anything meaningful about a movie like Moonlight, I feel like I have to make it personal. Of course, as a straight white male, it is impossibly hard to really relate to the main character. But as someone who has tried to figure out who I am for most of my life, and as someone who has never let their emotions show, I was able to connect to the main character in my own way. That's why I especially felt such a close connection to the first two acts.
There is that sense of fear and uncertainty that follows you everywhere you go, and what makes it especially difficult, is that it's coming from the inside.It might be due to my relatively young age or perhaps to something else, but I did find it harder to relate to the third and final act. The narrative felt more forced than it did in the beginning. Instead of feeling connected to the character in some way, I felt like I was simply watching a movie. And this really is my only complaint.It's quite difficult to write about a movie like Moonlight. The first and obvious obstacle is the fact that I'm white and I'm straight. But it's also hard because the story is so haunting, yet so beautiful. Trying to express the way it made me feel has turned out to be a rather difficult task.I'm glad that a movie like Moonlight can, not only exist but also receive the recognition it deserves, in today's world. It's an incredibly important story, and it's one that I think everyone should see. But it's not just an important story, it's also a very, very good movie."
MOONLIGHT,24 November 2019,3/10,I must be missing the point. I thought this was supposed to be the best movie of the year
MOONLIGHT,18 March 2017,6/10,"I went into this movie with high expectations, it is one of the highest rated movies of all time. The previous movie like this, Boyhood was one of my favourite movies of 2014. However, this movie is not as good as that one.This movie is split into three stories, and only one of them is really interesting, and that is Story 2. The plot of this film is rather boring, and characters you do not care about at all. I had difficulty even relating to the main character, it found him dull and uninteresting. Mahershala Ali gives a good performance, but was not worthy of the Oscar, I believe Dev Patel should have took that award.However despite, the boring plot-line, this movie does have fantastic writing, and acting. From the child actors, to the minor characters, every one here shines in their role. And the writing is fantastic, with some of the most realistic dialogue I have seen in a movie that year.While this film is not bad, it is not great either. I found myself looking at my watch, and wondering when anything was going to happen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and should only have had 3 of those. The nomination for best Cinematography was ridiculous, I thought the camera work was rubbish, even more so when many other films that year did a far better job.It was obvious that this movie would attract the attention of the critics, but I believe most of them were only giving it great reviews, because of all the fuss over Oscars-So-White last year. I think they just gave all the awards to this movie to prevent another backlash.6.2/10"
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2017,10/10,"Barry Jenkins's has given birth to a wonderful creation of cinematic poetry in the form of Moonlight.Divided into three chapters we follow the life of Chiron, from a young shy kid, to self discovering teenager, to re-invented adult. As each chapter unfolds, Chiron gains a new name for himself at his ages, including 'Little, and Black' as he has to continuously deal with his drug abusive mother, his exasperating school bullies, and best friend Kevin. As each decade passes, Chiron evolves into a new man figuring out who he's going to be and discovers more about himself in a magnetic life journey.What Jenkins has perfectly accomplished in his wonderful artwork is the creativity and imagination that can be achieved through the practise of filmmaking. Making a real outstanding piece of work, Jenkins has made a film to always be remembered. By exploring a sensational coming of age story of one black boy, Jenkins has made a whole new outlook of life itself with a magnificent message about being a stand out.Filmmaking and writing can only take you so far, until you have the right people in the roles. The entire ensemble cast of Moonlight fuel the heart of the film. With the most believable cast of actors to portray the same person. From Alex Hibbert playing the lonesome child of Chiron, to Ashton Sanders insecure teenager, and Trevante Rhodes closed off adult. As well as appearance that holds it together, all performers capture the posture and gestures of the character, which had me believe they pulled a Boyhood.With furthermore Oscar nominations for the supporting roles of Naomi Harris and Mahershala Ali, Jenkins has created some familiar characters who are uniquely and amazingly executed by both actors. Personally the stand out for me is Harris, though Viola Davis is sure to win the Oscar, I stand by Harris' transcendent performance.James Laxton's extraordinary cinematography pulls the entire atmosphere together with a stunning perspective into the upbringing of one boy, which significantly creates an innovative way of looking at life, the world, and identity. With one scene particularly Laxton encaptivates the audience into the scene. Even from the trailer, you can have the majestic and intriguing pleasure of listening to the score by Nicholas Britell. Tunes of such disturbing and enticing imagery enters the real cinematic world that Moonlight is layered in.The only shameful issue that I hate to admit is that, after such an incredible experience, I feel the ending unexpectedly arrives in a spontaneous nature that personally left me unsatisfied with the conclusion. Although I also admire the hidden meaning and symbolism that is invested into the film, it was also hard to discover the meaning that Jenksin's is trying to show. But the film won me with its phenomenal artistic presence.With the Academy Awards close by, I will say that I still stand by LA LA LAND for winning Best Picture, but with Moonlight being also the favourite I will rest knowing that one of these artistic pieces of craftsmanship will be named best film of the year. 10/10"
MOONLIGHT,28 August 2019,8/10,"Very well told and acted story of coming-of-age, manhood, self-awareness (and the lack of it), friendship, tenderness, loneliness and loyalty. The film immerses us into this boy's life, fears, hopes and constraints. Slowly told and very touching."
MOONLIGHT,12 May 2017,4/10,"I finally caught up with this year's Questionable Oscar winner, ""Black Moonlight"" last night. in Budapest. Like everyone else I was curious to see what all the noise around this picture was all about. Well, it was a fairly attention holding film, amateurishly made, but well acted with a good story, and certainly not quite as bad as that piece of mainstream crap, LalaPaloozaland, which it snuck in over at the Oscars. A great film, No -- but a pretty okay one, okay, yes -- notable for the fact that it makes you almost forget that every single actor in the movie is Afro-American and obliges you to just concentrate on the story and the plight of Chiron, the central figure with a sexual orientation problem. But really primitive in terms of production values and, if you stay for the end credits you'll see that no less a Hollywood high roller than Brat Pitt was Executive Director -- (obviously trying to hop onto the Combat Oscar Racism bandwagon -- to maybe salvage his sullied private image for leaving wife Angela Jolie, mother of many, in the lurch?).The film plays out in three parts; Part one, the neglected childhood of Chiron the child is very good and ex-rapper Mahershala Ali was riveting as the muscular drug dealer who takes a fatherly shine to the abandoned boy. His Best supporting Actor Oscar was very well deserved although he appears only in Part 1. The acting of the boy was also notable. Part 2, Adolescence, during which Chiron has his first, and apparent only, homosexual experience, is weaker, but still okay. In part three the one time teenage lovers are reunited years later in a tense overly drawn out conclusion that is well acted but badly cast and feels like a self conscious add-on. Adult Chiron looks absolutely nothing like his earlier versions and his first and only lover has since been married and fathered a child. The conclusion which is full of potential ends having no sense of closure conviction. One distracting device used in the picture is lengthy blackouts instead of cuts between scenes which reeks of low-rent more than stylistic decision. Altogether, a respectable low budget effort but nowhere near what is to be expected from an Oscar contender, let alone a winner. This was obviously a Guilty Conscience Booby prize. Sorry, but facts are facts and the mistaken winner attribution at the Oscar ceremony by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway was the perfect absurd touch to an absurd Best Film award."
MOONLIGHT,1 February 2017,9/10,"Moonlight is quite a well made piece of artwork with lots of interesting messages placed throughout it as we see this loner kid grow up and how certain events affect him in a realistic way. Moonlight tells the story of a young black kid who grows up in Miami and tries to live his life, but can't because of the kids who picked on him. He is bullied, his mother is on drugs and there are so many problems going on in this kids life. But what makes life truly hard for him is the fact that the young boy being portrayed here is also gay. This is something that plays out in a very interesting way. It doesn't stereotype this kid for being gay. Even though there are many signs throughout the film it doesn't highlight them and instead highlights the child's life as a struggling youth with his homosexuality simply being a add on to a already bad situation. The film is brutal and tackles really powerful topics, and is probably one of the strongest and most emotionally driven films I have ever seen. Mahershala Ali should undoubtedly get a best supporting actor win out of this, and this film also deserves to win a best screenplay because the dialogue in this film is amazing and captures you when you watch. Maybe not at the level of Birdman or Spotlight, but it gets really close. This is a very well told film and deserves a lot of the love the Award season is giving it."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,5/10,"Was that 50 Cent in the film?Typical Oscar choice formula. It's not about being an overall quality film at all or having some entertainment value. To win an Oscar, all you really need is to have a controversial subject matter (Like the film 'Crash' winning in 2005). Last year, Spotlight won just for the controversy subject matter about a daily newspaper uncovering the Churches molesting young children - the film itself is extremely boring unless you find office meetings exciting. This film is just as slow as Spotlight, it tries to be artsy with random shots. I believe it's a true story based on a play; the film could have been told in one hour, but they really stretched it out. Moonlight won Best Picture, this year, about a gay boy growing up. Of course, the timing is really on their side with all the gay ""LGBT"" movement going on. It is the ""hipster"" thing today. Add to that, last year there was major controversy/boycotting about the Oscars being a total racist (Jada Pinkett Smith/Will Smith) and not nominating or awarding black people. How convenient for this year (2017) for so many black actors suddenly taking over the Oscars, winning awards and winning the ultimate Best Picture prize. Oscars really must have felt guilty or scared of the boycott. I was expecting more surrounding the nature of being gay/complexity, but the film is just straight forward; Boy making out and stroking another boy. Oh, how controversial. A skinny boy suddenly turns into a macho Curtis James Jackson (Rapper 50 Cent). Mahershala Ali won Best Supporting Actor. I liked his character, but he's only in the first few minutes of the movie! I'm surprised he won as well just for that small part. I was expecting him to return somewhere later in the film, yet he never comes back. The film never really explains what happened to him. The ending is so weak. It was probably the worst part of the film. I think LA LA Land is overrated, but Moonlight is even more overrated. Lion was the overall best film/powerful. Spotlight... Moonlight... If Twilight focuses on politics and racism, show that the vampire characters were actually transgendered the whole time, maybe they have a shot at winning the Oscars in 2018."
MOONLIGHT,10 June 2020,1/10,"This is Hollywood in the age of Social ""Justice"". Make a film about ""oppressed"" African American victims AND about closeted Homosexual victims, you WILL win every award."
MOONLIGHT,7 December 2016,9/10,"""Who is you"" is the repeated refrain of Moonlight, the story of Miami-born Chiron told in three chapters corresponding to three ages (grade school, high school, and mid-20s). The answer is complicated. Chiron is shy. Chiron is black. Chiron is poor. Chiron is the son of an neglectful mother and absent father. Chiron is the target of bullies. Chiron is coming to grips with his homosexuality. Chiron seems to be a laundry list of melodrama and angst, but it's to Moonlight's great credit that it never loses sight of the fact that Chiron is Chiron. Moonlight is, more than anything else, a emotionally resonant and empathetic character study. The fact that is has beautiful cinematography, a tremendous score and soundtrack, and shines a light on a traditionally ignored segment of the population is all gravy.Each chapter is titled for a moniker of the main character (Little, Chiron, and Black, respectively), and grapples with his self- identity. The three chapters can be roughly broken down into three epiphanies: understanding your world, understanding your self, and understanding how to accept and be honest about your self. Every side character is written solely in terms of their relation to Chiron (I can only think of one scene without the main character), including a drug dealer who becomes his de facto father figure and his friend Kevin, who greatly influences his fortitude and his sexuality. Despite Chiron being a person of few words, director Barry Jenkins' camera and the performances of the three actors playing Chiron give us a complete, intimate picture, transcending the shallow stereotypes that appear on the surface, particularly in its third act. It seems ready to jump into yelling, violence, and melodrama at any point, but opts for restraint in nearly every case while still providing pathos and catharsis.What pushes Moonlight from effective to extraordinary is its beautiful production. Jenkins' frames are all a piece of art unto themselves, popping with slightly over-saturated colours (the full title of the original play is In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, and you better believe they get that shot). There's a lot to dissect in each image, and they paint a vibrant and distinctive world in spite of the often depressing material. The soundtrack is loaded with the kind of old soul and R&B that Kanye West made a career out of sampling, contrasting with the strings of the stunning original score. And the performances are fantastic from top to bottom, with Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali deserved locks for supporting Oscar nominations.Moonlight is an utterly absorbing and beautiful film with unfailing empathy for its main character. It avoids the numerous awards-bait pitfalls, standing a singular and triumphant work. As a piece of visual art, Moonlight is worthy of study. As a gripping drama, Moonlight is entirely effective. As a time capsule of an era where identity has taken centre stage, Moonlight is maybe the most important and relevant film of the year."
MOONLIGHT,31 January 2017,10/10,"The holiday dry spell of movies worth watching is officially over. Lots of good films filling the theaters. I'm glad we caught Moonlight, written and directed by Barry Jenkins (III) before it faded, though maybe it will be around longer now with the Oscar Best Picture nomination. I'd seen the preview and came away asking myself, what the heck is this movie about?, instead of my usual, why did they give away so much of the story?!! Immediately I was persuaded to see it, though, upon learning the play it's based on was written by Tarell Alvin McCraney, whose Brothers Size plays were so powerful on the McCarter Theatre stage a couple of seasons ago. Whatever it was about, I knew it would be worth watching. Brian Tallerico for RogerEbert.com calls it ""one of the essential American films of 2016."" In some ways it reminds me of modern (30 under 30) fiction-writing. A bit of disjointedness and a big dose of grit are part of the package. We see protagonist Chiron (pronounced Shih-RONE) at age 10 or so (Alex Hibbert), as a high school student (Ashton Sanders) negotiating tricky teenage waters in a violent environment, and finally as a young adult (Trevante Rhodes), struggling with his sexuality. While he in some ways advances, becoming more physically powerful, if still emotionally fragile, his mother (Naomie Harris) succumbs to her addictions and her sentimentality. His one lifelong friend Kevin (Andr√© Holland) cannot be the lifeline he needs. As Mara Reinstein says in US Weekly, the movie ""touches on themes of race, sexuality and isolation in ways that are rarely depicted in cinema."" A late scene with the adult Chiron and his mother, says so little in words and so much in feeling that it feels like a documentary. It doesn't seem like actors reading lines; it's real people struggling to connect. The actors playing Chiron at all three ages do a stellar job. Two actors recently in very different parts in Hidden Figures appear again here: Mahershala Ali as the young Chiron's drug dealer mentor and Janelle Mon√°e as his girlfriend. Various artistic touches distinguish this film, reminding you it is a deliberately created thing. Parts of it are filmed with such super-saturated tropical heat that the stills would be like artworks in themselves. McCraney and Jenkins both grew up in Miami's Liberty Square area, and the film carries the strength of their grip on its realities."
MOONLIGHT,28 May 2021,10/10,"Rewatch :: Part of my brain doubted this was as good as I remembered it being. Surprise, it's even better!"
MOONLIGHT,10 May 2017,2/10,"Soooooo Moonlight won some Oscars......then I watched it believing it was going to make feel something for the characters or the situation the characters were in BUT I DiD NoT FeeL a THiNG The lead character barely talks - and hes trapped in a situation that has been covered bya huge number of other films - namely poor black kid must overcome poverty and learn and grow in a cruel world...oh and hes gay. So therewas nothing really unique going on. It was just boring. The father figure in the film seemed way to nice to be real - I half expected him to a child abuser. Did not really get him at all? The 3 parts of the film also seemed dis-jointed, especially the last act...I did not know what was going on....so I suppose it was #Oscars so Black this year to balance #Oscars so White last year, now we are all happy again can the Oscars get back to awarding movies that deserve it instead on pandering to the black community"
MOONLIGHT,7 October 2019,8/10,"The movie is about the three phases of an African-American gay man living in Miami:I. Little - The name by which he was called by those that would bully him because he was shorter and walked differently. This early, he is forced to play with the losing cards he's been dealt with.II. Chiron - His real name, this is the young adult years where high school as per usual gets to teach you that life isn't fair and either you deal with it head on or you runaway and make a new life for yourself.III. Black - The name by which his childhood friend Kevin used to affectionately call him. Black now lives in Atlanta, trying to move forward away from it all, when he receives that one phone call that will bring him back to where it all started.While all the elements are there for a surefire Best Picture win, great actors, lovely texture and a moving storyline, the problem with telling a story that spans a long period of time in just below 2 hours is it's brevity. What was it like for Little when he finally understood the term 'faggot'? What was it like for Chiron to start over in Atlanta? What was it like for Black to have feelings for another man? With so many questions but the answers are few, you end up sympathizing instead of empathizing and that world of difference is what separates the Oscar Best Picture winners from the runners-up."
MOONLIGHT,21 February 2017,9/10,"This coming-of-age film succeeds in capturing the life of a minority, a homosexual black man in the urban environment of Miami, following him through childhood to adolescence to adulthood.For a fairly minimalist film in terms of budget, the themes and subject matter shine brightly. The performances from the performing cast; particularly Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are fantastic. Definitely deserving of the Oscar nominations.The tackling of prejudice is done particularly well as well as the overlying transformation story.Definitely worth going to see."
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2019,6/10,"The story is boring and I kept waiting for a payoff and finally gave up at around the hour mark. At least the filmography and acting is well done, it's just that I didn't feel engaged."
MOONLIGHT,20 December 2016,9/10,"'Moonlight' is illuminatingMoonlight is a self contained story about the life of a young man as he grows up in Miami, Florida. He has many of the problems we see in other films about boys and girls growing up, but it is not a coming of age story in the traditional sense. The main character goes by various names in the film: Little, Black and his given name, Chiron. He's little compared to his contemporaries, and he is bullied for his quiet demeanor. The transitions from Little to Black to Chiron work well. The film expresses genuine emotion through the main character's struggles. The film touches on the themes of living poor, being black and being gay, but it is above all a character study about Chiron who happens to grow up gay, poor and black. No grand statements are made about identities, just about him. I can't think of anything that comes across and phony. The transition between the three actors that play Chiron is also pretty good. I am not sure they all look alike but the writing makes the transition so well that we don't care. We know it's him. Singer Janelle Mon√°e as Teresa goes a good job as a family friend and Naomie Harris as Chiron's mother is able to demonstrate much, if not all, of the complexity of the character. Mahershala Ali from House of Cards fame is both charming and dangerous as a man caught up with few choices who mentors ""Little"" in what it means to be a man. Rating: Pay full price. While not perfect, it is authentic and emotionally appealing with come great acting and a good script. That's more than we can say about most films this year. Peace, Tex Shelters"
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,7/10,"This movie is a slow starter and takes a while for you get drawn into the story and characters. You have to bear with it.The concept of the movie is a good one and for the most part portrayed quite realistically. You follow the main character from age 7 thru to late 20's. They use different actors to play the different ages of the young man. The first two - thru to age 16 were very good and believable. The portrayal of the character in his late 20's was much less believable. The Director 'over-butched' the man. It just didn't ring true for me. And then towards the end of the movie, the main character declares that he has not been with another guy since his first teenage experimentation at about age 15/16 with a school buddy. Now that did stretch my belief to the limit.Despite that, the movie has a lot to offer. It is gritty and realistic. In my opinion, it is worthy of the Best Picture Oscar against the other nominations, although I did think Hacksaw Ridge would probably win! This movie should be on your list of one to watch - but no need to rush out and see it."
MOONLIGHT,18 June 2017,9/10,"'Moonlight' is the moving coming-of-age story of a young black boy, Chiron, who is having difficulty coming to terms with his sexuality, as well as the abuse he receives from his drug addicted mother.Based on the semi-autobiographical book by Tarell Alvin McCraney ('In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue'), it explores three stages of Chiron's life ~ from the pre-teen years through adulthood. It focuses on topics such as homophobia, drug and child abuse, poverty, and inner-city crime. The first movie to feature an all-black cast, 'Moonlight' is both breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly tragic. One highlight of the film was the portrayal of Juan by Mahershala Ali, a character who acts as the surrogate father to Chiron's non-existent one. Ali won a well-deserved Academy Award for his amazing performance in the film, along with 'Moonlight' itself winning the Oscar for Best Picture.Everything from the music (R & B, hip-hop, classical), to the amazing photography, to the incredible performances delivered by the actors, indicates why this film was THE best of the last movie season."
MOONLIGHT,9 December 2018,1/10,"Boring and unremarkable, wonder if the high rated reviews are from the cast and crew."
MOONLIGHT,14 October 2017,8/10,Summary (no spoilers)This movie is a story of a young African-American depicting his three stages of life growing up in a rough neighborhood in Miami.My Review (no spoilers)This movie had a good plot. Yes I have come across movies with this kind of stories but the director and the actors were able to make this movie unique and good. Everyone did a wonderful job in acting for this movie. It had the perfect and predictable ending. It had some heart touching dialogues some of which keep ringing in our ears.My Recommendation Yes I liked it I think you would too.My Rating 8/10
MOONLIGHT,16 July 2017,10/10,"I was extremely reticent to see this film because I thought it was going to be just another film about black ghettos and drug dealers. I was wrong. This film masterfully tells a touching story of a boy in three stages of his life (each set about 7 years apart, the film takes place roughly in the late 1980s, mid 1990s, and early 2000s). The story follows a shy, bullied boy in a hyper- masculine culture. The story is about love and reconciliation and even though some will dislike the gay content, the gay aspect isn't the point - it only emphasizes his separation from the culture he is being raised in, and his search for finding love and acceptance. The film cleverly uses devices like being fed by people he loves, and cool breezes to underscore when he is feeling safe. The film also uses colour and texture brilliantly - black skin gleams from tension and sweat induced by Florida's humidity. Camera techniques bring you into the film - they look directly at characters, so you become the other person in the conversation. At the beginning of the film the camera circles a character to emphasize how the world revolves around this important man; the same technique is used in reverse later in the film to focus on a bully, while the world whirls around him to emphasize the chaos he creates. The characters are complex, capable of good and bad, and that is so refreshing to see in a film like this that so often relies upon stereotypes - bad-ass mother---ers with guns and attitude. The foul language that is used in the film underscores the need for belonging rather than clich√© characters.I was mesmerized by this film and taken in by its characters and story from the very start, and the ending is everything I hoped for and didn't expect!Added June 2018 (a year after my original review) Interesting to see 3 people have voted my review as 'unhelpful.' Fortunately, I know my review is one of the best I have ever written and extremely helpful for those who haven't seen the film to determine whether it would be something they would enjoy watching. I know this because a certain professional movie critic complimented me on this review. These three votes are just homophobic trolls who vote down movies they don't like. How sad."
MOONLIGHT,31 January 2017,9/10,"Now this was a unique one. 'Moonlight' was so fascinatingly done and such a unique piece to watch unfold. As I referred to previously, in a way, this can be seen as a ""non-traditional"" film. It does not follow the typical movie formula with a story to develop, there were no big hooks or climaxes placed within. The film simply followed Chiron and his life through the three acts and how he had to live through the many trials and tribulations that came with his environment. Overall, it was a very unique experience watching 'Moonlight' in the way it was delivered... Now, for the overall performances and the effect of said performances. 'Moonlight' tugs at the heart-strings of its viewer. Everyone involved in the film delivers an honest and pure performance that is felt from beginning to end. From feeling Chiron's despair to feeling hatred for Naomie Harris' character who plays Chiron's mother. 'Moonlight' is an emotional piece that demands to be felt. An all-around well executed film from performance to direction. To draw any kind of negatives from the film, I can understand people not feeling Barry Jenkins' way of delivering this story. As I said before, with the non-traditional structure and no laid out story, it can be perceived as boring or slow, maybe even pointless to some. But, to anyone that may feel this story is pointless, you would seem to be missing the actual point: Unless you are a gay/lesbian African American being raised in a hard neighborhood, how can you truly know if this story is pointless or not? Even if you changed some parts of the formula, this is a story many do not touch or bring to the light. Not many know the struggle unless they have lived it. So before you care to critique that this story is useless or boring, jump off your pedestal or quit watching Oscar nominated films and stick to The Fast and the Furious.'Moonlight' may not be my favorite of the Oscar nominated films or my favorite of the 2016 film releases but I would be damned if I did not appreciate it or love it in my own way. Watching this film, I was zoned out from everything happening around me and was in total focus of the movie and how it was unfolding with each act. I found myself inside Chiron's world until the credits began to roll. A very solid and once again, unique film to witness. -- Oberrated.com --"
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2017,10/10,"Three chapters in a young Miami man's life at ten, sixteen, and twenty-five years of age. We witness his emotional growth, the collapse of his home life, his friendship with one particular classmate, and his growing awareness of his sexuality. Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" is an extraordinary film that follows this path to give us an incredibly powerful glimpse into an African-American man's life over a decade and a half.The first chapter (""Little"") tells us the story of ten year old Chiron (Alex R. Hibbert). We see him bullied by his schoolmates, and rescued after a fashion by Jean (Mahershala Ali), a local drug dealer, and his girlfriend Theresa (Janelle Monae). As this relationship develops, his mother (Naomie Harris) struggles to make ends meet for both of them, while battling her own growing addition to crack. Meanwhile, a third key relationship develops with schoolmate Kevin. The next chapter (""Chiron"") sees the protagonist at sixteen (Ashton Sanders), as his shy personality and lanky frame continues to make him the target of schoolyard toughs, while his mother's downward spiral continues, and his relationship with Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) takes more than one unexpected turn. The final chapter (""Black"") flashes forward almost ten years, as Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) is now living in Atlanta, and his life has taken a believable, though hardly inevitable, turn; he's now trying to seek some peace of mind in his relationship with his mother and with Kevin (Andre Holland).Every moment of Jenkins's screenplay rings absolutely true, presenting a realistic and powerful series of vignettes about Chiron's life. Reminiscent of Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" (to which Jenkins gives a knowing tip of the hat), Jenkins is careful to inject not only the negative elements of Chiron's life, but also the small positive notes and setting a fully rounded picture of his day-to-day existence. Each of the three actors playing Chiron help to fill out that picture, creating a remarkable continuity of character throughout the three stages of his life, and each masterfully plays off of the script, which so effectively uses indirect dialogue that Chiron's internal struggles resonate directly with the audience. Indeed, Rhodes' final series of scenes with Holland exquisitely use this type of indirect dialogue to give the audience that sad but knowing sense of paths that might have been -- but weren't -- taken, and the need to move on all the same.The supporting cast is equally well-rounded. Harris, Ali and Monae are absolutely superb, taking characters that could easily be stereotyped and giving them layers and shadings that we can readily see manifesting in Chiron's character as he grows. It's almost as if the film shows us the making of a man as if he were a sculpture, and we can almost see the clay as it is applied and molded, with each person we see touching his life leaving their own mark.The film is also beautifully shot, contrasting the sharp and defined colors of Chiron's day to day life with the serene and dreamy blue filtering in the scenes on the beach -- Chiron's escape from the hell of his day-to-day world. The last shot is a universal one -- we've all thought about at one time or another about how we got where we are, and where will our choices take us. It is a final, haunting image that sticks with the viewer, one that makes us see our own lives through the life of someone most of us would never think twice about.If not the best picture of the year, ""Moonlight"" is pretty damn close."
MOONLIGHT,21 April 2020,8/10,"Exquisite and restrained, but the surge of emotion is like the tide in the moonlight.It's just about a boy growing up."
MOONLIGHT,4 December 2016,10/10,"Just got back from the theater and bravo. Just wow. This is an absolutely unique work of art. I have to say work of art because the word 'film' feels almost curt in this case. I was going to call it a new take on an old story but it's much much more than that. It's not just a 'coming out' story. It's bigger...universal themes of awakening and redemption. It's a thing of its own, really. Not predictable. Beautifully acted and directed, and the camera work and use of music is genius. And the use of silence is masterful. So much of the story is in the silent spaces. And it's got this strange tension all throughout... like poetry on a tightrope. Yeah. 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,20 November 2018,1/10,"This film is so dreadful, I get angry thinking about it. Hate, is not a strong enough word for this rubbish. Just look at how many 1s are in user reviews & they're there because you can't give a minus score. In fact, I'm getting angry trying to write this review. I have to stop before I break something"
MOONLIGHT,29 January 2017,3/10,"Moonlight started out well. Deep, rich, flawed characters you could really settle in and watch for a while. Then it goes into a weird place. it drifts off into a place I never wanted to be and brought in a bunch of characters I didn't like. It wound up seeming very long. Ali, nominated for an Academy Award, will never win because his character was dropped early. He's barely in the movie and was one of the very few likable ones in the show. Same with the mother. She was good, but hardly in the film, yet got an Oscar nomination.I was rooting for the kid, but he turns into an unlikable thug. He turns ""hard"" and hard to root for. Then there was this weird, gay love story stuck in too. It seemed so out of place that it lent nothing to the story. Like it was just there for shock value.Another one in 2016 that I just didn't get the hype over and don't understand all the Oscar accolades. I say skip it. It was not good at all."
MOONLIGHT,4 January 2017,10/10,"When a film comes out and you know next to nothing about it with a director you don't know and a cast of mostly unknowns and it blows you away like it did me. Then I know I'm confronted by something unique. In fact it was director/writer Martin Donovan who wrote about Moonlight, urging all his actors to run and see it. Thank you sir. The faces of those three young men who are just one did something to my brain and to my heart. The best group of actors I've seen in one single film in a long, long time. The big surprise is that we knew it all along. It's all about love and what it means to be a man. Thank you Barry Jenkisns A revolutionary film made of truth and beauty."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,8/10,"I don't usually read other reviews here before I write my own; this time I did and I was disturbed by the tone of many of the negative reviews. A bridge beyond just different tastes, methinks, and into that world where a review says more about the reviewer that the subject.No spoiler alerts necessary here. Okay, one small one, next para.This is in my opinion the most unlikely love story in modern film history, staged in a part of American society where many would like to think ""love"" doesn't exist. Having been there, unlike the majority of reviewers here, I can assert it most certainly does. The depth of feeling that the portrayals of the main character present through three actor changes was fantastic, even (spoiler alert) when the director shows the post-jail version of his character yard-bulked out - which he would need to be to survive, though apparently many reviewers didn't ""get"" that - the essential character stayed the same.Liberty City in Miami is not the usual place one would expect a love story to reside in movie world and most of the characters here would as well not be those from whom understanding nor progression would emerge. But that does happen. If you're looking for ""South Central II"", look elsewhere.If you want to see a movie that shows love can emerge and reside in the most unlikely places, this is your movie."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2021,10/10,"I do not say this lightly: Moonlight achieves near perfection. The first time I saw it, it was kind of in one ear, out the other. I don't think I fully saw it, saw it's core. I thought I had a decent understanding of the African-American condition, as a white male, but I didn't. I never will. However, I have learned and expanded my mind since my first viewing of Moonlight, and upon a repeat viewing, I have seen it's core... and at the same time, saw nothing at all.Some people say that a great edit, great sound design, great visual effects, even great acting and directing is something that you don't notice: it's so immersive, so worthy of your attention yet undistracting, that you don't even notice it; rather, you live it. You experience a perfect scene as if it were real, happening right in front of you. The second time I watched Moonlight, I experienced it. I didn't wonder ""Who's that actor?"" until I was at it's end. Perhaps this means I should be more familiar with the people on screen, and if so, my ignorance was worth it.Everything about this film is damn-near untouchable. Moonlight gives hs beautiful cinematography, fantastic acting at all age levels (that's important, I HATE child actors), a phenomenally realistic and powerful script, all tied together truly artful direction. Moonlight is moving, and more than that, it is real. This is an important film: not to watch, but to experience it. I hope everyone gets a chance to experience it as I did."
MOONLIGHT,1 January 2017,9/10,"What if you grew up Black, while also feeling like you are a homosexual? It's hard enough living through one of the two, which is why it takes a seriously committed director like Barry Jenkins to accept the challenge. He doesn't have that much experience directing feature-length films, but in Moonlight, you would think he's been a master of his craft for decades. His latest feature has been picking up tremendous well-deserved Oscar buzz due to its subtle shock value that grips you throughout all the important milestones of a boy's growth into a man within an all-Black community.The boy's name is Chiron, and Jenkins introduces us to him while he is on the run from other boys at school who throw garbage at him. His tears of fright call the attention of a humble, hospitable member of the community, played with a cool soothing voice by Mahershala Ali. In this stage of his youth, Chiron's words are far and few in between, leaving room for what he doesn't say, rather than what he does say, to craft his complex character. At this point he's given the name ""Little"" by the friendly older man, who plans to help him get home, against the boy's wishes, and for good reason. His mother is the living embodiment of the environment he must grow up in: trashed, rejected, dependent on drugs to sustain mental stability, in other words, the usual Black mother figure of Hollywood cinema. It's not the best portrayal of Black women, but Naomie Harris' (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Skyfall) performance as this mother figure is the most disturbing and terrifying on screen depiction since Heath Ledger's Joker.This man quickly becomes the father figure ""Little"" never knew he wanted, as depicted by a nostalgic swimming lesson on the seashore. He may have the role model his mother failed to be, but it turns out that's not what his biggest problem is. Rather, his sadness comes from daily getting called a ""faggot,"" so frequently in fact, that he wonders if it's true. Under any other directors' hands, this scene could easily go dreadfully wrong, but Jenkins knew how to pace it in a fashion that commands tears to be shed as Chiron opens up about his sexuality.Then we are shown his teenage years, where he is given the nickname ""Black"" by his best friend Kevin. He almost always keeps to himself as his social capacity is limiting; his mother's desperate harassment towards him for drug money not helping in the process. Just like anybody in their teenage years, here is where screenwriter (also Barry Jenkins) cranks up his storytelling vigor, throwing in detail after detail of Chiron's most important memories to keep even the most distanced of minds intrigued.The visual flavor is not like other motion pictures you have seen. Everything about the camera-work is flawed: the image jerks all over, the image spins in and out of focus, the white balance is off, but you know what? It works. If done unintentionally, this would appear to be the work of any amateur who's never touched a camera before. But director of photography James Laxton orchestrates these imperfections to match the disorder of Chiron's desire for self- discovery. Nicholas Brittel's (The Big Short) soundtrack matches the troubling look of the picture to help you hate the people that Chiron would want dead.While it may be an immediate shut-off for many to see the very open life of a homosexual, especially in a film that features only one White actor (playing a police officer), this is one of the most intriguing looks into Blackness of the past decade. It's not every day you look into a world where all Blacks casually call each other a ""n*gger"" as if it's common slang. So if the subject matter does not offend you, and you want to feel better about the place of Blackness in our world, then Jenkins' character study is made especially for you."
MOONLIGHT,10 November 2019,7/10,Good. Powerful. Great acting by everyone but the lead. Best I've watched so far.
MOONLIGHT,12 December 2016,8/10,"12 December 2016 This past weekend, I saw the film ""MOONLIGHT"". The story location in the gang neighborhood of Liberty City, Florida is not to far away from my legal residence of Miami.All Three adult actors, Mahershala Ali, Naomi Harris and the very pretty and fine Janelle Mon√°e all are great in their roles. Story is good and well acted by all the cast all around.However, I hated hearing all of the cursing and use of the ""N"" word. However, none of that made me want to stop watching the film, but when the scene of the two young boys kissing, it was time for me to leave and that is what I did. One thing for sure, I Never want to see such scenes as two men being romantic.Over all, I give the film and 8."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2017,7/10,"There is much that is good about Moonlight and in the overall, I quite enjoyed it.But I cannot for the life of me see how it won the Golden Globe for the best motion picture drama, or that it can win the best picture Oscar, as while enjoyable, it is some way from being a great movieIt is the story of Chiron, a gay African American, and it is split into three distinct time periods, with three different actors playing the main role. The first part is when Chiron is a young boy, and to this reviewer, it is by far the best part of the movie. The sensitive young boy, who scarcely understands his own sexuality, is mercilessly bullied and made fun off by his schoolmates, who sense that he is different.His mother is a prostitute crack addict and he has no father. A kindly drug dealer (now there's an oxymoron for you) in the neighborhood takes Chiron in hand, and between him and his girlfriend, they provide a safe haven from the horrors he suffers at home and at school.While the first part of the story doesn't move along particularly quickly, there is more than enough going on to hold your attention.Part two begins with Chiron in his mid-teens. He is still shy and his schoolmates still tease and bully him. One day he is taunted viciously about his prostitute mother; he gets angry but takes no action. Kevin, his school friend since childhood, takes him to a deserted beach where they kiss and Kevin gives him a hand job. Later at school Chiron is taunted yet again and Kevin is put under pressure by a school gang to punch Chiron. This he does, and urges Chiron to stay down on the ground, but Kevin keeps getting up again, whereupon the gang descend on him and beat him severely.This is a pivotal moment in Chiron's life. He has clearly had enough of being picked on and intimidated. The next day he enters class, picks up a chair and breaks it over the gang leader's head. He is dragged off by teachers and arrested by the police. The story still holds your attention, as you care enough to want to know where it goes from here. But there are many overly long gaps in action and dialogue, and we just watch the screen for minutes at a time, waiting for someone to speak or something to happen. This is particularly so in the scenes between Chiron and Kevin, where I suppose we are watching the transformation of Kevin from school friend to gay conspirator, but it is not done very well and frankly, you just get rather bored. Part three begins ten years later when Chiron is out of jail and is now called ""Black"" - a powerful drug dealer in Atlanta. Kevin is now a cook in a diner back in Florida and one day he calls Chiron for the first time since he was incarcerated. They have a stilted conversation, and as a result, ""Black"" decides to drive back to Florida and pay Kevin a visit.The third part is the worst. Moviegoers have already invested a fair amount of time in this movie that now seems to be running out of steam, but you hang in there and hope for the best. Once more there are long periods where not much happens ‚Äì Black and Kevin stare at each other, and Kevin cooks a meal for Black. The only really good scene is when Black visits his mother on route Kevin's diner. Mum begs forgiveness for all the wrongs she has committed, and for her failure to bring him up properly.But subsequent scenes at the diner, and at Kevin's home, are so slow to the point of sleep-inducing.In the end, we find out that although Kevin has been married and has a child, he is still gay. Black tells Kevin that he has never touched anyone since that day on the beach when he kissed Kevin.Moonlight is clearly a 21st-century American morality play. America is a country where poor black gays are treated so badly that they have no chance of a achieving a good life. They will end up in prison and become drug dealers. Those who do survive on the right side of the law are obliged to hide their sexuality, as is the case with Kevin.But I'm not too sure that this little three-part mini-drama tells us anything we didn't already know. We are forced to watch a lot of angst ‚Äì and I get that, but I don't feel that much of it was done particularly well. For most of the time, it isn't clear what is going on until it happens. If that's what the director wanted, then he succeeded, but for this reviewer, it just resulted in frustration.I know I shouldn't question the story line as I have no way of knowing if such a story is feasible, but it did strike me as rather 'pat' that Chiron had been a virgin all his life. Sure, he wouldn't have wanted his sexuality to be known, but surely a powerful drug lord would have found a way. I wonder how many gay men with raging hormones, from any ethnicity, spend their adulthood in sexual abstinence? Where there's a will there's usually a way.I think his sexual abstinence was a ploy to justify him driving across America to visit his schoolboy friend, and to drag the audience across the finishing line on a dramatic high.The acting throughout is pretty good. Mahershala Ali, and Naomie Harris richly deserve their Oscar nominations"
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2017,6/10,"A sheer mend up and patch up for last years Oscar Controversy, the movie Moonlight is marked by false and unjustifiable over rating. Considering over its parameters for judgment, one can definitely say that the movie is certainly not what it has become.Direction : Absolutely average ranking up only to a good movie making and absolutely nothing extraordinary at all.Acting : Acting part was indeed great and one can't find any loose end to it.Cinematography : Quite pleasant and appealingEditing : As much as the movie required to talk about is well presented and seems adequate.Movie : Well the movie is like pointless and doesn't address anything significant at all. Perhaps its very close representation of actually what goes on in that world.Yet the three parts shown in the life of a guy seems not so important to hand it over with the best picture award. VERDICT : Seems like this year, no other movie really appeared that address a large section of society and have any catchy Poster. With #OscarSoWhite and absence of any other Oscar Oriented movie, we got a strange winner again."
MOONLIGHT,3 February 2017,8/10,"This movie is a small jewel that everybody should watch. It is the story of a black boy growing up in a not so perfect environment and if his skin color wasn't be enough he is also discovering his homosexuality.The story is told in 3 parts, each part showing a different age of the main character. We see his childhood with school bullies. We see his adolescence with even more troubled bullies. We see his adulthood. Each part is admirably told in a fresh way that gets you hooked to the screen and wondering, wanting to keep watching how the story will unfold. The story is pretty simple but how it is viewed, with a direct, realistic point of view is what makes it perfect.The three actors that play the main character at three different stages of his life are superb. Each of them have their style but within a whole. Then there is Naomi Harris. He portrayal of his mother is superb. Simply fantastic and real credible, as she has used to another kind of characters, but playing this one really shows that she can play whatever she puts her mind on. Simply brilliant. And then there is Mahershala Ali, who sadly doesn't appear a lot in the film, but the tiny bit that he does, he just steals the just. Also fantastic.If you are looking for a realistic portrayal of a real situation, please watch this movie. There is nothing out of the ordinary in it, and although you might not like the topic, it is good to see something different and what is more, a work superbly done."
MOONLIGHT,3 October 2016,6/10,"Three-act movie tells the story of a young gay boy/teen/man. First two acts are gritty realistic depictions of sexual confusion, abuse, bullying and homophobic violence with surprising comfort and refuge coming from unlikely characters. Third act shifts into some kind of 'Now Voyager' gear with the main character's transformation into a super hot drug kingpin with a gay heart of gold. I admit I'm no expert on the lives of down low African American thugs, but the idea that this smokin hot brother spent ten years denying himself sex with men (in the 21st century!) until his true love came back into his life was a bit much. At least the unlikely cowboy lovers in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN actually had a months-long sexual relationship. This guy waits ten years for the guy he masturbated with once on a beach. The whole thing ends up more like a romance novel (without a kiss or a final sex scene) than one would expect from the excellent realistic first two acts."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2019,7/10,"This story is really moving. Many of the scenes are heavily emotional, some even heartbreaking, but you never stop feeling engaged with the story and especially the character. You get real insight into the life of this character, feel what he is going through and get to ponder how his life might possibly turn out.
A wonderful scene is when he visits Kevin in the restaurant, it's a tense scene that shows the complexities of communication and how these characters are trying to get information out of this conversation while giving little away, in order not to get hurt again.The pacing is sometimes problematic as the film seems to be dragging a bit in some places, which might admittedly be on purpose so the viewer can have time to absorb every ounce of emotion transpiring on-screen.Another issue is the oscar-bait feeling you get when watching it, although admittedly less so than in other A24 movies.7.5"
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2017,9/10,"When I first heard about Moonlight I wanted to see it. I grew up in Miami: not the Miami where the director and writer come from. I grew up in suburban North Miami and went to schools that were predominantly middle class and Jewish. I've never been to Liberty City. There were black and Latino kids in my schools, but they weren't as deprived as the families in Moonlight. Also, I came of age in late 1970s and early 1980s, before Miami Vice, when Miami was seen as a run down tourist town that nobody came to anymore because of crime. Moonlight blew me away. I related to it completely. I was an outsider kid in school and I knew what it felt like for Chiron. I recognized what Barry Jenkins says in the first extra on the DVD about Miami's beauty and cruelty. During the first scene, I said to my husband, ""I bet it was boiling hot when they shot that"". I don't miss the summers there, with the temperatures hitting over 95 every day. I don't miss the insects (flying palmetto bugs and roaches especially). Moonlight made me remember how horrible it was to go to school for years with kids who wanted to kick your ass without letup. I was called gay too (I'm not, by the way, it the kids' standard insult). I got hit a lot, and nobody checked to make sure I was okay afterwards. I'm glad Chiron had a school staff member who looked after him. Moonlight also made me remember how beautiful Miami was, even with the flying palmetto bugs and awful people (the people I see online chatting about growing up in Miami are pretty casual about the drugs they did, and the people I talk to who live in Florida think people who live in Dade County are really materialistic.) The beaches take my breath away. There's nowhere else in the world like them, with the warm ocean and white sand. Even back in the day when I went to South Beach and saw the crumbling hotels full of dripping one unit air conditioners and old people staring out at the water- God's waiting room, people my parents' age called it- the beaches were magnificent. Thanks Moonlight for helping me remember that though life in Dade country is tough and people can be horrendous there is still beauty there. Anyone who thinks that this movie is about nothing, consider this- that even in a place of bleakness where everyone seems carnal,callous and inarticulate there can be caring, tenderness, and beauty."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,8/10,"The story follows a young gay black man, Chiron, from childhood through to adulthood in three parts. What happens to our main character is sad, with a drug addicted mother that doesn't take proper care of him, and with him struggling to find love and a place in life.Throughout all of this our main character is nervous and reclusive, never quite opening up to anyone. So many times did I want to shout out at the screen: ""Speak up for yourself!"" But that is precisely the movie's ingenuity ... that it makes you suffer through his quietness. The acting is superb‚Äîall three actors that embody our protagonist for three parts of his life do a great job at capturing Chiron's struggle.The camera-work is quite subjective, with lots of play with depth of focus and blur, some deliberately shaky camera as well. This creates a moody and at times irritating atmosphere.While Moonlight definitely deserves to be called a masterpiece, I didn't feel as moved as I perhaps wanted or anticipated from the movie. This is perhaps because the main character‚Äîprecisely because he's so inwards-oriented‚Äîdoesn't show a lot of emotion. The suppression of your feelings and who you are is, of course, the crux of the movie. At the same time this aspect didn't help me to relate to Chiron as much as I wanted."
MOONLIGHT,9 June 2017,,"I was stunned to see this included in AmazonPrime freebie. I wonder why some shows get in so fast for free and others, more yukky movies, you have to pay for. I didn't think i'd like this and loved it. Brokeback Mountain and Moonlight i couldn't help compare but it's done to no avail. Both wonderful movies and both are about 'queers'. Christopher Isherwood said he'd rather be thought of as 'queer' than 'gay'. I have a 'gay' friend i argue the issue with. If i were 'homosexual' i'd rather be thought of as 'queer' but not 'called queer'. 'Gays' are not 'gay'. Will there ever be a daring show with a strong really white man and a dark, charcoal black woman? When i was little in the 50's, a white guy with a black woman was the worst of the worst. Pearl Bailey was married to Louis Bellson. Black black great woman singer married to white white world famous drummer. Why not do their life story? I'm tangenting here. This show was extraordinary in it's innuendos, the powerful acting and the across the board truths and moral dilmenas society presents. I think the Bank of America is more morally bankrupt than Chiron or average 'pusher'. The philosophy 'if i don't someone else will' (sell them what they want) has validity. Life is complex and hard and lived in the greys not the black and whites. Homosexuality is real and not dirty. This will sound stupid but i'm glad they didn't get graphic like in Brokeback Mountain and other movies. Not because i don't have to have it shoved in my face like 'see this is what it looks like' but because the physical/sexual goings-on are so much better in imagination and aren't important at all. The love Chiron has bottled inside of him and rank honesty he struggles with each day is made so clear in this film with powerful acting. The single tears, the facial expressions, the repressions, the tension, the mystery play strongly across the screen and in me. The daily life of the black and homosexual culture is shown honestly and , i think , rather reservedly. This flick wasn't meant to 'shock' but to show 'how it is'. There's a moral conundrum and there's no answer or both answers are correct depending on 'where you are coming from'. The 2 main characters come to the conclusion that love and acceptance reigns. There is 'resolution'. I could have watched the acting for another hour. Everyone everywhere is 'queer' in some way. I can still prefer 'queer' so 'gay'. I'm queer in 100 ways. I think this show let's ya know that those who 'knock' people who are out of the ordinary, that are extraordinary or deviate from the societal norm in some way , are 'small' people, pathetic people who have to put down others to build themselves up resulting in being disgusting themselves. Sad to say many, maybe most, are that way. And, we all are that way for moments of our lives. I didn't feel this flick talked down to me and it appeared 'real to me'."
MOONLIGHT,29 June 2020,7/10,"As OP have already said, parts one and two work well. As a white person, I really felt that the problems of black people in inner city setting was quite marked, but nobody was really blamed, which was a welcome point. Chiron's painful, lonely existence made my stomach ache for him. The third part is problematic as his adult self is not credible. He changes from being a spindly youth to a large powerful handsome man. No matter how much iron you pump, your skeleton and face don't double in size! That said, it was a budget movie and with more resources let's hope for more and better from this team."
MOONLIGHT,10 September 2020,8/10,"""Moonlight"" is a well made movie. It tackles social issues in a very on the nose way, and it makes good use of imagery to get the audience to care about the main character. It's completely character driven and it touches the emotional topic of the acceptance of homosexuality, particularly within the black community.The main complaint that I have with the move is the way that it's split into three main parts, and we are given no real context or explanation for the character changes that occur between those parts. The segments are very good in their own right, but it almost feels like the segment about young Chiron (Alex Hibbert) is kind of pointless. Like it introduces us to Chiron's world and all, and I really like Mahershala Ali's character, Juan, but honestly we're told most of what we need to know about Chiron, his mother (Naomie Harris), and his economic situation once we move on to teenage Chiron (Ashton Sanders). The second act during his teenage years is definitely the best part of the entire movie, as it deals with Chiron and his run-ins with a bully (Patrick Decile). He also finds love in a close friend, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome). I feel like the movie would have worked better if it were set entirely during this time period. The final act deals with an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) meeting Kevin (Andr√© Holland) after many years. It's okay, but the scene that they're in the diner together is just so slow and boring. It's like fifteen minutes of the movie but nothing really happens.It's basically a series of three separate movies about Chiron's difficult life. And it's really emotionally engaging, which is why I feel like everybody had gotten swept up by this one. It's certainly not a bad movie at all. The cinematography and the acting are both top-notch. But if you step back for a moment, if you ignore the subject matter of the movie just for a moment, it's kind of a disjointed mess. I applaud the Academy for making bold decisions, but this was chosen the same year that we had ""Arrival"" and ""Hacksaw Ridge"", which I personally felt were much more memorable. I think people were swept up more in the subject matter that it touches upon, not the quality and pacing of the movie itself. And if you compare ""Moonlight"" with something like ""Schindler's List"", another movie with very emotional subject matter, it kind of falls flat.It's not a bad movie, and maybe I'm just being a bit cynical and over critical. I get that race and sexuality are touchy subjects in this day and age, but the movie itself is just kind of dry and forgettable to me."
MOONLIGHT,16 July 2019,3/10,"This movie didn't touch me or evoke any emotions of any kind. It's just a story without much climaxes and without any controversial component. Just about a boy growing up in a difficult part of the world. I liked the cinematography, the acting was very decent. I don't like movies with many sound effects or animation so I thought I'd like this one, alas."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,8/10,"Moonlight is written & directed by Barry Jenkins and stars Mahershala Ali, Alex R. Hibbert, Naomie Harris, Janelle Mon√°e, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes and Andr√© Holland.A timeless story of human self-discovery and connection, Moonlight chronicles the life of a young black man from childhood to adulthood as he struggles to find his place in the world while growing up in a rough neighbourhood of Miami.Short and sweet; Barry Jenkins' Moonlight has sunk low under the radar for many, but the sheer quality in the writing and acting will be treasured inside the hearts and minds of those who were lucky enough to experience this touching story. Of all the incredible people that worked on this film, I knew only two; Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris. Now, I've been introduced to a whole new set of fine actors, writers, filmmakers, who are all responsible for creating one of the most pleasant cinema outings in recent years. The most valued trait in Moonlight is how remarkably real it feels. The screenplay never once exaggerates on its simple storytelling, nor does it force its views on the audience. You make your own decisions, feel how you want to feel, just as the lead character does on-screen.Ali and Harris are remarkable in their respective roles and absolutely vital to the choices that Chiron (played by three great actors; Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders & Trevante Rhodes, in three distinct time periods) will make, leading him down his path into young adult life. Andr√© Holland provides wonderful support in the final act beside Rhodes, culminating with a well-rounded story of self-discovery.Original music by Nicholas Britell is clean, subtle and ambient. Only lending to the picture when necessary, never interrupting the performances on-screen or feeling forced. It's a perfect fit, an exquisite pairing of image and score.Winning the Academy Award for Best Picture is a phenomenal feat and the team behind Moonlight should feel very proud. I know I am.Verdict; There's so much to say about Moonlight, but only Moonlight will tell its story the right way. See this film.Moonlight, 8/10."
MOONLIGHT,26 November 2020,6/10,"I might be missing something here but is this supposed to target black audience only? Yes, the acting is good but the story is so flat, I have a hard time understanding what it is trying to tell me. Maybe this can evoke something special from within a black viewer, I don't know..."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,8/10,"Who are you?Do you know who you really are?Who will you become?Are you different form others? Do you feel you are lost?Should you decide for yourself who you're gonna be?Should you let others make that decision for you?Is life always easy?Is it bad to be different or strange or black?Is it easy to discover your identity?Who are you? The answer is in the moonlight.Beautiful shots,magical music,great acting(especially from Naomie Harris),a thought-provoking story,wonderful scenes,amazing directing but must of all....in every scene of the movie I could hear a voice saying:""Accept difference"" and ""Black is beautiful"". Moonlight is a drama that makes us think about who we are and who we want to become!Its a film that makes us wonder about what is going to come.A sign for the future.A film that tells us to come together and face the huge problems of our collapsing society.If we don't try to make things better,then what will happen? The answer is in the moonlight. The story also revolves around the relationship of a son,who isn't respected from anyone and of his mother,who is addicted in drugs and that's why she can't help him to face his problems and his difficulties. Although it has some flaws,like some really slow or unimportant scenes,it is steel a must-see. Moonlight is probably the most important movie of 2016 and 2017 so far! Who are you?"
MOONLIGHT,11 March 2017,7/10,"I enjoy making these kinds of reviews; I don't have to write down any 'special meanings' to this film, cause it really doesn't feel like it. It has a usable plot, not an interesting one, not an effective one, and so it baffles me that this movie got an Oscar honestly. But then again, I must be some racist, homophobic twit for not praising this movie on par with Star Wars, am I right?What did I like about the film. Well, I enjoyed the characters and their interaction with each other. I have to say, as a well spoken British white kid, films like Straight Outta Compton and Training Day have honed my skills in enjoying 'Hood' dialogue. I also have to praise the directors choice of actors playing Chiron from child to adult. Chiron feels like the same person no matter whose playing him throughout the film. And Chiron's kind of 'forbidden romance' with the character Kevin is admirable. I liked seeing how Chiron had to change to survive in his world instead of having the chance to just be himself. All of that I liked. Other actors like Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are also great in there roles, Ali mostly whose proved to be a very talented actor since I first saw his in Benjamin Button almost a decade ago. I hope the actors who played Chiron (the teen actor and the adult anyway) show up in more feature films in the future.But for all it's achievements, I still wouldn't have picked it as an Oscar winner. And no, I wouldn't have chosen La La Land either; I don't think either of them were great enough to warrant an Oscar, much less a nomination for one. For the 'progressives' out there the words gay black guy just SCREAMS Oscar bait. While yes, it's good that this kind of film broke through and won something great, I can't put this movies success on anything else but the virtue signalling left, not out of it's own merit. Probably why I don't watch the Oscar's anymore.I feel like the segment of Chiron as a little kid could have been shorter and his life as an adult could have been longer. I wanted to see more of his adult life to be honest. I wanted a scene of him finally trying to break out of the person he had to become to survive, explore his sexuality more with other men, and come to a realization that a life with Kevin was the only thing he'd ever felt any meaning with. But I'm overthinking what could have been. The ending is fine, and I appreciated that the film ended the way it ended. This ending wasn't what I expected at all."
MOONLIGHT,15 October 2016,8/10,"I liked this film.. liked it very much. That having been said, as a white guy, I sometimes had trouble following it. The writer was also the director and, no matter what the race, writer/directors often see something coming to the screen with a clarity it doesn't always have. It's almost inevitable. Changing actors in the same role in order to age them up is usually a necessity, and it can be jarring, even confusing. That was the case here. I can't say more without giving away a plot point, but the script needed to ease the transition. Characters, even the good guys, often had to admit bad behavior. This was deliberately underplayed and done well. Again, however, the set-ups could have been more elucidating. I realize that the director was not trying to make this an easy film to watch. In that respect, he succeeded. But he needed to make it user-friendly enough for those who may be know-nothings when it comes to the urban ghetto."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,7/10,"First hour and a half was great. Very emotional. But this ""no talking"" stuff out of Chiron got old real fast after 90 minutes. There's just so much you can pick up from a no-talking main character who never does anything, you know? Mahershala Ali was good--but he was on screen for what? 15 minutes? Best supporting actor nominee? Maybe if he'd been in the movie instead of the credits, I could see it. And, in fact, his character was the best one in the entire film--the most engaging. And if you blinked your eyes, you missed him. As I said, a good film, but not great. It won't hold up. Never should have won the Oscar. But it was better than La La Land, that's for sure."
MOONLIGHT,15 July 2019,9/10,"This was one of the most beautifully photographed, superbly set, and genuinely authentic films I've ever seen. Jenkins established a time and place perfectly, and told such an achingly honest and unsparing story of identity and self-awakening, it's almost like poetry. The use of a steadicam instead of a handheld gave it an uncommon grace and dignity which added to its authenticity. This is a movie I won't soon forget."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2018,1/10,I like independent and esoteric films. Moonlight is unoriginal and boring; not much of a script.
MOONLIGHT,27 July 2019,6/10,"Either it's overrated as an Oscar winning film or I didn't get it. Not so strong plot. Silence of the blackman, a gay... what does it tried to mean? Okay that he was in a shock specially with his mother's behaviour. I may not understand the main point. Of course I'll watch it again to understand it!"
MOONLIGHT,16 April 2017,2/10,"What was all the fuss about? Best movie. You've got to be kidding. La La Land and many others nominated were MUCH better. Did it win because of the 'black' element and being 'politically"" correct? Come on. There wasn't one white person in the film until the very end and they were just sitting in a restaurant. Boring, boring, especially the last act. Who OK'd this movie to be made???? A couple of the performances were the only saving grace. Otherwise, FORGET THIS ONE. Simply unwatchable. I'm glad it didn't do any business as it didn't even deserve the small grosses it received, much less a BEST picture. OMG."
MOONLIGHT,7 February 2017,7/10,"Act 1 I think the first act, though slow, was OK except that I only understood about 20% of what was said. There was so much mumbling. However, I have found this to be the way it really is. Lots of mumbling and wrong words used. Thank goodness the acting made it more obvious what was going on. Well, mostly.It was rather ironic that the mother was worried when Chiron did not come home, although not terribly worried, but then did drugs and ignored him regularly (it seems).Act 2 Now he just became a teenager. Still having some trouble understanding what is going on. But the demeanor of the teenage Chiron is matching what we saw in Act 1. Still quiet and head down attitude.Maybe I will continue. Oooooh, raw, rear entry sex outside. Seems right. I saw a black man pee in the parking lot of a Walmart while there was a restroom right inside and after he peed, he went inside. So the scene seems to fit with that.Act 2, the mother is still verbally expressing caring for Chiron but then treating him badly. She wants to claim blood ties, implying emotional ties, but just wants to use her son for drug money. What a movie... sad...So much abuse... Family and ""friends"" abuse him and he is so beat down that he just takes it. I know that feeling, personally, from elementary school. It is not a good situation. Abusive father, mother afraid of him for good reason and few friends. I can identify with him and say it is well done. My situation was not this bad, however, but I was just about as broke.I am beginning to not like this movie. It is too close to home.Well, now there is a challenge to hit someone and, of course, Chiron is selected by the guy he just had a quicky with the night before. Again, some truth here. Saw a ""reality"" cop show where two teens had a ""slap boxing"" match in a car and got blood everywhere. Dumb! But true. They got some serious questioning about it from the cops who were looking for a killer nearby. This is too real! So he takes revenge and HE gets arrested. Of course. The second one to act gets caught, not the first. Talking in class, fighting back, etc. Again, truth here.I made it to an hour. Still in there. I hate to stop watching a movie unless it is really horrible. Maybe this goes up to 5 now. The ending, per some reviews, may push it back to 4.Act 3 Made it to Act 3. Now he is all grown up. And finally, the first rap in the movie. But it is not too bad. He thought badly of drug sellers when young, and now he is one.Some have found the acts of differing ""speed"". So far, they are dead slow character studies. Vaguely interesting, not riveting. But I have seen worse -- FAR worse than this. I admit, I would not have ever known about it or watched it if not on the Oscar nomination but it is a story that is worth watching. Feels real all the way through. All three of the actors playing Chiron had it spot on. Not a wrong movement or word. Some nuance but not enough to get up to boring.Love the ""elevator music"" in the restaurant. Good use of music in this movie. Appropriate and not oppressive. Good re-connection with Kevin. Well directed, I think. Liking this as a whole.If you gave up too soon, I think you missed something good. Not sure it's Oscar good. For that level, see ""Hidden Figures"". I think this movie can't be judged on Act 1, 2, 3 but must be viewed and judged as a whole. The flow is perfect through and connecting the acts. They show a card between them but maybe that should be dropped for even a better flow. This movie grows on you. Give it a chance.I won't spoil the ending. I would not classify this as a gay movie. One character is slightly gay but mostly celibate. He only had one gay encounter. He only had one encounter of any kind. How will it turn out? Better watch it. There is certainly a French feel to this one. Plodding story but interesting if you take the time to watch it all the way through. Just went up to 7."
MOONLIGHT,21 November 2020,2/10,"I watched this movie and I think this is the first movie I watched in a long time that made me feel genuinely bored.I have heard such great things about this film. Hell, it won Best Picture at the Oscars. But what I proceeded to see was a boring, lifeless, bloated, drag that I don't even think has enough dignity to be called a movie in my eyes.The movie starts off okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a slow and uneventful trudge of shots. The characters, especially in the third segment of the film, where absolutely two-dimensional and lacking - I didn't really care about any of their problems and there wasn't anything that sold the movie to me. It was just a series of events which had something vaguely to do with something Deep and Important but didn't get any further than face level.I couldn't really understand what the film was about. I feel like it was trying to incorporate too much into one movie - the discovery of one's sexuality, abuse, poverty, racism, addiction, abandonment, I could go on. Because of this it all felt confusing and also repetitive. I mean, those are all great themes to write a movie about, but please, don't try to chuck everything into one movie to try and make it as profound as possible. That has almost never worked out, and instead your attention is split so much that you end up caring very little about each individual theme and forgetting others altogether.The supposed 'climax' at the diner fell completely flat, to the point I didn't even realise it was suppose to be the climax until I went on here and read the reviews. I don't think there was a single part of this movie which I found genuinely good. What's a shame is that there are so many usually great actors in this movie, but their skills were pulled down by bad writing. I am at a loss to see why this won Best Picture.I'm sorry, but this film really didn't do anything for me.-Sasha."
MOONLIGHT,16 August 2020,9/10,"*Don't read until you've seen the film. It's best to know as little as possible.*This is amazing filmmaking. The film is striking and beautiful to look at. The use of music sweeps you up into the conflicting, swirling emotions Chiron is always at the mercy of. The writing and acting are excellent, both of them demonstrating an incredible, admirable restraint, where the plain truth of a deeply held feeling or truth can only break through in fleeting, cathartic moments. You can almost physically FEEL the unspoken words behind Chiron's eyes, and Juan's, and the adult version of Kevin. Chiron's character arc is palpably believable and captivating. By the end of the film, you really know and care about him.Several scenes stick with me:
-An enrapturing, ecstatic sequence where Juan teaches a young Chiron (""Little"") to swim, and then sits and talks with him on the shore about how ""you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be."" Later, Teresa and Juan reassure him that he's normal, acceptable, and doesn't have to understand his sexuality yet. You share in Chiron's tentatively blooming euphoria as he realizes they truly care about him without question or conditions, that maybe he can trust them. That maybe he is worth being loved. But then you're punched in the gut as Chiron deduces Juan is the dealer supplying and enabling his drug-addicted mother. Mahershala Ali breaks your heart with an aching pathos, hanging his head in deep shame, nothing to say in defense of himself. He knows as well as anyone that he could have been so much more. His silence says everything he can't.-A teenaged Chiron and Kevin's lingering goodbye, Kevin, as always, playing it cool, and Chiron, as always, feeling his bewildering tangle of feelings more profoundly than he is able or willing to express, more deeply than he or anyone in his life can deal with.-""Black"" visiting his mother at a halfway house. In the space of a short conversation, they go from circling a lifetime of unsettled issues, to confronting and lashing out at each other, to tenderly and tearfully breaking down and holding each other for what's probably the first time in years. Naomie Harris and Trevante Rhodes are absolutely convincing as mutual casualties of their broken relationship and Paula's struggles. That you empathize with BOTH of them, and perhaps even see a glimmer of hope for them going forward, is quite the feat of acting, writing, and directing.-After a decade or more, Black finally bares his heart and says exactly what's on his mind to an evasive, deflecting Kevin: ""You're the only man who ever touched me... The only one."" It's a powerful, understated moment, where a simple phrase and a pair of restrained, nuanced performances say so much more than a monologue ever could have.This is an extraordinarily confident, compassionate, poetic film of complex emotions from a previously little-known director. I'm excited to see this film being so enthusiastically celebrated, and I'm very much looking forward to what Barry Jenkins does next."
MOONLIGHT,8 April 2017,10/10,"I cannot praise this film highly enough. Firstly, a drama about a gay character which doesn't remotely veer into cheap, crass stereotyping or raucous, misplaced humour. Rather one which rings entirely true to me in a lot of ways, handled with care, subtlety and expertise.The best acting/casting I've seen in decades.It's sad to think, also, that there is such a lack of quality drama involving non-white characters. This will hopefully encourage others to buck the trend."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2020,9/10,"I can't talk about Moonlight enough, the cinematography was exquisite and the directing was epic, the editing just brilliant. I could almost feel the sunlight through the screen and the humidity in the air. The camera takes you with the people and it captures emotion and feelings like you are there, somehow managing to peak into their lives.Moonlight is everything a movie should be and more; an example of how things can and should be portrayed and it all comes with brilliant performances and incredible directing. This is why representation matters and why we need more of it. Take everyone with you, recommend it to as many people as you can, never stop talking about it.Mitchell Bulfin"
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,3/10,"I don't remember the last time there was a film I wanted to like, and enjoy, as much as I did Moonlight. But in the third act it went out of its way to make sure I knew that it did not want me to like it. Or enjoy it. Maybe that was the point it was trying to make? Ask me what am I doing in the theater and why don't I mind my own business?Whether art imitates life or not, it certainly mirrors it and Moonlight, like other movies today, mirrors for us a society where the eternal question of whether to be or not is answered by the absence of any motivation to even consider it.Every story is only as good as the point it makes in the end. The first two acts could have exploded into any one of a multitude of statements in the third. But the third act leaves you feeling like the painting ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" where the people supposed to be sitting at the diner (Dean, Bogart, Monroe and Elvis) don't even bother to show up.Every story told must at least attempt to answer the simple question ""so what?"" Moonlight does not. I really wanted to like it. Its only redeeming feature that makes it worth watching is Mahershala Ali's character and performance in the first act, and the first act itself. The second act is great, but its promise is never fulfilled. What the heck: I still want to like this movie, so I'll pretend the movie ended in the end of the first act, in the last close-up of Mahershala.PS. I would be prepared to consider that my reaction and some of what I observed above was the point Moonlight was trying to make. But then I'd have to ask whether art, entertainment even, is supposed to elevate our thoughts or drag them down to the point where, even in a theater, they remain chained to the sidewalk of the ""hood""."
MOONLIGHT,21 March 2017,2/10,"This film will, not might, but will go down in history as the most over rated winner for BEST PICTURE of all time. No one will ever convince me that the politics of this was not the reason for it's praise. This is the first film that deals with black ghetto life, void of any of the usual issues found in such Scenarios.The usual sex, blood and violence has been replaced here by ghetto homophobia and homosexuality. Unfortunately the film will not be seen by those most in need. This reminds me of the joke,""If a tree crashes in an empty forest , does it make a sound""? This film needed to have some big Black ""STARS"" to draw the audience intended. It won best picture due to the racism in Hollywood. Racism by the fact that it confronts a problem with black culture that has been ignored politically for fear of being racist. Which is racist by definition."
MOONLIGHT,16 November 2016,8/10,"MOONLIGHT, directed by Barry Jenkins is an exquisitely written and delicately acted tale of how a young African-American boy navigates through the covertness of childhood isolation, into the reticence of adulthood. Three actors portray Chiron at different stages of existence - all maintain the silent presence of a person with a deep secret viewing a world of abuse and neglect with the curiosity of innocence. The young Chiron/aka ""Little"" (wonderfully acted by Alex R. Hibbert) realizes at an early age, that he should keep the pain and turbulence that is cloaked behind his dark-intelligent eyes hidden - it is best to stay silent and remain an enigma to others. Desire is tucked away from the periscope of one's peers, under a translucent sheet of manhood, thereby avoiding some of the emotional lacerations that kids inflict on one another, particularly if you are ""different"" and happen to be gay, and poor, living in Miami with a drug addicted single mother.Life changes when ""Little"", chased by a group of stone-throwing boys, finds refuge in an empty shack , breathless, curling up on the floor, bony arms flung around his thin body for protection. Juan (the wonderful performer Mahershala Ali), who happens to be the local drug dealer, enters the room and sees this young boy silhouetted against the wall, a small warrior standing erect refusing to utter a word, and an unspoken bond is forged - a connection based on Juan's memories of his own childhood. ""Little"", unwilling to talk, but willing to accompany this tall, powerfully built potential ""father figure"" to Juan's house for a home-cooked meal by Teresa ( Janelle Monae), the woman he lives with. Teresa instinctually recognizes a ""wounded"" child, and provides ""Little"" with a patina of kindness and warmth momentarily allaying the scars incurred by years of bullying and abuse.MOONLIGHT gives us some lovely moments between Juan and his pre-teen prot√©g√© - particularly one involved with learning to swim and the oft-used metaphor of the power of water to cleanse; but this scene is so beautifully filmed that it erases any notion of banality.In the next chapter, we meet the adolescent Chiron (Ashton Sanders) and witness the anguish of being a loner. Bullies take advantage of those they sense can be tormented and the High School years can be agonizing to a sensitive, fragile young man moving into adulthood. Innocence is slowly eroded; the protective veneer of armor and detachment are easily pierced, yet a sense of wonder remains. Chiron experiences moments of joy particularly in the company of a childhood friend, Kevin (Jaden Piner,) who is practiced in the art of subterfuge and easily glides through his fellow teenagers' posturing mentality - appearing to be part of a group, but in reality attracted to Chiron's desolate stillness. Their relationship is restrained, but undercurrents of sexual yearning - the physicality of touch - a tender finger grazing a hand - can transform years of misery and sorrow into the confusion of love.The last chapter occurs 10 years later when a powerfully built Chiron (alluringly portrayed by Trevante Rhodes,) returns home to Miami - his wordlessness remains, but the years have altered his appearance, and for a moment we believe we are seeing Juan again - the man who helped shepherd ""Little"" through the turmoil of childhood. Chiron having maneuvered through sphere's of hate and humiliation, is eventually able to reconcile with those who have previously cracked his world; a mother who could not see beyond her own aching needs, and his former confidant Kevin ( Andre Holland, depicting the sensuous, and elegant, adult Kevin.) A guileless candor belies Chiron's rugged presence; the passage of time is complex, paving over the self-inflicted wounds of longing, but also re-igniting the desire to embrace the future."
MOONLIGHT,21 July 2017,10/10,"I truly adored this movie. Moonlight takes it's viewers on a unique journey and it is something that I have not experienced previously. It takes us through 3 stages of the life of one individual; who, despite what we are told from the common spectator's point of view, is more than just a 'gay person of color'. He's an individual, an outsider looking in, quiet, reserved, but emotionally in touch with the world. He has a capacity for love and forgiveness that is rare and we're taken on a hypnagogic journey through his eyes. Upon viewing ""Chiron's"" stage of life, I was taken into a portal and brought back to my early teen years, where life became so confusing, with no explanation as to how. This is something that everyone can relate to at least a little bit, and the way it's portrayed on film is intimately accurate. Juan, despite not being in the film more than we would wish, was deliberate in a sense, because he was such an influential part of our protagonist's life. Someone can may show up in your life for a mere 2 hours, but their influence can last a lifetime. Naomi Harris was the stand-out performance as a mother who is selfish, but still a multi- dimensional character. The interaction in Act III might bring you to tears as many can relate. The cinematography, music, and use of sound bring us to art-house territory without being untenable, and keeps us grounded in reality while we get immersed in a world from an artistic angle. I see many reviews saying that 'nothing happened', 'boring' etc. but it is not a movie for people to take things from; rather we are brought into the world and seeing it from their point-of-view and we disconnect ourselves. Unfortunately, people go to the movies with demands on the mind, but holding expectations will always leave you feeling disappointed. Approach this movie with an open mind & heart and turn off the smart phone."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,6/10,"This movie is not very good. It's an average movie. I can't understand why it won the best picture Oscar. I think the Academy is going too political. I can't understand their decisions and all the gafs and mistakes they make. I used to plant myself in front of the TV during the presentation, late at night, but nowadays i don't even watch the brief version of it next day. It's a total disappointment...like this movie. I've seen much better dramas about the same issues. The movie doesn't envolve enough...sometimes it's even boring. And the final scene is endless..for what? for nothing! The ending...you already know it. No! not good enough! Not even one of the best 10 dramas this year."
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2016,9/10,"I decided to check this movie out since I was heard a lot of positive things about it. Needless to say, I thought it was fantastic. I won't spoil anything, though I do mention one specific moment.You need to go into the movie expecting a very character driven story. Its a pretty quiet movie, and it heavily relies on the performances to be effective. The performances are definitely the best part of the movie. This is the best acting I've seen in a long time. Every single actor, even the child actors, none of them feel like they're acting. All you see on screen are real characters, real people. You feel like you're there with them. Definitely Oscar- worthy material. Even when they're not speaking, they convey so much emotion with their facial expressions. The film is split into 3 parts with a different actor portraying the main character at different ages. All 3 of these actors age seamlessly into one another, conveying the same mannerisms and speaking patterns throughout. I haven't seen multiple actors play the same character at different ages this well since We Need To Talk About Kevin.Moonlight kinda reminded me of It Follows since both movies are intentionally set in an indistinct decade and time of year, almost an alternate universe, made even more surreal since they never outright say where they are (even though if you look up information on both films you'll find where they were shot and intended to be set). This gives the film a more universal appeal since it feels like it could take place anywhere.Another aspect of the film I really liked was visual storytelling. In some scenes there are many small details that you can use to figure out a location or person's backstory without having anything verbally explained.My only big problems with the movie are on the artistic and technical levels. The production value is okay, but the cinematography isn't the greatest and sometimes they make some weird editing choices. I also personally thought the third act felt a little uneventful. At first I thought it ended a little too early, like there would be about 10 more minutes, but after thinking about it, that was probably the appropriate place to end.My only real objective nitpick is there's a scene where someone is hit with a chair and in typical Hollywood fashion the chair shatters into a bunch of tiny pieces. A real chair would never break that easily, and it momentarily took me aback since the rest of the movie is very grounded in reality. Overall this was a pretty stellar film and I'd highly recommend you support the filmmakers by seeing it in theaters. The movie is about a lot of things, especially finding one's identity and place in society, and masculinity and what it means to be a man. Because of this, everybody who sees this movie is sure to walk away with something to think about.Right now, Moonlight is the second best movie I saw in theaters so far in 2016. I like Hacksaw Ridge a little bit more, but keep in mind it's a completely different type of movie and there are different things it does exceptionally well to achieve its intended result.I take minor issue with some creative decisions, but everything else was incredible. 9/10."
MOONLIGHT,27 November 2016,10/10,"""Moonlight"" is a very moving and well-crafted film. It concerns the many challenges faced by an African American youth growing up with the burden of a drug-addicted, abusive mother and relentlessly vicious schoolmates. Chiron finds a few rays of light as he fends off attacks from all sides and negotiates his own complex sexuality. Those rays include a well-meaning but highly culpable adult drug dealer, the drug dealer's girlfriend and, separately, another teenager who eagerly kisses and then reluctantly assaults Chiron within the same 24-hour period.The structure of the film is highly reminiscent of Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy, except here the story is contained in one movie rather than three distinct films. The acting perfectly expresses the ongoing devastation and chaos in Chiron's life, aided by a script that serves up a minimum of mawkishness or sentimentality. The blunt realism of this film, filled with violence more psychological than physical for the most part, really pierces the heart -- I defy anyone to see it and feel unmoved by what it shows.The camera work is phenomenal, and perfectly complements the frightening milieu and seriously damaged characters with its restlessness and aggression. The editing, too, is highly skilled -- not a moment in this film feels wasted.If only movies like ""Moonlight"" were the norm. It plies the narrow strait between forgettable blockbuster entertainments on the one hand and pointless independent movies replete with clich√©s on the other. Please see and support ""Moonlight"" so we can all look forward to further efforts by its abundantly talented creators and cast."
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,4/10,"A Black Gay Man Growing Through His Life Of Harassment And Hostility Can Be Captured In A Much More Spectacular And Special Way.Director Barry Jenkins Had Done Good Executing The Role Of Leaders And Mentors In Everyone's Life.But Moonlight Falls Apart As It Fails To Capture The Vivid Imagination Of Gayness.I Read Another Review In Which A Gay Couple Watched This And They Felt Absolutely Nothing More Than What They Are Feeling Right Now. So, The Perspective From The Gay Community Might Be Pretty Clear Now.The Film As Per My View And Many Others Here Is That The Oscars Were Pretty Affected By The Controversy Over The Black In The Previous Year.Moreover The Film Is Essentially About Nothing.You Could've Made A Short Film Jenkins."
MOONLIGHT,28 June 2017,8/10,"Moonlight is one of the most beautifully told stories of this decade. The camera work used in this film is like never before it has some of the best camera work since Children of Men. The film has a brilliant and beautiful way of using It's camera as a character. The cast is incredible every single one of them giving layered and beautiful performances there is not one bad or decent performance they're all fantastic. A movie that represents problems with people and there life dealing with these problems. The story is compelling and makes the audience fight for the main characters. Relatable moments in our own lives is what drives the eagerness from the audience. Sexuality and differences are a huge deal and the way Barry Jenkins wrote it in regards to a young kid struggling all the way up to adult hood is breathtaking as this movie is very realistic.Moonlight's excellent structure in storytelling, its powerful performances and thematic vision really emphasizes the film's sense of self-discovery. A unique presentation, filled with a superb use of music, colors, cinematography.This film flairs with originality and a unique style of telling it's story. There are some extremely depressing parts in this film involving the second act which nearly made me tear up and there are some sad parts in the 1st and third act as well. I absolutely love the open wold atmosphere Moonlight creates which many films try to do but don't succeed where as Moonlight succeeds at sucking you into It's dark world. Some of the long tracking shots most notably the opening scene are filled with realism and beauty and it sucks you into the characters and the world. ---Yidioo"
MOONLIGHT,25 May 2019,4/10,"This could have been a good movie, it's not. Possibly if it was cut down to 45 minutes (with some skill) it would be ok. The story is solid, the actors are good enough. This just drags thru seens of no talking, and walking and sitting ... Too bad I liked the idea"
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,1/10,"First: If I knew it was a LGBT movie, I wouldn't even think to watch it. But even for a LGBT movie, it doesn't add anything. Bellow the average movie. Extremely slow. I don't agree with some best picture nominations but this one was a huge mistake.And an Oscar for M. Ali for just 30 minutes in the air? Give me a break!!! He had much better performance on ""The Free State of Jones"".Waste of my time and my money rent."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2021,8/10,Seeing this in theaters was an entrancing experience. the cinematography is so beautiful you will genuinely get lost in it. the acting is also amazing though (janelle monae is so underrated). not for people who hate slow movies
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2017,10/10,"There's a tender beauty in MOONLIGHT that, despite an oftentimes glacial pace, surprises as one of the more artistic endeavors of 2016. Oftentimes a movie will follow a character through life, hitting the high and low points, and come out on the other end with little more to say than ""this person existed."" Here, the ultimate message touched me to the core. Regardless of where we were born and raised, ""Moonlight"" somehow captured humanity in a perfect way.We follow the story of Chiron, a meek boy who is raised in the rougher parts of Miami. His mother a drug addict and his classmates a constant source of bullying. The story is broken down into three concise chapters that tell specific stories pertaining to his identity. Chapter 1 is titled ""little,"" where young Chiron is discovered in an abandoned building by a local drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali, a great performance). For the first time in his life, Chiron has a father-figure who he can look up to and seek guidance amidst the lack of support from his mother. Chapter 2 is ""chiron,"" where we find a lanky Chiron navigating a solitary life of high school. One night, he has an intimate encounter with his friend Kevin, an act that boils to a breaking point the next day in class. Chapter 3 (""black"") concludes the tale with a hardened Chiron, muscular and menacing as a front, works as a drug dealer and reuniting with Kevin after years apart.The movie is wonderfully-written and these characters become people we can identify with if only because they have dealt with pain and loss in their lives. There is truth in their words. Chiron, a young boy who keeps his head down and speaks little, finds a voice through Juan and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e). Contrasted to his life at home with his mom (Naomie Harris in a surefire Oscar nomination), Chiron begins to see that life is not only a place of torment. There are people out there who can make life worth living.The craft on this film is exceptional. The camera is in a constant state of motion and tightly-focuses on our characters with so much out of focus that their worlds become a state of confusion and disorientation. The first shot of the film is a simple scene, where Juan meets with a dealer and finds out how things are going. He soon leaves. A simple shot would have sufficed, framing both characters in medium. The camera instead whirls around these two men, floating through the street and immersing us in a the scene that is unexpected and memorable. It's the little things that count. The music, a combination of classical and choral, contrasts the images we see on screen and somehow heightens the emotions.The story, amidst characters and interactions, ultimately boils down to the relationship between Chiron and Kevin. In part one he is little more than a childhood friend (and in fact I had to check to make sure it was the same character in all three instances), and by the end we see him as an adult with just as many bottled emotions as Chiron. Though the two boys start off relatively similar, the finale shows the way that paths of life can diverge and flow. One of the final scenes is a simple scene where Chiron seeks Kevin out at his diner, where Kevin has promised to cook dinner. The exchanging of glances and the way the camera idly drifts in and out of the conversation is simply beautiful. Chiron has worked to build up his body and physique to appear intimidating, maybe threatening, but when he speaks with Kevin we catch glimpses of the shy little boy from the top of the story. For having 3 separate actors, the consistency of Chiron's personality is a crowning achievement in a film so full of great aspects.It's hard to put into words a movie that is so good that nothing can accurately describe. The perfect words have already been written in the script, and talking about the movie simply does nothing to improve on the fact. All I can say, wholeheartedly, is that you must make time to see ""Moonlight"" sooner rather than later. It's that good."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,8/10,"This is quite a surprising movie on many levels. Coming to it cold, I knew very little about what it was about, deliberately, as so many reviewers give too much away these days. Boys and the Hood this ain't. Yet the setting is the same. That's what jars initially, because this isn't about the G's and the straps and hoes and the pimps, it's about a little boy who is struggling to find his place in the world.Some of it, for me, made for slightly painful viewing, more from personal experience than through the performed sadism or bullying. The three acts flow gently through their parts, although the second finishes with something of a crash. We do, however, see two black boys kiss and love it or hate it, it's been going on for thousands of years, so some of the rather more hysterical commentators on IMDb might want to check themselves slightly.It's well made, well acted and it holds your attention solidly. However, the third act does sag a bit, the contrition with mom did jar a bit, and out of two sexual scenes, one involved a heterosexual couple which was a bit bizarre to me. These are minor quibbles overall though, in general I thought this was a really solid movie and well worth watching. We had the added treat of the projectionist playing 5 seconds of La La Land at the start of the show, well played the Rio in Dalston."
MOONLIGHT,7 April 2017,10/10,"This seems to be the kind of movie that is only getting infamous for all the wrong reasons; namely the epic fail at the Academy Awards earlier this year. I had already seen both La La Land and Moonlight prior to that mistake, but I wanted to rethink before I actually put fingers to keyboard and properly give my opinion on them both.First of all, this is a film that takes a deeply intimate and personal look at the lives of both Tarell McCraney (writer) and Barry Jenkins (director), which gives a real insight and nuance to the incredible amount of detail that is put into this epic story.The story is told in 3 parts that spans roughly 20 years: we see this small boy called Chiron, who we see as a small kid nicknamed ""Little"", a 15 year old at school as ""Chiron"", and then as a 25 year old hardened muscle-bound drug dealer nicknamed ""Black"". Within those parts we see a selection of characters that emphisise the struggle of growing up black, gay, and poor in Miami in the 1980's.Each part looks beautiful, due to the gentle lense of James Laxton providing a continual throughline despite the time jumps, and the editing to make us focus on the most important aspects of each story - as Little, it's Juan's influence, as Chiron it's his sexual encounter with Kevin (which, by the way, is so natural and uncliche it needs to be taught to all film students) and in the final part, it's Chiron fixing his relationship with Paula and then rekindling his relationship with Kevin.EVERY...SINGLE...ASPECT of this movie is PERFECT. The acting is exceptional, especially from Oscar-winning Mahershala Ali as Juan, the drug dealer who takes Little under his wing and who uses his extremely limited screen time to give a character of immense depth and also tragedy that lives on past his off-screen death between ""Little"" and ""Chiron"", and also Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris, who plays the drug-addicted and abusive mother of Chiron who later repents with monstrous ferocity in the first two thirds, and then with a heart-wrenching repentance in the end. Chiron is also a lovable character that gives a deep insight into the fractured view of black masculinity, as is Kevin. Janelle Monae is also in the film as Juan's girlfriend who is extremely cool and enjoyable to watch. The script is perfect, without a fake moment or an unnecessary sequence. The score is on-point.As the film reached its end, I was waiting for something terrible to happen. Something that make me react the same way I did with the ending of La La Land, ironically. But it didn't; the ending, with Chiron and Kevin in each others embrace, then cutting back to the smiling Little on the beach, was exactly how to do an open-ended ending. This film is perfect, in every way.Watch it. You will NOT be disappointed by this. I promise."
MOONLIGHT,5 June 2019,7/10,"I will admit that it feels a little gimmicky and Oscar baiting at first, but the film is good."
MOONLIGHT,26 August 2021,9/10,"I loved the way the story is told in 3 parts: childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Each one in which our protagonist lives certain experiences that as he grows up will make him question ""who he is"". I also see that they represented well the customs of the afro descendants as with the music or their expressions. On the technical side, the music is well done, the photography is very good and the performances are good. A very good story about the search for identity!"
MOONLIGHT,25 June 2017,10/10,"This movie is beyond brilliant. I am a white gay guy almost 60. I just had no way of knowing this culture except by reading the newspaper. I live in Miami and we read regularly about violent incidents happening in schools in the neighborhood depicted in the film. But at the bottom of everything is a simple coming of age story, but one that goes to degrees most of us wouldn't know. I loved the characters. By the end I even pitied poor Paula,imagine living with her memories and guilt. I love also that the movie doesn't HIT YOU OVER THE HEAD. We know Black is visiting his mother in rehab because we see he is wearing a sticker. We know that Juan died simply because his mother says, ""I haven't seen Teresa since the funeral."" It is nice being respected in that we don't have to be told, ""PAY ATTENTION!"" I am not proud to say I felt initial satisfaction when Chiron attacks his classmate (undoubtedly seriously injuring him). Kevin, poor Kevin. If youngish (under 35) don't like it, give it another chance after 45 and I bet you will see it differently. Last two scenes are the most erotic I have ever experienced."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,7/10,"The first two thirds of the movie are interesting and poignant. First we see a young boy trying to survive with a crack-addicted mother and being helped by a drug dealer and the drug dealer's girlfriend (apparently in the 1990s). Then we see the same boy as a teenager, struggling to deal with being gay and managing bullies. In the last third of the movie we see the same person as an adult. What he has become is a disappointment, but the movie could have sustained my interest if there had been some type of dramatic reckoning at the end. Instead, the ending was predictable and extremely drawn-out. In addition, some characters seem to just disappear. Although the depiction of childhood and adolescence was empathic, I really didn't feel for the adult character."
MOONLIGHT,10 July 2018,3/10,"I am finding a lot of movies nowadays are so boring that I am inclined to walk out after an hour or so. However, some films get going in the second half and you find it was worth persevering with. Not this one. Told in three parts with some excellent acting the plot was week and one dimensional. Just when you think the story was about to take off it went back to the long drawn out scenes with too many pauses between dialog that you are left wondering if the conversation has been muted. Talking of conversation there are moments when the jive talk is impossible to interpret and you think you are watching a sequel to ""Airplane."" Good beginning, some middle and an ending that makes the movie a waste of time. Oscar winner? Shouldn't be."
MOONLIGHT,9 January 2017,2/10,"I am very eclectic when it comes to movies, such as I love the marvel movies, lord of the rings series, Quentin Tarantino, animated, sci-fi, westerns and even horror movies aka the conjuring, purge, green inferno, the insidious series, musical, I have watched Les Miserables countless times and I thought Fences was one of the best performances by denzel in ages..So please believe me I was looking forward to seeing this movie after it what the golden globe awards..I could not even making it through half this movie...I have no issues with slow movies if the actors and dialogue can keep me pulled...aka Fences...but I couldn't even tell what this movie was suppose to be about 1 hour in....the fact that this movie won any award is disservice to all other movies..i hope the Oscars do not give into to the pressures of the ignorant...."
MOONLIGHT,19 February 2017,8/10,"This film is technically well made, the performances are consistently absorbing and moving when required to be, the story itself not unduly familiar, and the denouement is satisfying for a viewer who bought into the subtle romantic thread that develops throughout (albeit not without disturbing interruption). But the film is not without its unresolved plot points or motivational themes for me, Mahershala Ali (universally identified as a ) as Juan, is indeed possessed of star quality, and this chimes with Juan as Chirons early male role model. But Juan's articulate tolerance seems unlikely given the compromises he's made in life (and which are called out by Chirons mother). Juan disappears from the film after the first third, which makes no real sense, and his conflicts are never echoed where they ought to be, in his girlfriend Teresa's character. There was only one real challenge to my suspension of disbelief, the idea that the actor who played Chiron at 15 could physically become the man who played the adult Chiron is absurd. Though references were made to him 'rebuilding' himself, the two men's frames were from opposite ends of the spectrum. The actors themselves did create continuity of character, but the leap was like Pee Wee Herman becoming Mike Tyson though a little gym work, and it distracted me and undermined the story a little because it seemed to be theatrical wish fulfillment. Similary, the 'monogamous' wilderness years that Chiron is supposed to have lived, seem to me to be a romantic ideal for 12 year old girls, but worse , they undermine the reality of Caron's adult gay sexual nature. The implication being that he's not gay, just in love with this one person who happens to be a man. This is a carefully managed internalised homophobia that chimes well with many black men. I don't buy it, it is merely a reflection of the unwillingness of that community to accept gayness in its full male sense. All that being said, it was and is an interesting tale, warmly told, with incredibly high quality performances throughout. I admit I had a tear in my eye at the end...and a warm fuzzy feeling."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,1/10,"Clearly one of the WORST movies I've seen in quite awhile. I'd be surprised if a thousand words were spoken the entire film. Chopped up scenarios, a bit like ""Boyhood"" but with black folks and MUCH LESS spirit or meaning.Typical, type-casting film about a young boy's tough life in the ""hood"", bullying, and troubled adult. Uh huh. And....... that's it. As if THAT card hasn't been played a million times over and over.Dead and soulless film. Waste of celluloid, and most definitely a waste of time and a rental. Academy Awards folks -- you should be ashamed for even RECOGNIZING this film. What a farce you are proving yourselves to have become. Complete putty in one social group's hands. Disgusting.I will say though, the LGBT and black folks should be satisfied though now. Even if most will agree its win is out of political, boo hoo whining of previous years' minority community.The nomination, much less the WINNING of ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" are clear proof that the Academy has no backbone and societal conscience to the viewers who patronize them. Complete ""bone to the dog"" decision by them headed by none other than oh (!), shocker a ""minority"" President.Sickening cowardice on their part. This movie SUCKS in bold faced, all cap letters! Nothing to be proud of AT ALL. What a true bummer."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2020,1/10,"I really hated this movie, it's very boring and slow, it doesn't get anywhere"
MOONLIGHT,14 April 2020,9/10,"The film focuses on an ordinary black boy, presenting his troubled growing up environment. The plot is natural, the technique is delicate and slow, and the characters are vivid and fleshy. Male master grow up after adult, look like a strong body, ""career"" success, now is not what it used to be, and the mother reconciliation, but too long depressed heart still need to release, psychological barriers need to step past, he only go to find the closest childhood partner, in their unique way to solve. The film shows the psychological context of human development and provides a perspective to guide the audience to explore the truth and root causes of social problems."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,3/10,"Moonlight Review So NOT Best Picture...to me Okay I watched the so-called Best Picture of the flubbed Oscars of 2017 from Redbox last night and this is NOT Best Picture in my book. Okay here come the bashing ""You're being a racist."" or ""You didn't understand it."" I understood it just fine. It's about this kid who I am guessing is 12 by the look of him who only goes by the name Little because no one ever bothers to learn his real name which is Chiron. Until one day he is being bullied by these kids after school so he hides out in his abandon house and this guy Juan comes along to ""rescue"" him Now he's a teenager and still being bullied and him and his friend Kevin start up a relationship but the next day a bully tells Kevin to beat up Chiron and let's just say things go downhill from there. Then he's an adult and he's a selling drugs and his life is basically falling apart and Kevin calls him to catch up and that's basically it. This film was not good. Sorry but it wasn't. Don't go off on me for saying this but it wasn't best picture at the Oscars. They had it right the first time when they said La La Land because THAT is a Best Picture not this piece of crap. I want my 1 hour and 57 minutes of my life back. I gave it a 3 because the only person who was even interesting in this film was the mother and she was on crack. That sounded mean but it's true. The best picture of the year at the Oscars they had it right the first time it was LA LA LAND! Go rent that not this film."
MOONLIGHT,23 February 2017,6/10,"The story of a poor kid born on the wrong side of the tracks. His mother has drug problems and he doesn't have many friends. He's bullied has a horrible life. Few people are kind to him, except the local dealer and his best friend.The first half the characters seemed real, and what could happen. The 2nd half the motivation of the characters is very weak and poorly rooted in narrative or even likely.If you are looking for characters that break stereotypes simply watch a box set of 'The Wire'."
MOONLIGHT,13 July 2020,9/10,This is a really good movie. This movie has some really good acting and some powerful dialog. Everyone was amazing in this movie especially the kid actor who played Chiron.
MOONLIGHT,10 June 2020,10/10,"Deep and absent-minded, a boy rising from the bottom cannot change his heart even though material changes him. Perhaps this is the fate of the end-result, we can do nothing.Three chapters, three names. Small name, flower name, big name. The boy grew up just like the gold teeth he had won. The blue boy in the moonlight had been hidden inside."
MOONLIGHT,15 March 2018,1/10,"It's all been said in the other negative reviews, and I can only concur. Desperately pretentious and earnest, one of those ""pat yourself on the back for getting it"" movies. ""Go and watch Transformers then!"" they cry. After sitting through Moonlight, I actually FELT like a Transformers/50 Shades/Emoji Movie marathon."
MOONLIGHT,13 November 2017,8/10,The one thing that anyone would notice couple of minutes in the movie is how good the actors really are. Mahershala's Oscar was well deserved. But I felt Naomie deserved it way way more.The directing is great. The core story is good and this paired with the good acting plus the directing resulted into one of the best films of 2016. I would highly recommend this to everyone.And one minor thing for the ones who have seen it. How good is the poster!!
MOONLIGHT,4 June 2020,1/10,"I watched the whole thing to see if I would begin to like it and yes it explores the subject matters of poverty, growing up gay and the never ending drug problem we still have worldwide.
Moonlight will never reach the audience it may want to reach because let's face it the mainstream audience will just not connect with this film.
We all know now the general public all they want nowadays is action and the endless marvel movies, what is a massive shame because I think good drama is far more compelling than the over the top brainless unrealistic action films.
Despite a very good performance from Danielle Harris as the main characters drug fuelled mother who was an horrible out of control, unreliable woman who you will despise mainly because of the things she did to her son. I just thought the story and dialogue never really went anywhere. Maybe many others will disagree,and they are rightly entitled to their opinions, but no one can tell me you will get moved by this film, maybe its just me because I just could not relate to story being from a small town in the UK. I know the problems are faced everyday in the UK and American cities regarding drugs etc.
Do not get me wrong the movie is well acted ,well filmed and will get the recognition from the academy but to me and the main general public this will be just a complete borefest to them.
I think there are have been more superior films been done this year including the excellent hacksaw ridge to name just one an incredible film full of bravery from a soldier doing acts beyond what is expected from anyone in the military and to me was far better movie to me.
Moonlight, oscars best picture material of course yes, that's why it won!! because this type of film will always get the votes from the academy, but I believe the general public would mainly go for hacksaw ridge if they had straight choice between the two, and on me viewing both movies now I would say they would be right and definitely the wrong film won."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2017,9/10,"Moonlight tells a powerful dramatic story in a poor, hopeless setting but it has never been done quite like this. The structure is set in three acts, one when lead character Chiron is a child in the projects of Miami, one where he goes through awkward teenage years, and one as a confused adult trying to find himself. Oh, and did I mention that he is a young gay black male whose mother is a crack addict? It is a snapshot of life filtered through an art-house lens, brilliantly edited and directed. It has scenes that are so honest they will rip your heart out, like when innocent questions asked by a child at a dinner table have bone-chilling answers. The story is one that never gets told but opens the floodgates for many more movies of its kind."
MOONLIGHT,14 October 2017,9/10,"Incredible film and well worth a watch for anyone interested in how to tell an urban drama. There's powerful cinematography, music, and character-building throughout following Chiron's journey to adulthood. Films displaying the naked core of human nature, alongside dual emotions of fear and passion, of this caliber are far and few between."
MOONLIGHT,28 August 2019,10/10,"I really don't have words to describe this movie,maybe beyon great,astonishing,amazing but even these words aren't enought to describe how well this movie was made and how it made me feel.
What I really loved about this movie is of course the plot/story,I've never seen such a story which can relate soo much with the life of almost every people,especially our childhood up until the beggining of our adult's life,no other movie(Oscar winner or not) had this strong connection with our lives.
I'm very happy that ""Moonlight"" won the Oscar for Best Picture because it has everything an Oscar movie needs to have and those things are:a astonishing story,a cast whose performance as well as character build are beyond amazing(especially Mahershala Ali,Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes) and a director(Barry Jenkins)who is not only 100 percent dedicated to his movie but Barry himself says that he's related to the story of his movie.
I think that the most heartbreaking moment as well the best scene of the movie is when the adult version of Chiron decides to accept Kevins's dinner offer. From the moment he enters to the moment Chiron takes Kevin home with his car and just before the movie ends,Kevin asks Chiron ""Who is you Chiron ?"" and Chiron says ""I'm me.I ain't trying to be nothing else."". It's such a great scene because from the beginning of Chiron's childhood to him as an adult he still tries to found out who he really is as well as asking himself if the person he is now it's just a mask of his personality or this is really who he is ?
It's a question that most of us are asking ourselves.
Overall, Barry Jenkins movie,Moonlight is as I said in the title the Best Oscar winner for Best Picture ever made,whose story is written in such a fantastic way that makes us feel like we're Chiron and we're living his entire life becasuse some parts of his life relates to most of us and the most obvious one is that of people seeing you different from them."
MOONLIGHT,16 October 2019,,"I am old enough to remember when any film won an Oscar in one of the top categories you could expect a quality entertaining experience. All that changed around 2000. Since then, in general, Oscars seem to be a measure of how many Politically Correct boxes have been ticked - Dallas Buyers Club, The Danish Girl and Moonlight are typical examples {although DBC is the best of these three). These films may have fine acting and/or directing but lack any real entertainment value but proudly flaunt their 'right-on' credentials. If I was a cynical film-maker desperate for an Oscar, I would have no trouble including the necessary elements. An Oscar used to be an indicator of a 'must see' film, for me it is now an indicator for 'must avoid'. Moonlight got eight Oscar nominations but is as entertaining as watching my clock tick through 111 minutes, Two fine performances, Ali and Harris, can't save this turkey."
MOONLIGHT,7 April 2017,4/10,"... just because of the hype. Too many times, I've been fooled by movies hyped out of all possible limit ‚Äî and this felt like yet another.Don't misunderstand: it's beautifully filmed. Every member of the cast is spot on in capturing their various characters. The production design walks a great line between gritty reality and just barely there haze of memory.The problem is the writing. I was with the film until the very end. I wanted to see a conclusion to Chiron's character arc. Had he learned anything along the way? Would he find any kind of resolution?... Well, we just don't know. Everything seems to be headed for that, then it just... stops. Incredible build up of all kinds of sexual tension between him and Kevin... and it just... stops. Tearful cuddling scene and go to credits. I like films that leave themselves open to interpretation. But there has to be something to interpret, and this seemed to lack that. Maybe I missed a few things along the way, but it was just empty. Chiron doesn't really learn anything. Kevin's turned his life around, as far as we can tell, but it's difficult, if not impossible, to know for sure because when everything is left vague, then nothing is really resolved.Best Picture? Sorry, no. I don't see many movies these days, but when I finished watching this, my first reaction was, Oh? Are we getting a Moonlight 2?"
MOONLIGHT,30 April 2018,7/10,"""Moonlight"" is thought provoking and sincere. It tells deep truths and holds interest throughout. However, it feels empty during some moments when it should really be the most powerful.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Story/Directing: ""Moonlight"" starts out strong with the childhood of Little. He starts to learn he is different from others. We see the pain this causes him. We also experience the brokenness of his family; his mom is hardly a mother to him. But some kindhearted people take him and shape his life. He is drawn to them, and this is beautiful. Overtime, Little grows up and prefers to be called by his name, Chiron. His life changes and he figures out who he is a bit more. We really start to connect with Chiron during this part of his life. Then, as we jump into his adulthood, he becomes distant from the story. The film begins to lose its momentum, and we don't get a strong piece of storytelling until the very end. Kevin turns out to be a more developed character in the last third of the movie than Chiron/Black is. Barry Jenkins shows promise as a director. He commands powerful moments and gets the most out of his cast, but I think he has a lot more potential than what the final product ended up being. *Cinematography/Editing: The visual storytelling is a strong suit of this film. James Laxton composes beautiful and powerful images that tap into the emotion of each scene. His use of color is powerful and memorable. There is a constant tone of melancholy and disconnection through the camera angles and movement. In many scenes, we are pushed very close to characters when we see Chiron's point of view, and it leaves us with a feeling of being closed in on and trapped. The depth of field also gives us hints of Chiron's feeling of being disconnected with others. The performances of the actors are placed higher in importance than having fancy camerawork, and that is a strength of this film. The editing adds so much beauty to this film. There are no quick cuts. We take our time focusing on characters and the things going through their minds. The pacing makes this film seem so much more natural and grounded in emotion. Less is more sometimes, and when it comes to editing in this film, they understood that and used it to their advantage. *Dialogue/Acting: Once again, less is more. There were no grand revelations through long monologues or verbiage. The conversations felt sincere and honest. There was power in the smallest of lines because it was coupled with strong performances from the actors. There were not many weak performances throughout the whole film. One of the weakest performances was by Trevante Rhodes. I am not sure whether it was a directorial decision or if Rhodes has a lack of range, but he stayed in the same mood for each scene he was in. Most of the other performances were authentic and powerful. *Music/Sound: The score was subdued but still carried a lot of weight. It was melancholic and beautiful; perfectly reflecting the tone set by the other aspects of the film. The sound design did its job. The most noticeable parts were when sound cut out, revealing to us that Chiron was pushing some of his experiences to the background. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume and set pieces were beautiful and played a central role in setting up the feeling of the film. There are not many uses of special effects, but the film did not need them. The only instance that required it was the beating of Chiron, and it held up as being relatively realistic. *Conclusion: ""Moonlight"" is a beautiful film that follows the life of a young black man who struggles to find who he is and what he will become. It is heartbreaking, hopeful, and down to earth."
MOONLIGHT,26 November 2016,9/10,"I saw Moonlight about a week ago, but because of the holidays and a buys schedule I was not able to get to this review until today. In those 5 days since I saw this movie I have thought about it every day and I think I like it more than I did when I first saw it. I don't want to get into the plot too much in this review for fear of spoiling anything for you guys so this will mostly just be me telling you about how great this movie is.Lets start with the director, Barry Jenkins. I had never heard of Mr. Jenkins before Moonlight and I don't think I am the only one in that boat. He only has one other feature film in his directorial library, but after seeing Moonlight you would think he has been an industry regular for the last 15 years. Jenkins gives a legitimacy to the setting of this story, which I cannot say I see too often in these types of movies. The slums of Miami may be downtrodden but Jenkins is also able to show the beauty around the madness. The movie is based off an unproduced play by Tarell Alvin McCraney called ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" but Barry Jenkins is responsible for the script of the movie and what a script it is. The basic outline is the movie takes place at three different time periods in a young boys life, and each of them are both drastically different, but somehow many things stay the same. I will get to the actors in a moment but Jenkins gets so much emotion out of this script, and it is not sappy or searching for tears, it is just real life emotion, pain, happiness, regret, anxiety and more, Moonlight does not shy away from emotions, it uses them.The interesting thing about Moonlight is that the main character is played by 3 different actors over the course of the movie. In part one, entitled ""Little"" Alex Hibbert plays the lead. A strong performance from a child actor that rivals some of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. Ashton Sanders takes over the reins and is in charge of the ""Chiron"" portion of the story and this one I feel I can relate to the most. Sanders plays the quiet troubled portion of Chiron's tale beautifully. Then Trevante Rhodes closes it out in the ""Black"" portion of the story. This may be the most effecting performance in the movie, just because of the complete transformation for the child in the beginning of the movie to the grown man we see at the end. People have asked me which performance was the best of the three, and honestly I can't pick one. They are all affecting in their own way and would not be as strong if you removed any one of them.I can't say any movie has gotten to me as much as Moonlight has this year. There are just so many great things here, The writing the directing the acting the classical music that adds to make this story more than just a ""hood drama"". In my opinion Chiron is the most well made character in a movie since Riggan Thomson in Birdman from a few years ago. By the end of the movie I felt something for Chiron, I can't tell exactly what it was, it is more than pity or compassion but something deeper. There is a reality in his eyes by the end that has been earned by the previous 90 minutes. I have seen quite a few movies this year but in my humble opinion Moonlight is the strongest of 2016 so far. It should be a prominent player come awards season and it would be deserving of everything it gets. Get ahead of everyone and see Moonlight now, you wont be disappointed."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2021,2/10,"Yes it had potential, they kept it simple and real, real life problems that real families have to go through today, and will continue to, and that is why I praise the subject matter. But as a film the narrative really stalled when it hit the third act, and this is where it could have really grounded you as the audience and kept you in your seat thinking about it, long after the credits. But it just didn't, it was a very boring end and you just didn't find yourself caring enough which was unfortunate.The film was well made, the setting, sound production, direction all seemed to click together nicely. The acting was slight, and restrained in a very real kinda way, this was unique and worked well for the first two acts, just... But a coming of age story still needs an edge to it, to engage the audience, and this is where you were left wondering... An Oscar worthy picture...? I didn't think so..."
MOONLIGHT,21 April 2019,9/10,"Up there with some of my favourite films: although not one I will play on repeat often: it's a bit close to the knuckle for me. A lot of Chiron's early life mirrors my own. I've lived the feelings of abandonment, bewilderment, fear and anger. I've felt cast adrift in a loveless world that doesn't seem to have space for me.Beautifully performed, atmospheric cinematography, and tight scripting: not much is wasted. The plot line is carried masterfully through all three ""acts"" of the screenplay. This is the only slightly jarring thing, the way the film is carved up into acts as if you were at the theatre. It's one way of marking the passage of time - perhaps not the most successful?It deserves far more accolades than it has received - but being about a black, gay character puts the film into two categories that Hollywood still marginalises.Watch it! It will leave its mark on you."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2020,7/10,"Moonlight has some excellent cinematography. A good varsity of shots. Good set design and locations serve to make us feel trapped in the world just like our main character is. It's no doubt a technical success.
Moonlight is a tale of one character through 3 phases of life. He is very quiet throughout, and the movie chooses to develop him through his actions, not his words. It works for acts 1 and 2, but not for act 3. It builds up for 20-30 minutes to a moment that never happens and I don't know what the writer was doing. There's no closure here unfortunately and it brings it down.
That said, I still enjoyed it overall. Don't listen to the pricks tanking it's score."
MOONLIGHT,21 September 2021,8/10,"Moonlight's realness is devastating, and the first two chapters are just incredible. Mahershala Ali is truly the star of the film, and unfortunately it seems that as he disappears from the film so does the story. The chapters are just barely connected, seemingly a depiction of real life. However, the exploration of our protagonist's character is quickly abandoned in the third chapter, almost as abruptly as the film ends."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,6/10,"Moonlight is a particularly difficult film to rate. It is without doubt a thought provoking piece which handles its narrative dilemma of a young black youth growing up in the tough streets of Miami and coming to terms with his sexuality, with both honest realism and grace. However Moonlight will also without doubt have a number of disappointed viewers (me included), which will have mostly been provoked by the hyped up acclaim from the professional film critics and the film academy's.Chiron is the name of the gay black youth the films narrative follows and is split in to three chapters. Chapter 1 presents Chiron as a young boy, Chapter 2 takes us through his high school years and Chapter 3 we see how Chiron has turned out as a fully grown adult. Now Chapters 1 and 2, I found very engaging. His struggles between the isolation and bulling of his sexuality and having to cope with his unpredictable drug addict of a mum, I felt was very endearing and I had a high amount of sympathy for his situation. I would have to point out though that the film runs at an unusual pace through out, with some scenes not feeling necessary to the plot and the dialogue always difficult to grasp, particularly as Chiron is very quiet fella.Chapter 3 is where the film lost me. The three stages of Chiron's life are of course portrayed by three different actors. The child Chiron and the teenage Chiron look like they could be the same guy with their meek gangly frame and vulnerable facial features. The adult Chiron looks so different, that you can barely believe that it is the same character. He is now a big muscle bound mean looking drug dealer, who bares no resemblance to the previous two Chiron's, its a difficult evolution to buy. Though the look of Chiron is not my main issue with the final chapter, it is the fact that it is so drab and uneventful. The whole chapter is made up of Chiron visiting an old friend whom he had his first gay sexual encounter with. It is basically a long conversation between the two of them and it really drags to the point where I switched off (you know where the films going at this point) and just wanted the end credits to roll.Moonlight is overall a brave and decent film with strong performances marred by its boring uneventful conclusion. Unfortunately it has ended up asking more questions about professional film critics than it has about it's subject matter. In my opinion film critics have now become redundant, they always give glowing reviews to anything art house or anything that tackles pc subjects like Moonlight does, regardless to whether they will actually entertain or immerse the audience. Incredibly the film that I most enjoyed watching this year was Passengers, which came as quite a surprise given that the critics said it was awful."
MOONLIGHT,19 February 2017,10/10,"I usually don't write reviews, even if it's for a movie I really admire, but this film is something different. This film is important.The reason I say this film is important is because it's timeless. What this film presents is something that will never disappear from society- Broken families, people who need to learn to live their life through the struggles of being gay (or anything but straight). Even in 30 years this film will be true to real life. And not just in America, but also in the world in general.The acting is off the charts, the directing and cinematography is absolutely fantastic, the screenplay is just amazing. Every actor is on their A game, every scene is meaningful.This is a movie, that although truly tough to watch, should be viewed by anyone who can handle the subject matter and has a strong heart.Even though I praise this movie so much, it's one of those movies I can never see myself watching it again. This movie left me broken, with absolute shock. When this movie ended, only after 10 minutes could I stand up and wash my face. This film is a must-see experience."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,1/10,"I had my doubts before viewing this movie and it turned out i was right! This is a terribly boring, slow paced, bad written and poorly directed movie. I forced myself to stay and watch it until the end because after all it got an Oscar for best movie 2017!? . . so i sat it through until the unbelievable end-sequence. . what a waste! I also can't believe people are actually giving this trash of a movie good reviews . . and THAT IT GOT AN Oscar! No, really everything you read about this movie is a lie: it's not a masterpiece, it will not ""open your eyes"" or anything like that! I even doubt if the people who wrote this crap actually SAW the movie! Chiron is black and gay. OK . . so? He got bullied at school. OK . . and? He is frustrated, feels not understood and is - unbelievably! - shy about sex. So . . ? Thousands of young boys may have experienced those feelings and circumstances and yet made friends and did something with their lives and explored their sexuality. . Chiron doesn't . . he flees and hides and suffers and moans . . sigh! This film isn't even close to being worthy of an Oscar; well i guess it simply won the Oscar for best film due to outside pressure from groups complaining that Hollywood is racist. AVOID THIS GARBAGE!"
MOONLIGHT,21 October 2016,8/10,"This movie is a beautiful piece of art from beginning to end. I was anxious to see this film but still nervous in hopes that the result would match the hype. Some of my expectations were not met (Janelle Monae's role) but those minor kinks do not take away from what the film was made to be.I was curious as to how they'd tell a full story in three parts but it flowed well and each actor who portrayed the main character, Chiron, added so many nuances.. it just pulled you in. But the actors who stole the show are definitely Naomie Harris as the main character's Mother and Ashton Sanders who played the teenager version of the main character. Both commanded the screen in every scene they were in. On the surface, Naomie's character is despicable but she brought such heart that it made you feel for her. Ashton's version of Chiron was a great journey to watch. I was rooting for him the entire time. But I must point out that the entire cast was awesome.Well written, well paced. The visuals. The music. I was blown away and definitely recommend it. There were some places I wanted the story to go, as far as character interaction in certain areas. I was looking for some memorable monologues or some gritty drama between certain characters but I had to realize that this movie was more about the internal struggle. The subtlety is what made it unique."
MOONLIGHT,26 January 2017,2/10,"So how many films do we have to see about poverty, drug use, inner city struggle and young boys coming of age n the hood?The original version of this now tired story-line is the 1991 Boyz n The Hood and still the best version.Just because the writers make the young boy gay, doesn't make it innovative.On top of it, the flow of the film is jagged. Unrelated scenes and dialogue that do nothing for it's artistic or deep portrayal. The early scenes show the working mother striving to provide, worried about her son's whereabouts as he comes home to a clean furnished apartment in a low income neighbourhood. Next thing we jump to her on crack, spewing all sorts of vilification towards her son's orientation while he's at home in the apartment now empty, no hot water and the kid's boiling water on the stove to take a bath. Keeping in mind he's all of 7 or 8.Okay so without at lease an inkling of a backstory we make the jump wondering what fresh hell is next? All in all each scene rambles in meaningless directions with meaningless dialogue.Sorry folks, I didn't stick around to find out if there's a happy ending.It's just a bad film trying to make you feel as if you should care because there are poignant important issues on offer. The truth is the film is exploiting important issues hoping the audience isn't savvy enough to pick up on the extremely bad writing.The writing manipulates the audience with over the top emotional brutality and preys upon our need to remain politically correct toward the content. In reality the content is both racist and homophobic. Thanks but no thanks."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,8/10,"Moonlight is a powerful film about the struggles of poverty, combined with the struggles of being homosexual in an environment geared against it. Based on a character brought to life by three very talented actors through three different time periods, the suffering of man is painted in an assortment of colours and styles. Brought up in a family of one, victim to drug abuse, victim to social poverty, victim to stigmatized sexuality, and seduced to a life of crime and betrayal, Moonlight presents the real struggle many people face in life, and resonates with a broad audience.Naomi Harris is the star of the show, portraying a mother who couldn't care less about her only child, who instead favours the high-end result of drug abuse. Harris steals every scene, and provides the foundations for the mental instability of her son and our key protagonist. Mahershala Ali does well as a father figure, though his acting chops in this film in particular, are overrated. His character is left to dwindle away into the shadows of the film, never to be mentioned again, nor remembered. Barry Jenkins creates a world of juxtaposition, flared with colour and bleakness. Creating walking clich√©s, and then painting them with the colours of alienation, Jenkins really digs into the depravity of man, and the general hatred towards the misunderstood. Whilst Jenkins has undoubtedly created a fantastic piece of film that resonates with a broad scope of people, it is not the best of 2016. Its win is understandable, though undeserved."
MOONLIGHT,26 May 2020,4/10,"Best picture?
Most Politically Correct certainly. Something for the Gay Folks. Something for the Black Folks. Something for those of us who were bullied in school.
Original? Not in the least. Not even in terms of style, which is just French New Wave.
And maybe Black Folks might not appreciate the idea that the majority of them are felons or drug addicts?
I can see why the producers got money to make this money.
I don't see why people in the industry thought so highly of it."
MOONLIGHT,5 April 2020,10/10,"Moonlight provokes your sensibilities and bestows us with awareness of a phenomenology that is not easily accessible. Chiron is an accrual of tragic circumstances that culminated into a certain type of person that might not be accepted by many people. Moonlight attempts to elucidate the unfortunate courses that life can take you and inform the viewer about many of the nuances that lie within the situation that life might throw at you. It gives an answer to difficult questions like: Why would a person decide to be a drug dealer if his mother was ravaged by drug abuse. Why would he not accuse his bullies of assault or battery?The tripartite depiction of Chiron's life was an astute way of demonstrating the development of a person as a consequence of his life situations. It gives us a lesson on understanding the difficulty of life in all its complexity, to understand that some people just have no other choice in the events that happen in their life. It allows us to creep into the suffering of the protagonist and understand his brokenness and, therefore, accept him. Finally, it gives the viewer a hard pill that can wake him up to his own ignorance and biases.The venture on Chiron's mind is a very profound one. I enjoyed the little accurate features of his personality like timidness, insecurity, melancholy, taciturnity, and excitability. It gave us a really comprehensive rendition of the range of the effect of Chiron's circumstances on his psyche. It is really constructive to have movies like this one. It shows us circumstances that we would not otherwise understand if we didn't have artistic works like moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,16 August 2020,9/10,"Moonlight is a tender exploration of sexuality and self-acceptance. A parable of life in underprivileged ghettos of society, told with the upmost delicacy and respect. Whilst Moonlight focuses on the American working class black community, it's moral theme of cyclical self-depreciation and desperation could be retold in any home devoid of love or community lacking hope. Given the subject matter Moonlight could have been an arduously grim experience. However Jenkins crafts Moonlight masterfully, punctuating the bleak storyline with sumptuous cinematography and a juxtaposing classical score. Told through three snapshots of Chiron's coming of age, a uniformly superb cast keep us engaged. Part of the viewers frustration at Chiron is that he misses the glimmers of hope - such as the tender hearted acceptance of Juan and Teresa. Whilst it's far from the stereotypical Oscar winner chock full of barn-storming dramatics and elongated ""nomination bait"" speeches, Moonlight's subtlety sticks with you. A brave tale told in a bold and unique manner."
MOONLIGHT,16 April 2017,3/10,"Moonlight; We always watch a movie that won Best Picture Academy Award movie because quality is quality. All throughout this movie I kept wondering when some serious tension was going to occur and when there was something really at stake. There were a few fleeting moments but they weren't that tension filled. The clich√©' mother who's a crack head etc... Seen it all before. At the end of this film we looked at each other and said ""that's it""? It was an interesting little story but from my POV it was just another urban ghetto story with a gay twist. A great movie or a great book stays with you after it's over. This movie was very forgettable. We really expected a lot more from an Oscar winner. This sentence has absolutely nothing to do with race, but IMO La La Land was about eight times better and more entertaining. That movie should have won the Oscar."
MOONLIGHT,7 January 2019,4/10,"Since it won the Oscar, I thought it would be a good movie to watch. All put in a wonderful performance. Other than that I found it really not that interesting and there is so much more of the story that needed to be told. It wasn't nearly as good as I had read about. I really wanted to like this movie too"
MOONLIGHT,26 February 2017,8/10,"I can see why Moonlight is seen as one of the best movies in 2016. All performances were exquisite and it is so thought-provoking. It addresses race, sexual orientation, family, and so much more. And it does that in an intrinsic manner through this young boy who is trying to figure out who he is. These issues are approached subtly because this is all about Chiron finding who he is. And it is this level of subtlety ‚Äì which is not just present in the main character's story but those around him ‚Äì that makes this movie stand out.All three actors who played Chiron were stellar but the teenager one took things to a whole new level. He conveyed a level of emotion that I did not get from the other two and I really felt for him.The music enveloped me in the narrative, making me shiver on a couple of occasions, and all the play on sound was amazing, like the time when Chiron was at the principal's office and her voice progressively faded away.The camera work was stupendous. The way some scenes were filmed made them more genuine and the lyrical tone of some of them was just beautiful.This is heatbreakingly realistic too. I am sure stuff like this happens everyday.The film dragged on a bit at times, and the highlights are definitely the first two stages ‚Äì child and teenager. Once we get to adult Chiron everything that happened felt quite purposeless. I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen that would wrap up the story nicely but that was not the case.Also, some things did not add up, like Chiron's backpack being obviously brand new and he is always so clean despite his living conditions and his mother's neglect.It is still an amazing movie and I highly recommend it."
MOONLIGHT,28 May 2020,9/10,Finally gave in and watched it after all these years. What a beautiful and resounding art!
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,7/10,"It's the typical movie that doesn't have to do much to conquer us, just for the story that carries. And for the first part of the movie that worked for me. The story but also the interpretations and the soundtrack. They all connect and captured my attention. I felt moved by it. By now I'm saying this is definitely a must watch and a serious candidate for the Oscars. But then it kind of lost it. It's not that the story stopped being good, but I guess the way it was threat in the end didn't satisfied me. I guess I maybe saw too much difference on the main character and maybe it was that or maybe it was just the action that I felt it didn't took me anywhere in the end and so I was a bit disappointed. The movie is well made and played. The story matters (there are a couple of lines and looks that say a lot about drug world and the places it affects), the soundtrack more then putting things together, some moments is enough to tell the story and like I said the actors also play it well (there aren't big speech us and a message is yet still passed), but I guess for me it lacked a little piece in the end. Worth watching but not as good as predicted to be in the beginning."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,10/10,"It is difficult to effectively display certain inner conflicts one may experience during the coming of age, but 'Moonlight' stunningly portrays three chapters in the life of a young, black boy and his struggle whilst growing up gay. Starting off with Little (Alex Hibbert); a boy who is taken under the wing of local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), followed by him as a teen, referred to as Chiron (Ashton Sanders), slowly uncovering and accepting his sexuality, then finally as a man (Trevante Rhodes), living his life begrudgingly with the burden of his troubled past. All this is then juxtaposed by a very difficult relationship with his mother, Paula, (Naomie Harris), falling in love with his best friend, and getting bullied consistently throughout school. The consequences of each prospect are dealt with astonishingly, somehow illustrating issues that have deep and dark implications with serenity and consideration. It simply is wonderful to watch.Some have referred to this feature as ""mundane"". However, director Barry Jenkins displays the toughness of this boy's life with appropriate genuineness. Amongst it all, Jenkins' unquestionable artistic talent demonstrates a troubled soul who cannot grasp exactly what it is that makes him different with seamless realism. He does this through the subtle ocean imagery every time Chiron encounters something challenging, which ties the narrative together ingeniously. This, combined with an excellent screenplay by Jenkins, inspired by Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, 'In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue', results in a naturally flowing story that makes 'Moonlight' immensely powerful.All three actors portray the main character with equal conviction, immersion and entrancing absorption; it certainly feels like an overarching story following one character, a hard task to truly pull off unless, like Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood', you use the same actor over an extended period. Ali's supporting role as the complicated, good-willed drug dealer, Juan, is indeed praiseworthy but it is Harris' performance that is most awe-inspiring. Certainly Oscar worthy, her marvellous display as Chiron's damaged, drug addicted mother is one that particularly stands out, despite the movie in itself being an incredible cinematic experience altogether. The extra layer of Juan being Paula's supplier adds further gravity to the situation, which is, to put it frankly, just one of many factors in the movie that pull delicately at your heartstrings. Jenkins successfully sustains the emotional attachment throughout, and has created an absolute serene picture; it is difficult to resist a rewatch.Intricately and carefully crafted, 'Moonlight' truly does shine as a masterwork, conveying emotions in their utmost complexity as part of a story where, in reality, 'little' happens (pun intended). Barry Jenkins comes to the forefront as an emerging talent in directing, with the standard set so high, it is now intriguing to anticipate just what his next project, 'A Contract with God' (a three-part directed feature), will be like."
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,8/10,"""Variety movie with artistic feel added to it and this will not be everyone's cup of tea but definitely its a treat for movie lovers"" My rating- 4/5Positives- 1.) Direction , script and story- Director succeed in capturing the characters emotions and loneliness. He gave this full film a documentary feel and he takes us to the Chirons (protagonists) life and showing us different emotion layers of each character. He took in variety format with realistic film making which needs to be appreciated. Story was also good and it may not attract you because its approach is more like documentation of a person. Story gives attention to all those sensitive feelings of the character and that makes us feel sympathy for Chiron (protagonist). Script had realistic dialogues and it gave feel to this movie.2.) All those 3 actors who played chiron's different stages of his life, Chirons friend, Mahershala Ali- All these actors gave justice to their roles and especially Mahershala who had minimal screen time but his performance was excellent. I don't know the names of these 3 actors who played chirons life but all these 3 actors were apt for the role. Same as well for the actor who played Chiron's friend. Rest all actors also performed well.3.)Bg score 4.) Cinematography 5.)Narration styleNegatives- 1.) Slow paced movie- Duration could have been reduced because it was boring the audience. If they could have made it short then it would have been better.Overall- This movie deals with different Genre which may not appeal to common audience but definitely its a treat for film lovers. It shows us the loneliness of a boy and where it takes him to with great narration technique. Yes Moonlight sheds its light on a loneliness boys life and it has open ended climax which makes us think about the characters while leaving the theater hall.My Rating- 4/5"
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,5/10,"The film is an in depth story about a young gay boys struggle growing up in Miami. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and the music runs along nicely to this. The film could of definitely been shortened and had more dialogue from shiron who for the most part stands around with his mouth hanging open looking gormless. Powerful story,"
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2017,4/10,"What the heck is going on? This movie does not deserve the rave reviews it is getting. Okay, let me get this out of the way first, the acting was superb, but in no way does good acting make a movie - it is story, drama and conflict that does this. The movie crawls along at a snail-like pace, occasionally awakening interest, but just turns out to be as dull and unexciting as La La Land and Manchester by the Sea. I am truly fed up with 'fake' reviews on IMDb that build a movie up to be something it isn't. They need to put more effort into weeding these people out who clearly have an agenda and perhaps are somehow associated with the movies production. Moonlight is a meandering film that ends stupidly. Someone else on IMDb said the end was awesome. What a complete and utter idiot. The end was dumb and pretentious. It seems to me that leftists have taken over Hollywood and place great reviews to bolster their poor attempts at movie making. Watch this at your peril. Just boring nonsense with the odd moment of excitement thrown in. I would NEVER sit through this again even if I was paid!"
MOONLIGHT,2 November 2016,10/10,"To solely categorize this film as an examination of Chiron, a young  African American who has to deal with being gay is accurate but  inadequate. It wouldn't be inadequate to also categorize it as a movie  about drug abuse, school bullying, and isolation. However, if someone  were to ask me what MOONLIGHT is truly about I would say that, at it's  core, it's a film about teaching a child how to swim, feeling the sand  on your skin, and cooking a meal for an old friend.   Director Berry Jenkins is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film  away from conventional storytelling and offer his audience something to  connect to in their own way. The way his camera roams around is  sensually magnificent; he knows when to cut to the next shot and when  to linger a few seconds longer. But above all else, his ability to add  an extra texture to each scene is awe-inspiring; it's more than just  style for the sake of style; it's essential to the movie's argument.  From the very first shot to the very last, MOONLIGHT is about as  beautiful a movie as you're likely to see this year. The colours are  rich and luminous; James Laxton's cinematography is visually immersive  leaving you stranded inside the story of the film. It moves at a  smooth, welcoming pace. The music, whether it be the classical or  hip-hop selections as well as Nicholas Britell's subtle score, is  perfect. And the performance are, well¬Ö they're the cherry on top.   It's uncanny how similar the 3 actors, who played the kid, teenage, and  adult versions of Chiron behaved and acted; you'd almost think it was  the same actor who played all three roles. Mahershala Ali and Naomie  Harris are more deserving of Oscar nominations than just about anyone  I've seen this year. They may be the standouts, but all the  performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and  powerful; a standing ovation for the casting director is in order.   But perhaps the thing about this movie that deserves the most acclaim  is its open-endedness; it's fight against straightforward  categorization and recap. MOONLIGHT so much more than a movie about  growing up gay; it's about overcoming your adversities and, despite  being a product of your environment, figuring out who you want to  become. Identity takes time to discover, and that's something anyone  can relate to."
MOONLIGHT,13 February 2017,9/10,"Barry Jenkins as writer and director has created a film which is as much poetry as cinema. Based on the play ""In Moonlight Black Boys look Blue"", it takes the story of Chiron, a young black boy and captures his life in three chapters: boy, teenager, man. The film resonates because it is a subtle dance ‚Äì Jenkins plays with convention by portraying a quite clich√© plot line and then subverting it at every angle. In many ways the story is old hat: young boy grows up in a drug affected household and struggles with the environment which attacks him at every turn. The film has many layers and the exploration of Chiron's growing realisation that he is different whether that is being gay or maybe just a quieter mode of maleness against a sea of testosterone. This theme of maleness is examined in many ways both in what it is to be a man but also WHEN. Time is a relentless stalker and observes in the background as the characters scramble for a purchase in their own stories. But, oh everything is in the telling. Jenkins uses his camera as if it is also a character ‚Äì always there, seeing everything but not objective: it subjectively is choosing stories to tell even if centred on Chiron. It is rare to so highly praise cinematography when the film is set in a modern urban environment but this is the exception. Throughout the film, Jenkins is using colour and lighting as a grammar to highlight the character and tone of the scene. All directors do this but rarely does it elevate the material. The ensemble is brilliant across the board. And that includes three versions of Chiron and Kevin to reflect their stages of boyhood. It is very hard to pinpoint any performances because they are so authentic but if I had to pick one it would be Mahershala Ali as Juan. He so dominates the screen whenever he is in the film because he is playing a caring person. Think back when you last saw a young black man portrayed as empathetic who was not a teacher or related vocation. It is jarring as you keep waiting for some ominous subtext to emerge. Moonlight is a beautiful piece of cinema which might have the unfortunate criticism that by subverting its own story, sometimes the film suffers: the viewer is waiting for the next plot point but in a poem it is all about the film language and the emotion of the image."
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2017,10/10,"""Moonlight"" is an exceptional drama, and the most refreshingly honest film I've seen in awhile. In a season when awards-friendly films tend to be polished and sanitized to appeal to older white audiences, here is a haunting and lyrical film which looks deeply into the moral complexities of its characters, and finds there both poetry and heartache.""Moonlight"" could loosely be described as a coming-of-age tale, but it's also somewhat of an odyssey. It introduces us to Chiron (pronounced shy-rOHne), a sensitive 12-year-old black boy, who's growing up in a sun-drenched ghetto in Miami, Florida. Chiron is a quiet, reserved kind of kid, with big sad eyes. When we first meet him, he's taking shelter from a group of neighborhood bullies in an abandoned apartment. A man happens to witness the commotion from across the street. He investigates, and although the boy won't talk, the two form a tenuous friendship. This man is Juan. Juan and his girlfriend, Theresa, become like a second family to Chiron, offering him support and stability whenever Chiron's crack-addicted mom either disappears or goes on a bender.There is a deep irony here, however, because Juan is the neighborhood supplier that Chiron's mom is indirectly buying from. There's moral complexity as well; it's because of his work in the drug-trade that Juan is able to afford the kind of comfortable lifestyle that makes a semblance of stability available to Chiron.I found myself pondering some thorny questions, like: What impression might it make on a boy if the only real glimpse of domestic stability he gets comes from the household of a drug- dealer? And to what extent are Juan's feelings for the boy genuine, and to what extent are they motivated by guilt? And does it even matter? Is anyone ever truly selfless?The film is broken into three sections, and each section is based around a different time in Chiron's life. The first section finds him at around 12-year-old. The second section finds him at about the age of 16, attending high-school, where a combination of events involving first-love, peer-pressure, and bullying, conspire to bring massive change into Chiron's life. The third section reveals Chiron in his thirties, hardened, having grown into a version of Juan. When he receives an unexpected call from an old friend, memories and romantic tensions disrupt his carefully-molded sense of identity, and he sets out to reconnect with his past.The film looks deeply into each of its characters. Chiron's Cuban-American friend, Kevin, develops into a much richer character than we first take him for, revealing a man who has fought his own battles of identity. Even Chiron's crackhead mom is given fair treatment, depicted as a woman whose disease (of drug-addiction) often obscures both her love for her son, and her ability to provide a home -- in ways she eventually regrets.All in all, it's a film which manages to seem grounded in the stuff of gritty reality, even while being gorgeous, haunting, and deeply poetic. The only fault I could find was that the ending came a bit too abruptly for my taste. I was enjoying the film's concluding scenes so much, I was disappointed that I didn't get to find out what happened next. I really wanted to know more about these characters; I wanted their stories to continue. But you know, perhaps that's not such a criticism after all."
MOONLIGHT,7 December 2019,5/10,"This film doesn't deserve a 1/10. It's well shot and, in very few instances, well acted, but many of the performances are simply subpar.The second biggest problem with this film is the lousy screenplay. Just about every scene is written to try to shoehorn the plot and the characters, but it's so awkwardly done. The characters and the situations they get into are so beyond implausible and they flow out so unnaturally.The main character's first gay experience with his best friend is something you would only see in a Hollywood movie. It wasn't even remotely plausible or sentimental or reflective of teens coming to understand their sexuality. It was shoehorned in. But in Hollywood, if it's about homosexuality, we have to give it brownie points for trying. That's all that matters to them and the critics.But here's the biggest problem with the film: if you're going to make a film that's totally implausible and overall mediocre acting, you have to at least make it interesting. This film is boring. And there's not even close to enough quality art direction to make up for that.It's a slow film that's poorly done, but all that matters to the academy and Hollywood folk is that it's about a gay black kid with a crackhead mama. That's enough for them to drool all over it and call it the best thing ever made."
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2020,2/10,"I can see why some people appreciate and love the story of Moonlight, and also why others don't. I won't get into whether the movie deserved the oscar or not, as art is always subjective.Personally I found Moonlight to have great potential along with an amazing cast which did an excellent job. But sadly Moonlight was way too slow for my taste, I found myself wanting to turn it off at several points as my patience was simply wearing off.I can appreciate artsy movies, for example Mandy - which is extremely lacking in dialogue and is like a slow burning acid trip from the 80's, but still Moonlight wasn't my cup of tea at all. You are supposed to appreciate the silences, moods and gestures of the characters and Moonlight is indeed more about the mood, the feeling, the raw and simple story of man - which can be beautiful in it's simplicity. So I can see why it divides opinions, why it is amazing for some and a sedative for others.If you can enjoy and appreciate a simple story being told very slowly, with quiet scenes and pretty much with ""nothing happening"" for a majority of the movie, you should definitely give Moonlight a go, there's a 50/50 chance you'll love it.But if you know you're really not into slow paced flicks with barely much happening at all, you're better off skipping Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,23 December 2019,8/10,"Great movie, acting was good and the story is sad but interesting."
MOONLIGHT,12 October 2016,10/10,"This is a movie that deserves to be seen without knowing too much about it. I want to be brief about my reaction to this film, but what I really want is for you to know that this is a must-see film because it showcases a story from characters not seen enough in film. It's an important film not because it draws attention to race, but because it reminds the audience that skin color shouldn't be a factor in filmmaking (though there are exceptions, particularly with historical accuracy).First, I must applaud Berry Jenkins on his firm direction. He is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film away from conventional storytelling and offers the audience to connect to the film in their own way. The film is not about a black man figuring out his sexuality, but about how identity takes time to discover, something almost (if not) everyone can relate to. The performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and powerful. Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali are the standouts, both on the verge of receiving awards recognition. A standing ovation to the casting director!The soundscape is particularly impressive. It knows when to draw in sound and when to take it away, what type of music is necessary in the particular scene (bravo to composer Nicholas Britell), when to bring the volume and bass up or down, and so on.There is so much more to say about this film, but I want to leave it up to you to decide. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
MOONLIGHT,28 January 2017,10/10,"Well I think this is a superb film. There is great economy with the script and the directing but a great deal is communicated about why we humans are so often behave in ways that are disappointing.The main character, played by three actors as he ages, is a man of little words but rather wonderfully he does say exactly what needs to be said at a couple of key moments.There isn't really a clear good and bad in the film, the bad characters are so because they are frightened people and his is so true of life. The film communicates this so much better than I have.The directing is for the most part really exceptional. We move through the story in such an efficient and elegant way. Actually the directing is really rather stylish, but it stays out of the way of the story telling so you don't really notice it.From some of the reviews you might think that the film is depressing, but it is not. This is essentially an optimistic film as I think you'll find."
MOONLIGHT,31 May 2019,3/10,"I remember the Oscar flub with crowning la la land over this movie accidentally, it def should have stayed that way. I think the only reason this movie won is from the lack of diverse directors/cast and since this was one of the only talked about movies of the year that hit those two aspects, it won so the academy would not be called out.This movie is an absolute snore fest. They could have made a real, raw, emotional journey with the subject matter(s): a black young man growing up in a tough area, being mercilessly bullied, with a druggie mom and two strong adult ""strangers"" that were the only characters that help take care of him. All while figuring out his sexuality and what it means. It sounds good when you write it out like that, right? But the way they delievered the story, was lacking any real emotion or strong ties to our lead character, he barley says a word so you don't bond with him and everyone else in the movie is only in it for a small fraction of the movie so you don't bond with them. Juan and his gf were they only two that showed any heart and emotions, but as soon as they were in, they were out. They could have had Juan and his relationship shown, the only father figure he had then be killed or died, but instead this all happens off screen with a time jump. No love lost as a viewer there. Even Kevin, the ""love interest"" is a superficial feeling friend with sparse scenes and other than their beach encounter, there is also no real connection there to feel.This movie was incredibly boring on the lack of the things mentioned above, I think they could have made this into and actual Oscar winner vs a default win based on PC reasonings."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,7/10,"This is more like a 7.5 to me, but since I have to round up or down, I'm rounding down. I was disappointed in the story, but I have to say the cinematography and the acting were excellent.I was confused by the bulked-up appearance and overall look of grown Chiron (""Black"")--I asked myself, ""What, is Juan still alive after all?"" I thought Trevante Rhodes did a good job--his look just did not work for me in the context of the other two actors. (However, on a shallow note, may I say that Trevante Rhodes looked MIGHTY FINE posed on the bed with just the sheet...)I'd heard this was based on Tarell McCraney's life, and so I was expecting a more inspiring ending, with Chiron making his way out of the drug trade and into school. Instead, the movie is just one long struggle, leaving us wondering dubiously ""Where does he go from here?""It's not a movie I would watch again. But I do think the story Barry Jenkins envisioned was well told."
MOONLIGHT,6 April 2018,6/10,"This movie can be described at mediocre at best. I will admit there are some incredible scenes in the movie, but as a whole it is sloppy, badly acted and doesn't really derive to any conclusion. Let's start with the positives. I love how the movie is segmented into 3 chapters following the protagonist's life. Mahershala Ali gives an amazing performance and fully deserves his Oscar. Sadly, his on screen time leaves you desperately wanting more.The negatives. There is one GLARING problem with this movie. It is clearly a hard left leaning, SJW, LBGTQwhatever Oscar-bait movie which Hollywood LOVES and pushes hard as their ""stance"". They don't see nuance and their coddling of everything is like we're living in WW3. That would not be a problem at all with this movie, as Moonlight has clear merits. But the fact it won Best Picture is a clear indicator that Hollywood is trying to shove this message down our throats.The acting is overall poor despite a couple of well acted characters. It could best be described as shuffle acting, as if they don't have a clear definition of who their characters are in their heads while they're playing them. The movie's emotion is set like the steady sound of a dead heartbeat. Even moments that should have explosive impact feel like a little blip. It is overall too calm for the subject matter at hand. In conclusion: should this movie be a Best Picture winner? Not by a long shot. Is it worth a watch? Absolutely. There are great nuggets in this movie, but it is overall mediocre."
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2019,9/10,"Movie was a good one. A story of a guys growth, and him coming to terms with himself.
Was a hard watch, cos personally, I could see somewhat myself and my growth in the story.
Some unpleasant memories from past, and references to my own life...
The actors did awesome job portraying the characters in their roles and brought great depth to story....
Recommend to watch. Not easy story, but takes thought...."
MOONLIGHT,12 June 2021,5/10,I don't know guys: the topic is deep but the execution is not. I expected something more in-depth. Have nothing more special to say.
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2017,,"A hard and tempered love story that reminds me of my plants, the euphorbia milii or the crown of thorns. The plant is thorny and robust and bears surprisingly beautiful flowers. With that analogy, the film is a new twist on the gay subject for it is about being an oppressed minority within a community of oppressed minority. Like the plant, you instinctively develop strong protective galvanization to survive the hostile environment but beneath that defensive crown of thorns, love, which is beautiful, but delicate and fragile, it is actually the surprising, the hidden and the toughest champion for it will break through that thorny veneer and bloom if given the slightest opportunity. Superb acting all around especially the actors who played the different stages of Chiron. A most deserving winner."
MOONLIGHT,10 August 2017,7/10,"Moonlight is definitely a good film, it may very well be a great film. I just did not think so. It definitely captures the nightmare that school and a broken home life can be for many. The feeling of realism is captured as circumstance dictates reality for the main character in every aspect depicted in the film. The entire cast is excellent and in spite of it's long run time the pace of the film never becomes tiresome. The main characters struggles are both heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The open ended conclusion left me wanting to see more. I would recommend not being deterred from watching this film in the thinking that it may be a ""gay"" film or a ""hood"" movie as it is much more than just that."
MOONLIGHT,9 March 2017,8/10,"An honest movie human interest movie about a black boy growing up in a crack environment. Very well acted, not over dramatized. No artificial emotional thrills. A black boy is portrait through his younger years into his adult years with little support from his crackhead mother and some from caring people in the hood. This enables him to stand up for himself, although no escape from his surroundings seems possible. Typically a movie that might have a positive impact on people. A true Oscar winner."
MOONLIGHT,2 May 2017,,"I very rarely like best film nominees, and this is a prime example of why. In the wake of the ""whitewashed"" Oscars mess, the academy appears to be making a conscious effort to change its image. That's fine. More power to them. I only wish they had chosen a better film as the poster child for their reinvention, because, truth be told, there is very little to be praised about this film. In all honesty, there is very little about this film to be praised, save the ""groundbreaking"" use of a gay black man in the lead role. The problem, however, is that this is just the latest in a long line of Oscar nominees that were nothing more than a political statement. The Oscars are too white, so we'all nominate a film starring a black man, but since everyone seems to have forgotten that the winner just last year was a story about a slave, we'll make this new one gay too. Honestly, there is nothing special about this film. It may be well made, but the plot, the acting, and everything worth noting in a film is average at best. The sad thing is, I don't think I'm alone in this opinion. But because the academy has decided that it's job is to decide which films are the best social or political commentary and not which ones are the most enjoyable or most well made, we end up with this sub-par political statement as our reigning Oscars champion. Hopefully next year, the academy will realize what their job actually is in all of this and pick a movie that people actually enjoy. But probably not."
MOONLIGHT,26 April 2020,10/10,"A real complaint to bullying and the underworld. A film that opens your mind and that launches many messages as well as having an original appearance, almost unique in its direction."
MOONLIGHT,21 May 2020,9/10,"The film reflects a lot of problems, and all of these problems appear in one person, family misfortune, campus bullying, drug abuse, drug trafficking, homosexuality, also fully reveal the good and evil of human nature, a little depressed after reading. Finally, little's look back at the beach is unforgettable."
MOONLIGHT,9 June 2019,5/10,One thing for sure about this movie is they have the Miami crack houses down to a T.
MOONLIGHT,20 March 2017,3/10,I've seen many TV movies that were much better than this was. My mother could not believe how boring the movie was. The movie is only about 97 minutes long and thank god for that because the story moves along at a truly glacial rate and the biggest problem with the movie is that none of the main characters are at all likable.This movie disappointed me more than Manchester by the Sea. So much for the accuracy of awards shows like the Oscars or the Golden Globes.So who voted for this movie to get Best Picture of 2016?
MOONLIGHT,9 February 2020,1/10,"Don't waste your time. Bad acting and way overhyped nonsense. Just another token ""black"" film that won because nothing else was nominated. LOL"
MOONLIGHT,29 May 2021,10/10,"I absolutely ADORE this movie I think it is nearly perfect. I watch it usually in the middle of the night with my best friend and we both end up sobbing by the end. The writing is incredible, emotional yet realistic and subtle. All 3 of the actors who play Chiron did an incredible job, and the characters are complex, lovable, and flawed. It is an important look into a time and place and how a person's identities intersect in their environment. All the scenes on the beach are absolutely incredible, this movie is visually stunning. It is Miserable and gruelling at times but it is so sweet and wonderful and relevant. This movie is absolutely a masterpiece and a proud 10/10 !!"
MOONLIGHT,1 May 2018,7/10,"In a sea of one star and ten star reviews, I thought it would be nice to share my balanced and concise viewpoint on the film.The film is about a bullied boy's transgression into a man. The film gave a nice insight into a life of ethnicity-based poverty, drug addiction and social exclusion. I enjoyed the cinematography and the acting was superb. The script is often non-existent, but I particularly enjoyed the ability of the film to progress the story through acting alone. Overall, I liked the film. However, I soon thought about other films that I rated as an '8'. The film didn't make me question anything, neither did it wow me. It nicely reiterated what I already knew in a 3-part story. For this reason, I rated the film as a '7'. Watch the film, but don't be carried by the hype as some other reviewers obviously were."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,7/10,"I remember the 'good old days' when IMDb review forums had a more balanced array of reviews, instead of everyone rating something 1 or 10, and then adding politics. So I'll add some of that to the mix. This was my experience: I watched it post-Oscar. My reaction: ""Moonlight"" is that type of movie that is best appreciated as a ""hey, that was an interesting indie; it's well acted and I wonder what the director will do next"", instead of an Oscar winner for best movie and best screenplay. It's the type of film that I would have added to my list after seeing it show up somewhere in the Independent Spirit Awards, like ""L.I.E."", ""Our Lady of the Assassins"", ""Paranoid Park"", etc. It's stylish, it captures a slice of life, and it is mostly engaging. Unfortunately, like others point out, it feels under-done, like each act was cut short a little, and in particular the last act is underwhelming, and too much like a first-time screenwriter's autobiographical play. It's Oscar-winning screenplay is ironically quite short on story-telling, dialogue (yes, sometimes appropriately intentionally, other times just not very creative), and scenes that will engage enough.The cinematography is interesting, with a video-game like POV, floating over the lead character's shoulders from behind, inviting you into the action. There's some nice shots, good use of music (although sometimes cut a bit abruptly, and I would have liked to have heard more of the beautiful score), and a lot of use of the senses. Feel the ice, feel the sand, taste the food, enjoy the nightlight; it all feels relaxing, enhancing the ability to escape a grim reality into something more beautiful. Other sounds are blocked out or intentionally out of sync. I liked that Barry Jenkins was able to capture that.The first act has an excellent scene with a showdown between a surrogate father and an absent mother, which is also a debate about the drug dealer/drug user relationship. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are great in these respective roles. There's discussion of identity, acceptance, masculinity, and bullying. The second act builds on a climax in which the characters stands up for himself, literally and figuratively, and then takes on a sociopathic bully, who is one of this year's scariest villains. The third act tries to balance a charming but thin love story, while exploring identity, and the influence of our role models and life circumstances on ourselves.It sounds better than what it is, unfortunately. The trailer is great. But, again, the screenplay is underdeveloped. The third act is a different film, or perhaps needed to be shorter and add an additional act between that and the second one, to further flesh out the story."
MOONLIGHT,1 July 2020,7/10,"It talks about the growth of a boy. Restrained emotions, tolerant expressions, and a lot of blank space. The director left more room for the imagination to the audience, perhaps just to let the audience feel the same. Regardless of skin color and sexual orientation, this boy's perception of love is no different from ordinary people, ordinary and beautiful, delicate and gentle."
MOONLIGHT,5 June 2019,1/10,It was a big mistake to see this movie. and I don't see any reason for it to get Oscars over Lala land other than it is promoting the LGBT
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"I'm afraid I could not connect with this film in anyway. Whether it was the actors mumbling and difficult to understand or that there was very little happening (or both)that made it the worst experience I have had a cinema in a long time. Apparently, it was some pretentious offering which ticked all the boxes for the Academy which was suffering from guilt from the allegations of the all white Oscars the previous year. I cannot think of any other reason why it got Best Picture. Looking at the other ratings it is obviously a film that divided audiences. The Academy did not find a way to honor a film like Lion with any wins but gave this film the major award is mind boggling."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,3/10,"I am not a black person! Here you go, I said it first thing and probably not the best of opening sentences. And as a not-black- person, I cannot relate to where black people shop for their clothes because a young boy wearing the same trousers and white t-shirt all day, from being in school, being chased over rough terrain, climbed through fences, had food twice and slept in these very clothes and they still look brand new. I would love to know where these clothes were purchased, because I will get me some. And some of these women, boy-o-boy. No matter how much crack they smoke, it somehow makes them look more attractive. The crack sold here in Canada is different, you can usually tell if someone is using it, not just by their teeth. Yup, lots of attractive women in this show, also a tad different up here in Canada. And now a few words to the plot: there is no plot. It is not going anywhere. If you would like to watch a show that gives you a somewhat realistic display of what it feels like to grow up with people doing and dealing drugs, watch Training Day: completely different premise, but yet, you can feel the tension, the fear, the agony of having to grow up among people whose lives center around drugs. Not in this movie however. And to be absolutely honest: I grew up in a very suburban and 100% white neighborhood and I had friends that had a much shittier live growing up than that portrayed in Moonlight. And yes, numerous movies have been made already, This Boy's Life comes to mind, but none are so pointless or contrived as this. When I started my little rant I used sarcasm, but seriously, not every movie needs a plot, we have Lynch and vonTrier doing movies like that already and maybe there is room for more. And if you would like to specifically target 13% of the population that is fine by me as well, but please pay attention to details."
MOONLIGHT,24 June 2017,3/10,"After seeing the nominations that moonlight gets, I was so exited to see it but sadly it turn so bad and i wasted 2 hours for nothing, there is no story and no point of this movie and in the end you will get zero benefit from this movie. The only good thing about this movie is the acting and the poster design."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,7/10,"So I was hesitating whether to give this movie an 8 or a 7, but decided this way.First of all, I do not agree with all of these reviews saying it's complete bullshit you can bore yourself to death or anything like that.But from the other side it certainly does not deserve for a best movie award and is so obviously a consolation prize for the black community after last year's disturbance. Last year a much better movie, Straight Outta Compton, was skipped by the Academy almost entirely and now they simply wanted to somehow redeem themselves or simply get some peace from the racism accusations.Speaking about racism.. there's not a single white person in the whole movie, obviously if that would be the other way around a white producer would be accused of racism, but it somehow is okay in this case. And it has to be stressed that there's 72.4% of white people in US and only 12.6% of black people. These stats may differ for Miami or Atlanta, but still it's much less probable you won't encounter any white person than that you won't encounter any black person. And there simply is none in this movie - no one in the school, no one on the streets, no one on the public beach on in any other situation.Next, these three parts of the movie are far too incoherent. We definitely miss too much and especially the third part is not very credible as a continuation of the first two. So a skinny guy who spends his time reading books, watching TV and hates drugs because of his mother, he's kind of intellectual introvert, then becomes a complete opposite, because he spends some time in a prison. Hmm. And how much time did he spent in that prison? He hit his colleague with a char in the classroom, it was his first ever misconduct, he did it as a response for his bullying (which he would probably testify, because why not), his victim probably didn't get any serious damage from that and the movie suggest like he would go to prison for years for that.. and they haven't even bothered with hiring some similarly looking actor (face) to the younger versions of his character. The body can change, but building muscle doesn't cause your face to change for an entirely different type. He's like Ed Skrein in one episode and Michiel Huisman in the next.The characters are not deep enough.. what do you really learn about the main character throughout the whole movie, apart from the fact that he's black and gay? The same about others, we simply have some shallow roles - the bully, the crackhead, the surrogate mother, the father you never had, the boyfriend.The movie is far from dynamic, and believe me, dramas, heavy psychological movies etc. can be dynamic when they need to, but not in this case.It also doesn't depict anything specific. It seems to be a primitive mix of most of the motives that usually give you a movie award.I haven't yet seen La La Land or Manchester By The Sea, which seem to be the other most appraised movies this year, but I doubt they won't be better. Captain Fantastic seems to me the best film that has been skipped by the Academy this year. It's better than the Oscar nominations I've seen so far - Moonlight, Hacksaw Ridge, Arrival, Hell Or High Water."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,1/10,"Movie is about some boy (Chiron) who grows up gay in the projects, with an abusive mother, a fatherly figure who happens to be his mom's drug dealer, and having to deal with bullying until he grows up and becomes a drug dealer himself. He reconciles kind of with his mom and the movie ends with him visiting his old friend who he discovered his gay sexuality with. And that's it. There's nothing else that needs to be said about the film. You've just saved 2 hours of your life by reading this review. I'm all for character studies but this movie was pathetically boring. There's zero resolution to basically anything, we don't learn anything other than growing up in an abusive life is hard (DUH!) and trying to cram in motives, lifestyles, emotions, etc. into three completely disconnected segments (movie films Chiron as a boy, teenager, adult) didn't work at least with this film. I really don't understand why this was nominated at all. I think it's just because Hollywood got a ton of backlash last year from the black community and they just want to avoid BLM riots or some crap. Literally EVERY other best picture nomination (didn't see La La Land but not into musicals) was FAR better than this pile."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"Remember how AMC shows all the Oscar winning movies and the week before the Oscars and it's so exciting to see them? Well this will never ever be one of them. This movie is so poorly directed, written, and just a slow story of misery that offers nothing. It starts off depressing and ends that way. No arch and no story other than a bullied teen confused about life. Teaches you nothing, no moral, except how to walk out of a movie theater. SO many thumbs down."
MOONLIGHT,26 January 2017,6/10,"Okay, so the only reason I gave this movie a 6 was because of the hype the media gave it before the release. I was expecting this extravagantly made film that would touch my heart but it did the opposite. The storyline was of course relatable to a lot of people; a gay boy with a messed up mother, dealing with bullying and coping with being a man all at the same time, but the way it was set up, personally I just didn't like. The co editor Joi Mcmillon is nominated an Oscar for best film editing, and I give kudos to her for being the first black female nominated, but something about this movie just didn't sit well with me. I can say when Chiron finally reached adulthood, the plot got somewhat better, and when his friend(who he had one experience with) reached out, I just knew would start getting juicy. It just didn't. I did love the acting, though, there were a few of my favorite actors in the movie, I just really wish the plot was done a bit better. More action, more drama, more suspense. Something. Overall, big ups to your Oscar nomination Moonlight!"
MOONLIGHT,19 March 2021,1/10,"A few years or so ago, La la land was mistakenly named as winner of best picture at the Oscars. While La la land was far from the best film I've seen, compared to Moonlight, it was more likeable.Having recently watched Moonlight, I am puzzled as to not only why or even how it won the oscar for best picture, -plus a few other Oscars- nor why or how it got nominated. The pivotal question must be why was this film even on the radar?The story, (such as it is) in director Barry Jenkins film is divided into three parts.Part one is entitled Chiron, in which the characters, using mainly street language, talk a load of nothing.Part two is entitled Little, in which the characters, using mainly street language, talk a load of nothing.Part three is entitled Black, in which the characters, well I think you know the rest.Nowhere near enough depth was given to the story of two African-American youths who discover they are gay, and one whose mother is a drugs abuser.In my opinion, this is, so far, the worst film ever made, even trumping under the skin, and other users who have read my review of that film will know exactly what I think about it. Yes, Moonlight really is that bad."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2017,9/10,"https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-moonlight.html I had the privilege of previewing Moonlight ahead of the its' UK release date (17th February); a coming-of-age tale told spectacularly.Many modern dramas in this style tend to be artsy, pretentious and not to my tastes. However, Moonlight managed to tell this story with subtlety and confidence, without trying to be overbearing or arrogant.This particular depiction follows the life of a young black man from Miami, with the film differentiating between three key phases in his life - 'Little', 'Chiron' and 'Black'. Each phase is performed by a different actor, which worked to the movie's advantage - too often is a child-actor hired for a five minute scene just to jump-cut to its' prominent section of the characters' adult life.The movie bears witness to Chiron's childhood tribulations; overcoming intense bullying, dealing with his drug-addicted mother (played expertly by Naomie Harris), and coming to terms with his sexuality. Throughout the film, Chiron is consistently an underdog, partially due to his race and homosexuality, but mostly because he is a small, timid youth that allows others to figuratively walk all over him.Something I couldn't praise more highly is the films' cinematography: it is stellar. Calming or carefree moments in Chirons' life are reflected through soft and slow camera moments, whereas dramatic or tense scenes called for their well-used, rough, jarring shots. Scene transitions were almost always instant, until a moment of pure bliss uses a gradual fade to blend scenes.Moonlight is very subliminal with its' concepts carried throughout - an example being the change in nicknames for Chiron; representative of his choice of who he is, and reflecting childhood advice given to him by a character named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who he meets as a young boy.The acting quality was wonderful on the most part; Chiron's actors (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes) clearly studied each other's mannerisms to portray the characters' likeness perfectly. Kevin, the childhood friend, played by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland, respectively, was also portrayed well. Yet it is Naomie Harris who certainly needs commending; she was near-perfect for the role, and did an excellent job on her accent.The film did, however, have some things lacking. The characters of Juan and Theresa (Janelle Mon√°e) were prominent at the very beginning of the film, but shortly after lacked any presence - clearly only present for the purpose of opening the story. I also found a couple of scenes slightly unnecessary - one scene of a sexual nature was clearly only placed for shock-value rather than substance, and a classroom scene alluding to the HIV virus seemed irrelevant to the plot, but thrown in simply because the films' lead was gay.The film also lacked the kind of closure many people like - leaving unanswered questions as the credits rolled. Whilst a sign of intrigue and plot-investment, this also meant the annoyance of open-ended plot points, and left me wondering if the end was justifiable.All-in-all, Moonlight is an incredibly good movie, with great acting, lighting, cinematography and script. I was pleased to watch it before its' February release date, and would undoubtedly recommend it."
MOONLIGHT,29 July 2017,5/10,"I believe this film, while not without merit, was highly overrated. The acting was good. The direction was competent. The episodic development of the story was OK but hardly unique. The same treatment was used to much better effect in the Brazilian film, ""City of God"".I think that the reason this film received the Academy Award was that it appealed to a certain group of the Hollywood elite. It was not particularly popular in the African American community which it purports to depict. Not nearly as much as ""Fences"" which in my view was the much better film. The reason for that lack of popularity is clear. This story of the romance between two male drug dealers puts forth a misguided view of an ""industry"" that is deeply wounding many black neighborhoods, and which is much resented by most members of those communities. It is finally an effort to assuage White Guilt, by sentimentalizing a very squalid situation. The reason that the Academy Awards are becoming increasingly irrelevant is that an effete view now prevails in the Academy which insists on awarding ""niche"" films such as ""Birdman"", ""Moonlight"", and the never to be forgotten ""English Patient"", while passing over superior films such as ""American Sniper"", ""The Revelent"" and ""Hell and High Water"" which also have the effrontery to be popular as well. Despite its win this ""Moonlight"" was the least worthy of the films nominated last year for best picture."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,1/10,"Hard to expect anything good from the film. It is just another film where You don't understand the crux of the story till the last moment- why was it even nominated for the Oscars! The movie has 3 time periods, childhood, adolescence and youth. The protagonist is a very ordinary character of just another Afro-American boy who is raised by a drug-addicted mother. Nothing special in his story which would make the story interesting and there is no curiosity in the viewers minds about what is going to happen in the next scene. He is neglected by everyone in his school and his colony and is bullied every time. The role which won Best Actor for Supporting Role - Juan is himself a drug dealer and is seen to guide the little boy - Chiron in the film. Its a slow and sluggish film where I was waiting for it to end. I watched this film because of its hype of winning Oscar Awards and totally wasted my time. There is absolutely nothing significant in this film. There are brilliant actors and films out there and it keeps me perplexed, why this film won over them. I am crestfallen and dispirited by Moonlight's win over others. Indisputably, its an overrated film with undeserved awards!"
MOONLIGHT,15 September 2020,9/10,"Moonlight is definitely my best picture of 2016, for how much that statement is worth. I felt really close to the main character Chiron: he suffers at home, school, life in general is painfully dramatic for him. He's lost, he hides from himself, he must live up to the real man culture and to what other people already planned for him. So he did, but, in the end i'd like to think Chiron managed to live with himself, be happy with who he is and knowing that's enough.Juan(shout out to Mahershala Ali, what a beast of an actor) represent Chiron's only protection. He doesn't want him to follow the life he chose and wants to give him what his mother can't deliver: a safe home, but he couldn't manage to stop the cycle, as suffering is strictly part of Chiron's life and to many living in ghetto areas. It's not about living, but surviving.Also, the ocean and water itself is a big character in the plot. Purification, reborn, solitude. When Juan teaches Chiron how to swim it consolidate his presence as a paternal figure, swimming means surving. And when he meets Kevin on the beach a little bean of sun shines, it's good to know someone else might be on your same boat.The pressure, the antagonism and the castration on Little is definitely part of the ""macho man"" emblem. Blackness and suffering, you gotta be strong to stay alive, you must be a man, we know what that means, there's one definition, it's a standard and if you don't follow it, you're weird and different. So better be normal, or you won't make it out alive. And this is a warning."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,6/10,"Chiron is a boy growing up with his crack addicted mother in suburbs of Miami. One day, running from school bullies he meets Juan, drug dealer who with his girlfriend Theresa becomes shelter from violent outburst from his mother. His troubling childhood continues through adolescence as is his strange friendship with his classmate Kevin that could grow in a relationship. As Chiron is growing up and becoming man we witness burdening past defines gap between who he is and wishes he is. As film picked up excellent reviews and 8 Oscar nomination, I went on blind date with this movie and didn't want to know anything about it. Huge disappointment. Clich√© is written in too many places starting with characters tied up with screenplay. On moments you can guess what next line is going to be, symptomatically it will be confirmed with camera and music. So when you see sad character, you're going to have close up, violin in the background and Chiron saying I am sad. When it's romantic time, groovy Barry White like music will accompany Chiron looking madly in love eyes in close up etc. To the point of comic, and I am not joking. Shots of Chirons six pack that looks like gym commercial is not shot of man longing for physical closeness with other man. Somehow mysterious relationship with Kevin without anybody else in scene is not necessary sigh of troubled relationship, it is often a signal to the audience that it might be that Chiron is imagining Kevin, which I thought through the first half of the movie. As it is obviously not deliberate, it is fail in directing.Action takes place as it fits screenplay and because of that you have feeling as it has been staged, thus creating feeling of artificiality. As story composes of three chapters in Chieron life (boy, adolescence, man) there are many storytelling parts as characters inform others and us what they have done in the past, of which many we would rather see than hear about, as they seem more interesting than what we are looking at. Characters are build as clich√©s without any variety, so you see crack mother, suffering child and drug dealer with golden heart, not real persons. That makes actors go overacting and storytelling. Camera is intriguing at moment playing with sharpness on the edge of closeups, flares and neon style, but what is it worth when everything else fails to deliver. Pros is cinematography described above and physical look of actors as Chieron and Kevin have striking physical resemblance in all three different periods in their life.Seeing 99 on meta-score, more than positive rate from IMDb, and 8 Oscar nominations in acclaimed categories I rushed to see this movie. First time in my life ever I am positive to say ‚Äì shame on you Academy, as this film does not deserve it. What went through critics mind who should at least be bearer of our consciousness I also don't know. Movie which wishes to speak about homosexual growing up in African American suburb of Miami should not be automatically praised just because of its agenda. It should have been praised for its capacity to speak of love, truth, inner battles and society we live in. It was done in Brokeback mountain and Adelle. It was not done in Moonlighting, which is, at its best, average TV movie."
MOONLIGHT,19 December 2016,7/10,"""What's with the fronts?"" Kevin asks his old pal Chiron, referring to the ridiculous silver grills sported by the latter on his teeth. It's been many years since these childhood friends have seen one another and this swaggering, thugged-out dealer could not be further from the sensitive, introverted boy Kevin once knew. Or is Chiron's hard posturing just another ""front,"" as tacky a put-on as his mouthful of metal? Kevin asks him pointedly, ""Who is you, man?"" Such questions of identity are central to writer-director Barry Jenkins' Moonlight, a work of extraordinary empathy about the kind of character we seldom meet at the cinema. Young black men from bad neighborhoods aren't often allowed to be vulnerable in movies, and they're never allowed to be gay. Adapted from Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, the film tells Chiron's story in three clearly demarcated acts ‚Äì first boyhood and then adolescence, before this reunion with Kevin in early adulthood.""Am I a faggot?"" the nine-year-old Chiron (Alex R. Hibbert) asks Juan, a local dope dealer who has taken a shine to the hapless lad. Played by Mahershala Ali as a kind man who does bad things, Juan is stirred by the child's aching eyes and invites him home for meals, only sometimes to the consternation of his gal Teresa (Janelle Monae). ""You might be gay, but you're not a faggot,"" our oddly progressive Juan warmly informs the youth. The three form a surrogate family that provides blessed relief from Chrion's real mom (Naomie Harris) and her erratic behavior as a regular customer of Juan's. So beautifully gentle and nurturing are the performances of Ali and Monae that I enjoyed these scenes enormously without once believing them for a second.Years of bullying at school and relentless abuse from his druggy mom have already begun to harden Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) when we catch up with him just a few years later. High school is presented here as series of macho rituals ranging from absurd to cruel. The toxic masculinity even infects young, good-hearted Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), who carries on at great length about all things pussy even though he has far more in common with our protagonist than his yammering might lead you to believe. The two share an intimate moment in the moonlight of the title, before Chiron's life takes yet another tragic turn.The expressionistic flourishes employed by director Jenkins and cinematographer James Laxton seem intended to conjure a sensation of memory, shrouding Moonlight in something like the dreamy rapture of Wong Kar-Wai's movies and their lush pillows of regret. Problem is that I don't think either of these guys quite has the chops to pull off what they're aiming for yet (Laxton recently shot Yoga Hosers) and a lot of the oddly disjointed camera angles and shallow-focus tricks come off as more distracting than evocative. Ditto for how the film sometimes coyly obscures simple narrative information, throwing up another self-conscious level of artifice between us and the characters for no good reason.(Also, could someone please declare a moratorium on indie movies kicking off with a braggadocio unbroken long-take announcing the director's virtuosity underneath the opening credits? It drove me crazy in Hell Or High Water and feels equally obnoxious here. This is becoming a bigger Sundance clich√© than the end-of-the-second-act car accident. Birdman's over boys, you can stop comparing the length of your shots.) But all such quibbles dissolve in the film's truly transformative third act, in which Chiron is now played by the remarkable Trevante Rhodes and Kevin by The Knick's magnificent street-brawling surgeon, Andre Holland. It is here that Moonlight's theatrical origins emerge and we are treated to their reunion played out almost in real time. As demonstrated in Jenkins' first feature, 2008's winning, morning-after-a-one-night-stand comedy Medicine For Melancholy, he's got a knack for letting his characters talk their way around one other's defense mechanisms and insecurities. Even the filmmaking seems to settle down, allowing these actors to carry the scenes instead of goosing them along with trick shots. Like Chiron, the movie takes off the fronts.Moonlight has become an unexpected smash on the art-house circuit, I think because it's legitimately thrilling to see these two lost souls ‚Äì straitjacketed for so long by our poisonous culture's concepts of what it means to be a man ‚Äì at long last able to share a meal and speak about what could never be said. It's exhilarating to watch Chiron and Kevin finally just be who they are."
MOONLIGHT,19 July 2019,10/10,"OH WOW!!!! This is just an outstanding film in every way. My heart was aching for the pain that this young man was going through. As a man, I know the plight and recognized my own story in this film. OMG. Tear alert. Thank you for this beautiful film. A+"
MOONLIGHT,20 August 2019,2/10,"It just tells the life of a gay man.not worth watching except the first 40 minutes of the movie.Mahershala Ali performed perfectly,but the other guys is average.The last 20 minutes was very boring.I gave this score only for the first 40 minutes."
MOONLIGHT,23 May 2021,7/10,"This is a pretty good movie and pretty atypical. Unfortunately this only won a Best Picture Oscar due to giving in to the #OscarSoWhite crowd, for sure. How Liberal we are! And the director's idea of not having the three actors who played Chiron at different ages not meet, as to not pick up each others' mannerisms, was pretty stupid."
MOONLIGHT,30 August 2020,7/10,"Great cinematography, and important portrayal of gay black characters in cinema, puts the spotlight on a sphere we are not used to see.
The rhythm of the movie is sometimes slow and the ending could have been less obvious."
MOONLIGHT,17 October 2020,9/10,I've read some of these reviews and for the life of me I don't understand how this film could not have touched them. These characters were true life studies. This was as real as it gets. Don't miss the opportunity to see unless you are empty and enjoy fast and furious type movies
MOONLIGHT,23 February 2017,9/10,"No other film in 2016 so poignantly cast a light on a young man's quest for love than Barry Jenkins' masterpiece, 'Moonlight'. Based on the Harold Pinter play by the same name, 'Moonlight' tells the story of a young African-American boy, born into poverty and searching for identity in an often hostile environment ravaged by drugs and violence. What elevated the film for me were the moments of extreme beauty and bliss amidst the chaos and urban decay that surrounded the characters."
MOONLIGHT,18 April 2018,8/10,"I watched this In two sittings and was glad of the break. The three ages of the main protagonist all play their part excellently, and each in their own way shows a sadness and sense of being trapped with a secret that is unacceptable to the people around them, as a child, teenager and adult. Not a world that I've ever seen portrayed before which is why I think it is worthy of its accolades. This feels like an insider account of growing up gay in a tough neighbourhood.Brooding, challenging and sad but well worth the watch."
MOONLIGHT,9 February 2020,7/10,"I had been trying to find some time to watch this movie for a long time, and it being an Oscar winner, I had high expectations. I was a tad bit disappointed in it to be honest. I really enjoyed the early part of the movie with ""Little"" and ""Juan"" and their relationship. The problem for me is that time was too short- Mahershali Ali was great as ""Juan"", but he was only on screen for about 20 minutes and I thought the movie needed more of him as he is such a fantastic actor. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and the dynamic between mother and son was riveting; Ms. Monae was great as well, would have liked to have seen more screen time for her too. I think the weakest part of the movie was the last 30 minutes or so, and I don't really feel like we got a full exploration into Chiron's sexuality and life. This was a very good movie with strong performances, but I was left with a feeling of wanting to know more about these characters and their stories."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,9/10,"I actually watched Moonlight one day before it won this year's Best Picture Oscar in the most twisting way in the history of the Academy Awards, but I only got to review it now. The way it turned out, this win was completely unexpected, but probably not undeserving at all. Moonlight is a sensational tale that explores human nature like few films do. It is not as an easy watch as the ""Best Picture"" frontrunner La La Land or in fact any of the other contenders for the prestigious award. Nevertheless, it makes for a breathtaking picture if the viewers allow themselves to take the enthralling trip it offers.The story is split in three parts. The main character for all of them is Chiron, first as a young boy, then a teenager and finally a grown man. There's no conventional timeline, the plot just jumps from one part to another skipping several years. Moonlight doesn't try to tell a story, but rather showcase life with all its struggles and pains through the eyes of a black boy in a rough Miami neighbourhood. Chiron is a symbol for everyone growing up in a world they don't understand but being unable to escape. He is different yes, but aren't we all? Is it so difficult to find someone who really cares about you? Is it so bad to behave differently, to feel differently, to address sexuality differently? The film is as powerful as a film can get. Of course it is not for everyone, it doesn't offer the kind of light entertainment a lot of people look for when going to the cinema, but it has the ability to affect deeply in an emotional level if one is patient.The script was written by Tarell Alvin McCraney and Barry Jenkins (who also directed it) and it was inspired by their memories and experiences as young black people growing up in Miami. Surprisingly, it is Jenkin's only second feature film, the first being Medicine for Melancholy. His work in Moonlight is impressive. It is bold, aesthetic and clearly directed with careful attention to detail. The score and Mahershala Ali's supporting role performance are the icing on the cake. It's not that I predicted its surprising ""Best Picture"" win in the Oscars, but I really felt it was the only film that could rival La La Land. Overall, Moonlight is by all means a magnificent picture and I believe that the recognition it gained will give hope to many an ambitious filmmaker out there who's not looking for Hollywood's clich√© formula."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,8/10,"The movie that got the Oscar. You know, I was thinking that this review would be about ""La La Land"" (LLL) (I was also hoping for it to win ""Best Picture""), but instead is about a very particular, crashing and drama heavy film. What I thought when it ended was: ""like nothing new, but the big details about the story are making a really interesting and reflective difference""; one that makes it earn its recognition as 2016's Best Movie.I was hoping that by the time I would be writing this I would have seen both LLL and Moonlight (ML). But I can assure this: LLL was more of a technical success, and ML is a heavy packed story with a more palpable reflection. Now, let's get into the analysis. As I said before, I found it not that original: a boy who grows with a drug addict mother, without a father in a middle-lower socioeconomic status. Also, the boy suffers bullying in school. It sounds like the recipe for a not so deeply planned and designed drama. But, But! the difference relies heavily on this: Juan (one the most satisfying secondary characters of the 2010's so far), the boy is homosexual since he is ""Little"" and he is a young black man growing in a rough neighborhood. The heartbreaking story of how difficult can be growing up in those circumstances and having trouble coping with who you are and your sexuality.A tenderly crafted flick with relatable storytelling, impeccable performances, and a plausible direction. Juan is one of the coolest, likable and most instantly loved secondary characters from the last 10 years at least. Excellently portrayed by Mahershala Ali (a well-deserved Oscar). The other is Naomi Harris's impeccable personification of a drug addicted mother who apparently loves his son very much. All three stages are also marvelous performances from a skillfully selected trio of young actors. I say that the third one is the best, it demanded heavy, and heavy was Trevante Rhode's specialty. Barry Jenkins does a nice job in the director's chair. He likes to place the camera very near, especially to faces (without them coming close-ups); and to follow everything that's going on in the scene (to move the camera in every direction that is, instead of, example: letting it in a static position). The cinematography works perfectly especially in the nights, where a yellow tonality is added to the scene, working perfectly in contrast (black and yellow).It is a good movie, and I have the feeling that they did a good choice in the Academy Awards.MY FINAL CONSENSUS: A heartbreaking coming of age story that has enough energy and perfect realization for making it worth if its recognitions."
MOONLIGHT,16 October 2019,1/10,"Black history month, (insult number 1: for 11 months nobody cares) where people of all colours; silver, brunette, strawberry blonde petition to pay reverence to black cultural history which is really just USA-centric. I don't really see any awareness paid to Brazil or even the Caribbean for this month long homage which plays out in most areas as Othello being staged in theatres and this year, the TV premiere of Moonlight.The academy award for best picture has gone to quite forgettable films over the last few years: the shape of water, green book and moonlight. So perhaps the hype bestowed on Moonlight serves to it's detriment for a curious film watcher like myself.The idea that a story about two men who sort of like each other romantically is nothing new and has been executed in film far better than Moonlight many times, over many years. I felt this film was afraid of itself and so left lots of gaps that should have been filled in because the gaps were not pregnant pauses where the viewer's mind is percolating ideas etc. They were just tumbleweed gaps of nothingness, even coldness. My analogy would be doing a crossword but leaving blank the ones you don't know. How could it be possible that anyone else would compliment your crossword skills if you leave lots of it blank."
MOONLIGHT,29 May 2017,7/10,"There are some nice things to say about Moonlight. Firstly, I admire the film's attempt to go away from the effeminate gay stereotype not that there's anything wrong with it but its refreshing, the three age structure is somewhat interesting and tackles to actual issues with the black and gay communities. Finally Mahershala Ali is easily the best part of the movie. Now on my new view of the film, which was meh at first, now its a bit more positive. The first part, the best one, tackles the story of a young kid in the need of a parent figure. Even if this figure is an amoral man, there is a need for the protagonist to discover his identity, in this case in a male figure, since he is raised in a lower class and traditional environment, even if he is surrounded with a morally bankrupt society.In his teenage years and adulthood there is a concern with the issues of growing up queer in this society; with abuse, bullying and the need for companionship. Cleverly our main character turns into his ""role model"" but keeps all his issues formed from his past.I admit the structure and pacing seem a bit too slow for me, and for an oscar winning movie it's a bit too small. I understand the cultural relevance of being a black and queer movie, but... I wish it was on a more game changing film."
MOONLIGHT,6 January 2020,6/10,"Just like the headline says, but I'll dive in a little more. It started out great and just got worse from there. This is a story of a black gay man and his life in a 3 separate parts. I think they could of done more with those parts. It had its moments but it eventually ended on a low note. I base movies on 3 items. #1 does it inspire me, this movie was a 7 it made me want to be a better father so my son doesn't have to go through that lifestyle. #2 did it leave me awestruck, I gave this a 6 it was what was expected. #3 was it entertaining, I gave this a 5. Like I mentioned it started out great but the storyline was lacking and I felt like they could of done more. The other item that I was frustrated with was some of the cinematography. It made me dizzy and was frustrating to watch at times."
MOONLIGHT,3 February 2017,7/10,"The story is divided in three parts.First part introduces us to ""LITTLE"", a young boy who tries not to face his abusive crackhead mother. When he's helped by a drug dealer, in figurative way he finds his missing father and family.The second part introduces us to ""Chiron"", a quiet teenager and withdrawn, without friends, who is struggling the same problems. He's been a bully in school since early age and now bullies became even harder after he is homosexual suspected.The third part introduces us to ""Black, unlike first two parts, now he is a different person. A drug dealer who lives in Atlanta ...The Best thing about this movie is acting. In first two part as Little and Chiron, acting was fantastic. While Naomi Harris was extraordinary and thought she's gonna win Academy Award until I saw Viola Davis on Fences.Cinematography was great, great shots, great picture, great camera work. As a story, it wasn't extraordinary. I couldn't say I enjoyed the movie very much."
MOONLIGHT,16 July 2020,1/10,"This movie won a best motion picture Oscar ??
Honestly i've never even heard of this movie."
MOONLIGHT,17 February 2019,7/10,"I don't get it ! so many reviews state: "" a film about nothing""...""totally boring""...""I lost 2 hours of my life""...""bad acting""...""whyt an award for this uneventfult, pretentious crap""...""artsy fartsy"" etc.etc.
And then again: ""outstanding""...great actors and roles""...""an important piece of film history""...""incredible""...""beautiful and truthful"".....etc.etc.I liked the film. You have to have a kind of sensibility for this kind of film and the problems its dealing with. The first 30 minutes I got almost angry with that totally silent and withdrawn child and the environment he has to live in...but when you understand why things are what they are you begin to like the film.
Sure, I would have written some charakter-straits of some roles differenty. The mother-son relationsship is sometimes very irritating. Some things explain themselves at the end only-but I have to respect the writers and the directors point of view.
It certainly is a film you can debate for hours about, and it certainly does not meet the expectations of people with hollywood-blockbuster tastes and it certainly isn't a film for small town movie goers in the bible belt of the USA.
And I feel sorry for those lovers of gay films, who had hoped for juicier minutes. (no pun intented).
It's more an arthouse film for NewYork/London/Berlin audiences."
MOONLIGHT,10 October 2016,9/10,The ending is more like a European film ending than an American one - there isn't a nicely sewn up drawing together of the characters on screen ... it's more left up to the viewer to come up with their own ending.I loved the ending - but I can see some people hating it !The director was challenged in the London Film Festival screening as to whether he had considered another ending - but he said absolutely no way - this was the only ending there was ever going to be !Respect.The very mixed London Film Festival audience loved the screening - I've never seen so much applause during the Q&A.It really is a film with widespread appeal. Go and see it for yourself !
MOONLIGHT,8 December 2016,9/10,"Excellent script, cast, cinematography, costumes, lighting, and sound. Excellent performances from an all star cast! How do you tell a life story,without every little detail and play by play. Simple show what's important and let the audience fill in the gaps, which isn't hard if you're an adult. Many will call this a ""black film"" or a ""gay film,"" but I call it a great film! I know (and have known) so many Chirons and Blacks, that never get to the final stage of this film, and finally someone has captured all of the heartache, emotional distress, pain, love and awkwardness of growing up and living Black and gay in America. It was worth waiting for, and I look forward to an unlimited release so I can see it again."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,9/10,"This subtleties of this film cannot be overstated, but are no doubt not appreciated by all. Am I pleased it won the Best Picture Oscar over meaningless fluff like La La Land? I have to say yes. Is it the best film of the year? That, of course, is subjective. But in my opinion the depth of story and performances far outweighs the aforementioned film. It is not an in-your-face statement of what it is to be a gay black boy or man. It is simply a honest portrayal of one story of such however. Those who found it boring are probably used to action or melodrama, not the intricacies of film art or the human experience. Bravo to a well deserved recognition."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,9/10,"This coming of age tale explores a segment of the population - inner city black gay teens - rarely visited on screen. For that reason alone it is worth checking out, but what really draws the viewer in are the riveting and subtle performances from the main actors, and the authentic, gratifying script written partially autobiographically. This is a script that eschews all Hollywood and melodrama, and focuses in on the characters' humanity and decency. Every situation is presented naturally and in all its messy complexity, then the characters are given a wide berth to struggle toward a resolution, with wide latitude for making mistakes, taking detours, even dead ends as they slowly realize their place in the world. Along the way they learn to forgive themselves as well as the people in their lives who have been such a hindrance to them. This is an extremely rewarding film to savor and watch again and again for the great performances, stunning visuals and emotionally resonant story."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2018,8/10,"Low budject but with a lot of heart with 3 different actors playng the troubled child, teenager and then young adult, moonlight simply tells the story of the first two decades of a homosexual black kid from the Miami. The perfomances make the movie all of the ""Chiron's"" gave me goosebumps and almost make me cry, Mahershala Ali gives a good and solid father figure perfomance but strangely small part, i wasn't expecting him to just be in one third of the movie and Naomi Harris gets the bad mother of the year award. 
Three parts make this movie, the the early years that a child should be protectd from the bad parts of life, the teen years where you discover who you are in this world and finally adultwood where you reflect the path that you are going possibly to the rest of your life, and all of this is mastered perfectly by Barry Jenkins"
MOONLIGHT,22 January 2017,9/10,"WOW! Just saw what may be the best film of the year ‚Äì Barry Jenkin's MOONLIGHT. Delicate, lyrical, and movingly cinematic, it is a visual poem. It takes its time, and feels very ""independent."" Although the dialogue is terrific, the narrative thrust is completely cinematic, visual. And while character driven, the film poses big, weighty, universal themes like Identity, Sexuality, Masculinity, Family, and Community. (And yes, the initial Caps are intended.) MOONLIGHT is urgent social commentary that feels unbearably personal. It is a masterpiece from that dizzying, disorienting opening shot (with cinematic ""look-ma-no-hands"" bravado) to that delicately intimate close. The camera work, the musical score, the screenplay, the performances are all top-notch. These are the big stuff. But the small details are so skillfully delivered that they are simply breathtaking: the spiritual baptism of teaching a boy to swim; the loving preparation of a meal; the feel of sand on skin; and the blue-glow of moonlight reflected on black shoulders. Each shot ‚Äì each one allegorical ‚Äì beautifully rendered. I LOVED IT."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,7/10,"Meat Loaf sang that Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad; and that's the sum of this movie. It certainly ain't bad, but it isn't worthy of near 100% across the board ratings from the movie critics. Based on the first two acts it certainly is but the third act lets the movie down pretty badly to the point that it became overtly boring.Mahershala Ali was the standout performance. He really was great. However, with both his and Naomie Harris' small amount of screen time I wonder if there should be a minimum screen time limit to warrant an award nomination. Cinematography was mostly superb, although I felt a couple of the night scenes were filmed poorly with light continuously reflecting on the camera lens. The score was fantastic and brought great depth to many of the scenes. So in conclusion, whilst I was enthralled throughout the first two acts, I ultimately felt disappointed by the end of the film. As such, a Best Picture nomination should be judged on the whole and not just some of its parts. For that reason, I don't believe it should have won the Oscar for Best Film."
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2018,9/10,"I think I've been living in a bubble because I've never even heard of this film until recently. I've never seen a film where I actually liked the drug dealer, and then felt sad when it became apparent that he had died. I read the screenplay before I watched it, because I'm a movie nerd, and totally fell in love with it. Then to watch it was even better. Outstanding performances and outstanding film!!!"
MOONLIGHT,13 March 2017,1/10,"Complete waste of time and $$. This movie tackles nothing, has no depth, no story, nothing but 2 hours of extreme bore. I saw it because it won the Oscar for best film and heard some good reviews, including Emma Stone's Oscar backstage comments. As other people have commented, this movie just won an academy award to compensate for last year's complaints about lack of diversity and recognition for African American artists. But other than that, no merit at all."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,10/10,"Today, there aren't many movies that do something that very few if any films have done before. After the 100 years of films, many story lines, plots, and themes are absolutely exhausted. Why do you think that we are feeling such fatigue of superhero films currently. However, today, I am here to review a film that actually breaks many barriers, and that film is Moonlight. An independent release, Moonlight may not get much attention by audiences. However, critics have lauded it as one of the best movies of the year. Curious as to why it was so heralded, I went to check it out. Upon completion of the film, I wasn't sure how I felt about it. After spending many pensive hours considering the film, I realized that it not only did it meet my expectations, but it exceeded it. Moonlight follows the tale of a young, black man by the name of Chiron. He grows up in the inner cities of Miami. Chiron is pretty independent as a young man, taking care of himself while his mother works. He finds an unlikely role model in local drug dealer, Juan. Juan gives him some sense of independence, and in a way, takes care of him. Juan tells him on a beach in Miami, ""At some point you've got to decide for yourself who you gonna be. And let nobody make that decision."" The film continues to follow Chiron as he grows up, evolves, and shows how he struggles with multiple adversities. For the sake of spoilers, I refuse to give away how the plot unfolds, any further, but this movie deals with several difficult topics. One topic the movie writes so smartly is addiction. Naomi Harris, who is best known for her work in the Pirates of the Caribbean and James Bond movies plays Chiron's drug addicted mother. The character of the mother is based on the mothers' of director Barry Jenkins, and playwright Tarell McCraney, who's unpublished play was the basis of the screenplay. Addiction is prominent in Chiron's life, even as begins to make his own choices. In the world of men, fragility is not something often depicted. Traditionally, men in movies are shown as tough, strong, and unbreakable. This is especially the case of black men that appear in movies. Moonlight breaks this trend, by showing, a pensive, weak boy in Chiron, who is desperately seeking guidance and love. He seeks this through various outlets, including some homosexual ones, as he continues to grow up. The film is an important step of African American cinema, as I can't really think of other movies that depicts not only a gentle black man who could possibly be gay, but the film not once mentions the topic of race. To many, this could be perceived as ignorant of African American problems, but to me, it speaks volumes. African American women struggle with so much more than simply racism. It seems that Hollywood forgets this when making movies depicting everyday struggles of African Americans. Yet here is Moonlight, a wonderful masterpiece that beautifully depicts a young man's struggles. And yes, he happens to be black. Moonlight is not only an achievement of film, but an achievement of film history."
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2018,4/10,"Films like these makes me wonder and think that some producers are 3 year old kids who are in love with sponge bob and have not seen a decent movie in all their lives. It is a complete denial and very confusing, takes some time to understand and when you do, the question is why?"
MOONLIGHT,18 December 2016,7/10,"Those of us who are not poor and black would do well to see this movie if only to begin to understand what it is like. Too many of us still blame blacks with little understanding of the obstacles they face. That said, this movie tries to do more than was necessary. Chiron is not simply poor and black. His mother is a drug addict and he is gay too. This many issues simply muddies the waters. The movie is still fairly effective and worth seeing, but it could have been better if it didn't try to do so much. It may be the movie was trying to appeal to a black audience, that already knows what it is like to be poor and black, and felt the need to add what it is like to have a drug addict for a mother and be gay too. This seems to have gone too far."
MOONLIGHT,17 January 2019,10/10,"This movie is incredible and I simply can't understand who would and how someone could give this less than a perfect score. It is everything a movie is supposed to be. Timeless, emotional, thoughtful, and yet still entertaining. I don't think I've ever been more moved by a movie."
MOONLIGHT,13 January 2020,2/10,"I am perplexed as how the Academy thought Moonlight was even deserving of any nominations, let alone any wins. La La Land is way better in every possible way.Of all the movies nominated for Best Film for that year, Moonlight is by far the worst and most boring. It was painful to grind through."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,4/10,"i am a fan of Mahershala Ali, his acting was wasted in an extremely boring,disappointing ,bleak and useless two hours of my life.I can't believe someone will actually enjoy this movie!!!!! i can't even fathom how it became a movie!!! i need to write five lines to have my review printed and i can't think of anything else to say except that it is a boringly drab and lifeless film. i had my finger on the forward button all the time !!"
MOONLIGHT,24 March 2018,8/10,"The story focuses on three different periods of the life of a gay black man from a tough neighbourhood. These types of films usually have the tendency to come out as propaganda. But I felt that this film was an expression of the ""Other."" The rhythm of the film is slow, steady and calm. The speed of the film did not interfere with my interest in the story; on the contrary. The way this film was made was in tune with our main character. Some reviewers suggested that there is no character development in the film. I disagree, the way the characters were studied was consistent with Little/Chiron/Black. There are some unnecessary camera movements that seem ""for the aesthetics"" but I could disregard them for the overall of the film. I can understand why someone would be disappointed with this film, and why someone would love it. I am close to the latter but agree with some points of the former. Without spoiling the experience, one should try and watch the film with empathy for the main character and the world around him. Finally, I have to say Mahershala Ali is a brilliant actor even if we see him for a few minutes."
MOONLIGHT,26 March 2018,3/10,This was the most over rated movies probably in the last 10 years. brought nothing that other movies didn't bring and it was worthless this movie sucked
MOONLIGHT,6 January 2020,8/10,"The emotion vested within the core of this story is as gut-wrenching as it's foretelling on one's purpose from the creator himself. The subtlety of raw despair is often felt but left unsaid, due to the overwhelmingly troubling external forces surrounding Little. The altruistic actions of Mahershala Ali's Juan towards Little propel the framework to the very conclusion itself.Along the way-after some years eclipse-Chiron finds himself combating his mother's addiction and the trauma that is high school. Humans will undoubtedly rear the ugliest of forms, but Chiron travels towards an infinite discovery of his own metamorphosis. Sometimes an escape offers clarity, even though the shift in scenery is only but a temporary notion. Teresa.Black has reinvented himself in an attempt to shed demons from his past. While the bandage method has healed a few wounds, others-deepest of all-still remain. A call from a love thought to be lost shakes Black's very foundations-sending him on a whim back to Miami to unlock the very door inside the subterranean chasm of his soul.Be who you are-true to your heart. Don't allow the world to define your novella. You're the author-walk forward with your eyes focused ahead."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"Obviously the Academy gave the best picture to Moonlight because of the complaints last year on lack of color in film.This movie stunk. Not just stunk, but stunk to high heaven.Just finished watching LION. Great movie. Worthy of best picture. Haven't seen La La Land yet but I heard it is also worthy of best picture."
MOONLIGHT,26 May 2020,1/10,"I will be short, because there is nothing in this movie. Nowadays of you want to be nominated for an Oscar you need to have a black guy in the movie or a gay. If you have a black, gay main character - you will have tremendous success!
Really, there is no value in this movie, save your time and do something else instead of wasting 2 hours..."
MOONLIGHT,30 April 2021,8/10,Literally my only wish is that it was longer. I want more.
MOONLIGHT,28 October 2018,10/10,This movie is just about as perfect as it gets. I can't think of anything bad to say about it. Very very moving and Well told story.
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,1/10,"How this kind of cheap political crap could win a Best Picture Oscar? The answer is, it's all because it's a movie that is delivering the political message, we been experiencing similar political messages last 8 years at Oscars. But remember a film is all about art! What will you learn from Moonlight, how to sell drugs, how to prostitute yourself, how to grow up and become a wealthy drug dealer? I watched it ill, this is just another boring, low-budget, movie, that kills hopes of a young director and actors to be in a film that wins Best Picture. Instead, it shows ""even if we don't think so, we have to make politically correct decision to choose the Moonlight!""It's all about living in a hood, but I don't live in a hood, people need hope to live their lives, to build their families, to proceed in a career, to make new movies and become new directors. Moonlight is a dead end, again and again!"
MOONLIGHT,13 March 2017,8/10,"Moonlight builds its main subject with substance-filled chapters, acted by brilliant and compelling actors, in a rare fascinating story while dealing with difficult issues, race and sexuality, while fighting the pressures of life.This is Director Barry Jenkins' first Oscar Award winning piece, but before this, he's already known for his style, for he fills the silver screen with detailed masterpieces apart from it being visually captivating. He doesn't do movies for the visual pleasures, there's always a story behind every angle of his film.Moonlight is divided into three chapters, all with the lead being performed by three different actors whom all provided a soul to their character, Chiron.The first part is titled ""Little"", which entails Chiron's isolation as a kid, for different reasons like bullying and his mother being a crack addict. The second called ""Chiron"" where, in his adolescent years, began to question or be curious of his sexuality, and still the bullies in school that made his inner beast came to life. The third is ""Black"", a full grown Chiron, who is now a drug dealer, following the footsteps of his mentor Juan (Mahershala Ali).Moonlight is so grounded in its character development, but it never went dull. Every scenes is based on the character's perspective, which is filled with searing emotions all throughout without focusing other than its subject matter."
MOONLIGHT,11 July 2018,7/10,"I gave this five simply to be neutral but I liked much more than that. I don't give a rats about the Oscar. The obvious undercurrent of racism & and homophobia in the poor reviews is a bit unnerving. They seem to cover it with some comment about the slow pace or quality of the story, acting or dialogue. Film is art asome folks just don't get it. Better to admit that than falsely call something rotten. This film was clearly well crafted in many ways. Maybe not a masterpiece but not crap either."
MOONLIGHT,12 July 2020,7/10,"I mean, it was nice..and its not like i had problems with any aspect of the film..be it the casting or the performances or the script or the dialogues or anything really. It was all pretty good. It's just that due to the oscars and all that, I found it slightly overrated. But having said that, there's LOTS and LOTS to like here. I cant say 5 fave moments because I think all of it had a certain ""thematic"" viewing quality to it, which was even and thats what made this an experience altogether. But I loved the sequence with the little kid, and the one with Kevin.. which is like saying the entire movie. :)"
MOONLIGHT,14 March 2021,9/10,"Absolutely incredible, the picture, the emotion and the emotional growth and development of Chiron is awesomely portrayed. 100% recommend."
MOONLIGHT,9 September 2019,6/10,"After reading the reviews, and seeing Stuckmanns review on YouTube (a reviewer I nearly always agree with), I not only wanted to really love this movie - I expected to. But alas, no. Certainly it has some really good things about it - the cinematography is beautiful, incredible performances from just about all of the cast, but the story? I mean sure, it is meaningful and I guess important to a degree, but it was just a bit thin on the ground. Young boy, becomes a teenager, then a grown man - and he is gay and has lived a lonely life because of it. Not exactly mind-blowing. And it had one of those really frustrating endings - you know the type, the ones that just end and you are like ""Eh? Is that it....? Really...??!!""But as I said, it does have many plus points, and it is certainly worth watching - just personally after all I had read I was expecting to be blown away, and I certainly wasn't."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,7/10,"The theme of Dignity plays a crucial role in Moonlight. Without giving away too much, the little boy in the beginning of the movie finds, quite by accident, a mentor who shows great dignity despite his intense shame in dealing drugs. He clearly sees himself as a protector of the boy, perhaps knowing what he himself went through as a child.This lesson of dignity is carried through the movie. As a high=schooler, he tries hard not to react to his tormentors, but eventually he knows that his dignity cannot be permanently deferred.As an adult, he has a calm demeanor. He knows what he had to go through, and he knows he can smile a bit at where he is right now in life, even as he repeats the role of his mentor.His childhood friend also has his dignity, but he took a different path. He found a vocation he can be proud of and simplified his idea of wants and needs. He too has an inner peace despite not having the trappings that money provides. In ""Man's Fate,"" Andre Malraux's historic fiction of the 1929 revolution in China, a revolutionary is captured and interrogated. When asked why he rebels, he says it is for his people's dignity. His captor laughs and says there is no such thing as dignity. His response: that his people certainly know humiliation.... and that dignity is the opposite.Moonlight is the opposite. It is an un-film with characters and circumstances that we don't get to see in other films. It is exotic and at the same time wholly familiar in our expectations of inner-city degradation. But within that environment, even then, there are paths to dignity."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,10/10,"Seldom do I feel compelled to write a review, but I feel like this film deserves a better defense against the recent influx of disappointed ratings. I'll also do my best to explain what many users feel they might have ""missed"" because I think it's a shame to feel gimped or as though they wasted their time.First of all, plot and theme aside, the acting was simply incredible. Mahershala Ali blew me away with his performance; his character filled every scene and kept me clinging to every word he said. With his performance he brought to life the dichotomy of guilt and luxury that comes with being a drug dealer, and of compassion and reluctance that comes with being an unorthodox father-figure. Up to par with Ali in acting was Naomie Harris, who brought me to tears with her portrayal as Chiron's tragic mother (some might use a different adjective to describe her but that can be subjective). The three actors who played Chiron at his three different, boldly contrasted life stages also shone bright and I was convinced for the entirety of the film that every ounce of pain, longing, anger, confusion or joy that the character felt was real.But I believe great acting can only make for a truly great movie when paired with strong direction and cinematographic choices, and I thought that both were exceptional in ""Moonlight"". The suspense that builds when Chiron is in danger, the heartache that many scenes illustrate - all work extremely well to carry the film and move the audience in ways they might not have been moved before. The choice to divide the film into three distinct parts works to contrast Chiron's changing body, choices and situations, and I thought it was a brilliant decision. Also worth noting is the song choices, which, unlike a lot of movies made today, choose to strengthen the emotion and depth of the films' scenes rather than simply accentuate them.So what's the purpose, then? What was the point? Obviously a lot of that is up for individual interpretation, so I'll share mine. ""Moonlight"" isn't ABOUT resolution or satisfactory endings. It's about how life can shape a person, and within that life, the unfair situations and chance occurrences it can bestow upon them. We get to watch Chiron grow from a confused, lonely young boy to a longing adult with a hard shell, and while some may not feel the sort of resolution they do in other movies they are instead watching the culmination of urban hardships and internal conflict alongside radiant acting that makes the film feel real to the bone. Never before have I seen sexual orientation and manhood be presented and discussed on the big screen like this and it demands to be seen.""Moonlight"" is a story about a life, even one that could've unfolded right next door to you, and it is told beautifully."
MOONLIGHT,12 June 2017,8/10,"""Moonlight"" (2016) When I rented this DVD, I was excited to sit in my recliner, in my ""man-cave"" to watch the Best Picture of last year, according to The Academy Awards and The Golden Globes. I had read so much positive hype about this film; Metacritic gave it a score of 99. Geez Louise, that rarely happens! I knew very little about the movies, including most of its cast and crew. So, I went into ""Moonlight"" with pretty much an open mind, but came out of utterly confused; this could not have been the same film that I was prepared to see.Now don't get me wrong, it was a fine film. Did it deserve the ""best picture awards""? Did it earn a 99 score by Metacritic? My answer is no. Let me tell you why. The first one-third of the film was nearly flawless. Seeing the life of a nine-year-old son of a crack-addict mother got me emotionally involved. Poor Chiron endured terrible treatment by his peers and got no parental support until a drug dealer and his girlfriend took him in and provided some nurturing, though not enough.The film really bogged down in the middle when Chiron was a teen in trouble. The Miami ghetto was not kind to a black, gay man, but this was conveyed to the audience in a disjointed manner. I needed more organization and development of Chiron's relationship with Kevin.The last one-third failed to make a realistic statement and the life messages sort of ""petered-out"" here. Because of this, the movie felt longer than its 1 hour & 51 minutes.Lastly, I am almost embarrassed to comment about this, but I feel like ""Moonlight's"" best film award was an atonement by the academy to show penance for its past failures to recognize diversity in film-making. I'm reminded by the times that the academy awards Oscars in empathy to a nominee, (he's getting up in years and this is probably his last hurrah), or (she's the bone-fide front-runner, we just must give it to her for her years of service to the industry, which I term as the Meryl Streep 'Gushing Statue')I do recommend that you see ""Moonlight"" and make up your own mind. Oh, and by the way, I gave it an 82 rating on Metacritic."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,4/10,I haven't seen La La Land yet because I thought it would be a common boring musical. But honestly I don't think it can be more boring than this one. A story that could be told in less than 30 minutes takes 1h51m. Why really...? Also 99 Metascore...? This is not even a joke... It's really a shame for the world cinema to have this film as an Oscar winner.
MOONLIGHT,30 October 2020,,"Well it certainly hits all the right intersectionality buttons. As for the best picture, sure. It's better than all the others that were nominated that year except for..... All the others!"
MOONLIGHT,17 March 2017,1/10,"I was so hyped to see this movie after seeing such rave reviews from critics and friends but I was greatly disappointed. It had a quite interesting start but a plot you've already seen/heard/read before. From that on nothing happened that could wake up my feelings for the characters. Also, the photography was OK, but the shaky camera (that definitely shook more than necessary) made me just dizzy (slightly nauseous) which also made me loose focus on the story and was thinking more of my reaction to it. I mean I have no problem with hand-held/slightly shaky camera, check out work by Lance Acord (Marie Antoinette, 2006) and Bruno Nuytten (Possession, 1981)where they use it in a very subtle way that also give the plot and the characters the right edge without making the viewer dizzy. I felt like the movie wasn't trying to make a point beyond being overtly pretentious. I want something to touch me neither if I can connect with the characters or not, doesn't matter, what I want is a great study of the characters which I think Jenkins didn't got out of his actors in this movie. All an all, I think the movie is not worthy of the outcrazed hype around it. I have though not lost my faith in Jenkins, I believe he can get something better and make something better. Empty characters and even a more starving, echoing script won't make good pictures nor a great director or actor any justice. This didn't hit home.."
MOONLIGHT,5 April 2017,10/10,"You realize, I hope, that this inspired and inspirational film is even better than the cumulative rating here suggests. That is because the homophobes and racists have swarmed here on a self-righteous, self- assigned mission to trash this celebrated film by voting '1' in the ratings. If you are not sure, see it and you will know the praise and awards are fully deserved. I guess I can do no better than the person who said, ""I didn't realize how much I needed this film until I had seen it."""
MOONLIGHT,24 April 2020,1/10,"When you finish the movie you will have just one question in your mind ""How did this movie win the best picture?"""
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2021,10/10,Moonlight offers a remarkable and brilliantly crafted look in to lives too rarely seen in cinema.
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,1/10,"I have just watched this film after it won the Oscars ,well the highlight of my evening was pausing the film to go out and get a quarter pounder,fries and a milk shake to eat while i watched the last 30 minutes. The film had one speed ,dead slow ,the sound was so bad i could not tell what was been said. The first part with the young boy and his mother was interesting and well acted,but should have picked up pace.I can only think because of the pressure to give films with black actors more awards that's why it won a Oscar, it should not have been nominated. maybe it was a mistake to have been . The film critics always give good reviews for films a lot of us end up not liking maybe they get back handers (payments). I am getting fed up of actors speeches praising men and women of colour ,or brown actors ,,does Leonardo Di Capro say ,,""i would like to thank the men and women of white for this award...its getting too much ..If you want to see a good film that will keep you watching all the time see Hell or high water or Deep water horizon ,"
MOONLIGHT,15 February 2019,4/10,Slowest and most uncomfortable watch I've ever had. Artistic rubbish.
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2018,6/10,"It's quite a strange movie. I put a 4 first then I changed it to a 6 after a second watch. It tells the story of Chiron in three parts, as a youth, a teenager and a young adult. Growing up with a drug addict mother, meeting kind adults (I really loved Janelle Mon√†e!), and discovering his sexuality. It's a succession of scenes, of which some are hard, some disturbing, some cheering and some poetic (those kids playing on the beach while there's Cucurrucucu Paloma playing, enchanting)
The ending left me quite dissatisfied though."
MOONLIGHT,6 August 2018,5/10,Kind of went off a little over half way through... Liked the way it ended...
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2017,7/10,"Boo hoo I'm black. Boo hoo I'm gay. Welcome to the we're sorry for no black Oscar nominees make up year. It was actually pretty decent. The acting was really good in fact. But it in NO WAY deserved to even be nominated. More propaganda designed to make gay more normal. The whole story was ""I'm black so I don't have a dad, and I'm gay so feel sorry for me."" Sorry....nope."
MOONLIGHT,11 February 2017,10/10,"Can I give this movie 11/10?!? Finally a movie that really deserves the Oscar for best movie.I saw Moonlight almost one week ago and I am still mesmerized by this movie. Everybody should go to the cinema to experience this masterwork. Moonlight is one of the most beautifully told stories of this century. The film has a brilliant and beautiful way of using it's camera as a character. Every member of the cast gives a beautiful performance, as if they knew that they we're playing in a masterpiece. The three talented actors that play Chiron are all equally brilliant in their own ways of playing the character of Chiron.And what I liked the most of the movie is the slow camera work of director Barry Jenkins, the dialogues without much words and above all the captivating music of Nicholas Britell. I am seriously thinking about going to see this movie again within a couple of weeks. I have not done this since The Deep Blue Sea (of director Terence Davies), which is still the best movie I have seen the last ten years at the cinema.Some people say that the pace in Moonlight is a bit slow, but I like this so much and I have only one minor criticism actually: the pace is sometimes to fast, some characters deserve even more dialogues!Nevertheless: there aren't enough words I can say that will do justice to this film, so check it out at your nearest theater. You will not regret it, because Moonlight is a movie for real movie adepts."
MOONLIGHT,11 February 2017,3/10,"The photography of this movie is more than amazing, but the plot is really poor. Slow, predictable and specially there are many issues not explained. And we do have to believe this is a nice ending? It tries to be a copycat from Boyhood and even more, from Truffaut series... This year Oscar's selection are really disappointing. Teresa and specially Blue are interesting characters and then suddenly we do not know anything else from them. Bullying in the school is so often, I suffered... buy we then wonder if he goes to a special school or what happened? Moved to Atlanta? why? when? Too many gaps. Last but not least, looks really weird that Chiron can be the same boy from 17 to the last chapter (Black). The three actors play very well but the idea of the director of not making them meet for me is wrong... too different. Solitude is a way specific feeling."
MOONLIGHT,30 January 2017,8/10,"Light in Moonlight is beautiful, so striking that it seems to tell its own story¬Öwhich at times was necessary when sound and motion would take a hiatus from storytelling. This art-house Oscar hopeful had its fair share of dramatic stares, water metaphors, and violin music, but it also told a resonating story about a young man's relationship with himself. The film dealt with his relationship with a local drug dealer, his mother, and other boys, but what was constant was an introspective window at ""Little"", ""Chiron"", and ""Black"" ‚Äì names that also serve as chapter titles for the film.The Take: We're not movie critics, but we might be better. https://twitter.com/thetaketweets http://filmtake.tumblr.com/"
MOONLIGHT,11 February 2018,10/10,"2016 was a good year for movies. You got La La Land, Manchester by The Sea, Hell or High Water and many other good movies. A movie that stood out however was this small movie from A24, a studio that is known for its exceptional resume of independent films, called Moonlight. This movie won countless of awards, including the Best Picture award at the Oscars. 
The movie is about an African-American boy who lives in the hood. We witness his upbringing as he deals with countless of hurdles. One of them being his own sexuality. Taking such a strong subject, this movie was very bold and honest with its depiction of what it's trying to say. Some movies just wants to tiptoe around the edges of its own theme. This movie dives headfirst into its theme. There was one particular scene that showed two boys giving each other pleasure whilst sitting in a beach. It surprised me, to be frank, but I'll fool myself if I said it wasn't powerful.
This is what I'll call a movie at its purest form. It was incredibly powerful through its ability of visualization. The cinematography, the colour palette, the score, the sound mixing, the editing. These aspects combined into one movie that doesn't use much of dialogue. With the visualization of a confused boy looking at the other boys playing sport, or the one where a mother is scolding her child, but the dialogue was muted, all we got is pure facial expression that tells us more than words could.
 I know not everyone supports LGBT, and this movie may seem like an LGBT campaign to some of you, but trust me, it is not. It's not just about an LGBT person. If you could widen your lens for a sec, you'll notice that it is not an LGBT parade. It is actually about a lost soul in a familiar yet foreign land, desperate for a loving hand, desperate for comfort. I'm sure we could all relate to that."
MOONLIGHT,23 December 2016,10/10,"There are few movies that show the sensitivity of Moonlight; the boy who plays the role of the child Chiron is supernaturally good, as is the actor who plays the adolescent. Stand-out scenes include: a conversation at dinner when the child's protector, Juan, explains to him what ""faggot"" means, adding that he should never let himself be defined by others. The adolescent Chiron's upright posture and tensed muscles as he walks through the school, determined to wreak revenge on his tormentors. The conversation between the adult Chiron and his sorrowful, penitent mother. And the scene in the diner, when the love of Chiron's life makes dinner for him so tenderly. The possibility of love in the final moments of the movie do not close off the viewer's capacity to dream about what could take place in the future: are the doors finally opening for Chiron? Deeply felt and beautifully filmed."
MOONLIGHT,30 June 2020,7/10,"This is one of the smartest and most powerful movies I have ever seen.It's an innovative idea and passes useful messages from the friendship of Chiron and Kevin.However the reason I put 8 is because we didn't find out what happened to Mahershala Ali and as the screenplay is original and not true,I would like to see his performance more.Also the dialogues were a little bit slow.All in all very nice movie,it worths a view."
MOONLIGHT,3 July 2017,5/10,"Very overrated movie. If the Chiron was from Asia and Kevin name was like Pamela, I don't think this movie would have been considered for any Oscar.The three versions of Chiron are three characters that don't fit with each other, the plot is totally foreseeable, the soundtrack... what soundtrack? no soundtrack found.This reminded me of ""12 Years Slave"" case, once again an award given for the social impact of it, and not for the true value of the product."
MOONLIGHT,3 July 2017,5/10,"I really wanted to like this movie. I believed all of the award hype and I was looking forward to seeing it. That all ended about a third of the way into the movie, if not before. I understand that it is regarded as groundbreaking because of the subject matter--rarely are black gay men represented in media. I think these stories should be told and have an important place. But this movie did not live up to its hype and was not entertaining, all ideas about subject matter aside. I agree with other reviewers that said it floated along and barely told a story, the time line was confusing, and that the characters were poorly developed and that the dialogue was so pointless, that it added nothing to the story. I did not grow to like these characters because I barely knew them, I could not root for them or hate them. I feel like I could have watched this movie on mute and still have gotten the same message out of it. The idea of hating your crackhead mom is a stereotype and not new to media, and I was confused as to how when we first meet her she is dressed in scrubs and does not look like an addict at all, then a few frames later is she doing drugs in a car and Juan stumbles upon her as a customer. It seems unlikely that he went from never having met her to meeting her for a second time under the circumstances that he did. How long between these incidences? I also do not understand why Juan's girlfriends house appears under remodel and no one ever explains it? It was a distraction that added nothing to the movie.I felt a slight glimmer of hope when Chiron burst into the classroom and hit his bully with the chair. I thought here it is, surely this will set in motion events that lead to his adulthood and who he becomes. But no.When we meet adult Chiron, he is supposed to be in his 20s but he looks about 38 years old to me. Kevin does too when we meet him again, plus when he was a child he looked like a Cuban American or mixed race, but as an adult he doesn't look the same at all. So many of the features that made him distinguishable as a teenager are gone. We all knew where it was headed in the diner but why did Kevin call him in the middle of the night after all this time? There was so much left unsaid and I was loooooonging for it to be said. I kept thinking surely something will happen at the end to make all this waiting pay off and it will be so satisfying, but that moment never came. The movie just ENDS. These are just a few of the questions I have about this movie. It could have been so great and the concept is so good and so relevant, but the execution is so poor and lost on me. I kept thinking, did I miss something? All I can hope is that this movie paves the way for more stories like it, but better execution."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,3/10,"Movie of the year? Are you kidding me? This film is a complete waste in every way. No plot, no storyline and poor acting and directing. Right from the beginning it was obvious that this was going nowhere, terribly slow. Still, I kept watching hoping for a miracle that never came. Two hours later the movie ended and that is actually the ONLY positive thing that can be said about ""Moonlight"": It doesn't last for ever, although it feels like it!!"
MOONLIGHT,5 September 2019,9/10,"Becoming your own truth, no matter how painful, is forever a beautiful journey lit with moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,20 January 2017,10/10,"If you have not seen Moonlight go check it out. Definitely worth your time and money. This is a story about a Boy growing up with the struggles or his environment and sexuality. This film uses 3 different actors to portray Little/ Chiron at 3 different stages of his life. Without spoiling anything, Each stage of Little's/Chiron's life he deals with new and some of the same problems from his past. Each actor in the film are great; to highlight some are: Little's Mother, Teresa, Juan, and Kevin. The Editing of the film worked well and the Cinematography was great. The soundtrack/score or the film helped tremendously; the film uses music to give the audience a sense of how a character is feeling. Overall I give Moonlight a 9.5/10 . It's a hard life and a beautiful story."
MOONLIGHT,9 February 2017,9/10,"Sadly, LGBT cinema is pretty bad, mostly because almost all of these movies have clich√©s or depressive endings or sometimes even worse, the idea of 'stay in the closet for less suffering'...but this movie fill all my expectations of what I was looking in the genre.The story is solid, focusing on three parts: childhood, adolescence and adulthood. In childhood the protagonist, Chiron, has to suffer the discrimination in a neighborhood where the drugs are usual, here meets Juan (Mahershala Ali) after hiding from bullies. Later in Juan's home, he and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e), decide to dinner with the boy and after a bit of chatting they realizes that his mother (Naomie Harris) don't take care of her son, and also Chiron asks about sex orientation. Then in adolescence, Chiron continues dealing with thugs, but having a close friend with whom has his first experience. In his adulthood, Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) have to deal with his mother and for last he receives a call from his friend Kevin (Andr√© Holland). This sumarize doesn't has major spoiler.The acting performances was really good, from the young actors, then from Rhodes and Holland, also Mon√°e. Harris' performance was good too but reminds me a bit of the Mo'Nique' performance in Precious...For last, the acclaimed performance of Ali, in my opinion is over- hyped by the critics, despite he gives a good performance, only appears in the first part, having two good scenes.To ends this review, the movie is really good in acting performances, dramatic without being forced. Good in direction and editing, also for adapting the screenplay, deserving of their Oscar's nominations. So if you want LGBT movie with a different end and a touch of realism, this is a must see, but be warned, at moments the film goes slow, despite this, is one of the best of 2016 and a strong Oscar contendeer. I just hoping the Academy to be neutral."
MOONLIGHT,5 February 2018,10/10,Moonlight is one of the heart touching movies i have ever seen. Its simple and beautifully written.
MOONLIGHT,11 March 2021,10/10,"A look at three defining chapters in the life of chiron a young black man growing up in Miami. His epic journey to manhood is guided by the kindness, support and love of the community that helps raise him."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2017,10/10,"I started watching Moonlight after the Trump inauguration and the beginning of the movie seemed almost too dark to watch. Maybe I was just in a dark mood. I should have known better.I resumed the next day and was drawn in again. I finally finished the movie (on an industry showing) the third day and was mesmerized. Yeah, I know it's best to watch movies in a single sitting but this was such a finely crafted film that it mattered little. The moments, the deft direction and camera-work are something that film students will be studying for some time methinks. You can see the script, subtext in every actor's eye. This is filmmaking of the highest level. The direction was superb, the script deft with not a word too many. And the actors - the cast was astonishing. There is so much talent, so much depth in this superb cast - what an incredible ensemble. What an incredible movie."
MOONLIGHT,21 September 2017,5/10,"I saw this with a friend at the AMC Oscar Showcase. When it was over I said ""Well they killed two birds with one stone."" Politically correct qualifications - black and gay - both in one movie. I was sort of joking but it turned out to be true. It was interesting enough but not worth the Oscar win on its own merits, in my opinion."
MOONLIGHT,20 January 2017,9/10,"Have you ever met someone and wondered how they became the person they turned out to be? Moonlight answers that question for one man from the slums of Miami. The beauty of this film is in its subtlety. We are given a lot of information without a lot of exposition, which creates a perfect balance of wonder without confusion. Telling a story in this way requires flawless performances, as many of the most touching moments of revelation came not through words but through a look, an action or a movement. Even if you can't connect with the story being told you will be drawn to it. The film kept me in a state of tension the entire time as I watched Little/Chiron/Black struggle with the main antagonist - life - fighting against everything the world threw at him as he searched to find himself. I don't remember the last film I saw where I hung on every moment, hoping for the best and bracing myself for whatever came next."
MOONLIGHT,29 November 2016,10/10,"Moonlight is a cinematic masterpiece. Only a few films have attempted to tackle this subject matter, and none of them were as brilliant and effective as this one. As a film, it's a work of art, with gorgeous imagery and gripping camera-work. As a story, it's intimate, touching, and insightful. It shines light on a character struggling with his identity in such a way that no film has done before. It manages to strike a connection between this character and the audience, and we experience his life along with him. The acting transcends this film. Everyone in this movie gives a performance that is so authentic that an audience can easily forget they are watching a film. Moonlight deals with themes that are universal in such a personal way that anyone can relate to its story. This is a movie that will be remembered. It is a film with a purpose. If a film can reach perfection, this is one of those films."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,Watched this film last night after it getting best Oscar and it looked quite interesting on paper. Shame it didn't turn out as interesting on film ! The plot is totally incredulous and the film is very laboured. A shy weak bullied homosexual teenager turns into a hardened criminal after a spell in a young offenders home. Show me the boy at 7 years old and I will show you the man !! The film is badly made and very amateurish although the acting is not too bad. I felt no emotional contact with the events taking place at any stage in the film. How on earth is this the best film of the year. In fact after the Oscar presentation cock up by Price Waterhouse Coopers I begin to wonder whether the two idiots left and right of stage made a massive mistake with the vote counting. Can we not get a decent firm of accountants in to do an audit of the result ? !!
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,9/10,"When people ask me, ""What was your favorite movie of the year?"" I don't say Moonlight. When people ask me ""What was the best film of the year?"" I say Moonlight. This is a dark, gritty story that felt like it wasn't being told because anyone decided to tell it, but more like fate had been leading Barry Jenkins and company towards this their whole lives. The obvious comparison would be Boyhood, and it feels that grand in scope, but more timely. If you had told me that they filmed all of the iterations of the main character, Chiron, over a twenty year span with the same actor, I would have believed you. However, if there is one thing I will remember from Moonlight down the line (because it is a little heavy for a regular spot in the rotation), it will be Mahershala Ali. I loved Dev Patel's performance in Lion, and in many ways it was more athletic, but I would have turned off the Academy Awards after the first card had Ali not won. The scene at the dinner table could have been his only scene in the movie, and he would have earned that Oscar. That is all. 9.2/10"
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,5/10,"Best way to describe this movie, was, ""Get on your mark...get ready...get set........."" but no one said, ""GO."" Basically, great build up, but never took off. I'm black, and yes, I'm not ashamed to admit that I support my people doing great things such as winning Oscars, but this movie was NOT worthy. It was the GAY AGENDA that won the Oscar. Nothing against the LGBT community; but why must everyone portray gay roles to win Oscars? Hillary Swank...Sean Penn...Phillip Seymour Hoffman....Jared Ledo, etc. ALL Oscar winners for portraying homosexuals, and that's not right! People are whining over black and white, but it's not race that Hollywood caters to. It's homosexuality they cater to. That's like me eating steak, but my best friend is a vegan. Even though my vegan friend doesn't eat meat, I RESPECT that, and love my friend regardless. I don't shove my steak in my vegan friend's face, FORCING him/her to eat it. But that's the best way I can describe Hollywood and the fact that they force homosexuality in the faces of people who are not homosexuals. Hell, I can love and respect a gay friend; but understand, I'm NOT GAY, and I shouldn't be seen as a bigot because I don't give you an award. And Mahershala Ali winning for Best Supporting Actor??? WTF? Nothing against him, but he's seen in this movie all of 20 minutes! If anything, I would've given the award to the woman who played the crack head mom! Or Janelle Monae. At least they were seen throughout the movie. But Ali's performance was nothing different from what an extra would do. Not Oscar worthy at all. Again, I love to see my people excel, but don't give us undeserved awards just to pacify us! Moonlight was a bad PBS movie in my opinion. Not Oscar worthy."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,4/10,"I saw this movie in the cinema today, largely influenced to see it by rave reviews from some well-known TV pundits, and the fact that it has some impressive award nominations. I stuck with it, but found it pretty tedious. To a large extent this is because for me the dialogue was difficult to follow ‚Äì since it is mostly in a rather indistinct southern US urban style. Subtitles would probably help a lot on that front. But that wouldn't speed it up. It is just a fairly plot-free life story which is not very interesting (to me anyway). And by the way I found some of the cinematography to be unpleasant ‚Äì e.g. camera swirling round the scene in an apparent attempt to compensate for the lack of action interest. The film will probably appeal to some people e.g. if they feel that what they know of the story-line is of some personal relevance. My advice, though, is to wait for the DVD/streaming version so that you can switch on the subtitles and fast-forward where necessary."
MOONLIGHT,8 May 2017,10/10,"I was surprised this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, not because it didn't deserve it. It most definitely did, but because if the Academy had wanted to honor a film starring African-Americans about the black experience, they would surely have voted for ""Hidden Figures"" which was a very typical Oscar bait movie. That ""Moonlight"", a smaller picture, won gives me hope for the Academy.Roger Ebert once said that if you want to make a bigger point in a movie, go small. Make the experience about one smaller thing. Do not try to make a big statement. Make it small and personal and trust the audience to get it. ""Brokeback Mountain"" did just that a few years ago. It concentrated on one relationship and what happened in it. It worked beautifully. ""Brokeback Mountain"" should have won Best Picture instead of the atrocious ""Crash,"" but homophobia exists in Hollywood just as it does everywhere else. Perhaps ""Moonlight"" overcame that bias because of the fact that the lead character being gay was not as central to the plot.""Moonlight"" is truly a beautifully made film in every way. The cast members are phenomenal. The actors playing Chiron, especially the first two are wonderful. Ali was very deserving of his Oscar. Even though, he only appears in the first third of the movie, you feel his presence throughout. Harris is ferocious as Chiron's drug-addicted mother.The cinematography is perfection. It always amuses me when the Oscar for cinematography goes to a film set in the French countryside or in Rome. Filming beautiful scenery is not very difficult, but filming unattractive scenery and making it seem beautiful is more impressive.I really thought that if the Academy was going to split the big two awards, they would have given Barry Jenkins Best Director and La La Land Best Picture, but I am very happy it went the way it did.The final scene is moving, even suspenseful, as the two adult actors say so much without saying anything at all. The final shot of little Chiron back on the beach is magical. A perfect ending to a beautiful film."
MOONLIGHT,20 August 2017,2/10,"The problem with this movie is having an agenda,the world is full of people wanting to tell a story but don't have the platform.The motion picture platform is very powerful and effective,it should be used correctly but there are always going to be people who use it for personal gain,agendas,the even use it to mold the mind of people.This is the case of the latter,trying to push a personal agenda should never be the motivation for making a movie but we see it happen all the time.This is the case with this movie,i see a personal agenda laced with a story of young and middle aged males in the hood trying to find themselves when all they needed to do was research their history but this is fantasy being pushed as real life in the hood and the false hood of being gay and struggling with it.This happens but at this point if you are trying to help black youth the last thing they need is for a company to make a movie about being something other than what we should be striving for.being gay is NOT something you strive to be or do,how about making a positive movie about young black males succeeding in life so they can have a positive influence in their head after leaving the theater.Nothing good ever comes from pushing negative thoughts to people except more negative thoughts."
MOONLIGHT,11 October 2018,10/10,"I won't write a long review here so long after the event. But this movie is as close to perfection as you can get. Beautiful filmmaking, acting, writing, the whole lot. And whatever you might think about subject matter etc. this is a movie for everyone and you have to at some point in your life get your ass sat down and watch it."
MOONLIGHT,12 December 2018,,"Feels like this movie was given an award just so that the Oscars could say they're into diversity. This movie isn't really anything that special. And if you're wowed by this, congrats, you're easily entertained I guess. I don't know what movie should've won best picture."
MOONLIGHT,28 April 2018,1/10,"Horrible filmmaking from
beginning to end. Poorly shot, poorly acted, highly inappropriate, full of agenda driven content. Can we just get back to entertainment please??"
MOONLIGHT,22 July 2018,1/10,"It is baffling to me how anyone, ANYONE, could hand this film an academy award. We have lost our respect, adoration, and awe of the craft of filmmaking if we must start awarding and pushing poorly made films to serve the current political agenda. I'm shocked at this film."
MOONLIGHT,7 August 2020,,"When will people learn BLACK LIVES MATTER!!! Get that through your head!!! This movie has a wonderful story, great cinematography, a good cast, and a important message. 3 out of 10"
MOONLIGHT,22 February 2017,7/10,"It is simply another over-hyped movie but far better than the latter. It could've been good but is completely let down by the last half of the Third Act, which makes the entire movie amount to nothing meaningful.In essence, it was good for almost the 2 acts, but starts crumbling the 3rd act. As the 3rd phase of Chiron does not have enough resemblance or even make sense because there is a massive leap from second to the third act, making the 3rd act to stand on its own; unlike the Second Act which leaned on the First Act for enhancing the story.The best aspects being the first two acts; the acting is amazing with great theatricality. A lot can be said, but you really can't describe it, you can only feel it."
MOONLIGHT,20 June 2020,5/10,"It's the transition to adult life and turning out a different person that lost me to the movie.
I mean.. there are some good acting moments, but the plot is quite poor.
Obviously an Oscar winner for political reasons, but then again, the Oscars have become just a hoax show.
In that sense, it's aproppriate."
MOONLIGHT,5 November 2016,10/10,"Barry Jenkins' portrayal of identity, family, love, sexuality, and masculinity is all shown in a gritty and unsettling manner as well as being somber and poetic at the very same time. Its a wondrous work of art that displays a universal message of finding one's true self and how our own life experiences can create who we really are in the end. Its a story that's both real and raw, creating an environment that Chiron has to navigate in order to find out who we is inside of him, and I believe its a strong message that just about anyone can grasp onto.Every character is acted and portrayed in a way that feels authentic and real, without resorting to clich√©d stereotypes. The narrative feels unpredictable to the point where you have no idea where the story can turn at any given point. Barry Jenkins' direction and writing is simply mesmerizing due to an intricate blend of somber color pallets, stylistic visuals that complement the story, and minimal dialogue that instead, utilizes the stunning power of silence to evoke certain emotions. All in all, this is the work of an artist who put his talent and passion into his own personal project and creating a beam of hope for those struggling to find their way through the burden of life.Believe all the hype for this masterpiece of a film. I cannot sing it's praises enough and its one of those once-in-a-lifetime works that I implore everyone to go seek out. It is worth all your time and money. I can't get this film out of my head ever since I left the theater, and I have a feeling that this might end up becoming one of my all time favorites in the future."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,4/10,"Firstly I am not racist. I love most other cultures more than my own. Very much so. Particularly Asian. Very gentle and great manners. I understand there was a lot of resentment about the non-nominations over coloured actors last year. I really don't care much for the Oscars. I never watch it. However, I do watch all of the movies. The Oscars are par se. They mean nothing now. It is all politically driven and they needed to make up for last year's non acknowledgement of coloured actors. I don't care if they are black white purple red or yellow. It matters not. If the movie is great I don't care. Movies like 12 Years a Slave and the Colour Purple are terrific movies. This movie was good with the first two parts being quite okay. The third part was inconsequential. No explanation of what the lead role was doing and why. Trying to get people to accept coloured or gay people is so clich√©d now. I certainly accept them and most people I know do. Why make a movie about it. I have watched 6 of the other movies nominated for Best Picture and they blow this away."
MOONLIGHT,6 July 2018,1/10,I can't believe they choose this over La la land...
MOONLIGHT,19 November 2020,2/10,"Trite, slow and cliches abounding. My biggest gripe is with casting. Adult Chiron looks and acts nothing like his younger selves. I actually didn't realize it was supposed to be him, until his mother called. This is a talking head movie, fraught with unsatisfactory conversations that go nowhere. Writers and directors need to realize that every single shot and bit of dialogue must propel a movie forward. This movie sits in idle for 90% of its run time."
MOONLIGHT,6 November 2020,9/10,"Wow this was beautifully written and acted.
I didn't know what to expect but I was bowled over by the fine work of Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes as the younger and older main character Chiron.A life time of a hidden truth and the longing for that first love.You can see why it won so many awards. This is a movie for anyone not just a section of the public."
MOONLIGHT,9 November 2020,10/10,"Moonlight is the perfect name for this romantic, beautiful, black movie.Moonlight is different, it's love story is told through the sole perspective of one boy growing into a man, it follows his love story, his sexuality, and his growing years, and how his love has developed not only for the person he loves, but for himself.Moonlight is different because the audience not only understands the mindset of this growing boy, but in the beginning soon starts to empathize with him, wanting him to find love but understand why we cannot.Moonlight is not a traditional love story in any sense, it's poetic cinematography and storytelling through it's imagery of strong black men make this one of the most romantic movies of the 2010's decade."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2019,8/10,"Moonlight is a movie dipicting a real world in the USA and everywhere no one can exit from cradle to grave. The film shows audience a young boy life living in his pure eyes and heart not knowing what is going on and how cruel the world embracing his life is. There is certain breath he and audience can take in the commitment from elder adult male to let the boy feel the sense of being fostered and cared by other adult. He everyday learns that his life is still the same. He somehow has sort of equality of education, living and ""peace"" from threats at the minimum level in the USA. It seems to be ""better"" than other areas in the USA or the world in bloody conflicts or gang wars. The boy still tells audience the fact that there is certain places and areas in the USA or developed countries where a child lives in a life statically designed to automatically to end specifically in a vicious circle. And they don't know what it is even after they grow up until the time they face up with.
This is a film depicting what is going on in certain many areas in the world without gang war or military civil conflicts where many boys and girls are designed to end from the very beginning of their lives. They have any choices to take, have chances to find love but choices of criminal conducts to avoid felonies to survive. Still such choices are not depending on their wills but on their circumstances they fall in. Moonlight is not a movie simply about LGBT of African Americans but is probably the very first major movie telling homo sexual relationship a boy has purely sought and affairs boys and guys casually seek in bisexual and/or bisexual feelings. This is a movie seeking to tell audiences about the life without any choices but to survive to end in the USA or everywhere even outside of war conflict area.
Each sequence and each photo is sadly beautiful. Acting of all casts are very delicate and being seen as very natural, which is very difficult, as if they were living in the area parallely as movie goes on. Synopsis and direction both are well conscise to avoid dramatic feelings to tell the world as it is as much as possible as they can. All bring certain distant feeling to the film as if audience are just seeing every detail of distant life of a boy in a train window despite the fact that it is real in the USA. exquisite technique and sense of photography along with high skills of sound recording. There are many influences from director Won Kar Wai, Buenos Aires, Shanghai Express, FallinAngel in the music and the editing and photography. That does tell something to audience: for example audience who watched the movie Buenos Aires many times. And I think this movie is not only giving applause and homage to Buenos Aires but also trying to challenge to the film as saying like""hey that's nice to see happy ending in reaching mates who won't hurt you but I will show you sad and cruel ending in homosexuality and bisexuality in a town of this highly developed nation of the USA"". I guess. I strongly recommend this film as well as Buenos Aires and other Won Kar Wai films.
If you watch all or any, you will see what the films talk about: the films won't tell about LGBT but life and everybody on this earth, in small towns, male and female or transgenders beyond differences of sexuality and sometimes racial origins."
MOONLIGHT,6 November 2016,8/10,"Moonlight is not the best movie I've ever seen. Might not even make my top 10. But it is one of the best-acted movies I've ever seen because it is multi-layered and realistic. The story revolves around a young man named Chiron, who has a tough upbringing while dealing with bullies at school, a drug-addicted mother and also struggles with his sexuality. The story is told in three parts, and I really enjoyed the first part, which features Mahershala Ali, who is quickly becoming one of the most popular actors working today. Ali plays a drug dealer who befriends the young Chiron. The other parts are also interesting as Chiron grows up and evolves into a man who is still scarred by his upbringing. A diner scene in the third act is one of the best in the movie as the characters share a reunion that is joyous, yet awkward. The actors pull it off deftly, with most of the communication reflected simply with the eyes. I did have a few issues with the movie. I thought Naomie Harris was miscast as the drug-addicted mother. Her acting was OK, but Harris is British, and I can tell she struggled getting the black American dialect down pat. Why not an American actress? Also there is a ""Brokeback Mountain"" type of scene that was difficult to watch. At least 3 people in my theater walked out. It was even more disturbing because the actors are teens. However, kudos to the producers and director for taking a topic that has been done over and over (growing up in the inner city) and getting A-rated performances from mostly unknown actors."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2017,4/10,"I was quite disappointed by this movie, there is nothing special about it whatsoever. I can only think the Oscar nominations were driven by more than a little political correctness as the lead is black and gay.From the start it's so slow that a few coffees may well be needed to keep you awake. In Part 3 the lead is quite miscast and bears almost no relation to the boy in Part 2.The only saving grace - it's well shot with beautiful colours, that's not enough though."
MOONLIGHT,2 April 2017,1/10,"Best Picture? check.Mahershala Ali? check (big fan of his from House of Cards).A potentially unique story told from a so-far untold perspective? checkA tepid, slow, meandering, meaningless, sparkless two-hour bore? check.1. As mentioned, I really like Ali. But this was not within 100 miles of an Oscar-worthy performance. I suppose he looks and acts like a drug dealer, but aside from the superficial, he isn't all that different from ""Remy Danton"", lip-licking included. I suspect this is an actor ""tic"", frequently licking his lips, and imo an Oscar-worthy performance needs to be tic-less. Watch Viola Davis in Fences. THAT screams Academy Award.2. I have no issue watching movies about black characters. Or gay characters. Or Black AND gay characters. But I do have an issue watching a movie in which the protagonist is weak, passive, and way too quiet most of the time. I want to know how he feels. I want to hear his opinion.3. If you're doing a film in which there is a time-lapse, your protagonist should kinda sorta look like the same person in each time period. The 3 Chirons really couldn't be much more distinct, and it ruins any sense of continuity of emotion (if any) you've built for this character.Having said that, I thought the middle, teen Chiron was the most interesting and compelling, both in the actor's appearance & performance, and story-wise. I really wish they would have just aged him up. Let's be real, nobody changes THAT much between 16 and their mid-20s. The best part of the film *SPOILER ALERT* was when he was beat up by his friend and instead of ratting out the perpetrators, he marched through the school in a fit of rage and smashed the ringleader with a chair. FINALLY, some raw emotion, anger, venting frustration, action, etc. The film needed more of this, more of Chiron reacting to his environment.I can only echo other reviewers when I posit that this film's ""political"" content and characters lent itself very well to the awards season. I've seen a great many Best Picture winners, and so far this is the worst film to have won that award."
MOONLIGHT,5 October 2018,1/10,"Ok, we got this fine and simple story. But the movie itself feels not only shallow but also annoying. You can't enjoy it and even if you try you will immediately be distracted by a sudden piece of the most common classical music. Or a horrible and harsh cut between shots and different scenes. Or a poorly done appearance of the older version of a character. Or a weird camera work. Give me the screenplay. I will read it and in my head it will be ten times better.Pointless, boring and predictable. It's not romantic or beautiful enough (like ""Call Me By Your Name""). It's not dramatic or violent enough to show the ugliness of adolescence (""Everybody Dies but Me""). I've no idea why is it SO OVERRATED. It only shows some events on a timeline. It's about the characters who failed to develop the interest in them. They don't grow on the camera hence the viewer can't care about them."
MOONLIGHT,21 January 2017,7/10,"It's hard to understand all the relationships between the characters (main & supporting) of the film. Some are subtle (like Chiron and his friend Kevin). Some are ambiguous (like Chiron and Juan, Juan and Teresa, Tersea and Chiron). And some are ridiculous (like Chiron and his mother Paula). You may enjoy the complexity which is rich and plain to me at the same time.The film has three parts. The first two are better than the last, yet the last part is crucial and decides how the relationship of Chiron and Kevin ends. You may love the film in different ways. For me, the silence of Chiron (during the first part) is so beautiful that remind me how weak is our words."
MOONLIGHT,29 January 2018,4/10,"As it's Oscar season I've been working through all the movies that have ever won Best Picture. After watching this garbage I have lost all respect for the Academy and probably shan't bother watching whatever wins Best Picture this year. While I've had an account on here for quite a while, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review, as I want to warn people off being conned by the Academy and all the 'professional' film reviewers that, frankly, should be ashamed of themselves (98% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF??!!).The main character is extremely one dimensional and dull. It's as if the writers decided that his personality is that he's gay. That's not a personality, that's a sexual orientation! That would be like saying that Tony Montana's personality is that he's straight. The dialogue may well have been written be a child, as pretty much all of the subtext is spoken aloud; there's little by way of subtlety here.I give the movie a 4 as the acting is very good and the cinematography is pleasant and easy on the eye. I've got no bad words to say about any of the cast; they're doing their best with what is clearly some very underwhelming material. And technically the film is well produced and edited.This is not the worst movie in the world, far from it, but it deserves very strong critique if for no other reason than to counter the phoney, totally undeserved praise it's been receiving from so-called 'professional' reviewers. A film needs to be more than 'groundbreaking' or 'tackling tough issues' to get a good review from me. Before it is anything else, it has to be a good film. This film reminds me a lot of 'Rocky Horror'. People called that 'groundbreaking', but it was a terrible picture nonetheless.And I'm not afraid to say that this movie was clearly up for so many Oscars as a political move. It's a sad indictment of modern times that to rag on a movie about a gay black man would leave one opened to being labelled ""intolerant"" and/or ""unenlightened"". If a movie sucks, one shouldn't be afraid to say it, regardless of its subject matter and ethnic makeup of its characters.Do yourself a favour and give this film a pass."
MOONLIGHT,13 July 2017,9/10,"This is a beautifully executed film that tells the heartbreaking story about a young black boy struggling with his sexuality amidst other conflict. It is a coming-of-age tale done right. Wonderfully shot, acted, directed, and scored - everything is done tremendously well. This movie does an exceptional job of including the viewer in the protagonist's journey, and it's incredibly affecting. ""Moonlight"" is a triumph for the way stories should be told. It relies solely on characters and story to intrigue the audience, as they hold their breath until the very end."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,3/10,"Long boring passages where nothing is said, the main character stares at the camera or the ground. Many times the camera is right in the character's face. Scenes jump around and there is no real semblance of a story. We see three periods of a person's life and at no point is he interesting or do we care about him. I can't remember being this bored at a movie but this isn't any movie - this won Best Picture and having just watched it all I could think of was ""huh?"" Mahershala Ali is the one positive - he's great. Oscar worthy? I don't get it again - it wasn't like this part was some amazing part that showed great range but who knows. The Oscars are a joke anyway. If this is the best picture, I'll be walking on the moon soon.I was surprised that a great movie like Hell or High Water was nominated for Best Picture because it's actually a great film. You're telling me this is better? In what dimension?This. Movie. Sucked."
MOONLIGHT,14 June 2017,7/10,"There were slightly mixed reviews for veteran Hollywood critics Ann Elder & Les Roberts of GREENLIGHTReviews, but they both agree that this film stole Best Picture at the Oscars. Les was especially disappointed by the script because he feels as though he's seen this film many times before. Ann however thought that the film was very topical and empowering. It brings up lessons that need to be learned, and it was made only more brilliant by great acting and directing. They both think the average film-goer will not be too entertained, but Ann says serious movie-lovers should see this for its unique approach to film-making and the average Joe should see it for life lessons.

MOONLIGHT,18 May 2020,5/10,"It was watchable but how it beat Hacksaw Ridge for the Oscar is beyond me. Average story, cliched but well acted."
MOONLIGHT,1 May 2017,3/10,"It is a shame in this day and age that people can't even be honest with themselves, and in not doing so, do more harm to their cause than good.Simply, this film sucks. No story, no plot, no character development (at least not to the point you care about anyone, including the kid). Just one big dull moment.The thing is, that by 'fluffing' the piece up or saying it is better than it is just because it is a 'black' film it is like saying: This is the best we can do, and when REAL people watch it (not fake reviewers or people fluffing it), they'll say, ""Really? Well that was pretty bad."" And so, where is the real win?Had it not been for Mahershala Ali who I love on House of Cards, I would have wanted to give this a NEGATIVE 1, as it is, a 2 is generous."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,7/10,"Moonlight is a coming of age story about the struggle of being different in an environment which excepts you to act and behave a certain way. The themes are heavy but also light at times; giving a vibrate contrast between two ways of life. One with a mom who penalizes his son for drug money, and the antithesis: with a cool ""uncle"" who shows you more respect and love than your own blood.Like Lion (2016), the film keeps a realistic style while keeping a cinematic flare (note this is a very standard Oscar trope... often pretentious but sincere). One interesting note is the emphasis on diegetic sounds which is a fancy film word for ""real sounds"". Over 50% of ANY high produced film reproduces sounds in a studio to give them an ""omph"".While Moonlight is no exception, there is a handful of scenes which recaptures a sense of atmosphere which could only be heard at these specific spots: the breeze of the ocean comes to mind. I enjoyed Moonlight, most of it, especially if you like the subject matter."
MOONLIGHT,15 June 2019,9/10,"A simple, touching story, beautifully told by Barry Jenkins.Mahershala Ali is understated and just about perfect in Moonlight. Exquisite cinematography, too.Overall, perhaps my favorite movie of 2016."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,1/10,"I can't think of a movie that should have won Best Picture this year but this one shouldn't even have been nominated. I bet the script for this thing had to be 10 pages or less - there is so much dead time with nothing going on visually or from the dialogue. Plenty of time to get up to go to the bathroom without having to stop the video. The basic story has potential but like so many movies these days this thing just suddenly stops - there's no ending, no conclusion, no lessons learned, no redemption, NOTHING. And my last point: why do black film people make these horrible stereotype movies of their own ""culture"" which they always deny as being typical. This movie has the mother as a drug user and whore, the father figure as a dealer, at least 2 of the main characters having been to prison. Come on, I'm not saying every black story should be based on the Huxtables but this movie is depressing and hopeless. The Best Supporting Actor winner was sleep-walking through his role - the kid's mother had a much better performance. Skip it."
MOONLIGHT,4 July 2017,5/10,"More proof the Oscars are all political and going to give awards to movies because of political correctness. There is absolutely nothing great about this film. I do like Mahershala Ali I've seen him in several movies. The movie is boring, and only sadly reinforces stereotypes. Gay black man grows up in the hood. Mom is a crack whore. He gets beat up in school. I am surprised I sat through it. Only watched it because it was on Amazon Prime. I am glad I did not sit through this in a theater I would have asked for my money back. The Oscar should have gone to ""Lion"". For the record I really did not care for ""La La Land"" either."
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2017,10/10,"I saw the filming of this movie in 2015. I don't think anyone on the set even thought it is going to be on a big screen, let win an Oscar. The only bad things about this film is all the wrong mainstream attention it's getting. This is a very quiet film that is best watched alone, without knowing much about it. The word Moonlight here is a metaphor, for a bleak ray of hope for love and empathy that the protagonist tries to carry through a conformist society that wants him to be something that he is not. I like how this is not about a clich√© coming out or even coming of age. There is no happy end here. It a very wise, realistic tale about a timeless dilemma: Society vs Individual. Despite what big reviews are saying, this is not a film about sexual orientation or race. It takes place in Miami where most black people are not traditional African-Americans that live of north of Miami-Dade county line. Racial stereotypes is a moot point in this neck of the woods. In fact Juan is a Cuban immigrant who impersonates an African-American drug dealer. That mask elevated him in a society where he otherwise would've been an outcast . This identity crisis later mistakenly is inherited by the protagonist. The LGBT struggle aspect doesn't even exist here, as Chiron is not outcasted and bullied because he is gay, but because he can't conform to the labels of society that surrounds him. The homophobia in this film is portrayed in a more realistic light. Here it's a tool to stifle those who are introverted and empathetic. It highlights how mentally weak boys are in groups, and how apathetic the girls are when they are giggling during bullying, even though the bully is comparing Chiron to a woman, as if being a woman is degrading. Everyone knows this, but they will all go on about their business, while the victim will face a beating and humiliation. However, if he was a flamboyant and loud gay guy without any integrity, would he really have the same problems? In fact we don't even know how important gay sex is for him, because this film doesn't even try to reveal that, because frankly it's never important in his situation. He just wants to be left alone pretty much. His sexually curious friend on the other hand is obviously was way ahead of Chiron, as far as gay sexuality goes. He, however, never been bullied and never been an outcast, since he conforms to societal ""norms."" Chiron wouldn't feel comfortable in any collective identity since he is extremely introverted. This person will not be happy in a gay community, black community, or any other clich√© group identity where most weak people hide. He leaves us while he is hanging onto his collective ""Black"" identity, but his internal struggle to find his real self is making him a mental wreck at this point. Berry Jenkins actually said that Chiron and Kevin will never be together and that Chiron is too wounded by the society to build any kind of relationship in it. It is also a fact that the film was heavily trimmed due to low budget and many important factors, such as Juan's past and grief scenes over his death, were left out. There is an original script floating on the internet somewhere. In another interview, before the mainstream crowned this film as an LGBT/race drama, I heard how the cast was talking that this is a film about people who have not found their tribe yet, and less likely will ever find it. Indeed, I think the film is trying to show us that the society is pretty much a sewer system and most people are the sewer that flows through it. Those who don't conform to it, become either outcasts or impersonators of identities that will elevate them in the society, even though they know very well that this society is a sewer and they have a very little respect for it. And those who went with the flow of the society, at the end of the line will feel nothing but regret and wasted years, i.e. Kevin. This is a good mental flick with a lot of metaphors and philosophy. I don't know how it ended up at something as mainstream as Oscars and therefore brought these blockbuster audiences who will not get this film. They want Broke Back Mountain and 12 years of slave, but this quiet film is not even close to it. In fact if you like those, this film will put you asleep. Even though the cinematography was inspired by Wong Kar-wai films, this film actually reminds me of 80's cinema from the Soviet Union where I grew up as a kid. It was very art-housy and neorealistic, where you watch a pot on a stove for good minute and nothing happens, yet the aftertaste after watching these films is very long and strong. i. e. Little Vera 1985, Scarecrow 1984 and many more. Some moments in Moonlight also reminds me of House of Sand and Fog, and a little film Sue, where a woman is so given up on fitting in that she is loosing her mind from loneliness. Anyways, this film is good, it's just not designed for mainstream American audiences."
MOONLIGHT,1 February 2017,10/10,"Minute by minute ""Moonlight"", achieved to enter my soul into the burning world of the main character, Chiron. I could feel his pain and his everyday problems which were torturing his thoughts. Despite I have nothing to do with his way of life, that movie got me into him with the best and deepest way.Chiron's feelings and thoughts, are so powerful and TRUE, that he didn't even had to talk. With very brief dialogues (and many times without a certain dialogue),he managed to express himself only with his eyes and body language. His eyes were screaming but his voice was soft and calm.""Moonlight"" presented how hard can life be when poverty exists. Also, being different as a child can mean a brutal childhood like Chiron's who suffered not only from the bullies but from his own self too. He had nothing and that is why he couldn't find who he is.With a very authentinc image of black communities, the movie tells the story of a sensitive child, teenager and young adult, not certainly a gay person. He suffered an Odessey of self-discover.Finally, the only thing that saved him was his honesty about who he truly is. I believe that's the thing in life...Welldone for the great acting, scenario and music. That movie inspired me and showed me a very tough life but same time TRUE. See ya again at the Oscars."
MOONLIGHT,2 May 2021,4/10,"This is glorified as a beautiful story? Is this a triumph? Why is portraying the same anchors that drag a culture down played over again here, and it's celebrated?Fatherless child. Check.Richest person on screen is a drug dealer. Check.Drugs ruining a family. Check.Harassment of someone because they aren't ""hood"" enough, so they don't have a ""black card"". Check.Meaningless violence amongst your own neighborhood. Check.Refusal to report crime because ""Snitches get stiches"". Check.Violence breeds more violence and the result is incarceration. Check.Next person to become the richest on screen is the new drug dealer. CheckThere is no triumph here. Just like in the movie 'Do the right thing', nobody did the right thing. Nobody made themselves better.This whole film is a disservice to a community who wants to be better. What little plot it offers is mostly just a day-in-the-life, or maybe more accurately, a day-in-the-rut.How much better would this film be if it were about the first drug dealer taking the chance to acknowledge that his drugs were killing what was left of the family the young boy?I mean, there was literally a scene where the little boy makes the drug dealer acknowledge that it's HIS drugs that are ruining his mom's life, therefore ruining the life of the boy.And the result of that acknowledgement? ""Oh well"". Even the nicest person in the film, Teresa doesn't care enough to do anything about it.What if that was the self-reflection moment where he put the young boy on a better path than he chose and helped protect him from the harassment of his peers?What if it were about a person being a responsible adult and breaking a harmful cycle?No... instead it's just the long and boring unproductive daily routine of selling drugs and harming each other.What are we left with? Just the notion that we yet again get a glimpse into the lives of people who inexplicably refuse to make positive change for themselves and stay in the same cycle of doom.The homosexual angle just put another undeveloped nuance in there for no good reason.The only reason it got a 4 instead of a 1 is because I maintained hope until the end that a decent message would surface. It didn't, but at least I didn't turn it off before it ended."
MOONLIGHT,18 September 2019,10/10,Rich performances by every actor. A real pleasure to watch.
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,8/10,"I didn't like it as much at first but it stuck with me. I think it was powerful. My only concern is the casting. As far as I can tell, none of the main actors were gay. It remains to be a story about them, not us, unless we are included in the storytelling.Can you imagine an black, gay actor rising to fame because of this role and now having an audience and fan base? They don't cast big parts with gay actors cause they aren't big enough yet. How they going to become big? In this case, it wasn't expected to be as big as it was, even more so, then cast us! Yes, the acting was great. Maybe it could have been just as great or even better with actors who had been there."
MOONLIGHT,11 September 2021,1/10,"It takes hard work and dedication to make a film so artfully assembled a complete mockery of the film industry. The sage advice in this film should have been something people took with them, much like that of Forest Gump. The characters are made even remotely compelling by the skill of the actors, yet they are still missing so much. I don't have any idea how we can see a young black man grow up throughout three acts and still feel as though every character is underdeveloped and almost ""faceless""The movie is painfully terrible- it is as if we are the ones being hit by the chair- Lying on the floor, unimpressed, with splinters from a now one legged chair in our neck."
MOONLIGHT,25 August 2019,10/10,"Now to start off, I wouldn't be the type of reviewer to give a ten star review unless the movie really deserved it. This movie deserves it. No, no one dies, no large scale tragedy happens, but despite that, this movie will make you cry at the end and in various parts throughout it without adding a large scale tragedy.This movie shows the life of Chiron, a struggling homosexual growing up in the ghetto with a crazy crack head mother. In the beginning part it shows his relationship with his mother, who is disappointed in him because of his sexuality, his relationship with his best friend Kevin, the only kid that's actually kind to him, and his relationship with his mothers crack dealer, who cares for him more than his mother does.The second part of the movie fast forwards to him being a teenager, and how he is struggling in school with almost everyone. He is being constantly bullied by a group of homophobic curs. In this part, he also experiences his first time with his best friend Kevin. No much later on, Kevin bullies him along with the rest simply because he's surviving and doesn't want to be bullied himself. The second part ends with Chiron retaliating against the ring leader by beating him up with a chair. The attack causes Chiron to be thrown in prison for assault.The last part shows Chiron as an adult, and as a drug dealer. It shows that he's never truly recovered from his horrible childhood. In this part he meets back up with Kevin, who is now married to a woman. Kevin judges Chiron for going down the road he did. It then ends with Chiron confessing to Kevin that he was the only sexual partner he's ever had.Now this summary barely does this movie justice, as it is a very brief summary for how many layers were in this movie. I'm choosing to review this because I feel that it is under appreciated by viewers. I believe that this movie is deserving of a higher average than a little over a 7, this movie deserves at least an 8 or 9 average. I think it's truly one of the best movies ever made, and if you haven't seen, you need to watch it."
MOONLIGHT,30 March 2020,7/10,"I feel lucky. I feel blessed. This is art. I am thrilled to catch this film after so long and decided to write a review just. Coming of age movies are one of my favourite genre and this didn't disappoint. I wouldn't say that this is the epitome of this genre but hey, it got a story that flows so smooth, that you just can't complain. I rated 7 because it felt a tad too overlong in the end. But it was a beautiful end though. Recommended."
MOONLIGHT,13 October 2020,8/10,"This film is beautiful. It shows the struggle of sexuality, your race and people that surround you. It has slow pace and there are not long dialogues but this film doesn't need it. Acting is superb and storyline is phenomenal. The struggle in real life is real but for everyone out there don't give up, you're only getting stronger and more beautiful and do not care about what other people say just love yourself and do things that makes you happy!!"
MOONLIGHT,18 May 2020,8/10,"Only after watching the movie did I find that the sensitive keywords that were expected were marginalized. It was about the growth of a boy. Restrained emotion, intolerant expression, and a large number of blank space between the three acts, the director left more space for imagination to the audience, perhaps to make the audience feel the same. Regardless of skin color and sexual orientation, this boy's understanding of love is the same as ordinary people, ordinary and beautiful, delicate and gentle."
MOONLIGHT,20 May 2020,10/10,"This film, from start to finish, is a masterpiece - I'm in awe of every part of this film and how incredibly distinct it is from so many movies that came out during that year. The editing, cinematography, direction, acting, music, and script all come together so beautifully to tell such a powerful story about love."
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2021,8/10,Why is society so mean? Why can't we just accept and respect that some people are different? A life was ruined because he wasn't accepted by others and he couldn't be himself.This movie was really heartbreaking... üòû
MOONLIGHT,31 March 2017,3/10,"This movie started interesting enough and seem to be leading to something more but then just kinda ended. I thought it started off pretty good and started leading somewhere but then towards the end it was anti climatic which was disappointing considering how well it was put together in the beginning, it was like the writers were like how do we end this? and someone suggested well lets just end it here with no real conclusion."
MOONLIGHT,19 July 2019,8/10,"First let's get the obvious out of the way Trevante Rhodes and Mahershala Ali are two of the best actors alive today.
Sadly this movie was quite uneven. It's small budget showed like the patches in my knees when I was a boy.
But this doesn't let the writer and director off the hook.
First, too often watching it was just down right tedious. Sorry it wasn't setting a tone it was failing to fine one.
Second, the writer really didn't care if the audience was following along. Sorry, a good script shows the way, ideally unobtrusively, but guides the audience along. This sadly was disjointed and choppy.
Thirdly, it dropped characters not letting the audience know what happen to them. While it can be argued that this is permissible, it's obvious that here it was either laziness or inability.
Having said this there are several characters that are more than just interesting and, thanks to the great acting, engaging.
Also, there are several scenes that are very well written, but sadly these peaks of excellence are surrounded by too many valleys of mediocrity.
In conclusion, a film worth seeing, but again primarily due to Trevante Rhodes and Mahershala Ali (and the other actors) and not due to; director, writer or producer."
MOONLIGHT,18 April 2018,10/10,No other proper description. Truly portrays the importance of identity and nurturing relationships.
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,10/10,"WTF are all you haters on these days? Go review some super hero movie. I bet that kind of boring suits you well. Movies are the seventh art form are they not ? Art is created by an artist who discovers something admirable and then finds a way to present it to the world so that other people could admire too. Well this artist did just that, he presented some one's real life struggles in way that is easy to understand and empatize. It's is a shame people don't see it. Sometimes we can't see the emperor because we are blind. Most of the movies today are plain commercials in disguise with a team of marketing experts behind them shutting our eyes to true beauty and feeding our primitive desires hence all the more rampant consumerism."
MOONLIGHT,28 June 2020,7/10,"...there was hardly any emphasis placed on Chiron's love life - only the consequences of it - being bullied and teased for being gay. There are only one or two scenes involving sex - furtive and hurried. I did, however, enjoy the strong and honest performances by everyone involved in the film. Mahershala Ali deserved his Oscar and I am glad that the film won Best Picture. I hope that the next LGBT film with a primarily African-American casts focuses more on romance and sexuality of the characters and not place it on the sidelines."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2020,10/10,"I have put off reviewing this film for years because I'm not sure there's any way I can put into words how I feel about it. It is a perfect film.
And, look, I know that how we experience films is shaped by our own personal experiences and that no two people will see the same film in the same way and everything is subjective and blah blah blah... but Moonlight feels like it transcends all this. It has something to say that everyone can relate to. It has a beauty that even the crusty old men in The Academy couldn't ignore. It is pure cinema - the moving image used to explore the human experience, to present us with one person's life and ask us to see what they see and feel what they feel.
Sure, nothing really 'happens' in Moonlight, but in a way that's what makes it so significant."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,1/10,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But it was unwatchable. Not because of the content (which is what a lot of the reviewers seem to have a problem with) but because of the way it was filmed. The camera shakes, jerks, spins, rocks, and bobs, and every single shot is a close-up, causing the background to be a mostly out of focus blur. The end effect, for me at least, was a constant sense of nausea, coupled with headache inducing eyestrain.I had to listen to the movie with my eyes closed because it was so poorly filmed, and that ruined the whole experience for me. If the film had been made with a steadier hand on the camera, I think I might've been able to enjoy it.Hopefully the distributor will consider applying a steadicam post-production filter for the post-theatrical release."
MOONLIGHT,26 January 2017,9/10,"This film is an incredibly moving look at the life of a young black man in three stages of his life. The actors are amazing and each one offers unique insight on the way life turns out sometimes. This movie felt melancholy and raw... put your heart out there and squeezed it until you feel the pain and emptiness of a life that knocks you around and chews you up and spits you out. It also shows you that there are people out there who want to reach out to these damaged kids, who want to be the beacon for someone when they don't have much light to guide them. Really spectacular film! I am not sure if I want to go cry in bed for life's missed opportunities or hug the bearers of light in my life and thank them for showing me the way of the giver."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,5/10,"Watching a movie is supposed to be fun and enjoyable, the two things that I did not feel while watching Moonlight.I was excited to see this 2016 Best Picture especially involving an all black cast. I was expecting to see a fresh new take into the black community depicted in films, but all the excitement were quashed early on in the movie.I understand why some people think this is a masterpiece, but it is not enjoyable to watch nor is it educational."
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,7/10,"Probably, the most overrated movie from 2016, but the problem is not the undeserved success. The annoying thing is the reason why this movie won the so called ""The Best Movie of the Year"" award and it's pretty simple to think of some motives. First of all, the fuss regarding the racism from Hollywood and, indeed, it s true that Hollywood tends or used to give more attention to white people, whether we talk about actors or movies. Secondly, Donald Trump's election with every stupid thing he says and supports gave birth to a strong hostility from Hollywood and we have some real proofs(Meryl Streep's speech and other indirect attacks). There are many more examples and this movie is an evidence that Hollywood wants to fight against the political system which is definitely not a bad thing, but maybe it should take the cinematographic work into account more than other goals when it comes to famous awarding events. All in all, in my opinion, it's a pity that now movies constitute political means and Hollywood uses them with no atonement. People pay interest into Oscars and this movie doesn't deserve so much attention."
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2021,10/10,A truly beautiful movie led by an exceptional cast. A must-see!
MOONLIGHT,4 May 2020,4/10,The movie just went nowhere. One of the most boring pointless films I've ever watched. The camera work wasn't bad but there's no way it should have won any awards ever. What a waste of time. Such trash.
MOONLIGHT,25 July 2020,6/10,"A creative film in which there is a bunch of themes an symbols about masculinity, homosexuality and being black. However the story is more a made up of tropos than some good tale to be telled. The film makes you think and feel, but the story lacks of interest."
MOONLIGHT,14 January 2017,10/10,"One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I felt this movie's themes transcended race, class, gender and sexual orientation. The will to survive all obstacles and the need to love and be loved, to be touched, is a human story told so affectingly here against a sun drenched tropical landscape with an ocean view. The use of water as a metaphor for human growth or the soul, the unbearable isolation of young Chiron who wears his backpack like Atlas bearing the weight of the world, the visual and audio perceptions from the point of view of a child, an adolescent and a young man and the emotional truths so tellingly displayed thru-out this entire film make this one of the most deeply felt films I have seen. I felt like crying afterwards and nobody died."
MOONLIGHT,22 July 2019,7/10,"Regia=9

Interpretazione=9
Fotografia=8
Finale=7"
MOONLIGHT,30 August 2017,1/10,Ill keep it short and sweet. Another movie with a great message. It could have been so much better but it is boring dull and the ending is atrocious as well which is always the sign of a bad movie. Don't believe any hype or awards won. Another movie given a best picture award for its message although the film is awful.
MOONLIGHT,21 April 2017,6/10,"I'll start by saying that the acting was very, very good. Childhood Chiron barely talked at all but he uses his eyes so well to convey his emotions. Same with teenage Chiron, who talks a little bit more but acted so well with his eyes and body language. Of course Chiron's mom and Ali were tremendous. I agree with most other people that Ali's character, Juan, should've been in more of the movie.It was obviously a good movie. It had outstanding acting and was well-directed. I just think that the movie tried to hit a lot of different targets, and it ended up not really hitting any target. It's not a movie that focuses on the struggles of a black boy/teen/adult growing up in the hood with a drug-addict mom....but it seems like it tries to be. It's not a movie that focuses on the bullying that happens to this boy/teen and then his challenge to overcome it....but it seems like it tries to be. It's not a movie that focuses on a boy/teen/adult who is confused about his sexuality...but it seems like it tries to be. It's not a movie that focuses on the life-changing deep relationships that a boy/teen/adult finds...but it seems like it tries to be. And so, the movie touches on all of these different topics, but with no direction, and no outcome to these problems. Yet, the characters are intriguing and the actors portray them well."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2017,10/10,"When I saw this movie I couldn't stop thinking about it. It is amazing gift of art. There were so many great scenes in this movie it's hard to pick which is my favorite. The group of great African-American actors in the film was just groundbreaking from beginning to the very end. It's so super important for everyone to see this film and how it's like being a homosexual and being a black man.I can't say anything bad about this picture other that the fact it's timeless. Once you've seen this movie like I did, you can never let it go."
MOONLIGHT,12 May 2019,8/10,I thought this would be a rough film to get through. Turns out it ended up being one of my favorites of the year. So simple and so complex at the same time.
MOONLIGHT,20 May 2020,1/10,"I'll admit the cinematography was great, but the storyline, acting was just dreadful to sit through. I can't believe this won best picture"
MOONLIGHT,31 May 2020,8/10,"The strength of this movie lies in its development of the central character over time, and the factors that shape who he becomes. I did find some of the production methods, such as the random moments of classical music and loss of focus, at times inappropriate and rather pretentious."
MOONLIGHT,19 December 2016,4/10,"The many choices one makes about what scenes to keep and what scenes to lose went somehow wrong here. I'm guessing it was because they got some stronger-than-expected performances and decided to hold on to them, but they overdid it, and ended up sacrificing the story. You cannot build a film on performances alone.Important things omitted include -where was the boy's father? -what is Teresa's background? Is she part of this world of crime or is she a solitary example of an important character who is not? -what happened to Cuban Juan that he disappears after Act I? did a life of crime catch up with him? -how in the world did the boy from Act II turn into the man of Act III, which seems entirely improbable? There's your real story, regrettably not shown at all, and a gaping hole preventing this film from holding together.But in the most glaring gap of all, the boy's gayness is never shown. Very likely there were scenes filmed showing it, but apparently someone chickened out. I don't necessarily need graphic scenes, but just some scenes that show why people are taunting him, why he needs to know the meaning of the ""faggot"", etc. Way too much telling here, and little to no showing. In the end these problems often make the movie first puzzling and then yawn-inducing, especially in Acts I and II, and overall really keep it from being the best film it could have been."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,2/10,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I gave a 2 and not a 1 because the first 10 minutes the movie got my attention. It could have been a good movie but I think the director had no idea what to do and the scenario was absent.We watched the movie 4 friends together, each one with different tastes on movies. None of us liked it!"
MOONLIGHT,22 January 2017,,"never been a big fan of movies who touch let's say a minority in some places in the world. but this movie has that deep sense of touching something every body might feel. I'm not going to praise the direction or the screenplay because they were really great or Mahershala Ali's role as Juan whose the protagonist was influenced by through the whole movie. However, what i really grasped is the showing of the fragile characteristics of these tough men. the whole moonlight significance in my opinion is the display of the soft side of these black men even though they have to stay and act tough their whole life.""Running around, catching a lot of light"". ""In moonlight, black boys look blue"". this quote by Juan defines what the whole film is all about that in the struggle of life you find yourself and discover who you are."
MOONLIGHT,12 May 2017,4/10,"My mind got drifted away a few times during this movie unintentionally. It's a greedy movie which would like to cover most sensitive subjects on earth, i.e. drugs, black, family abuse, bullied kid at school, gay. The director made sure all these mentioned elements were thrown into the blender, and pressed the action button, then a messy concoction came out of it. I don't see how this movie won an Oscar, it's a mystery to me! Quite disappointed really, I don't get what this movie is trying get at, there's no romance, no heartfelt relationship, no nothing. Bland movie is fine, but trying to be everything and end up being nothing is a waste of my time. Actors' acting is the only thing worth mentioning."
MOONLIGHT,14 May 2017,3/10,"Warning: Review will contain major plot points, as I feel it is essential to get my point across.I had heard of this film when it got nominated for the Oscars, but never got a chance to see it in theaters. Good thing too, as even viewing it for free I still felt like my time had been stolen from me.""Moonlight"" is, simply put, a dull and unpleasant experience through and through. The actors do their jobs well enough, therefore i give it a three out of ten instead of a one, but decent performances doth not a movie make.I'll go ahead and summarize the movie in as few words as I can:Part 1: Chiron is a young child who is bullied because he is gay. He meets a father figure who is largely unimportant beyond teaching him to swim and giving him a place to stay when his mother is doing drugs. We don't see him again for the remainder of the film.Part 2: Chiron is a teenager who is bullied for being gay. His mother is still a drug addict. He has a gay experience with one of his close friends. The same friend is then pressured to beat him up by the bullies. Chiron comes back to school the next day and hits the lead bully with a chair. He is sent to juvie.Part 3: Chiron is an adult, and sells drugs for a living. He visits his mom in rehab and they have a touching moment (the only piece of this movie with any real emotion in it). He gets a call from the friend he had a gay experience with as a teenager and they reconnect.That is, unabridged, all that happens in this 2 hour long movie. What fills it in to make it last two hours, you might ask? Pointless scenes, for the most part, either involving silence or plot exposition that becomes irrelevant almost immediately.The fact that this film received an award for best picture over movies that actually had a plot is a travesty. This movie is the ultimate example of people finding depth in something that has none to begin with."
MOONLIGHT,19 January 2017,7/10,"this film was OK a 7.2 no more, so the story has three actors playing the life of one person why is it played here like it has never been done before.. Yes the acting was good, but the the best character wasn't used in part 2&3. 8.5 so this is better than Django Unchained, The Shining, American Beauty, Old Boy, Reservoir Dogs, Braveheart, A Clockwork Orange , Taxi Driver, Scarface, L.A. Confidential, Unforgiven, Raging Bull , Heat, The Great Escape, Die Hard, Casino, Gran Torino, For a Few Dollars More, Snatch, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight Rises ...... and this is just to name a few...all with lower ratings give me break!!!!!!!"
MOONLIGHT,27 August 2020,9/10,"A beautiful and heartbreaking movie with a simple plot but complex emotions. If you're more into mainstream movies and the blockbusters this won't be for you. This is an artistic tapestry woven with deep emotions, great performances, and excellent cinematography. The reviews that said this movie was nominated for awards strictly for diversity reasons are dead wrong; you didn't get the film. The film will challenge a few who may consider some of the subject matter too ""different"", or hard to relate to; but if you can look past that you can really see the struggle and beauty that these characters are going through. Give it a chance and open your mind!"
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,5/10,"This was from the start boring, it proceeded into more boring and followed with more boring. How did this film win an Oscar???? How was this film even nominated? Oh yes, I get it now, if it ain't Black or nor produced by African American's it is deemed to be 'dog poop' I stopped watching the Oscars a few years ago, namely the year that American 'blacks' decided that anything that 'White people' watch is racist, but anything that 'Black people' watch is the bomb."
MOONLIGHT,26 February 2017,2/10,"Yes, it had good acting. Yes, it was technically well made. But there's no there there. For us it never achieved liftoff. It kept plodding on and on, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing to justify spending two hours on. In the end (and at the end) we were left wondering, why is the end now? Why not 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after? Possibly a good movie for film buffs/critics who are tired of the same old thing, but for the occasional movie goer, we can do better."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2019,3/10,I only watched this because it won and nominated several academy awards and I almost like Mahershala Ali parts but rest of the movie sucksafter they chose Argo many years ago I find out that Oscar is a political award and doesn't related to art but I said myself to let this another try but I'm disappointed again
MOONLIGHT,6 May 2017,4/10,"What??? Tried to like it.Maybe a good movie if you are Black and Gay but that's about it. Because the actors keep changing, can't connect with any of them. Grown-up Chiron is not the same as teenage Chiron. Spent a good bit of time trying to figure out grown-up Chiron. The academy was definitely looking over its shoulder on this one."
MOONLIGHT,18 January 2017,6/10,"I heard the film from the code switch podcast. Both hosts, Gene Demby and Shereen Meraji, spoke very highly of the movie. They also showed the clip of little's mom robbing little (little is the nickname of the young leading actor). It is a powerful scene, and I couldn't let go the film because of it. However, I didn't feel much when I saw it in the theater. It might happen because it is the second time for me, or I lacked the background knowledge. As a foreigner, I didn't resonate much with the film, though It is definitely a slow-paced movie with lots of details. I didn't get the core until I went through the reviews on IMDb. The camera usage of the first part is good. It shows the depressing side of the bully. I really like it."
MOONLIGHT,5 June 2017,1/10,"possible spoiler alert SOOOOOOOOO disappointed in this movie. I had my mother over to watch this silly movie that won numerous awards for some odd reason. THE HELP, great movie, THE COLOR PURPLE, great movie. This piece of Hollywood garbage is not a good movie. I did not understand the plot, all the stupidity in the movie. I don't want to give anything away in case you decide to waste a couple of hours of your life on this crap movie but be warned it is a stupid movie"
MOONLIGHT,12 April 2017,10/10,Moonlight is a slow moving emotional drama movie which will haunt you ever since. The story of a troubled teenager in a tough neighborhood which digs deeper when he grow old and when he finds out more and more about himself. As he grow old he lack love and affection which he should get from his parents. This in fact will affect him in a lot of ways. The director have played his part very well in depicting all the emotions in the screen. Naomi and Ali have given their all time good performance which surely require an academy award recognition. We cannot say any wrong about anything with related to this movie whether its the screenplay or direction or even the background score. Moonlight is surely a wonderful movie but it will always be a sad glimpse at a lonely childhood and how hard it is for children.
MOONLIGHT,20 December 2016,,"This splendid sophomore effort from writer-director Barry Jenkins is a tale of everyday African-Americans in which white people have no say. Well, someone is behind the fixed impoverishment of whole neighbourhoods facing the otherwise replenishing beaches of Miami, where most of this tripartite story about one young Florida man takes place.Set in the 1980s, the first chapter of Moonlight is, like the others, named after the handle our main character currently goes by. A local don of much respect named Juan (House of Cards' impressive Mahershala Ali) dubs him ""Little"" when he spots the spindly kid (Alex Hibbert) running away from schoolmates seemingly intent on beating him for being ""different"".Little has trouble with his too-young mother (Skyfall's U.K.‚Äìbased Naomie Harris), currently escaping into the new world of crack cocaine. The alternative home provided by Juan and his bohemian girlfriend (singer Janelle Mon√°e) provides something solid, even if this is compromised by the older man's dubious profession.Despite his macho swagger, Juan has the most apt answer to the boy's anxious request to define faggot: ""It's a word people say to make gay people feel bad about themselves."" There's a small sag when Ali leaves the building. But the next section features tightly wound Ashton Sanders as the teenage Little, now using his given name, Chiron. He's also called ""Black"" by the light-skinned Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), the only boy who shows real interest.The movie could have survived without the overly familiar bullying subplot, although this does take Chiron (now played by Trevante Rhodes) into a massively toughened-up present, complete with gold fronts and a Detroit ride just like Juan's. Jenkins lets the scenes play out with organic ease, and cinematographer James Laxton physicalizes the locations with a kind of off-kilter poetry. Stereotypes are pushed aside here as men make their own ways through the minefield of masculinity in battleground America."
MOONLIGHT,5 May 2019,2/10,"I know this movie won Oscars and gets some really good reviews, but I just couldn't get into it. One of the few films I almost walked out of the cinema on."
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,7/10,"Moonlight is an OK movie, acting and plot are consistent, yet there are no surprises, no twists. It's a story that we have already heard of o read. It's not an Oscar winner in no way. if you like this kind of life's stories you won't be disappointed. Watch it, enjoy it but don't expect to go to bed thinking about this movie. OK movie, not an Oscar movie."
MOONLIGHT,23 May 2017,4/10,"I am baffled as to why this has received so many high reviews. Yes it was pleasant but frankly it is hyped because it is about a black person. Yes I am all for equality but wow this film is truly over rated. I can only imagine how bad the other nominated films were if this won the award. Also, it is disappointing that a black actor wins the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when playing a drug dealer. Equality? Please......"
MOONLIGHT,2 May 2018,8/10,"First time I watched this movie I didn't know what to expect. I really liked the cinematography and music from the start. Actors were also good. This movie did a great job in all those aspects. I didn't know anything about the plot prior and was pretty surprised about him being gay. I just wasn't expecting the movie to go there. Anyways it came as a surprise and I think I didn't enjoy the movie as much because it came about kind of randomly. I ended up watching the movie again later on and this time I really enjoyed it. I noticed all the production a lot more and really loved it. I could also understand his story and struggle a lot more knowing that he was fighting with this from the beginning of the movie. Anyways, the whole production was just beautiful. I understand why this movie did so well. It has nothing to do with them doing something edgy by casting a black gay dude. The whole production was amazing and that's why this movie deserves the awards it got."
MOONLIGHT,6 May 2019,10/10,Every single solitary piece of this movie is masterful. I won't say anything more then WATCG THIS FILM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
MOONLIGHT,13 May 2019,9/10,"A heavily Oscar crafted indie film that definitely isn't for everybody. But this is what you get with company A24. The performances are spectacular, the directing is sharp, and it knows exactly what it wants to be. If your looking for those elements along with a boring film with thin consistency, no story to tell, weak writing, and characters that are difficult to relate to. Even for the LGBTs, than this is the film for you. For everyone else, it is not really their cup of tea."
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2019,7/10,"This is not a very different kind of hood movie. It focuses on the tough upbringing of a boy in the streets of Miami, rather than a lot of street violence and drugs. There isn't actually as much going on as you would expect. And some moments are long. But Moonlight manages to also have some powerful moments, and the cast are all pretty good. It deals with themes such as homosexuality, Afro-American identity and social classes. Which is why it won the Academy Award for beat picture. It's a sometimes touching flick and overall a good and very smart movie. Recommended!!"
MOONLIGHT,8 December 2019,10/10,I watched it back in 2016 and now again in 2019. I really really really love this movie. It's so deep and emotional. One of my favorites. I cannot understand the negative comments.
MOONLIGHT,19 September 2020,10/10,"From start to finish, impeccable film work. Dynamic shots, great use of contrast lighting, and impactful sound and visual design. Albeit, some shots were held for a bit too long for my liking ..like when Kevin cooked the meal for Chiron - but it just made scenes even more meaningful.What's more interesting though, is how the film approaches three of the big social identities.. race, socioeconomic class, and sexuality. Chiron fits into all of these categories... he is a black non-heterosexual man brought up in poverty. Coupled with the beautiful cinematography, this made his inherently melancholic life story transform into a masterpiece.To further elaborate on the content, the three parts of the film each represented a different period in his life. This is typical of a coming-of-age drama, and the general set-up was similar across the stages. First stage, Chiron is a young boy. Second, Chiron is a teenager. Third, Chiron is an adult. Within all these, you see how the three social identities shift and adapt to Chiron's current stage of life. Each of these are different in their own way.However, I believe the one binding aspect across the stages is the beach. The allegorical emphasis of the beach is a sense of calm, contentment, and freedom. In each stage, the beach signifies a happier moment in Chiron's life. Juan teaching him how to swim, his first homosexual experience with Kevin, and discovering Kevin lives by the beach.I wouldn't consider the presence of the beach a spoiler, rather something to look out for and to interpret it how you feel when you watch it.Regardless, this is an absolutely stunning film. Recent coming-of-age films tend to move towards a comedic approach, which, albeit, is not my cup of tea. I was entranced through this entire film, thoroughly impressed."
MOONLIGHT,20 April 2021,9/10,"There are no flaws to this movie. The cinematography, pacing, tone, score, and acting are top notch. It's really sad to see people watch this movie with obvious bias or seriously misunderstand it. Whether you like it or not economic inequality, racial equality, and homophobia are serious issues that are still prevalent in the United States and will continue to be so if people keep pretending like they don't exist."
MOONLIGHT,31 October 2016,8/10,"An artistic indie that is clear, deliberate and articulate, Moonlight is a quiet slow burn gem. The film is a triptych, the three acts give us defining moments in the life of the main character named Chiron. The child called ""Little,"" the teen ""Chiron"" his actual name, and the man called ""Black."" The chapter titles said to me where he is in this life. Although I witnessed imposing forces of life from being raised (trapped) in an impoverished drug addled community, the character themes are universal. Where is Little's support system? He's becoming aware of self and his lack of place in the world. His young identity teetering on the balance in a world of few options. Chiron is becoming aware of who he really, though stifled and just when he needs to find his way, his world is literally beating it out of him. Black has made himself in the image of the only one he ever trusted, after being railed by the system. Chiron, though wounded and guarded is still in there. Nothing in the film felt gratuitous or wasted. It is rhythmic and artistically produced with purpose in scene composition and sound. Little learning to swim in that big ocean spoke volumes. Dialogue is more exposition than narrative, though a few scenes felt forced and a bit on the nose. The main actors especially the 3 Chirons are very good, award worthy performances. Each actor was very powerful in invoking the intentions of the filmmakers. A lot is left to the audience to decide for themselves. I don't always love that because I love storytelling that shows me a different point of view and doesn't rely on my point of view to shape it. But this worked for me in the way art should. It has a point of view and what I do with it, what I take from it, how I feel about it, is up to me. Good Stuff."
MOONLIGHT,6 June 2020,2/10,"Coming from a gay man, I was excited for this film but seriously nothing happened, very minimal plot, no confirmed ending. I'm only assuming a political win at the Oscar."
MOONLIGHT,21 December 2016,,"Moonlight features one of the best ensemble performances of recent years. Although Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are being singled out, almost every actor's work here achieves excellence. They all unite to bring a reality to these characters and the story.Barry Jenkins' direction visually captures the world and internal feelings of Chiron in each episode. His screenplay, however, hits some artificial notes that can sometimes take the audience out of the reality that has been established. One such moment occurs in a dinner conversation between Chiron and his mentor Juan, a local drug dealer who becomes involved with Chiron's well-being. Juan, on a few occasions, gives these sort of speeches and words of wisdom that are too conveniently apt in regards to the overarching purpose of the story. This and some similarly contrived situations of the script contrast with the very real performances and atmosphere of the film.Even with these faults, the film is able to transport us into this world and make us care about all the people who inhabit it. It has several powerful moments, both subtle and forceful that will make you feel you are watching something very real and personal. That, ultimately, is what makes this a solid achievement.***/**** - Solid Film"
MOONLIGHT,23 July 2020,9/10,"A beautiful movie of a touching story. The casting is first-rate, not a false note from any of them. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing any role. The story-telling is very clever, a great script, a story very well told. The notes say the film script is adapted by McCraney from his play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, but I couldn't find any info about this play. Is it published? I'd like to see how the three episodes would have been done on stage One quibble: because of regional accents some dialogue is completely intelligible. Subtitles would have been very useful and the film would get my 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,30 December 2018,3/10,"I tried to genuinely watch this movie with an open mind. Even though given the uproar the AA community had created about oscars apparently being so white, the fact that this movie won an Oscar made me take notice. I wanted to watch it to see what this movie was all about that got it an Oscar.And I'm sad to say that half way through the movie trying to painfully wade through its overtly pretentious artsy aesthetic I realize this was oscars way of getting this monkey off their back by giving a movie by black artists an Oscar already.I wanted to whole heartedly support and will continue to support minority artists anyway I can. But this was an average blah movie with nothing to write home about. Given that in spite of it being so average that it received an Oscar tells me that merit has nothing to do with the award given that year. It was more a PR move.This movie was a pretentious disappointment."
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2017,9/10,"This one reminds me a bit of The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, where a boy, who is different from the rest of them, tries to find his identity. People mock him, and he really doesn't know what's happening. Unlike The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, everything doesn't come easily for the boy. The subject matter is real, and we get a very detailed picture of how people who are under these situations feel.Being different kind of sucks, when one's mocked and cannot do anything about it. The central character in this movie, Chiron, suffers from that, and we see him getting beaten up for some things that he really cannot do anything about.""At some point you gotta decide for yourself who you gonna be"" says Juan, and thus from then on, we see Chiron on a journey of self-discovery. This is what the movie is really about. Fortunately, he's got a few good hearted people in his life, particularly, Juan and Teresa, played by Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monae respectively. They are the only ones who really understand what's going on with him, and they give him constant support, and guide him through his path of self-discovery.Mahershala Ali's and Naomi Harris' performances stand out. There's this one scene, when Chiron confronts him, and Mahershala Ali's acting in that scene is Oscar worthy. The three actors who play Chiron are fantastic in their roles, and the rest of the cast was great as well.As for the technical aspects, Barry Jenkins' direction is mindblowing, and the tension and emotions are captured perfectly. As for the screenplay, it is wonderful, but at times, I really depended on subtitles to understand the DOUBLE NEGATIVES. HAHA.One of the best of 2016, for sure.9/10."
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,9/10,"Sigh... it's pathetically funny how everyone on here who have this movie a ""1/10"" or something close to it pretty much did so because they thought the story was boring, and didn't personally identify with anyone in it. Of course then many of those who did so then jumped to the conclusion that surely the critical acclaim the movie did receive was because of the ""white guilt"" of Hollywood following last year's minority-absent Oscars, and the election of Trump. Forget everything else that a film utilizes: cinematography (which was excellent, with rack focus and fluid movement shots that would bring a tear to your eye if you cared to understand its craft in the slightest); editing (near flawless, seamlessly keeping eye line and multiple take continuity to almost surgical precision that most people who don't bother to appreciate take for granted); acting (great for the most part, though I wasn't a big fan of the kid who played the youngest Kevin); etc etc No, disregard all of that and simply trash a movie because you didn't like the story.My only gripe is that the main female characters were too damn hot. Especially the crackhead mom. That's probably the hottest crackhead I've ever seen I must say. Beyond that, maybe treat this film with a little more respect before you sh!t all over it simply because it's character driven and dialogue heavy, with a mood that requires you empathize and submerge yourself into rather than being spoon fed a bunch of flashy action and plot twists. Grow up people! ""1/10"" is for a movie like Jaws 4 or Gigli or whatever. When you honestly think that everyone is an idiot but you and that the only reason a movie like this gets awards and acclaim is because of your ignorant understanding of society's reflection of politics, you are at the very least an unreliable critic."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,4/10,"So I read nothing about this movie beforehand which I like to do so I can be really moved by the works of the director and actors. I'd like to start off by saying that it was a unique coming-of-age story line that was thought provoking and uncommon in mainstream movies.I won't get into any moral issues and whether I agree or disagree with the main story line and main character's orientation. So don't crucify me for that. I like to keep an open mind with the movies I view and I enjoy and well done story and acting performance way before I criticize morals and politics in movies.But regardless of those things, I still didn't feel it was a very well done plot. I get how they tried to tell the story but and the first and second acts with a lot of struggle. But the third act left a whole lot hanging. So my question is, why all the hype? Mahershala Ali is a stellar actor and is Oscar worthy for his role but I didn't feel he had nearly enough screen time to merit his Oscar win. His role was important for the plot but why get rid of him after the first act? I honestly lost interest after that.Overall, this movie was way too overrated for Oscar season and I do feel that it was a political and even racial move to do so. Good movie and heart, poor execution in the final product."
MOONLIGHT,14 December 2017,,"My god, how do I get 1 hour and 50 minutes of my life back, what was this movie about? a kid who had a tough upbringing and he is gay? how do you make a movie about that last an hour and 50 minutes, it seems like this could have been filled as a background of a 4 minute music video, pathetic the politically correct Oscars had to award this as the best picture because of the context of the movie rather than the content"
MOONLIGHT,22 February 2017,9/10,"Little. Chiron. Black. Three names, but only one story. The story of an everyday boy, struggling with the conditions life has decided to put him through. 'Moonlight' is not merely the title of Barry Jenkin's work, but it is an active and fundamental character of the movie itself. Juan, some kind of spiritual father for the protagonist, tells Little that once an old woman said to him: ""In moonlight, black boys look blue"". This is, indeed, the core of the story, and a key to interpret it as well: the moon reveals the real nature of black people, and in particular of our characters, because it makes them lighter, not black but blue. It colours them. More than that, 'blue' in English is not just the word for a colour, but it expresses a whole state of mind and feelings: being blue means being melancholic, being nostalgic, being rather sad. Little and Chiron had to go through so much more pain than the other children or kids of their age, that they became Black. Nevertheless, Black is just a dark and rough surface for what's really inside the character, something the latter buried in order to go on, to protect himself, to survive: his real soul, and, fatally bound to it, a great pain. Pain for his tragic family situation, and pain for his homosexuality. This great matter is both subtly and deeply shown in the movie, with no moral presumptions of saying whether it's right or wrong, or how a person should handle it. It's just a person's trait, and by being so, each person has to deal with it in a different way, according to who they are and what and whom they are surrounded by. Sadly for Little and Chiron, they were not in the best environment to grow up in, and this lead them to clam up; luckily for Black, his old best friend Kevin, with whom he shared his first - and ""only"" - homosexual experience, reaches out to him and exposes him after years of pretend and isolation. ""Who is you man?"", Kevin asks him; and the only thing Black can answer is: ""I'm me, man. Ain't trying to be nothing else."" But his face, his body language, the scenes afterwards tell a different truth. Kevin, who is ""the only man who ever touched"" him, questions him, doubts him, thus reveals him. And, with one of the most beautiful ending shots of the last few years, Black finds his way back to Little, to his one true soul. Wonderfully written and directed by Barry Jenkins, the movie boasts great cinematography accomplishments as well: the shots are very precise and symmetrical, and a great deal of art and poetry emanate from moments like the one with Juan and Little playing in the sea. The colours are wisely and carefully picked, with blue shades as a recurring colour palette, and with a whole other range of colours that tend to represent the atmosphere of the scene or, in particular, the protagonist's state of mind. Thanks to the very common and yet wonderful storyline, and to all the technical qualities of the movie in its whole, the spectator manages to become one with the characters, the seaside, the moonlight: in one word, with the boundless atmosphere. He is drawn to not only see but actually breathe the universe shown on the screen. And to flow in it until the very end."
MOONLIGHT,4 November 2017,7/10,"It seems most reviews for this film are split. I'm not gonna exaggerate to stand out but rather give a balance between why some people might not like and why others will love it.As has been the case before with previous Oscar Best Picture winners, this film has the critics and the public slightly divided, with critics giving huge praise compared to most of the public, who see it as nothing more than a 'good' film. To me, Moonlight was unsatisfactory on first viewing since I was expecting a big climax near the end as it is with most films. Instead the film is more subdued and should be seen this way to truly appreciate the little things that make this film stand out. It's obvious from numerous awards and nominations for directing, acting, music, etc. that the crew and cast are something to be admired. However for a non-critic for the most part these will not be noticed (except perhaps the standout acting) since they're done very subtly as to serve the style the director was going for. Some will say this is a film about nothing, a film in which the main character and the story doesn't change. I can see why people think this. Perhaps the best way to approach this film is to expect exactly this, but to also see it for what the film really is; a portrayal of the everyday difficulties with family, friendship and love of a black man growing up in Miami. Nothing more, nothing less.It's a beautiful film if you sit back and give into it. It's not supposed to be grandiose and epic. And I'm sure that by rewatching it you will enjoy it a lot more. It makes you think and relate, as well as giving you an understanding of a different world for most of it and it's just these kinds of films that aren't for the people expecting a thrill but rather those who admire the little details and slightly unusual scope of the film."
MOONLIGHT,27 April 2019,10/10,Outstanding direction acting and emotion. It took me some time to view because of the subject but I'm glad I waited. Made it even more beautiful to watch. Thank you.
MOONLIGHT,20 April 2017,1/10,"At first, I was very curious about this movie and what it was about, and when it won ""Best Picture"" I wouldn't wait to see it. I rented it from Fandango and after about an hour we turned it off. This is probably the most boring movie I've ever tried to watch. How it received an Oscar for best picture, I'll never know. Do not waste your time."
MOONLIGHT,6 April 2019,6/10,"Maybe my expectations were too high √§ considering Moonlight has won best picture but after watching its story I was kinda disappointed? First of all I have to say that the acting in this movie is on point. Probably one of the best acting I have ever seen and its definitely the best part of moonlight. The biggest problem I have with this movie is its ending. It did not really serve a point, added anything interesting or felt justified at all."
MOONLIGHT,14 June 2017,1/10,"Probably one of the worst Oscar movies i have ever seen. If you want to know what happens to a kids life who is affected by drugs , watch City Of God instead. Don't watch this because nothing ever happens. Its just fast forwarding through the life of a confused kid. The movie didn't have a single noteworthy moment throughout. Just boring sequences one after the other. It didn't deserve Oscar for any role. The only people who deserve Oscar for this are the AUDIENCE.Patiently waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2017,5/10,"Like many of the top-rated comments here, I did not know anything about this film going in other than it won a billion awards and every critic loved it. It's an incredibly average coming-of-age film. Every part of it is clich√©. I can only imagine that the reason it was nominated for everything is as a counterbalance to the Oscars-so-white problem last year, and for the two extremely brief (and completely inconsequential to the film) clips related to the main character's homosexuality. Seriously, it's about 45 seconds of the entire film, if you cut just those 45 seconds there would be nothing alluding to homosexuality in the entire film. If you cut those 45 seconds, I can only imagine it would have lost a tremendous amount of critics' supports, even though they're otherwise utterly irrelevant to the film's story. I guess professional critics have to worry about being branded as homophobic racists.The casting for the main character in the third act was also jarring. Both of us spent the first 10 minutes of the last third unsure if the main character was the same guy we had been following the whole film, or someone else that was randomly thrown in. If they can bring the actor who played Grand Moff Tarkin back to life for the new Star Wars film, they could have done a much better job making Chiron resemble himself consistently across all three acts (the child and teenage actors look quite similar).If you absolutely love coming of age dramas with utterly awkward and undeveloped protagonists, then you'll like this film. If you expected it to be special or unique, then ... watch something else.Ali was good in it, easily the highlight of the film. Too bad he's only in the first third. He's the only character with any dialogue or character. Seriously there is almost no development of the main character the entire film. He starts and ends an awkward, un-relatable kid who can't utter more than two words a minute."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,2/10,"I was hoping something was going to happen, I felt as though i wasted 2 hours of my life in this slow and boring film. I heard the reviews were good but what was so good about it? He hardly said a word and it was just a lot of eye contact. Disappointed and I won't ever watch it again. It's typical of American producers nowadays making slow boring dramas with no edge at all to them."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,10/10,"I've seen a lot of movies lately, mostly because we've had a series of amazing releases but Moonlight affected me deeply on a personal level like very few managed to do in the past few years.Having seen the trailer only once and knowing the brilliant cast ‚Äì Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae ‚Äì I was sure this one would be a hit. And ten minutes into it I had already gotten a handful of tissues out, like the rest of the audience in the theater and was silently wiping my tears while the actors gave a stellar performance.First of all, I was ecstatic to see that Moonlight featured an all black cast. From behind the camera, to the leads, down to the last extra, kudos and please can we have more already? Second of all, Moonlight showed that a movie can talk about queerness in the black community and turn it into art and present it with dignity and beauty and capture the essence of being a black gay man, the masculinity and actually show the struggles, it went to places a few movies would dare to go and it spoke to me; I know for a fact a lot of people walked out of the cinema more accepting and open-minded. I had a 70-year-old grandpa sitting next to me, weeping and crying like a child, I have never felt more connected with the people I'm randomly watching a movie with.I can't talk about Moonlight enough, the cinematography was exquisite and the directing was epic, the editing just brilliant. I could almost feel the sunlight through the screen and the humidity in the air. The camera takes you with the people and it captures emotion and feelings like you are there, somehow managing to peak into their lives.Despite the fact that the movie goes from decade to decade, childhood, young adult and grown man, you never feel any gaps in the story. Sure through the years there are noticeable differences and happenings we don't know about ‚Äì and never really get answers to ‚Äì but this is Chiron's story and unlike books, people don't go about their life everyday talking about the past, or recalling life altering events. We get three major turning points in Chiron's life, presented beautifully and with a painful honesty. The ending left me gasping and a mess, I was happy and full of emotions and love and I still remember scenes from the movie and my heart breaks for Little and at the same time I feel happy for Black and I want to protect Chiron.Moonlight is everything a movie should be and more; an example of how things can and should be portrayed and it all comes with brilliant performances and incredible directing. If there's only one movie you'll watch this year, it's Moonlight. This is why representation matters and why we need more of it. Take everyone with you, recommend it to as many people as you can, never stop talking about it."
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2017,5/10,"Really? Best Picture? Best Picture for The Ocars doesn't mean anything anymore. This movie was average. Every other nominee was better than this movie this year. A boy grows up with a crackhead mom, gets bullied because he's gay, ends up getting in trouble for fighting back, gets older and goes back to see his gay friend to chat...the end. I just told you the movie so don't waste your time. Definitely think Faye Dunaway called it right the first time. Ugh."
MOONLIGHT,23 February 2020,2/10,This could be happening to any native or migrant. Highly overrated movie ... Waste of Academy's time and misleading for viewers
MOONLIGHT,6 October 2018,1/10,"Just because it is on a sensitive subject, doesnt make this movie great. 
no high points, no character development, no great story/storytelling.waited till the end to see if there was a twist/something remarkable... thinking all this hype cant be for nothing. But sadly disappointed, it was a waste of time."
MOONLIGHT,3 May 2019,9/10,"So affecting, achingly authentic, an incredible film that is as heartbreaking as it is beautiful."
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2019,5/10,"If you're some what culturally and historically aware and empathetic you will watch the this movie and think that life is especially tough for African people growing now up in poverty, they see setback after setback, you will feel enlightened but also bored. Bored because you know that life for the minority isn't easy and you can empathize with them. It's nothing new to you. If you're not familiar with any aspect of other peoples struggles in life but your own privileged, easy, white picket fence life, you will find this movie educational, heartwarming, emotional and brilliant.I will criticize the character development... Characters are introduced and then they're gone, you're left wondering what happened to them.
Like I said above, yawwwnnn but you should watch it. Because educational films are never a waste of time."
MOONLIGHT,4 October 2020,5/10,"I started watching the movie with a lot of expectations, and I was strongly disappointed. The pace is broken, like many pieces of the story mingled together with no apparent meaning. I went on to the end expecting that it would get better at some point, but it didn¬¥t. The only part worth watching is when the already adult Chiron visits his mother at the hospice, and it doesn¬¥t last more than a few minutes.
A pitty, because the story could have made for an excellent movie.
I wonder what people were thinking about when they voted it for Academy Award for the Best Picture."
MOONLIGHT,4 April 2020,1/10,"This movie is probably a 4/10, rated it 1 because it is highly overrated and needs to come down. Wasted 2hrs of my life watching this movie."
MOONLIGHT,15 April 2020,5/10,"I put my title for this is because, I find myself very difficult to be connected with characthers in this movie.Besides ,amongst other nominees, I do believe there were other movies deserved to be won than this movie.Perhaps the reasons to justified this movie is that, this movie is full of hidden references to that period of America. However, anything full of hidden references also mean that normal audiences would find themselves challenging to be engaged with.I really did do my best to comprehend this movie and, I failed to agree to many that this movie worths for the numerous appraisal it received."
MOONLIGHT,28 January 2021,9/10,"An amazing movie that feels like poetry. Director Berry Jenkins avoids cliches, and manipulative sentiment, giving us black gay life in its ordinary and powerful moments. A real achievement especially for a movie that did so well commercially. The direction and acting are impressive. The cinematography avoids the documentary realism that's still so common in indie movies."
MOONLIGHT,9 November 2021,10/10,"If I could give this movie 11 stars, I would. If I could show this movie to every person on the planet, I would. From the stirringly beautiful soundtrack to the precise character work, absolutely nothing slips through the cracks of this movie. It sets an example for filmmakers of today, this is how you make a good, emotional, heart-clenching story."
MOONLIGHT,13 June 2021,10/10,"In honor of the 49 victims we're remembering lost during the Orlando pulse nightclub attack, I dedicate this review to those women and men, their families, and friends. Kudos to the writers and everyone else involved In this story about courage, time, betrayal, acceptance and forgiveness. This project is a masterpiece. The author's ability to take us through a sequence of events that carry out to tell this story In a way that challenges understanding and seeks empathy in a mirrored - non judgemental manner. The tough topics presented vary from jealousy, drug dealing & abuse, bullying, single- parenting, image, poverty, male rights of passage, sexuality/ manhood, fatherhood, motherhood, and some cultural education -which either will give voice to the voiceless or convict those willing to surrender to change. The fact that we usually see the consequences of another person's actions without giving credit to the cause well this film accomplishes that. I'm happy to have discovered and learned."
MOONLIGHT,2 May 2019,7/10,"I'd give it a 6.5 if I could. It felt like the storyline was missing a lot of... oomph!! (Or umph?)I thought the casting of all 3 Chirons were excellent! Such great acting. And the cinematography was absolutely incredible -- especially the contrast of the dark skin tones against the bluish-purple lighting.The only thing that bothered me about the film was the script. Like others mentioned before, the film was slow in certain parts. Nice dialogue here and there, but then... nothing. I felt like the ending left us hanging.I feel it's definitely worth watching to gather your own opinion about it, though. I don't regret seeing it -- just wish the ending was better."
MOONLIGHT,14 January 2017,9/10,"Moonlight takes a huge risk in crafting and depicting the life of a person too rarely seen in film. The film chronicles the life of a man from childhood to adulthood as he seeks to find his true place in the world. Much can be said about the pure work of art that this film is, but it overall employs the pursuit for a universal standard of love. This socially conscious film plays a very insightful role in the worlds current state of mind and should be recognized for all that it has accomplished. With the brilliant performances from its entire cast, enthralling symmetrical shots that captured every raw emotion, and its beautiful themes, very few people will leave this film untouched.Ali's Rating: A-Favorite Quote: ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you."" - Juan (Mahershala Ali)"
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,5/10,"The Oscars get bashed last year for not enough black nominations; enter Moonlight! Talk about right place, right time. A movie about a sexually confused black kid from a poor neighborhood who gets bullied ‚Äì has Oscar bait written all over it. But Best Picture? Not for me. Since my watch recommendation is No ‚Äì this review might contain some spoilers.Moonlight does tell a story which is unfortunately far too common in American society; single mothers, segregated neighborhoods, mass incarceration & bad examples all around ‚Äì but is executed in a very clich√© and uninteresting fashion. A drug addict mom (well played by Naomi Harris) who prostitutes to make ends meet, a neglected fatherless child, and a neighborhood full of drug dealers and bullies seems like plot of several other black 'hood' movies. The kid is sexually confused and gets bullied in school, finds solace at a local drug dealer's home who becomes a surrogate father figure only for a short time before unexpectedly dying, the kid grows into teenage and has his first sexual encounter with a gay friend, has a school yard brawl with some bullies, ends up in prison and turns into a hardened criminal.The main character in the film ‚Äì 'Chiron', doesn't speak more than two or three word sentences at a time, and has a very dull personality. In the spirit of staying true to the play, the director chooses to cast three actors to portray three different phases in his life, so the performances seem broken. The kid ('Little') played by Alex Hibbert and adult ('Black') played by Trevante Rhodes end up being lackluster performances, whereas Ashton Sanders does a relatively fine job playing the teenage character ('Chiron'). Mahershala Ali plays a drug dealer with the same inexpressive style of his lobbyist character in House of Cards. Best Supporting Actor for about twenty minute role, seems like overcompensation by the Academy for 2015.The script conveniently skips over milestones like life changes, deaths, transitions which would need drama or dialog, instead just focuses on the day to day coping and feelings of 'Chiron'. The screenplay is extremely tedious like many other Oscar movies and could use about 20 minutes of editing. The audience can empathize with the plight of a poor, black child in a drug addled neighborhood ‚Äì but at any point, 'Chiron' doesn't seem to have problems finding food, shelter, clothing or education. Finally, his life is really an outcome of the choices he makes. With all due respect, more recent creations like 'Straight Outta Compton' and 'Black-ish' have done a phenomenal job portraying the challenges in Black communities while still delivering excellent entertainment value to audiences."
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2017,2/10,"This is a terrible movie. The one word to describe this movie is boring. There is no plot. No character development. Camera work and direction are like something you would expect from a film student's class project. I still don't know why this movie was titled ""Monnlight."" Mahershala Ali brought some life to this film as he does with all the projects he's in but somehow he disappears in the middle of the movie without any explanation. He wasn't bad considering the corny dialog he was forced to say.According to IMDb this is Barry Jenkins' first direction and he only has 8 writing credits and this lack of experience shows in the film. It wasn't clear what city this was in and in the first third of the movie the main character refused to even talk making the dialog so awkward I almost quit watching.Many of the scenes are very long single shots that were about as interesting as watching a spider crawl up a wall. In one pivotal scene our main character is about to do something and the camera has a POV shot of him walking through door after door after door after door, so many I lost count. The only thing that went through my mind was having all these doors shut in a building full of people is probably a fire hazard.I never gave a thumbs down (5 stars or less) to an Academy Award winner for best picture until now and I've seen them all from 1960-present and most from 1930-1960. I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 in deference to the Academy of Motion Pictures."
MOONLIGHT,14 December 2019,1/10,Waste of time.waste of time. imdn score I'm very surprised I think gays raised the film's score
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,1/10,"I'm a tolerant person, have friends and family who are LGBTQ. I understand multiculturalism and human rights. Entertainment should portray a story of humanity but when wave after wave of sexual themed movies even such at 50 Shades series, it needs to stop. The harsh urban backdrop of this movie was portrayed excellently as well as the relationship to his mother and father. I found some humanly touching moments in the film but when all is said and done it is still AN AGENDA FILM ABOUT SEXUALITY not identity. I was on the LGBTQ bandwagon too for a while and I celebrated the rights of gays to marry but that has changed. What was once a good cause has become a growing tyranny of a small minority of people who want all the high places of influence in society. I don't want a gay president, I just want an honest president. I don't want to bake gay cakes, I just want to bake a cake. I don't want gay novels, gay cars, gay clothes or gay cinema. Just because hetero-normal life is portrayed in film doesn't mean a sexual agenda is being pushed. When a couple is shown on screen having sexual intercourse it is called pornography no matter what the rating is. Leave sexual agendas out of film. Period."
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,10/10,"""So, where you gonna stay tonight, man?""I was certain that these would be the last words spoken in ""Moonlight,"" as Chiron responds by cranking up the radio, likely to mask the sound of his beating heart. But with the remaining minutes of the film, just as he does in every shot of this film, Barry Jenkins gives us far more than we deserve.""Moonlight"" is an intimate story of love, masculinity, and self- discovery in the life of Chiron, a black boy from Miami. The story is told in three distinct episodes: the first, titled ""Little,"" captures Chiron's childhood as he is introduced to an unexpected father figure, local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali). In ""Little,"" we witness Chiron (played here by Alex Hibbert) discover his mother's vices, his mentor's disrepute, and his own sexuality, culminating in a candid interrogation of Juan.The second episode, ""Chiron,"" follows our protagonist in his later adolescent phase. Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders) has lost Juan, but maintains a close relationship with Juan's girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monae). He has all but lost his mother (Naomie Harris) to her addiction, but continues to care for her well-being. He is bullied at school, but, despite his stature and introversion, he stands up for himself. Not long after his first sexual experience with his, seemingly, more mature friend, Kevin, Chiron proves himself stronger than Kevin by withstanding a bully's torment and fighting back. The episode concludes with Chiron being taken from his school in a police car.In ""Black,"" the final episode, we find Chiron (now Trevante Rhodes) at last projecting his interior strength in his physical appearance: a muscular drug dealer with grills and a car with a booming stereo, Chiron is finally ""hard."" Or so he thought: a surprise call from Kevin and a hopeful trip back to Miami return Chiron to his former demeanor. A reunion with his first (and, as we learn, only) male lover provides Chiron, Kevin, and the audience with tremendous resolution. Though the story, on its face, seems complex, its presentation is decidedly sparse. Jenkins opts to tell the tale through images, color, sound, and emotion rather than tired exposition and heavy-handed dialogue. The finished product took me by surprise. I recall the doubts and trepidation that preceded my viewing of ""Moonlight""; with staggering universal acclaim and a progressive, intersectional screenplay, I feared I was in for some clumsy, conspicuous Oscar-bait. On paper, the phenomenon reminded me of ""Boyhood,"" Richard Linklater's 2014 film that garnered widespread praise (for me, a good movie that relies too heavily on the technical feat, or gimmick?, that it represents).But ""Moonlight"" is something completely different. Barry Jenkins directs the film with an incredible attention to detail and a fearless devotion to the notion that Film is a form of Art. Many draw comparisons to the work of Wong Kar-Wai, one of Jenkin's admitted influences. But I was reminded first of one of my favorite filmmakers, Terrence Malick. The refusal to compromise real, human dialogue reminded me of ""Badlands"" and ""Days of Heaven."" The recurring influence of the shore, the beach, the water reminded me of ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Knight of Cups."" And, of course, a beautifully scored scene of children playing convinced me that I was watching an alternate version of ""The Tree of Life.""Notwithstanding these influences and recollections, Barry Jenkins still managed to provide me with an experience that I've never had before and techniques that I have never witnessed before. Opening the film with Boris Gardiner's ""Every N****r is a Star"" hearkened back to the opening sample on Kendrick Lamar's 2015 magnum opus ""To Pimp a Butterfly,"" one of my favorite albums in recent memory. Hearing this song during the opening credits told me exactly what kind of movie would follow, and it gave me the unique impression that I shared a common interest with the director. As for techniques, I was particularly impressed with the soundtrack and score. Application of ""chopped and screwed"" filters to the orchestral score represents a merging of old and new, an unlikely pairing of the Renaissance of the West with the Renaissance of the Dirty South. And the chopped and screwed songs that Chiron bumps in the whip manipulate and slow time, much like Jenkins does with his characters. Another technique that captivated me was the way in which Barry Jenkins conveyed the codification of memories in real time. Close-ups of various characters speaking to Chiron are slowed, and the visual no longer tracks with the audio. While the words that they speak may be forgotten, neither Chiron nor I will ever forget the looks on their faces.Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" moved me tremendously. But his film was not created with me, or a general audience, in mind. Jenkins is telling the story of his own experience, of Chiron's experience, and of playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney's experience, as a young black man in Miami. His film gives a vision to the underrepresented, looking for hope and a reason to love themselves. His film does so with the wisdom of personal experience and the zeal of a devout student of film. He tells the truth, *his* truth, with profound empathy, and the impact that his movie has had on me only confirms the power of truth and empathy to transcend identity and connect us all. I don't know if I'll ever see another film more deserving of ""Best Picture."""
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,10/10,"Movies are of two kinds. One, that brings the child within you, by showing multiple fast-moving, colorful images that are grand, visually. We are so used to these kind of movies that everyone is convinced that movies are for entertainment, and this is what 'I' want. And, when we least expect, we get something like 'Moonlight', making ourselves question why movies are made. We realize then, that there are a second kind of movies, where you start thinking and feeling deeper than ever before, giving a new meaning to life since you watched it.Moonlight is not a story, as others mention. It is about you, as an individual, portrayed through the character Chiron. Every human must have faced issues with identifying the world within and the world outside. As a consequence, he/she faces the challenge of adjusting both, getting confused, frustrated, afraid, reserved throughout, until that day when they open up to someone whom they believe completes them.Chiron is an introvert growing up in a very harsh environment (no spoilers), trying to find who he really is. Unlike other movies so far, Moonlight keeps Chiron at the center of every scene, portraying his struggles and emotions right directly on screen. Never in a moment does the movie divert into a sub-plot that tries to justify anything. What you see is the world as Chiron sees, hears and feels. The actors who have played Chiron have done a masterful work of emoting it. The direction and screenplay is a masterpiece itself. There are very few dialogues. But when they are spoken, they leave a deep thought in mind.Moonlight is not a Roller Coaster that an average movie goer expects. It is like that light breeze you feel when you walk along the beach. Don't watch the movie looking for a thrill. Just relax and feel the experience. That is when you understand life.(Caution: The movie does have scenes that might be disturbing to some. However, this movie is far safer and healthier than other movies you can think of.)"
MOONLIGHT,29 November 2016,10/10,"Moonlight is going to be Best Picture of 2016 and Best Sound and Best Score and Best Cinematography and several Best Actor and several Best Supporting Actor and Best Screenplay and Best Director-- what am I leaving out? It is a movie filled with HEART-- as perfect as a movie can be. It's a movie to watch six times and discover ever more depths than the last viewing.As Best Picture, the Academy will make up for repeated slights dealt over and over again against two communities.Everyone knows that Brokeback Mountain was and is far superior to Crash (who even remembers it?), but the implicit bias against LGBTQs disqualified it.The Academy has shown its implicit bias against Blacks so many times I've lost count.The Academy can embrace two birds with one Best Picture statuette. And the more Oscars the better. They are all well-deserved.Moonlight. Overcome your own implicit biases and see it, my cinema friends! You'll be better people for it. And we'll arc toward a better, more inclusive, society.(Plus it'll make the racist/homophobic Trump-Pence administration choke.)"
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,9/10,i see many users trashing the movie saying it is boring and it is 2 hours of nothing. there are just so many human moments in this movie that you just have to pay attention to. it is not about something adventurous happening. it's about what the protagonist is feeling and I swear.. the acting in the movie is amazing. the way this movie is filmed it gives the vibes of a lonely person dealing with his life taking it all in without pushing back. the movie's job was to create empathy for the character and i believe they did it perfectly.
MOONLIGHT,22 February 2020,8/10,"Something is missing between the first and second half of the movie, the things that would have explained the plot, anchored the emotions, and made the movie Oscar worthy. The cinematography is gorgeous when the shots are static, but they can get disorienting when the camera is moving fast, which builds up an unintended tension, or worse, nausea.I do appreciate the effort of depicting a minority community instead of a minority individual. Most of the times the call for diversity only compels writers to swap their white characters with black characters, without any attention paid to black people as a whole their distinctive lives."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,9/10,"I'm split. I think that this film could historically be one of those great films like Yi Yi or In the Mood for Love that will never be accepted in a popular canon like Singin' in the Rain or Apocalypse Now would be. I also feel that it is a bit over-hyped by critics. It's a bit moody, leans too much on stereotypes (I think a lot of the justifications for this are lazy and just band-aids over a lazy artistic decision), and is a bit underwrought for my tastes. However, if you watch this film and can't respect the impossibly strong technical aspects, the great acting, cinematography, and dialogue, then you probably don't expect too much from your movies. This is not a crowd- pleaser or even a generally pleasing movie. I cried at the end of this movie, but I also dozed off in the middle. It's a damn good movie and possibly will be great in hindsight. It's not perfect though and if you think you won't enjoy it then you probably won't enjoy it."
MOONLIGHT,30 December 2016,4/10,"When Moonlight ended, a woman a few rows back said,""Is that it?"" That was exactly what I was thinking. This movie received so many excellent reviews from critics, and awards and nominations galore, that I assumed it must be quite good. Unfortunately, I do not agree with these critics or the various award giving entities in this case. I do not think it should have ever been nominated for best picture or best director. I give it a 4 out of ten. Moonlight is not entertaining, nor is it interesting. I can only guess that they thought it was politically correct to give a movie about a bullied,gay, black teen a good review because of all the controversy surrounding the Academy Awards supposed lack of ethnic diversity. I would nominate Denzel Washington's ""Fences"" instead."
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2020,3/10,"No offense to gay people but it's disturbing for me to find myself watching something like that .. i don't give a fu** about the artistic value ,, can you just add a tag indicating that this have some gay stuff so i can stop wasting my fu**ing time"
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,9/10,"Moonlight is the story of Chiron, a black gay man growing up in the streets of Miami. The film is divided in three parts, which follow three moments of Chiron's life (kid, adolescent, adult). This is a powerful, poetic, gorgeous film, and absolutely one of the best of the year, and last years for that matter.So as I said (or wrote) the movie is divided in three parts, Chiron as a kid called 'little', Chiron as an adolescent and Chiron as a huge, ripped drug dealer. The problem with this kind of jumps in time when we follow a character is the consistency and credibility. Because inevitably it will be three different actors playing one character during equal time-periods. The other problem is that we have to experience enough depth and development in each segment as for it to work.The second problem is helped by a great writing and an amazing script. Each segment is deep, poetic and different. But the character is the same. The first is Little struggling with bullies and his timidity. The second is Chiron struggling with his sexual orientation and bullies. The third is Black struggling with himself, his desires, his quest for love and being loved. Each segment we get to know Chiron more, and adding them all up we get a complex understanding of his personality and his struggles. Chiron changes enormously from the first to the third segment, but because of the second it is completely logical. The first problem is avoided by amazing acting. From Hibbert (little) to Sanders (adolescent) and to Rhodes (black). I mean it's just great. Rhodes is enormous and ripped but he makes you believe that he is Little grown up, you actually recognise Little in Black, which is so weird. And whilst he is quite menacing at the end and quite bad ass, he is so tender and silent and emotional, it's amazing.Sanders does a tremendous job too. Harris plays the crack-addict mom, she's good. Ali is the big one everybody is talking about, and yeah, he 's amazing. His role is pretty small but important, and he plays it nuanced and deep. But once again, every performance in this film is nuanced and deep and pretty much great.The directing is phenomenal, as is the cinematography. Every shot is gorgeous, and the camera movements are hypnotic. Thanks to the great writing but certainly also the camera-work this movie is perhaps one of the most intimate ever. I actually felt like I was in the movie during some scenes. This is a poetic movie filled with recurring symbolism (water and fire etc.) and inner struggle. A movie about understanding (of self) and love. This film also shows us something we have never seen, a black man in the ghetto who is gay. Which really confused me at first, I literally was confused by this movie because I just never saw anything like it.This is a tender, poetic, gorgeous-looking, amazingly-acted, incredibly-directed film which dares to show us something we have not seen before. So yeah, amazing.9"
MOONLIGHT,17 August 2020,10/10,The movie has no extraordinary or over the top elements yet it is beautiful because of it's simplicity. You see the struggle of a person from his childhood to his adulthood. What really blew my mind was the amazing acting of all the cast members. Chiron's character had very less to speak and had mostly to convey his emotions through his expressions and all three actors did a very great job portraying him.
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,8/10,"Moonlight's charm is pleasantly surprising. It looks great, sounds great, and is exceedingly well performed. An impressive feat for a second time director.The plot has a clearly defined structure, and the three time periods the film portrays blend together with noticeable fluidity. It begins clich√©, with Ali's character playing the wizened, matured hood- father figure. For a piece that rejects stereotype so well, it certainly bows to some. Ali's character is a tough paternal type we've seen so many times before. Him and Little meet by complete deus ex machina, and the initial development of their relationship feels a bit lazy at first. The script is also pretty monotonous, sparking in only a few moments, with some conversations (especially the 'Moonlight'talk) especially unbearable. But for the most part, characters were fully realised, and seemed human enough. It was to the film's tremendous assistance that every actor plays their parts terrifically well, with adult Little being the standout.The film is filled a spectacle of colour and interesting photography. At minor points the camera-work felt somewhat un-subtle, even clunky, but again this was overshadowed by the good parts.The soundtrack is also well-chosen, resulting in a interestingly different experience, visually and sound-wise.Moonlight has problems,but its keen directorial vision, heartfelt characters, and unique cinematography saves it from mediocrity."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,8/10,"all the time i was watching this movie, i was thinking about my dear friend, Xulhaz Mannan. The thing relates him to this lovely movie is, he was the founder of Bangladesh's (our homeland) only lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) magazine and was killed brutally along with his another friend last year when a series of horrific murders of bloggers and activists were happening in Bangladesh showing some religious belief as the driving force in the killers' minds. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xulhaz_Mannanhttps://thewire.in/tag/xulhaz-mannan/"
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,10/10,"I decided to watch this movie without having much expectations but I was wrong. Moonlight is a combination of everything you want from a movie. 1.Well written script(the characters felt like they were real and they were really relatable) 2.Perfect acting(there was no single acting error, everyone did their job perfectly) 3.Exellent directing (every single shot made you forget you were watching movie. It really felt like someone took a camera and captured real life) 4.Powerfull message(I am not going to spoil that but I believe that every movie must have its own purpose, and Moonlight surely did) All in all, Moonlight is a flawless movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good moviesP.S. Sorry for any mistake in my English(not a native speaker)"
MOONLIGHT,23 April 2019,10/10,"I found this movie to be heart wrenching in every aspect and quite breathtaking honestly. The cinematography took away my breath and every shot was carefully crafted in the most perfect way. I've seen many reviews that found this movie to be boring because of the lack of dialogue, which for me provided tension and brought me to the edge of my seat instead of boring me. I also felt I became very connected to the characters, and I felt emotionally gutted at some points and ecstatic at others. I feel that this movie has everything a good movie needs to have, rather a GREAT movie. All of the actors, even the child actors, did an amazing job and I loved how the movie was set up in three parts. Overall, this movie is a must watch in a persons lifetime, one of the best movies I've ever seen."
MOONLIGHT,3 February 2017,10/10,"Moonlight as I first expected when I saw the the film cover, was going to be an exceptional movie. And yes, it was. One of the best thing I have seen so far in the last 3 years, a striking similarity to Boyhood (but better) and brought tears to my eyes. The actor who did Chiron's mother was amazing, she portrayed the drug mother amazingly, sharing some similarity with my Bipolar mother. I certainly believe that she should get a lot of credit even though Juan's actor was pretty great. A cinema's gems, showing aspects of human and how Chiron try to find himself. Through the three phases, you see the different sides of Chiron, how he was growing up, each time differently. The story between Kevin and Chiron was simply magnificent. The two boys, growing up, both with different personalities while caring for each other. To finish it all up, Moonlight was a recent masterpiece. In my case, far better than La La Land and should be having way more recognition. Absolutely brilliant, brought tears to my eyes and warmed my heart. Everyone should be watching this movie, truly enlightening. I hope for same movie like this in 2017."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,7/10,"Well, I watched this film just after it won the best picture. I had hoped that it could be as amazing as la la land and manchester by the sea. However, it turns out that I began to doubt the taste of the Academy. The story is not too bad, but all the way I couldn't get myself emotional. I just felt so boring at almost every scene. You know, when you intend to tell a story with a film, the story should be somewhere amazing. But in this film everything is plain as a blank sheet. I give it a 7 for the race problem and maybe sex orientation problem it reveals. It should have been much better with such a deep inside topic.I just get so shocked that la la land and manchester by the sea were both beaten by this one."
MOONLIGHT,16 February 2017,10/10,"I'll try to be brief. I probably won't though. I didn't know what to expect from this film. I have never heard of Barry Jenkins, though I am a fan of Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris, so I had something to look up too. This film is sad. You will not be happy for the majority of the film. While this may turn some people off, what may turn people back on is the relevance of the story. It may not be a story that has been portrayed before, but is a story we certainly heard of in one way or another. Jenkins' exquisite direction and love of production adds personality to the already stellar acting not just from Ali and Harris, but also from the 3 newer actors whom portray Chiron at different eras of his life. It is also a film that just looks good, expertly shot by James Laxton, known for his collaborations with Kevin Smith. This film is smart and pushes the boundaries of what we explore in humanity. Simply a triumph."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,7/10,"This film is no doubt over rated beyond disbelief. Although there are some great moments in the film, especially the cinematography, overall the plot sucks. It's overdone camera 360's, and front boring scenes really represent where today's films are headed. Marshala Ali put on a very cool performance I must admit. And perhaps deserved the Oscar. But let me say it again the plot sucked. There's no direction whatsoever. The story loosely strung together, the protagonist is a weak character. He's barely developed, it skips around to much in his life to follow why he evolved into x or z. We have to give credit to the camera shots, no doubt it was cool. The dialogue also had a sense of realism to it. To sum it up we want memorable characters not wooden robots with no emotion (like every other movie character these days) and most of all we want a good story. Moonlight is a example of a overrated movie, helped by the media, the only reason why it won was because of its political agenda and damn we don't want to watch a movie shoving politics up our mouths, we want a good story with common values we could ALL connect to. Moonlight by far didn't deserve the Oscar but of course it won because of its political message. Arrival, Hacksaw ridge kicked it's ass by far. I hope Hollywood recognizes that were sick of these political films, and just want to see a Good Movie!!!!!!!!! However I gave it seven stars due to some good drama scenes, really only in the beginning."
MOONLIGHT,14 April 2017,4/10,"I went to the movie with an open mind, thrilled by the chance of seeing a Oscar winner. However, it disappointed me in so many levels. Firstly, I understand that it is a movie about black people, but we live in a mixed world, should not be also other races present in the movie? Anyway, there is nothing special about the content. No intrigue, no nothing. It is a plain movie from the beginning to the end which just describes the struggles of a gay boy. However, nothing special. If you appreciate bizarre/abstract movies where you have to be philosophic to understand the action go for it. Otherwise, save yourself some time."
MOONLIGHT,11 June 2017,5/10,"This film is just very overrated. This is about a drug dealer who grew up in the mean streets of Florida. The acting is fine but nobody deserved an Academy Award. The person that won his part is so short that in reality was an extended cameo. Now I did like the part where the kid gets revenge but in general this film has nothing worth remembering. It Won Best Picture but so did ""Chariots of Fire"". The best thing about this film was the fact I did not pay movie theater prices to see it. Film 100% Garbage"
MOONLIGHT,5 October 2017,7/10,"I mean i feel the pain. We've all seen those kind of movies. You can't stay impassible. But.A very interesting beginning that leads to endless and boring dialogues. I socked when i watched the scene at the beach cause all i was expected was guns, drugs and violence. You definitely don't call it romantic under those circumstances but at least Chiron (leading character) is not a victim anymore. I mean yeah i feel the pain bro but talk for god's sake, say something. A 2 hours movie and he said 20 words. All i'm saying is that it could have been more active. Other than that, it was a worth watching film."
MOONLIGHT,3 May 2021,7/10,"Expected much more emotionally! But the movie failed to deliver! A good coming of age story that highlights only the few struggles and some life defining moments of an introvert African-American man, but doesn't take you emotionally deep enough in the last half and leaves you with incompleteness!Still I would say it's a pretty good 7/10, but again it's just another Over-Rated Oscar Winner for sure!"
MOONLIGHT,28 December 2019,7/10,"This movie made me really angry. Idk why, but I expected so much from it. It has so much potential, but they just wasted it. This movie could have been a 10/10. Ali was so good, but he doesn't get enough screentime and his character dies off screen for no reason and they don't even explain why. All of the actors who played Chiron were amazing, and that includes everybody else to.This movie has great acting, and the cinamatography is great. Something just happened with the screenplay and directing could have been better. There are some scenes that easily could have been better.When it comes to the story, there is something that is wrong. Nothing really happns at the end of the movie.At the end of the day. This is an average movie that could have been so more. It pains me that a movie with so many great performances and a story that touches an important topic in the world is just ""meh"". Instead off digging deep into it it just scratches the surface."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2018,7/10,"As a straight, white male I am definitely not the targeted audience for this film. I could not relate to it as minorities could. That being said, there is still much to take away from the film regardless of race or sexual orientation. Sure, it can come off as ""preachy"" at times, but as a whole it is not a terrible movie.What I enjoyed most about this film was how simplistic it is. It does not need any high-budget shots or elaborate plot-lines. It is a very basic, almost cliched, coming of age story that deals with the theme of overcoming hardships and discrimination. The acting is, much like the film itself, solid but not spectacular. They all did a fine job, but didn't really stand out to me. Lastly, something I enjoyed was that the tone was consistent throughout. This is something people take for granted as a film that is tone-deaf is often one with the most flaws. Everyone involved knew what type of film they were making, and did a great job of staying consistent. The main problems I have with this film come from the story. It is average at best as it is filled with numerous cliches. The ending is also very weak in my eyes as it does not leave me with a strong sense of closure. It just sort of ends, and doesn't develop the characters any further than it already did in the second act. Overall, I give this movie a 7 because although there are some flaws within the story, there is still a good message to be heard. The acting and technical work in the film is also solid. I recommend viewing it despite the fact that it may not be your cup of tea. It isn't great, but it is not as much of a disaster as other users will have you believe. That being said, it is okay to have your own opinion, so don't worry if you disagree with everything I have to say."
MOONLIGHT,27 March 2018,9/10,Loved the story and intertwining of the main character's life told at different ages. Thoughly enjoyed it!
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2018,9/10,"Moonlight is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It adapts a play in to film very effectively, staying true to its source material.
I did feel that it was a bit too like a play at some points, there are long sequences where the characters merely speak and it all has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. It clearly was not altered much from the theater script, it could have changed some scenes to make them more film-esque, as their were far too many moments where I felt I could have just watched it on stage."
MOONLIGHT,3 May 2019,9/10,"I've seen Moonlight many times and I feel that this is the best film of all time. Never has anything I've ever seen come close to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins is going to achieve legendary status as a director in the near future as he wrings beauty in every scene despite the bleakest of circumstances. The three act structure is beautiful as we see a vulnerable boy who can't be himself struggle to find himself in his bleak life in working class America. It's a film unlike any other and one of the most deserved best picture winners ever. This will and always will be my favourite film and I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every single film Jenkins makes."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,10/10,"I didn't know what to expect, but I liked it. I read a lot of the negative reviews, and can't quite understand why some were so critical. This movie is a serious, relentless, bare, unrepentant character study. If you aren't interested in seeing that, or if you are one of those who complain about a political agenda (even if one doesn't actually exist in the film), or if you think you might have more important things to do, then you probably won't like watching this movie. You've become hardened by reality. Go watch something else. If you want to spend two hours on a tour de force that laps you with one emotional wave after another without the slightest apology, watch this movie. And congratulations, you're still human."
MOONLIGHT,22 July 2019,9/10,"This movie is a portrait of the frailties, the conflicts and the effects that sexuality and social hostilities have on the molding of a human being. It also shows a take on how socialization - specially when you're a black man - can really affect your paths and your self image.
Moonlight really touched me, even though Chiron was very, very quiet and had only a few lines. It bothered me when I first watched it back in 2016, but now I believe his silence showed even more about the nature of his feelings and fears.
His bond with the drug dealer was also very beautiful in a pure and parental way. It was the touch of sweetness that this history, so raw and sorrowful in certain moments, needed in order to soothe the viewer for a while.
It's a very beautiful movie, and it certainly made me understand a bit more about things I never really questioned until then."
MOONLIGHT,8 June 2020,7/10,"1 . Hard hitting acting by cast
2 smooth screen play"
MOONLIGHT,3 October 2021,9/10,I can't get enough of this movie! It broke my heart into a million pieces! The script is beautifully written. Barry Jenkins really knows how to write a captivating story of love and pain.
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2017,1/10,"I couldn't understand 75% of the noises that came out of peoples' mouths when their mouths moved. Either because they were mumbling, or using slang that was totally alien to me. That's a major problem when trying to make any sense out of what was obviously trying to be a sensitive, reflective study. Possibly because of the comprehension issues, the situation our main protagonist appeared to be in also came across as naive and stereotyped at best - why was he bullied? What had he said or done as a small child and young teenager to deserve this? Other than being small and quiet (facts that were apparent without relying on speech) there didn't appear to be any other justification for the bullying. Unless it was because his mother was a (stereotypical again) druggy and single mum? No, this is a huge case of the Emperor's new clothes, I'm afraid. There is a thin line between sweet and naive - but this film was half baked in too many areas to be anything but an extremely naive piece of film making. One of the poorest films I've had to suffer in a very long time - you shouldn't win Oscars because you had the potential to be a good film."
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2019,6/10,"I was really looking forward to watching this film as I had heard so many great things from the critics. I was blown away by La La Land's story and character development and shocked when it didn't win Best Picture. Knowing that Moonlight beat the former out on this award I was anticipating a masterpiece. What a let down. The story is extremely slow with noticeable lack of dialogue at times. When there is dialogue it's difficult to follow due to lots of mumbling and street slang. I understand there was a want to accurately depict suburban Miami but most of the audience will struggle to understand what is being communicated. There was absolutely no character development apart from skinny shy kid becomes buff semi-confident kid. It was evident that the more time passed, the more things stayed the same. As a homosexual myself, I didn't feel any part of the script personally spoke to me. This isn't the kind of story-line that invokes any type of feeling or inspiration days after watching the movie. In fact I barely thought about it the day after. Strong points of the movie include Ashton Sanders' portrayal of Teen Chiron as well as the music. It certainly isn't a bad movie, it is a movie everyone should give a go, but it's not worthy of all the praise it got."
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2017,4/10,"Is it only me who can never deter the question lurking in the background while watching dramas.. is it fake? How do I relate to it? The movie is beautiful but where is this beauty coming from? Is it artificial paint, however masterful the painter, that is elevating my emotional response to the character, situation, carrying or miscarrying the leitmotif of the movie or is it emerging from the deep narrative structure, a masterful juxtaposition of moments that are so familiar but have never been arranged in such configuration? The question of real and fake in a feature film is superfluous as it can get. And yet I have a feeling after being under the Moonlight for a while, that somehow it is not the latter, it is the paint, the lights that have attracted so much hype to this flick. The second and third chapters of the movie break apart .. the outer as much as the inner of the character is lost, the only thing keeping them in transition is the aesthetics and over dramatization of a very dull script. Moonlight is a step back from Boyhood. Yet it is a beautifully painted movie and I can see why nobody would miss.. how do I put it.. self-reflection of the character? Its determination? Or maybe the hype is to do with the LGBT orientation? In my view it's neither something to applaud nor denounce, apart from the fact that the theme obviously needed a breakthrough in the cinema.There is a very good reason to follow your character for decades the way Linklater did.. something I learned from Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,4/10,"I also took the hype train and started watching Moonlight with serious enthusiasm and expectation, as supposed to be I guess because of awards, ratings etc. Unfortunately I cannot write any good comments. Simply put; this is a bad movie. Movie is not good for any aspects, not good for having a solid story, not good for performances, not good for picture, directing, music and so on. It is actually surprising that movie is only mediocre for everything. I mean, it could be good for even a few things. Thus, nobody deserve any prizes for this 2 hour waste of media. Character depth is a joke. It couldn't been more shallow and under told. It is almost like writer or director thought: ""well, you all watched numerous other movies, or heard stories about poor African-American society, drug addiction, bad motherhood, bullying etc. we don't need to repeat them again, but we also don't have anything more than that except this time there's a gay boy, so just focus on that and don't sweat us, just feel sorry and cry."" They have literally lounged about telling a solid story and mocked viewers like ""meh, you fill the gaps"". This movie tries to be Boyhood, but got nowhere close to it. It tries to arouse some feelings of sensitivity or social responsibility but became only superficial and narrow-minded. Cutting it short; Moonlight is just an overrated, over hyped, sponsored and politically backed up movie that nobody will remember within 3 months, yet to be an epic story."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,5/10,"An overrated averagely directed movie, in which viewers constantly search for plot or story. North American viewers grown up with such happenings in their surroundings may agree with the Academy Awards Jury for best picture 2017 but not me. I found Moonlight very boring and waste of my two hours.P.S The actors did justice with their roles."
MOONLIGHT,24 August 2018,10/10,"It's hard to review this movie succinctly. Because it's three distinct parts and their particular pain are so gorgeous in and of themselves I kinda want to write about everything that happens to these amazing boys (and then men). But you don't need to know what happens. You just need to reserve a couple of hours and press play. Let yourself get lost in the tender and vicious choreography of camera, performance, light and music that brings you constantly closer to this evolving little being. Such a dear human being trying to find a safe haven to be himself. To be tender and Warm. I connected so much to the story and this human we got to watch grow up. So happy it's here, I hope everyone watches this film."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,2/10,"Worst movie of the year! The Academy lost its mind completely. The movie is boring and lacking real content. The plot wasn't going anywhere. After about half an hour I realized the enormity of my mistake to watch this movie. Do yourself a favor, watch any stupid action movie with chases and hot chicks (or studs), just not this crap. Not that I have anything against quality dramas. I saw a lot of these this year and I enjoyed them very much."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2017,1/10,Whilst it was acted well the story just did not engage with me. The camera work in the opening section of the film appears designed to induce motion sickness!In the unlikely event I were to watch this on DVD I'd have the subtitles on so I can read what a lot of the dialogue and understand it - in English.For the audience this movie is targeted at it could be regarded as a master piece. It's not aimed at a general audience.Why 109 minutes instead of 111? I fell asleep I was that uninterested.
MOONLIGHT,25 August 2017,1/10,well. its on of the worst movies i have ever seen.Don't waste your time and energy. i don't know why people keep making movies like that. Just don't watch it. Don't.well. its on of the worst movies i have ever seen.Don't waste your time and energy. i don't know why people keep making movies like that. Just don't watch it.

Don't.well. its on of the worst movies i have ever seen.Don't waste your time and energy. i don't know why people keep making movies like that. Just don't watch it. Don't.
MOONLIGHT,17 April 2017,8/10,"This film touches us so closely and personally and shows that for so many of us human beings in a harsh urban world in the pursuit of our self awareness and the search for our own identity we have such little control over own destiny and for so many it is impossible to get out of the rut.The hand-held camera work in many settings and the slowness of the indoor scenes makes the audience come close to the characters. However, there's one shortcoming. At least for Australian audiences the dialogue deserved to have been subtitled as it was very difficult at times to follow what was being said. I do not wish to draw on this but if the European film public gets subtitles, some other English speaking countries deserve so too. A very well scripted film and we should have been able to clearly understand every word of it."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,8/10,"Although yes this is a story about an African American boy, I don't find race to be the center of the story-line. This boy had many complications. Being a small and quiet person brings forth bullies. Bullies can destroy leave lifelong emotional scars. Neglectful parenting, being a latch key kid or being different from your family can bring out strength or weakness from said child. Environment and adult influences can shape a person in either a good or bad way. Struggling with sexual confusion without clear answers or a unbiased confidant only leads to suppressed actions and emotions. Moonlight could have been in any upper, middle or lower class life and had the same basic story-line. Human emotion, connections and choices are what this movie speaks to. Anyone who's struggled with any of these situations can relate or at least empathized with this beautifully made movie."
MOONLIGHT,11 April 2018,3/10,"But it gave me so little to like. It was long, boring, and drug out very basic obvious scenes. It could have been condensed into a 30 minute short and would have lost nothing. 
The best character in the entire movie was the drug dealer Juan who became a father figure to the main character. 
Not much to see here really."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,6/10,"So basically, this dumbass director wants to portray people of his own colour as gay and junkies. ACT ONE Little boy with a mother who happens to love drugs more than him, constantly being verbally abusive and not caring about his wellbeing. The family who happen to welcome him and show empathy happen to be the ones selling drugs to the boys abusive mother. The little boys only friend happens to be gay without knowing and the other young boys only bully. So blacks basically bully homosexuals when their kids and grow up to become drug dealers or junkie parents.ACT TWO More of the same. Gay bullying, junkie mother wants drugs and more playtime between main guy and his only friend. A stupid hand job occurs out of nowhere and at that point you realise this crap only one the Oscar because they wanted a black film to win.ACT THREE Most pointless and non comprehensive act. Basically a long talk between the grown up drug dealing guy and his only friend. Moonlight is a load of rubbish and deserves the razzie. Its perfect for putting you to sleep after you've had 5757737 cups of high caffeinated coffee."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,10/10,"This is one of the best acted, directed, edited, and produced film I have seen this year. The acting is on point with every single actor especially the main protagonists and Mahershala Ali character. The writing though may seem slow paced impacted me emotionally especially, since I have lived in similar hostile environments as portrayed in Moonlight. The transition between each character is smooth and made me believe they were all one person. If a movie can me me cry both because it was sad and happy automatically for me is on top of my list (I'm rarely emotional for films). This is a film that I would wish that everyone who are of the gay community and especially in the black community will see."
MOONLIGHT,26 March 2017,2/10,"This movie is all about MEN love. I don't think so that movies deserve an Oscar. There is a 3 phase of this movie. Young, teenage and Adult. He doesn't really seems to be acting well in each character. I find this movie so boring. How can this movies got an Oscar i don't have any idea about that. It's really worthless."
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2017,10/10,"A delicate topic with good actors and good screenplay.No BS, very well done. I appreciate seeing a movie if the ideas or feelings are conveyed without exaggeration, something which we don't see in all movies nowadays."
MOONLIGHT,27 December 2019,10/10,"I came into this movie with high hopes, and I'm fully satisfied. It left me crying yet feeling joy at the same time. From the cinemaphotography to the realistic dialogue it touched me on an unreachable emotional level. More than a 7,4 is deserved for this beauty I just witnessed, and the fact that it won the Best Picture makes my heart soar in happiness.Well done team, well done!"
MOONLIGHT,16 February 2017,,"A sensitive, probing drama. Exploring America through race and sexuality. Beautifully acted, written, directed. To see black Americans portrayed with such complexity is so rare in mainstream American film. And then, on top of this, a sympathetic and positive portrait of gay men. I have a cringe meter which monitors how we, gays, are treated. Goes off constantly in most films. Not Moonlight, not a single cringe meter gong. Wonderful film."
MOONLIGHT,16 June 2017,7/10,"Moonlight 1st and 2nd act were interesting, but 3rd act has no surprises at all and there is really no point...unless that was the point.**SPOILERS for LaLa Land** At least LaLa Land had the concept that you may reach your dreams, but the consequences might be the loss of connection who knew you before you reached your dreams...Moonlight was not about the irony of relationships, or doesn't point out something gloomy or optimistic."
MOONLIGHT,27 June 2017,1/10,Looks like Obama and Oprah on acid doing a script. Trying to force this agenda which makes me think about the Oscar announcer's gaffe. The plot is really prolix and really takes you to nowhere. In which world the great turn over from a colored gay teenager is to became a drug dealer. Political purpose for sure! Don't waste your time!
MOONLIGHT,11 July 2020,1/10,"This film is about nothing...like there's is no good storyline and it's mostly about drug abuse,bullying etc. Oscar is rigged."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2017,10/10,"The movie moonlight which is adapted from the screenplay: ""In moonlight black boys look blue,"" Is possibly the best movie of the year. I know that is quite a statement but let me explain.Barry Jenkins has orchestrated the movie from an all black cast which not only fits the themes of the movie but also stomps upon the lesser touched ground of American cinema. The theater structure of the story where the story itself is divided into three acts is well executed and the cinematography is not only almost perfect but is also poetic. Here the music stands as a strong element to define the themes, the setting and the state of mind of the characters.Moonlight raises the bigger questions about self overcoming, race and the American dream and does it in a creeping kind of way so that you keep coming back. The question: ""Who is you"" which is continuously raised throughout the movie but it is truly only in the minds of the viewer that it can be answered definitely. Moonlight simply resonates within you long after you have left the cinema. It is jaw dropping well written and the cast members fit their roles to perfection without exception."
MOONLIGHT,24 January 2017,7/10,"The protagonist in Barry Jenkins' sophomore feature Moonlight is Chiron by name, and shy by nature. Bullied at school, neglected by his addict of a mother and wrestling with strong, complicated feelings for his best friend Kevin, Chiron is a world-weary wallflower of a young man whose difficult life contains only the smallest pockets of kindness. A Miami mystery in three acts, the film's first chapter deals with the young Chiron, better known as Little (Alex Hibbert); the second, his adolescent brushes with sex (Ashton Sanders); the third, Chiron the grown man (Trevante Rhodes), still hoarding the emotional baggage leftover from his early life. Adapting Tarrell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue for the screen, Jenkins reorganises the original story's nonlinear narrative into something cinematic, and rich with emotion, with a quivering, beating heart at its centre.USA 2016 111 minsDirector Barry Jenkinsmoonlight-movie.com ‚ñ∫ Trailer Though Jenkins casts three different actors in the role of Chiron, the consistency of the performances that he pulls from his young actors feels radical. From their body language to their verbal tics and downcast eyes, each version of Chiron feels as real a continuation of the character as an old friend growing up before your own eyes. The most striking of these central performances is Trevante Rhodes as Chiron's oldest iteration; despite his hardened, sculpted body, his soul remains soft with longing and lingering wounds.When local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali) finds nine-year-old Chiron hiding from bullies in his unlocked apartment, he takes it upon himself to look after him. He takes him to his girlfriend Teresa's house, feeds him and, in one lovely scene, teaches him how to swim.This is a film about the complexity of black masculinity and the very human hunger for connection. It is about the fragility that lies beneath a man's swagger ‚Äì what it means to be 'soft' and what it means to be strong. ""What's a faggot?"" the young Chiron asks his surrogate father, who pauses before responding carefully: ""A word used to make gay people feel bad."" From the fatherly tenderness displayed by Juan to Kevin's playful, lustful lopsided smile, Jenkins paints the men in this film with care. His male characters cry and cook and kiss and fight; their love scenes are affectionate and erotic and, most importantly, they are offered a healing, redemptive ending.With the help of cinematographer James Laxton, Jenkins finds poetry in all aspects of everyday life. A casual football game is turned into a ballet; precise framing transforms a lonely bath into meditation on existence. The use of midnight blues and purples, and the vast wides that encompass Chiron's single, isolated figure, work together to create an otherworldly atmosphere, all heightened sensation and simmering, feverish emotion.An aside: it's worth noting that film like this aligns almost exactly with my own personal tastes and thematic concerns. I knew that it was very likely, predictable even, that I would be interested in a story centred that dealt with the intersecting multiple identities of race, gender, sexuality and class. Yet I found that that the way Moonlight explores identity politics both challenged and surprised me, pushing and pulling at my expectations of what a coming-of-age film about a gay black teenager might be. Jenkins takes clich√©s about addiction, drugs, poverty, violence and homophobia in black America, and changes their context by shading familiar situations and archetypes of black life with careful detail and texture. He holds up stock images ‚Äì of the crack-addicted mother, the drug-dealing mentor, the bullied and sensitive queer kid ‚Äì to a cracked mirror, capturing how they refract and rebound in unexpected ways. It is thrilling, sensuous stuff."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,1/10,"Obviously Oscars gave them this reward as a compensation for being accused last year for being racist. The movie has no story, nothing special, doesn't worth to be even in the movie theater, I have wasted 2 hours for nothing. Nothing special about the act, story, photography, directing, very amateur and very boring."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2017,6/10,i was really intrigued by beginning of the movie even though it was a bit clich√©.The movie had a slow feel to it but that was exactly what i expected from a drama flick. Other than that i thought it was a good movie except for my beliefs coming into play.i am from a region which is bit homophobic and seeing the climax of the movie my head instantly dropped. because of this my rating for the movie instantly dropped to a 7 but as a result of the poor ending in my opinion it once again dropped but to a 6 this time. i thought there were so much more outcomes which could have come from the brilliant start.
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2017,10/10,"Moonlight is a film of great depth, concerning a gay black boy, teen, and man. The plot centers around a character that goes by three different names in three different eras of his life. The three different names are also, coincidentally, the three parts of the film. As a youth, it's obvious Little (played by Alex R. Hibbert) is a little different from other kids. He's bullied by the other kids at school. He likes to take hot baths. His crack head mother calls him a faggot and is far too aware of the way her son walks. Luckily for Little, Juan, a drug dealer, (played by Mahershala Ali) takes him under his wing, protecting him and mentoring him, telling him that ""no no, you could be gay, but don't let nobody call you a faggot."" Moonlight is a film filled with beautiful cinematography and music. Two great scenes occur in part one of the film. The first scene involves a sport played in the neighborhood played with a ball made out of newspaper. The kids in the neighborhood take this ball and run with it. The game is almost a mixture of soccer and rugby, and highlights the poverty of Little's life. Little first meets Kevin in this scene as well, (played by Jaden Piner in pt 1), a boy that will play an important part in his life throughout the film. There's also a scene where Little's mentor floats him in the ocean and teaches him how to swim. Both scenes are amazingly shot and have classical music playing throughout. These scenes are just a day in the life of Little, a confused boy trying to find himself. Little is still too young to truly know himself in part one, but as he transitions into being a teen in part two he has an experience he will never forget. He has a moment with another teenage boy on the beach, finding out that he is sexually into, at the very least, getting jerked off by Kevin from part 1, (now played by Jharrel Jerome in pt. 2), and feeling how good the Miami breeze can feel. As a teen Little, now known as Black (played by Ashton Sanders), is still bullied. Black still deals with his mother on the regular, but she now exploits him for cash to buy more crack. Black gets beat up and starts to find out he's into different things than most of the straight boys. In part three Black is still Black in part three (now played by Trevante Rhodes), and is getting buff and mean looking. He has some grills in his mouth and a chain around his neck. He now sells drugs in Atlanta, similar to his early mentor Juan from part 1. In part three Black receives a call from Kevin (now played by Andre Holland) inviting him to dinner back in Miami. Kevin visits his mother in rehab and has a moment, and then goes to meet Kevin in Miami. Black and Kevin end up hanging out and having dinner, drinking, and going back to Kevin's place. Black explains to Kevin that he's never been with anybody since the time on the beach so many years ago with Kevin. The film ends with a tender moment of the two more or less cuddling. Moonlight is a film of personal development and personal discovery. Little, Black, Chiron, whatever he is called throughout his years, is a man trying to discover why he's different from others. His issues are only exacerbated by the fact that he's poor and has a crack head mother. He is part of two oppressed groups, gays and black people. Even though he ends the film as a drug dealer, I couldn't help but feel he finally truly understood himself at the end of the film. He is a tough gangster, but he loves Kevin. Moonlight leaves you wondering what ends up happening to Chiron and Kevin, hoping they make it and can just chill and enjoy each other."
MOONLIGHT,25 January 2017,1/10,"I watched this film for two hours. Two whole hours that are gone. Forever. The film takes place in Miami. It's about a young black boy who grows up gay in a tough neighborhood. That's it. Lots of sitting on the beach. Lots of talking that doesn't go ANYWHERE. Overall, the film followed a tired format that paints a pretty bland and shallow picture about life in the ""hood."" Stereotypical characterization of black women. I honestly couldn't tell you the point of this film or write a more a more comprehensive summary because it's a waste of time.Why is this up for an award? With the exception of Ali--who is a really good actor whose talent is wasted in this film--I don't get it."
MOONLIGHT,12 January 2017,10/10,"After I saw ""The Arrival"", I was almost certain it was going to be my favorite film of the year. Nothing else I had seen in 2016 even compared. Then I went to the theater and saw ""Moonlight"". I actually had to wait a few days to fully process this movie. Absolute masterwork. In every aspect, this is perfect. Beautiful shots, great cinematography. Acting was the best I have ever seen in any film. The plot was presented very tastefully and mature, given the subject matter. I am standing by this word; if this film does not at least receive a nomination at the Oscars, I won't waste my time with them anymore. This film left me speechless and paralyzed for about 5 min after screening it. I am rarely affected this heavily by films today. Kudos to the writers/producers and cast/crew for a job well done. Without a doubt this receives my pick for film of the year and a perfect score of 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,3 December 2016,8/10,"I found this movie to be poignant, painful, and heartbreaking. All of the acting is stellar and genuine. I found the performances of Mahershala Ali and Alex Hibbert to be particularly stunning. The swimming scene with Juan and the young Chiron is particularly moving, sweet and heartfelt. The movie conveys the complexity of human nature -- how a person can be kind and caring, yet sell harmful drugs or how another character can show compassion toward his bullied friend but collude with the lowlife bullies. The bullying scenes wiped me out emotionally and I left the theater filled with melancholy. On the other hand, I somehow I felt hopeful after watching this movie and that feeling has stayed with me overall when I reflect back on the film."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,5/10,Multiple Oscar nominations was the hype behind the film and so I watched it but there isn't a lot of depth in the movie nor in its characters! The entire film story can be learnt from just the story paragraph in IMDb and believe me watching the movie then won't tell you any more.I like the fact that the director chose not to highlight white guys and their privileged life but chose to highlight reality of a black kid growing up in poor and crime-laden neighbourhood with lacking connection and relationships. Nothing special in my opinion!
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,10/10,"I loved this movie and knew it would win the Oscar, not because black actors had kicked up a fuss in previous year because they felt that they lack representation, but because it is simply the best movie I have seen this year. Manchester-by-the-Sea VERY close second through... All actors give a 5-star performance. A MUST SEE! I hope that the film will be watched in Africa and that it will deal positively with that continent's spreading homophobia."
MOONLIGHT,24 June 2017,1/10,"Seriously?!? HOW! This movie was nothing more than your stereotypical, ""I had it rougher in the hood, because I'm gay, and blacks aren't supposed to be gay crap"" I put this movie in terms of craptastic wastes of time, a close second to the movie Freedom Land. The academy awards snubbing well deserving, thought-provoking movies like Lion and Hidden Figures needs to go. For CHRISTsake they gave LA LA Land an award!"
MOONLIGHT,1 September 2017,10/10,"a motherfucking masterpiece. pure work of art.. hats off! what a performance!I was homophobic before but now I know how hard their life can be and they are also human.Barry Jenkins deserves each and every Oscar.Last 3 lines hit my heart so hard, I started crying. So moving! So emotional. The movie about friendship.Best love story I have ever seen on screen."
MOONLIGHT,24 August 2017,2/10,"I was hoping for this movie to be some great, artistic story but it was just the opposite of that. I don't even know where to start with Moonlight. First of all, the plot is very weak, there almost is none. It follows Chiron through three stages of his life. The casting for Chiron was actually pretty good. All three of the actors for him look surprisingly alike. The last actor has the worst performance of anyone. He doesn't really act like Chiron did in the last two parts but it was passable. One of my main problems is the casting for the character Kevin. In the first part, he is clearly black, as well as in the third part. But the actor who plays Kevin in the second part, as a teenager, is literally Latino. He's even said so in interviews and in a tweet. Nobody else seems to notice that Kevin switches races halfway through the movie. I didn't even know that the boy in the first part was supposed to be Kevin until I read it online. The music in Moonlight was very good, actually. I really enjoyed ""Little's Lullaby,"" (I think that's what its called). Its a shame that such beautiful music was wasted on this movie. The cinematography was good, if a little distracting. Another problem with this is that I felt no sadness when I learned that Juan had died. He was barely in it, how was i supposed to care if he died? We barely get to see the relationship between Little and Jaun. They could've showed a lot more scenes between them. Same goes for Chiron. The actors were good, especially the actors who play him as a child and teenager. Still, though, I really couldn't find a reason to care about what happened to him either way. It was boring with a weak plot and I couldn't wait for it to end. How this movie even got nominated for Best Picture is beyond me, nonetheless how it won."
MOONLIGHT,8 January 2021,5/10,I think it was a different narrative then we are used to seeing especially for it's time so that's what brought all of the hype. It was bold and forced people to watch a story that might make them uncomfortable. The acting was very well done. It has all of the potential to be great in my opinion. But the story fell flat.The final part doesn't fit with the rest of the film. And almost made the whole childhood sequence seem unnecessary. The adult Chiron (black) was poorly casted or if they wanted him they should have recasted the young adult Chiron. There was no development in the third sequence and it seemed unrealistic. Seemed the story had a perfect set up and then got lost somewhere trying to tell another story.
MOONLIGHT,11 October 2018,9/10,The plot isn't expansive or overly complicated. It works with little things in decent proportions to create something very beautiful.
MOONLIGHT,18 July 2018,10/10,"This is perhaps one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking that I have seen in a very long time. Everything about this movie is outstanding and beautiful. Barry Jenkins does such a great job of portraying how our experiences, both the good and the bad, truly shape who we are as human beings. I loved the soundtrack and the cinematography especially. This film is simply an engaging masterpiece that definitely was not what I was expecting.Moonlight depicts three important stages in the life of the protagonist, Chiron. The film begins by showing the first chapter in Chiron's life, titled ""Little."" The audience sees that Chiron is a quiet and reserved character who is often tormented by his peers. He is eventually taken in by Juan, a drug dealer, and his girlfriend, Teresa. It is also revealed that Chiron's mother is a crack addict who receives her drugs from Juan. In this chapter, Chiron meets Kevin, who introduces Chiron to the realities of boyhood. The second chapter, titled ""Chiron,"" focuses on Chiron during his adolescence. Chiron is still tormented by bullies and his mother has slipped further into addiction. However, Chiron reunites with Kevin and the two smoke a blunt on the beach (among other things). The next day, Kevin is pressured by a bully into fighting Chiron and this results in Chiron retaliating by beating the bully with a chair. Chiron is arrested and moves to Atlanta with his mother. The third and final chapter, titled ""Black,"" focuses on Chiron's adulthood. It is shown that Chiron has become a muscular drug dealer who resembles Juan. His mother, on the other hand, has been rehabilitated and wishes that Chiron would abandon the criminal life. Chiron and Kevin meet again at the restaurant where Kevin works. They discuss how they each progressed in life and drive to Kevin's. Once there, Chiron reveals that Kevin is the only person to ever touch him sexually. The two then embrace each other and the film concludes with a shot of black children playing under the moonlight.There is deep internal conflict with the character of Chiron. Throughout the film he is depicted struggling with his sexuality and masculinity. We see that Chiron copes with these internal struggles by being a quiet and reserved individual. Chiron's questioning of his sexuality is only further complicated by his relationship with Kevin. Chiron internalizes a lot of the personal traumas that he undergoes and this creates the character that the audience sees in the final chapter of the movie, a hardened and physically muscular individual who survives by intimidating those around him.The theme of bullying is present throughout a majority of the film. The audience sees that Chiron has dealt with bullies since childhood and we see the effect that this has on his character. There is also a complicated conflict that ensues between Kevin and Chiron, both characters are eager to validate their masculinity and this results in them being pitted against each other.While this film doesn't make a point of directly responding to social issues, Jenkins does address issues of poverty, drug abuse and homophobia through his characters. We see that a lot of what drives the conflict in this film are issues that are caused by society. Juan's desperation for financial security leads to him unknowingly supporting Chiron's mother's crack addiction. Traditional society's emphasis on hyper masculinity results in the teenage males engaging violence simply for the sake of validation. Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed was the visual symbolism. Moonlight places heavy emphasis on the color blue throughout the film, and this results in some memorably dope sequences that left me mesmerized. I also love how the film foreshadows the fight that is to take place between Chiron and Kevin by having the two playfully wrestle each other as children.At its core, Moonlight is a film that addresses a lot of the issues that afflict the Black community, but it does so through the unique perspective of a black male questioning his sexuality. This movie shows the way that hyper masculinity can detrimentally affect young people and how love can rectify this."
MOONLIGHT,25 September 2018,8/10,"So many ""hood "" movies out there & not many seem to stay true. This one gives a truth not many of us anticipated. 8/10"
MOONLIGHT,3 May 2019,8/10,"Such a powerful and necessary movie. So moving and thoughtful, with masculinity and race dynamics being the main themes that tie this important film together. Perfection."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2019,10/10,I was glued to the set. Was sad when it was over. Left me wanting to see more and more! The best movie and was so real to Life! Because of this I will now look up all Plan B entertainment movies. Great job all the actors and Brad Pitt!
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2019,10/10,"If you cannot relate on any form about this movie you won't begin to understand it! It brought alive so many emotions about the life of inner city youngsters and what they had to live through on a daily basis. It showed how his childhood monsters planted roots and sprouted who he became to be as a man. Oh, What a path his journey led him on!! From every aspect of his young life determined who he became and it happens right now in life.. Today!Awed by the film. I want more of these actors and director!Each actor and actress left a mark in my mind to come! I wasn't even aware some were indeed such great performers! Big fat kudos to all!! I even gave 2 reviews!!!"
MOONLIGHT,12 May 2019,9/10,"Moonlight is a very well made, beautifully shot film that is filled to the brim with great performances. It is very well paced and structured overall but some dialogue scenes do drag on a first viewing, this doesn't really affect it at all because even though the worse dialogue scenes aren't great, the best dialogue is really good and very genuine.
This movie is one of the most genuine feeling portrayals of a person who has had a rough and lonely life.
9/10"
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2018,10/10,"Loved it !! Beautiful Film and Beautiful Image. This is what a call a good film and an artistic movie! It is a real cinematic experience.
Love from Portugal!"
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2019,8/10,"Moonlight depicts the story of a young man growing up in a rough neighbourhood in Miami. Spanning from childhood to adulthood he embarks on the difficult journey of self-discovery and all the struggles that come with that. In many ways this movie is exceptional, the first two acts that deal with childhood and the teenage years of Chiron are perfectly told. Scenes so emotional and distressing with brilliant acting from the entire cast, particularly Mahershala Ali. Although a little underused he certainly gives an Oscar worthy performance. The dialogue between the actors feels so natural you really start to believe what you're watching is real. The soundtrack is as unique and original as the movie, suiting it perfectly."
MOONLIGHT,1 September 2020,7/10,"Moonlight had so much potential. The main problem I had with the movie was the third act. The movie was amazing up until Chiron hit Terrell with a chair. The editing and the look of the movie. Amazing. But the third act. I was waiting for the credits to roll as soon as the third act started. The third act was too slow. The first two acts had very nice pacing. Everything happened fast and the movie knew when to slow down. The third act felt very long. And nothing really happens. We are shown he is a drug dealer and still has nightmares of his mother. He reconciles with his mom and meets Kevin again. This did not need to be as long as it was in the movie. Many unnecessary scenes. There is one scene where he talks to a drug dealer that works for him. I understand this scene was meant to show how much meaner and tougher he has gotten over the years, but the scene felt very out of place. And the actor who played Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) had the weakest performance out of the three Chirons. The scene where he meets his mom again was way too short. Contrary to popular opinion, the actress who played Paula (Naomie Harris) wasn't as amazing as people say she was. She did a good job, but in a movie like this, She had to be amazing. One minor problem I had was how Trevante Rhodes didn't look anything like the other two actors. Some could say this was intentionally, but I believe they just couldn't find an actor that looked like the other two.But the movie is still good. I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates well made films. This movie gets a 7/10 for the fantastic first two acts."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,10/10,Most of the other reviewers appear to have seen a different film from the one I saw. Or perhaps they fell asleep because there wasn't enough action. One commentator claims to have seen better stuff on TV; perhaps this person should stick to box sets that give instant thrills but fail to remain in the mind and imagination. The film reminds me of the Terence Davies Trilogy (7.6 on IMDb) in mood and pace and it's a hopeful sigh that this thought-provoking film has received an Academy Award.
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2019,10/10,"An amazing movie i have recently watched online, still i need to watch this movie coz of the artist array"
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2020,4/10,I was really looking forward to watch this movie and I really hope it was going to be a good one. The story was oke.. The acting was decent.. but the flow of the movie? Just bad i'm sorry. This one doesn't deserve the oscar for best picture.
MOONLIGHT,25 October 2019,5/10,"Nothing happens in this movie. They do a good job of depicting a person's life, which can be kind of sad. But nothing really happens."
MOONLIGHT,23 March 2020,9/10,"I thought it was going to be about coming out as gay within the black community but it wasn't, at least not mainly. I read reviews about it already so I might repeat myself but I also think that it is a story about not being loved, not being sheltered, drug abusive parents, growing up, being bullied, feeling lost... the cinematography, the dialogues, the music is extraordinary and made the movie really special. I also enjoyed the acting."
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2020,10/10,This story speaks on so many relevant issues and I was truly touched and impressed by the performances in this movie. Wonderful filmmakers.
MOONLIGHT,22 November 2020,1/10,"Terrible, the full filme for this end?! Ridiculous!"
MOONLIGHT,22 December 2020,1/10,"If anyone ever noticed why this movie got and Oscar, text me please! I'm sitting here be like what the hell?! Was this the best movie they could find in 2017?! There wasn't any other movie?! Btw I rated this movie 1. I would have rated it 0 if there was one!"
MOONLIGHT,15 May 2020,10/10,I totally would recomend you to watch this movie.. is slow/dramatic :) be ready
MOONLIGHT,2 May 2020,10/10,"This film is a masterpiece and absolutely deserved Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I see many "" one star"" reviews on this site and this no doubt has to do with an objection to the LGBT subject matter. Ironically though this isn't really a ""gay film"" Yes, there is implied homosexuality and bisexuality but nowhere is the film explicit about this. I found this film to focus much more on childhood trauma and the shells that we all (regardless of sexuality) build around ourselves to survive this world. This film is shot beautifully and the acting is top notch even though many of the actors are in thier debut role. I related to this movie in many ways and I have never cried harder at an ending as I did here. Bravo, Barry Jenkins!"
MOONLIGHT,2 August 2020,6/10,The movie is very bad and not worth seeing. It has no logical story nor great characters. The movie is just bad
MOONLIGHT,17 June 2017,1/10,"Yeah, having won best picture Oscar along with other two I was interested to watch it. But after two hours, what a disappointment. Slow, uninteresting story, (though the performances were very good), unimportant dialogues. I really don't give a .... for people like the ones depicted here. All in all, what a boring piece of crap. Don't waste your time. Hollywood people has lost their way."
MOONLIGHT,8 May 2021,8/10,"I would say that this movie is one of the best productions I have seen. The script and the filming, some of the best work I have seen. Recommend this to everyone!"
MOONLIGHT,31 May 2021,10/10,Exceedingly beautiful throughout. Incredibly powerful storytelling and character development with minimal dialogue.Those giving this film a bad review for having a bad story arc due to the lack of dialogue evidently need to be spoon-fed every crumb of information through constant talking to be able to understand what is going on in a film.
MOONLIGHT,7 October 2021,2/10,"The movie might be good at cinematography, but it has nothing to offer us at the story part. Just a bunch of scenes next to each other for 2 hours."
MOONLIGHT,18 March 2017,7/10,"Being a gay man myself, I surely wanted to love this movie, especially after all the rave reviews and awards it was given.We were a group of five gay men and one straight woman. When we got out of the theater, four of the five gay men, myself included, instantly confessed that the film had hardly managed to move or touch us. The fifth one said that he found the film pretty good, but also didn't give me the impression that he was ""completely smashed"" by it. The only one of us who was in her own words ""absolutely stunned"", was our straight friend. ;) She was all teared-up and could hardly speak, because the movie had apparently moved her so deeply.I found this all very strange and have since tried to figure out, how this reaction could be explained. I have to admit, that I had a very similar experience with the equally highly acclaimed ""Brokeback Mountain"" when I first saw that approximately 12 years ago.I think, that ""we"" homosexuals simply react very differently to this specific kind of stories for pretty obvious reasons. We've BEEN there ourselves, in a manner of speaking. Of course, I'm not saying that I was a cowboy living in the Midwest somewhere back in the 1960's and 1970's, neither did I grow up as black child in a precarious and drug-ridden environment in southern Florida. That's simply not the point I'm making here.It's just that, having grown up as a gay man myself, I know EXACTLY what it feels like to have to hide one's true identity for a prolonged period of time, not to allow oneself to have ""those feelings"" towards other boys or men, to be mobbed and sometimes ostracized for the mere fact of being ""different"".Sometimes I think that these movies are specifically made by straight people for a predominantly straight audience. Because ‚Äî and I really don't mean that in a patronizing way ‚Äî they need to be explained what it all feels like, because THEY, of course, never had to experience it for themselves. So the same elements that have a very strong impact on a straight audience do not necessarily have the same effect with a gay one.However, I also have to say that I thought the way that the story is told is a little ""off"". First of all, I found it EXTREMELY strange that one of the primary characters of the movie, Juan (played by Mahershala Ali), simply ""vanishes"" at one point and is only vaguely referenced one more time in the film by Chiron's mother mentioning a ""funeral"" that the audience never saw, nor could know or even guess at the time that Juan was already dead!This is probably THE single most influential person for the development of Chiron's character throughout the movie. Chiron later even copies Juan in becoming a drug dealer himself, riding in a similar car with the exact same ""wobbly crown"" behind the windshield, wearing the exact same black bandanna etc.So then why on earth is it, that this tremendous loss, which had to be VERY traumatic for Chiron, is not in any way, shape or form, displayed or properly addressed by the film? This is something that I still cannot get my head around! I really think that this was just too big of an ellipsis for the story and literally qualifies as a ""goof""! And I also wonder if the scene in which one sees Juan die was actually shot and then cut from the final movie? Really looking forward to the extras on the Blu-ray here!Also, in the very beginning of the movie, there is, at least to my mind, no real explanation given as to why Juan, this bad-ass drug dealer, takes it upon himself to look after that ""strange little boy"" in his neighborhood in the first place. I mean, of course, I can THINK of MANY possible motivations for him to do it! What I'm saying is that none is actually given. He simply DOES it.And that's something I have been realizing for quite some time now, that an increasing number of Hollywood screen writers seem to think that it's perfectly enough to show the audience WHAT happens, but not really explain to them WHY it happens! And I have to add that I don't like this tendency at all! Because I think that it's ESSENTIAL for the audience to be able to really UNDERSTAND why the characters in a movie do what they do (or don't do what they don't do). So that's something that bothered me about ""Moonlight"" as well.Aside from all that criticism, I still think that ""Moonlight"" is a good movie. Especially Naomi Harris playing Chiron's drug-addicted mother is a real highlight. She does an amazing job! Also, the three actors playing Chiron at the various stages in his life, are very well cast and all manage to play the character while maintaining his peculiar idiosyncrasies. Of course, being a gay man, I also couldn't help but notice that Trevante Rhodes, who plays the adult Chiron or ""Black"", is an amazingly good-looking man with a, dare I say, jaw-dropping body. ;) But not only that. I really thought that he in particular brought some very interesting nuances to the character, and I keep wondering why HE wasn't nominated for his performance, instead of Mahershala Ali, who's performance was certainly good, but at least in my view not ""Oscar-warrantingly"" good. But I admit that I may be a bit biased here. ;PSo here it is, my two cents on the film ""Moonlight"". It's certainly worth watching. But I don't think it really deserved the ""Best Motion Picture"" award it got from the Academy. By the way, I didn't think that ""La La Land"" would have deserved that award, either. But that's another story and maybe another review. ;)"
MOONLIGHT,11 March 2017,1/10,The first thing I can tell about Moonlight is that it is completely overrated. I haven't seen anything extraordinary about the film. Everything was slow and boring. I kept looking at the clock during the film to see how many minutes were left. I don't understand how it got all these Oscar nominations. The other nominees were way better than Moonlight. I regret that I spent two hours of my time on this highly overrated film :(
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,10/10,"Rarely do I contribute my thoughts on a film to this site. However, after viewing Moonlight, I feel compelled to, as I now agree with critical praise and ultimately, the academy's decision to award it the Oscar for best picture.I had heard about Moonlight around its initial release in November of 2016. I am from a relatively artsy community in Western Massachusetts, where there are multiple independent cinemas willing to show such films. Having briefly heard the synopsis, a coming of age drama centered on an African American male coming to terms with poverty and homosexuality, I decided to put this on the back burner. As a white heterosexual male, raised in an upper middle class family, I had decided the story line was something that I could not relate to.Then the Oscars came along and reminded me that Moonlight may in fact be a film that I should consider viewing. Ideally, I enjoy taking in all best picture nominees, and thus far had been rather unimpressed with the likes of Manchester by the Sea, Arrival and La La Land. My contenders were Hell or High Water or Hacksaw Ridge. The night of the Oscars, I still had not seen the film, but when it was awarded best picture, I decided I had to watch it as soon as possible.Within the first few scenes I could tell that I was watching something special. I was drawn into the story and surprisingly, against my preconceived notions, could identify with some of the struggles Chiron (our main character) faced.This film, although having an entirely African American cast, is not solely about race, nor is it solely about sexual identity. It is a film about growing into your own skin and the struggles we all face in finding comfort there. This is a film for anyone who has had issues with family, fitting into social groups, or even communicating simple human emotions. It deals with addictions, bullying, and friendship. Moonlight is one of the few films that I have seen that captures a realistic view of life, in the broadest sense of the word. When watching this film, I would imagine any viewer would have difficulty in not finding a way to relate to one of the many characters.Although I rarely agree with the outcome of the Oscars, I believe that this year the Academy got best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor right. The story is outstanding, the acting stellar and the cinematography incredible. This is an amazing work."
MOONLIGHT,28 March 2018,1/10,"Yeah, it was a well-thought-out movie. My girlfriend didn't like the ending. If this film was submitted for a class, the teacher would return it with a bad grade. She would include a note ""saying you could have had a better conclusion.There's additional personal opinions but hey I'm the boyfriend what do I know.Let's be honest, could have been the better."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,5/10,"What a very weird movie. I watched it with my wife and the beginning was quite interesting. Then they moved to the mid-life of the character and it was still OK to watch, but then the adulthood was very boring and pointless. I don't think this movie deserves best film award, and I don't see what's all the fuss about. The acting is very good and direction is good, but the story is pointless and the ending leaves you wondering why on earth did I just spend two hours watching this weird film."
MOONLIGHT,4 December 2017,6/10,"Moonlight is not a bad movie. But it's certainly not a good one, either. The characters are inconsistent, the screenplay doesn't seem to know which storyline it wants to follow, and the most interesting things happen off screen. We go from A to B with no good reason, and not in a surreal kind of way, but in a bad writing kind of way. Meh all the way, had fun watching it for all the wrong reasons. Cannot understand where the hype comes from."
MOONLIGHT,24 April 2018,10/10,"I have read a few of the very negative reviews. And I think I can understand, that everyone has a very different 'take' on the journey that is their life. So i'm only going to say that this movie moved 'me'. It is a story that I relate to in terms of the isolation that sometime happens to a life through being Gay (or perhaps many other reasons) it seems to me this movie told a simple story very well. We all search for an acceptable version (of ourselves) and we all search for connections with others so that we can recognize that we are human.
I have no cultural connection to the setting (african American, drug use etc) of this story, but I found a true connection to the humanity of it."
MOONLIGHT,6 June 2017,4/10,"Just because a movie is trying to tell a striking and sensitive story, doesn't make that film very good, or even worthy of the title ""Best movie of the year"".It was boring. It was slow. Visually it was good enough. But story- wise, there was not much going on.I mean, it's easily one of those movies that you would watch on the TV one afternoon. It makes you feel, maybe, but it doesn't make you think. It doesn't excite. It doesn't break your heart either. It's all there, a movie as a complete package, but over-hyped."
MOONLIGHT,25 December 2020,1/10,"All hype! This film is massively overrated and never delivered.
I really wanted to like this film but it just went nowhere.
Not a classic and will never be remembered. How did this win an Oscar for best film?????
Easily forgotten once watched."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2017,10/10,"More than a movie MOONLIGHT is an experience.Langston Hughes asked ""What happens to a dream deferred?"" Barry Jenkins asks what happens to a human being is not allowed to be? This is a story about someone trying to grow into what they are meant to be while being hedged in by unmitigating boundaries of racism / white supremacy, homo-hatred and class.Barry Jenkins lets us see what happens to his protagonist and to the community he is a part of. But by turns Mr. Jenkins also finds ways to put us in the protagonists shoes so that we experience the effect of his world on him.If you have experienced disappointment as a child and learned to cope with it, this movie will speak to you.Stunningly acted with fierce vulnerability and commitment. This film is deserving of every award and nomination it gets and some it won't get."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,1/10,I would like my 2 hours back please. I thought this would be a good movie because it did just win the Oscar for best picture. Maybe they didn't mess up and should have given it to La La Land. This movie was like Drive but without the cool synth music and with even less dialogue.
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"This movie is boring in the most awful way, and how it won the Oscars baffles me - I have a feeling there is a lot agenda behind the win and very little objectivity.The acting is not that good either. The only error in the Award ceremony is that the win went to this disaster."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,2/10,"is not even a interesting gay love history (as it could be broke back mountain), poor acting, poor history, one of those movies where you are expecting something good to happen, until you see the final credits and you realize that you wasted 2 hours of your life. I really don't get the criteria that the academy used to rate this movie......"
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,10/10,"I got quite emotional watching this and was quite disappointed to read all the bad reviews. Maybe you just didn't get it and/or aren't empathetic enough. I really felt for the main character growing up with a mother addicted to meth that didn't care for him, maybe because I can relate. His safe haven amongst a storm was the supportive Teresa and Blue and for me this was my Nan. 'Little' was great at showing how much life affected him emotionally. You see the struggles of being different amongst the main character's peers, to being bullied for this, to trying to understand his sexuality. Some people are still against homosexuality and that can have dire consequences on the individual, which I have witnessed first hand many times. He ends up on the block and sometimes it is hard to steer in the right direction instead of walking in the path created for you. I cried when he met Kevin again, the only man that he has ever loved. ""black boys do look blue in the moonlight"""
MOONLIGHT,12 December 2016,10/10,"A film adapted from a play by Tarell McCraney, Moonlight is the cinematic fictional tale of a young black male growing up in Liberty City, a tough neighborhood in Miami. I was attracted to this movie for a number of reasons; it has an African American director, an all black cast, and the trailer is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Moonlight has been getting extensive critical acclaim and after viewing it for myself, I can attest that it is well deserved. The lead character, Chiron has to deal with bullying from the neighborhood kids, neglect from his drug addicted mother, as well as the overwhelming confusion about his sexuality. In this coming of age story, director Barry Jenkins illustrates this fable using three chapters. The first chapter follows Chiron through his childhood, while the next chapter picks up with Chiron in high school. The final chapter depicts Chiron as a young man. I enjoyed the way the movie transitioned from one chapter to the next; each chapter ending at a pivotal moment in Chiron's life and the following chapter starting with little mention of what took place in the interim. At times, characters would briefly mention events that occurred outside of the movie's time frame in a way that does not feel forced, much like the film's seamless dialogue. Characters' exchanges have a genuineness that leaves the viewer feeling as if they are eavesdropping on real conversations. It is almost as if the dialogue is not scripted at all; a testament to the high quality of the performances. The acting is first class all around; from the three lesser-known actors playing Chiron, to the more recognizable stars like Janelle Monae and Mahershala Ali. Every actor played a major part in contributing to my emotional investment in the film and the characters. Mahershala Ali's name has been mentioned quite frequently in regard to a possible Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Chiron's father figure Juan, but the standout performance in my eyes comes from Naomie Harris. She plays Chiron's mother Paula, and is the only actor in each chapter of the movie. Ali puts forth a heart-wrenching performance through which the viewer can watch her character evolve from one chapter to the next alongside Chiron. At times it was very difficult to watch because Ali's performance feels so authentic, leaving the viewer feeling even more empathetic towards Chiron. I enjoyed Moonlight because I related heavily to the main character. As a youth I was shy, introverted, and did not fit in with other boys my age, similar to Chiron. Out of a desire to fit in, I conformed to the societal norms set in place for young black males. I pretended to enjoy activities in which I had no interest. In doing so, I lost sight of who I was and what made me happy, which is illustrated beautifully in Moonlight. As much as I enjoyed Moonlight, I have to admit I found the ending to be anticlimactic. There are many character arcs the movie left unexplained that worked most of the time, but I expected more from the ending. However, I reminded myself that cinema is an art form, and the best art is left to the spectator to interpret. With that being said, Moonlight is a film that everyone should see to come to his or her own conclusion. After further processing Moonlight, I have grown to enjoy how it ended and have found it to be one of the best films I have seen this year. If you are a fan of cinema like myself and appreciate exceptional acting, great storytelling, and beautiful cinematography, I urge you to support Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,8 February 2017,3/10,"Reading other peoples' comments makes me a minority I believe, but there was just something that didn't win me over with Moonlight. Don't get me wrong, my favorite movie genre is drama and I really appreciate deep and artistically made coming-of-age dramas too, but I could barely contain my restlessness in these two hours. There was so little dialogue (and even if it was there, it didn't bear any importance) that it was difficult for me to get to know the characters, let alone like them or care for them. Although the plot may be relatable to some people, it just wasn't original. It felt like one clich√© was followed by another. Maybe the main problem is that I couldn't wait to watch it, I read so many brilliant reviews and eight Oscar nominations built up my expectations. Well, Moonlight in my opinion was a disappointment and even though I wanted to like it, it just didn't happen. I will still give the movie a 3 because it is not a disaster, the acting is decent and I appreciate the director didn't want to show another story of a white and privileged man. Movies with this type of message are important for our society, but I would not recommend watching this particular one."
MOONLIGHT,15 June 2017,1/10,"Like many I had heard all the rave reviews about Moonlight and obviously seen that it had won the Best Picture Oscar, so when my wife suggested we watch it I thought it was a good idea. Two hours later, when the film ended seemingly abruptly, after yet another mind numbingly boring piece of dialogue between two characters I could care less about, we both just looked at each other and thought ""What the......."". I think we both assumed that we had missed something because apart from a few interesting observations and well acted scenes this is a truly awful movie. I have heard that the key to the movie lies within the silences, which is another way of saying ""I've got no idea why I should like this movie, but everyone else says it's amazing, so I'll say that it's all about the silences and people will just nod knowingly"". The characters could have been explored in so much more depth, and there definitely should have been more time spent on the mother, played very well by Naomie Harris. Oh well, that's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back!"
MOONLIGHT,14 September 2017,7/10,"who is you?"" This question echoes throughout Moonlight, the breathtaking second feature from Medicine for Melancholy director Barry Jenkins. A coming-of-age story about a young man from a hardscrabble Miami neighbourhood, this kaleidoscopic gem focuses on three periods of its subject's life, chaptered by the different names and identities he assumes, or is given ‚Äì ""Little"", ""Chiron"" and ""Black"". Lending heartfelt voice to characters who have previously been silenced or sidelined, Moonlight is an astonishingly accomplished work ‚Äì rich, sensuous and tactile, by turns heartbreaking and uplifting. The first time I saw it I swooned; the second time I cried like a baby. I can't wait to see it again.Inspired by playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney's postgraduate theatre project ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"", Jenkins's film opens with a scrawny kid nicknamed ""Little"" (Alex Hibbert) being chased into a derelict house from which he is rescued by Juan (Mahershala Ali). Imposing yet gentle, Juan is a drug dealer whose addicted clients include Little's increasingly bedraggled mother, Paula (Naomie Harris). Aided by his nurturing partner, Teresa (Janelle Mon√°e, who also co-stars in Hidden Figures; see review overleaf), Juan takes a parental interest in this lost boy, who forlornly asks: ""Am I a faggot?"" so in my opinion this movie is overrated good acting and cinematography but the story wasn't deep enough"
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,8/10,"Moonlight succeeds on a lot of levels: the cinematography is magnificent, the directing is great, the acting delivers what it needs to all around, and it focuses on very important problems in contemporary America. What the movie lacks is character development of the lead. While characters played by Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monae are well developed with only 30 minutes (or less) of screen time, Chiron is left alone as a bit of a vessel-- he feels like a shell used to make the statement of the movie. The film relies on events to define Chiron instead of finding more subtle ways to define him, like developed relationships, and dialogue. Once the third act kicks in, we see more development and much more dialogue, but it's too late. By the end, Chiron is left without the character arc that he deserves. We frustratingly don't have much to hold on to about him. The trajectory of Chiron's life, his inability to escape from the problems of his area, is integral to the film. But while keeping his outer life stagnant with the environment, his emotions were forgotten in the process, resulting in a relatively unchallenging protagonist in an otherwise very compelling film."
MOONLIGHT,28 January 2017,10/10,"What's so impressive about Moonlight is how incredibly real it feels. Despite the protagonist, Chiron, being a character often looked by society, the film has an unnerving sense of realism. The script is so real and engaging because everything drives the story forward. Every word uttered makes you think about the overarching story and characters, about identity and masculinity, and about yourself. The film is massive yet intimate; confident, yet not pontificate. Chiron is played by three actors for the three depicted periods in his life. They all portray Chiron masterfully, but they don't feel like imitations of each other. Director Barry Jenkins restricted the actors from seeing each others' interpretations so that Chiron would feel like a slightly different character throughout his life, and despite this, the film doesn't feel episodic. It feels like a linear story told in the best way it ever could have been.Not a single moment in the film felt flat‚Äìthere is not a single misstep. It wrestling with the idea of societal expectation‚Äìprojecting strength, and hiding vulnerability. The only criticism I can make for this movie is that it didn't fully hook me. The first time I watched each of my favorite films, I was white-knuckled on the edge of my seat from the first frame of the movie. Moonlight didn't so that for me. It's a beautiful story that builds to a very emotionally satisfying finale, but it just didn't enthrall me as much as I would have liked it to. Still, that is a very subjective opinion. Moonlight is undoubtedly one of the best movies of our time. It features marvelous acting, cinematography, screenplay, soundtrack, and casually lyrical camera-work.This movie will forever live among the greats and absolutely deserves a 10 out of 10."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,9/10,"moonlight is a richly detailed and personal story of a boy growing up in a time and place that is ever so trying to change who he is. Chiron is the character we follow through this journey, and he is played by three actors excellently. the casting choices were absolutely brilliant and each of the actors managed to capture the main essence of Chiron, the sadness, the little shred of hope trying to blossom, and trying to be who he wants to be. the film heavily relied on each actors facial expressions, and they all did a wonderful job, most notably the child actor in the first act, who was fantastic, which is a rare sight in film these days. each actor conveyed a lot through their eyes, and the actors made it really believable that they are playing the same character, except you can tell through each of the acts that this character has gone through a lot emotionally. this film expertly explores themes of experiences changing who we are, and with every scene, moonlight explores this theme and many others. there is tons of symbolism in the film, they're subtle and smartly placed, and a lot that i will discover after rewatches. there is not a single scene that feels misplaced, or unnecessary, they all serve a point in developing this very interesting character. it doesn't waste time with events that have no effect on the story, or random subplots that are only there to add minutes to the movie. everything has a purpose. the directing all through out the film is mesmerizing, by Barry Jenkins. i wouldn't say it was perfectly directed, but he managed to craft a beautiful looking film, with the cinematography constantly emphasizing certain colors. and the score was absolutely haunting and masterful in it's use, and it completely diverged from the conventional type of music you would hear in a film that takes place in this area. definitely one of the best scores i've heard in a while, and it exceptionally conveyed how Chiron was feeling, and how much he has changed through out each act.the acting all around the board was great, Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris absolutely deserved the attention from the Oscars they got, and were essential aspects to this story.i absolutely love moonlight, it is a timeless film, and an exceptional piece of film making. it intelligently avoids clich√©s, and gives a realistic view of a person that is trying to survive in a world that is trying to change him. moonlight should be viewed by film fans, and fans of incredible story telling, and characters."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,6/10,"The film starts very well.First and second parts are really good. Acting is fabulous. Third part was a big disappointment, main actors and characters in particular.I would rate 7 for the first part, 9 for the second, and only 2 for the third (although such a low rating may be biased by disappointment). So ... I rate 6 in average. What a shame!"
MOONLIGHT,13 February 2021,8/10,Please watch this film I guarantee you won't be disappointed! It's so incredibly moving and visually stunning.
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2019,1/10,How did Ali win a award for this when he was only in the movie for less than 10 minutes. Over rated movie. Nothing at all special or memorable.
MOONLIGHT,14 April 2020,4/10,"I thought this was an Oscar. But nope. Far from it. Watchable but boring with a lot of pauses. They build up the end but instead of showing the unsatisfied desire of long lost love, it was just a cuddle. NOPE!"
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,1/10,"Did the Academy actually watch this movie? The small glimmer of light was the actor that won for best supporting. Outside of that - no plot, character development is next to zero and straight out boring. I am struggling to understand its IMDb rating. Maybe the card was right and La La Land should have won (I haven't watched this movie but it has to be better). Pick up the tax act and read it for two hours - more enjoyable."
MOONLIGHT,23 January 2017,6/10,"I am pleased i saw this film on pre-release in a packed cinema. Knowing little of the film i had no preconceptions. I am not a fan of 'lovestories' and yet again i found my attention waning during the film and understand why some people chose to leave. The film centres around Chiron a young African American boy growing up confused and outcast. The film follows his development from boy to man. The subject matter is an important one: bullying, addiction, sexuality, and ultimately a man wrestling with who he is. Unfortunately i found it hard to engage with any of the characters on the screen except Chiron's boyhood friend, Kevin. I wanted to understand more about the events that pulled these two characters of Chiron and Kevin together but the 'big' events were only eluded to and never shown, which i feel would have been far more interesting in seeing how Chiron's character deals with these events. As it stands we are left with protracted vague dialogues that really do not go anywhere. I cant help but draw comparisons with Boyhood - focusing on the 'insignifant' moments of growing up rather than telling a story - but i feel Moonlight had more to offer especially considering the subject matter. There are a lot of positives, there was a clear intimacy between the characters and the use of visuals is clever but it ultimately felt it lacked the explosive few scenes that would have elevated it to something truly great."
MOONLIGHT,4 November 2018,7/10,"This is a beautifully shot movie. Almost every frame is interesting until the last half hour or so. The director seems to be a natural in that sense. This is definitely not the best movie of the year, but it seems to hit all the right sociopolitical notes to get Oscar attention. The biggest problem is the story. I understand it's a character piece and Chiron is a well developed character--and all three people that play him are excellent.The inner struggle for self discovery is fine for a movie, but unless you're totally invested in the character, it doesn't have the impact the makers are looking for. I think of American Beauty as a great example of this. The heart of the movie was Lester's struggle to rediscover himself. The difference is, he had the two driving forces of his wife and the girl he wanted to bang. This drove the character, and thus the plot. Another, more successful example of this type of story is Hustle and Flow. DJay was struggling to become someone. His passion for music and desire to be a success drove him.This movie needed a stronger plot element to drive the tension. The conflict with the mother was probably the avenue to do this. This element was way underplayed. I understand what they were going for, but they didn't drive it home hard enough. And Ali...he was in the movie for like ten minutes...why did he win for best supporting actor? This is another reason why I think the books were cooked on this movie winning Oscars."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,7/10,"So you wake up and find that Moonlight won the Oscar for Best Picture. Against La La Land. Against Manchester By The Sea. Against Hacksaw Ridge. OK...""Moonlight"" is not a bad movie, by no means. It has great moments, beautiful cinematography, interesting dialogue during the scenes and nice acting (although not amazing) - is nomination for Best Picture is acceptable. The problem is that this isn't an Academy Movie Winner. The main character lacks a more profound development, the ""third scene"" is close to nothing (it adds basically anything) and, at some point, we've seen this film before - just remember ""Boyhood"".So, it's a nice movie, interesting, but pure and simply not good enough to conquer Oscars Night."
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,8/10,"Three things make this film worthy of the award and the attention it got.1. The story. It's not (only) a story about bullying. It's not only about hard growing up. It's not that favorite Hollywood clich√© of children becoming friends with adults. It's not a gay love story. It's not a story of (un)fulfillment. Rather, it's a story of all difficulties of growing up, coping with one's sexuality, surviving in a hard neighborhood, treating children like adults. About how all this is intertwined.Paula, Chiron's mother is a drug user and cannot bring her child up properly. A better-put couple starts taking care of him (irony, she buys from them), she feels threatened, but cannot stop the alienation, can't help but treat her son awfully. Years later, she tells her son that he is not obliged to love her, only to know she loves him.Juan, the drug dealer and his girlfriend Teresa gain Chiron's trust day by day. The price they have to pay is the burden of telling him all the harsh truths; why do the other children in the school call him a faggot, what (or who) is responsible for his mother's situation. Kevin seems to not lack self esteem like his childhood friend, he helps Chiron stand up to the bullies, he helps his way out of the closet. Yet his confidence collapses like a house of cards when the bullies decide to turn one victim against the other.Chiron's got only one moment in his childhood and adolescence that things seem to make sense: the moment with Kevin. And that's where I think the whole movie makes sense. It's the link between all the past humiliation with the betrayal of the next day. It's the moment where all the harshness of Chiron's life comes to a reconciliation, only to return once the moment passes. It's the moment that becomes such a burden that it prevents Chiron from connecting to any other human being for the next 10 years. It's exactly nothing more than a fragile moment, and I think the movie has done a great job in depicting it as such. Chiron crying ¬´ you don't even know ¬ª to the teacher concentrates the immense desperation coming from all this injustice.He decides to serve justice all alone, since the lawful means his teacher suggests will not punish the actual bully nor does he want his emotions for Kevin get in the way.The second moment that binds the movie altogether is Chiron crushing a chair onto the bully's head. His determination to not let the bully get away with what he's done and to not indulge in this ¬´ victim vs victim ¬ª little thing the bullies launched is shown in just a few seconds, and leads to a change of paramount importance ; Chiron changes environment, starts a new life we know very few about, starts to build himself tough (a metaphor of this are the body building scenes).Chiron builds himself but not in the way capitalist individualism wants us to ; he is shaped by the events of his life, until he decides to have a word in this procedure in order to survive. Violence too, doesn't come from some obscure drug mafia, it is shaped by an everyday life full of difficulties and the indifference (or incapacity) of teachers/authority, then takes its turn reshaping everyday life.And this tough guy Chiron has become in the third chapter lets us know that there are unresolved contradictions following him. In fact, this whole story ends as an unresolved contradiction ; Kevin, confident in the past, ends up saying that nothing he does is what he wants to do. Yet mentioning his child makes him genuinely happy. Laura says she loves her son, but admits she has done little to prove it. Chiron depends on no-one anymore and doesn't let people touch him, but drives all the way back to see Kevin.Even though it seems this has some kind of redemption (too easy one could say), some kind of happy end, the contradictions lying underneath make sure that the final scene is no end at all.2. No superficial drama. I particularly admired the direction and the acting for building the drama from within. The film did not need a dramatic scene for Juan's death for example. His absence is enough.Laura's abuse is shown in a mere 3-4 short scenes, one for the drugs, one for sending him sleep elsewhere, one for the money, one for the terrible realization that she hasn't shown enough love.The two emotional scenes between Kevin and Chiron (one as adolescents, one 10 years later) are built on the tension, that this is a hard situation and we all know it. No blabbering about how hard life has been or whatever.The teacher sees what's going on with all the bullying, yet carries on with the day's lesson. When it's too late, a teacher suggests lawful means to a nose-bleeding, crying Chiron.Most scenes are short and contribute to the story and to the characters. The dialogues too.Not that I don't like films with emotional outbursts, but this film has got many balls in the air (poverty, drugs, bullying, homophobia). I find amazing the way it handles all of them without resorting to ¬´ appeal to emotion ¬ª or ending up too loaded. Yet it produces a lot of emotions.3. Music and art direction. Very interesting choice of music links from one scene to the other. Adds to the tension accumulating throughout the film.The story behind the title is connected to the contrast of the colors ; bright, blue, green, yellow during the day, dark and warm during the night plus the color of Chiron's skin in the final scene under the moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,3/10,"2016 was a very good year for Hollywood, so many great films like La La Land, Hidden Figures, Hacksaw Ridge or Lion, just to name a few. Unfortunately, among so many good movies, there was this one, slow, uninteresting, not original in any possible way, a story about nothing.Don't be fooled by Oscar 2017 award for best movie, I can't find any reason this movie won. Even if you can live with the fact a movie Academy used political, social, racial or sexual inclusion criteria other than film making, it's impossible to stop wondering why didn't they go for Hidden Figures instead, as it shares lots of the issues seen in this one, but is so much more interesting and fun, based on true, very relevant facts.Acting and direction is undoubtedly good, but this movie is more a waste of their talent than a tribute."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"This film basically follows a similar format that past films such as Boyhood (2014) followed. A fictional coming of age biopic that is more driven by the character's development instead of plot or conflict.Boyhood was an alright film, nothing spectacular. Moonlight was just incredibly dull and pointless, and only served to reinforce the negative stereotypes of black people, which unfortunately are based in reality.This film wasn't even close to being worthy of an Oscar, it simply won the Oscar for best film due to outside pressure from groups complaining that Hollywood is racist. Moonlight is the first film to get an affirmative action Oscar! What unbelievable times we're living in! No longer is raw talent or creativity being rewarded, instead whomever can claim the biggest victim group status will likely be rewarded the most accolades by Hollywood.Disgusting."
MOONLIGHT,16 May 2017,10/10,"There is no satisfying start to describe a film which I have completely adored from its first watch. A film which, even after not being around any of those characters or not having walked on those streets; I have seen already three times and looking forward to watch it again. Just to have interactions with the characters, colors, music and everything, from this completely immersive experience! Moonlight, directed by Barry Jenkins is, as many have already said; a flawless film. But, that is because he took every decision on his impulses while shooting the film. Not everything can be explained what can be felt. So, he went with whatever input he was receiving and choosing the best that he felt at the time. Whether it was interaction between the central character Chiron and his mother with extreme close-ups or the scene from the ocean of the interaction between Chiron and Juan; everything was heartfelt and seemingly flawless. Even the simplest scene on paper made much greater impact on the screen. This was an exploration of Chiron's personality based on the interactions, which made it actually an experience we can have- walking by his shoes. Most of the frames focused on the alienation he was going through and the struggles surrounding it. Even the harrowing score by Nicholas Britell made him seem almost like a ghost roaming through these paths, that he was supposed to go by. He was lost- not because he couldn't find the directions, but because he couldn't understand where to be. Other than every actor playing Chiron and Kevin, Naomie Harris (Mother) and Mahershala Ali (Juan) portrayed their characters with such as ease; that the brilliance could be felt from every emotion they were depicting. Paula, Chiron's mother was a drug-addict who was as lonely as his son was. Maybe that's why she was reassuring herself in a way, by reminding him- she was the only person he had. Juan was a drug-dealer who accidentally meets Chiron and feels a kind of connection that he wants nothing to happen to this kid. Maybe he was seeing himself in Chiron as a mirror, without any emotional support; from the back of his life. But, he feels an urge to give Chiron the confidence to make his own choices and still to be brave to live with those. Even the irony of him (Juan) , being the reason for Chiron's alienation tears him apart. The colors of the theme- Black and Blue were used in many frames. Blue which was like a hope for him- escaping- takes prominence in the third chapter where we see it somewhat neutralizing the hot sepia tones. It was also seen in the previous chapters, in the scenes where he was trying to escape from the harsh reality. It was his journey from Black to Blue, from 'Soft' to 'Strong'; and the constant struggles in finding his own identity from them. So, this soul-searching journey would either make you love it unconditionally or would make you feel distant from the characters every single moment; because of completely personal approach while making. Choose for yourself who you wanna be.."
MOONLIGHT,22 January 2017,8/10,"i.Little:- I'm speechless when it comes to this half an hour, Hilarious! emotion disturbance, self discovering.. great acting from all the characters starting with Mahershala Ali the best actor in the movie.. I really loved this periodii.Sharon + iii.Black:- The tempo.. I started to feel that the events is running! why the rush? i am sure if this movie was in the hands of another more experienced director it must've been better, but..Barry Jenkins was very rushed, he didn't go deeply into more details between Sharon and his boyfriend, or even Juan! the best character and the best actor and the best performance.. why don't you give him more time on the screen? why don't you dig in his relation with Sharon? The movie needed more time and i needed more details..P.s: The dialogue was perfect, and the music was amazing and i enjoyed the movie from the very begging to the last scene"
MOONLIGHT,22 April 2018,4/10,"Nothing happens.
Really boring. It seems that the film would never ends.
I guess it jus received an Oscar because of the gay an black causes."
MOONLIGHT,14 May 2017,5/10,"Y'know, I was really rooting for Barry, the first big shot alumni out of FSU Film School, so I came in really hoping for this movie to be great.It was pretty boring, though. I can appreciate the filmmaking -- but the movie itself was a real snoozer. None of the lines came off interesting. None of the characters seemed to act natural. Nothing from the movie really made me feel emotionally invested. Mahershala Ali wasn't that great either, why the hell did he win Best Supporting Actor? Mediocre."
MOONLIGHT,30 November 2016,8/10,"I ain't saying this is a bad movie, but it's no Brokeback Mountain. Or, well, it is but for a different demographic. If you grew up a gay black boy in the hood, this movie probably shakes your core the same way BBM changed the lives for those of us who grew up in white rural America.It will also speak volumes to a lot of people though, because the gay issue seems to take a more minor role. This is more of a coming of age story/examination of how we shapeshift throughout our lives to deal with society. Homophobia isn't the issue in this movie, it's self-confidence.Demographics aside, I still don't think it's as well done as Brokeback. The acting is great, but the characters are a little bit cookie cutter and the scenes are a tad overlong and overdramatic. It's memorable, for sure, and will probably feel more profound to me as I dream about it tonight, but right after leaving the theater I didn't think it lived up to the hype or feel like a full story for that matter."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,9/10,"I really liked it. A simple and coherent narration. Real and actual themes. The story of the realisation of one being different until the acceptation of it. That movie brings up issues that anyone could have came up with in one life. It deals with themes that are often left aside and discarded, although they are quite important in the development of the society we all aspire to live in. A society of peace, tolerance and acceptation. I really don't understand all those bad reviews about this film. You can dislike it by principles, but you have to admit there is a great cinematographic work behind it."
MOONLIGHT,23 December 2019,10/10,"This film is a rare find. The screenplay is masterfully written; the story unravels beautifully; the editing is remarkably attentive.But the crowning jewel of ""Moonlight"" is the acting: nuanced, powerful, and frustratingly realistic performances are given by each and every character, no matter the size of their role. The principal character, Chyrone, is played by 3 actors who each have an astoundingly consistent realisation of the character - of course, not to mention the magnificent supporting roles of Ali, Harris and Monae would be an injustice.Barry Jenkins' unwavering attention to detail help communicate the film's powerful message phenomenally. Simply put, ""Moonlight"" is flawlessly executed."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,4/10,"The story is about a black boy who grow up with a crack addict mother. He discovers that he's gay from age 6.I think it's a clich√© from start to finish. The story is very poor, The acting is not more than staring all the movie from the lead actor. It's like a 5 minutes film that pushed to 2 hours. It's a political film. It's seems that they painted the target around the arrow they shot. They just wanted to give the Oscar for the first time to a gay movie in a political hypocrisy to all and so they did. This movie wasn't that good anyway, It's stole the Oscar to a truly magnificent film 'La La Land' and it wasn't fair - just because it's a gay black movie. It's just like last year when they gave the Oscar to that anti-church film no one even remembers. It's a shame.I hate when art meets politics. And the Oscars for me is dead."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"This is the type of movie you start watching with high expectations because of all the buzz around the film. At the beginning it's kind of boring but hey, it's just the beginning. You get to know the characters and stuff, it's understandable. Things will get better. At the middle of the film you think: 'ah, this is nothing special but it has a huge potential, the second half will be incredible'. The film goes on and you notice it's only 20 minutes left and you think to yourself 'oh, it did not fulfil my expectations but the film is so hyped, the ending MUST be incredible, memorable. Can barely wait"". And the ending happens out of nowhere when you least expect so you think ""so that's it? Nothing else? How can this trash be so hyped""? Then you remember the film is about black people and homosexuality and in the Oscars' last edition there was a huge controversy due to few black nominees and suddenly everything starts making sense."
MOONLIGHT,11 December 2017,1/10,"I have opened movie with a great expectations, but frustrated, the movie about nothing. And it won Oscar because of gay scenes. Of course I am not against of gay but only because of it the movie cannot won Oscar. Sorry. There are no emotions, film is very dark, scenes have been shoot very long, actors just looking to each other for one minute, why I should watch it?"
MOONLIGHT,3 December 2018,5/10,"This movie wasted two important hours of my life. The story is plain and dull and can be concluded within 15 words , and most of the conversations go to nowhere. Speaking to the reasons why it can get awards, I guess, people from the academy decided to give it awards after ten minutes of the beginning, when a BLACK boy says that I may be a GAY. Well,ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,5/10,"one of the poorest movie I had ever seen it's all about young Idiot he transferred into gay ..... what... are you kid'n me !!!!! i think mahershala Ali is gonna be a great actor he really is now , but what about that story it's poor even it's not gives new in decoration or filming or nothing ..."
MOONLIGHT,17 April 2017,5/10,"Start with an all black cast and throw in a gay love story scene, and you have yourself a cert for an Oscar...The film takes place over 3 acts, and each one of them feels very undeveloped - story lines that appear to be building nicely, but never quite get to where you want them to, and it never really engages you to the point where you truly share in the angst that Chiron is facing. It's a perfectly watchable movie, but at the same time, it's completely unremarkable and easy to switch off at any time. Oscar worthy? Not at all."
MOONLIGHT,11 January 2017,10/10,"Barry Jenkins hasn't made many movies, and this soars far and high above all others. He breaks your heart with each perfectly choreographed shot, brilliant cinematography, and revolutionary acting by a supreme all-black cast. He breaks down society to the roughest of the rough, piling on realistic and gritty conflicts. But by far the most tragic part of ""Moonlight"" is that it could easily be a true story. All the things that 'Chiron' goes through could have easily been anybody's legacy. It is a ""Schindler's List:"" a movie that makes you cry your eyes out at the perilous things in the life of the main characters, and is a great movie for any mature individual. The film is an accurate representation of the underground experiences that occur in society, and the obstacles that come along with it.I HIGHLY recommend ""Moonlight."" A+"
MOONLIGHT,9 February 2018,5/10,"Moonlight inspired by a play called ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"". This movie got many nominations and awards then I thought ""That must be good, I have to watch that movie"". Despite all the good acting and awards, it was just a big disappointment for me. You can guess what is going to happen in the end.Mahershala Ali have been nominated for supporting role and he won. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris both were good in their role but they didn't have longer time. I wish they had longer time."
MOONLIGHT,21 July 2017,5/10,"The movie does a great job at portraying life at a black neighborhood and living with a drug addicted mother, but it goes nowhere with it.The first part gives a great set-up, but the movie can't capitalize on that at all. Chiron (here mostly called little) is a really quiet kid who gets bullied and suffers a lot from his mom, but he gets sort of mentored by a guy (Juan) who actually sells drugs and his girlfriend. Chiron's mom confronts him and he keeps selling drugs to her, but otherwise his drug dealings don't affect him much. Life appears to just go on as we jump into high school, we are immediately informed Juan recently died and we don't ever see his girlfriend again (although how Chiron still seeing her is important to the story). The gay element is stamped all over the story, but it actually is just something sprinkled in at random. Chiron asks Juan what's a faggot and if he is one when he is a child, and the last scene before the transition is just him walking in a bathroom with two boys comparing dicks. While hanging out with his friend Kevin, they kiss and he sorta masturbates him for a bit, and he is sometimes called a faggot.The build up is good, but nothing happens afterwards. Some guys bully him, make Kevin hit him a couple times them hurt him bad. Chiron doesn't want to press charges, but charges into the main bully's class and breaks a chair on him, so now he is arrested. This is where the movie turns bad. We them jump forward a decade and the absurdly wimpy teen becomes a monster black guy who looks nothing like himself and deals drugs, but we never go deep into it. His mom seems better now, but we never quite go into it, they just have a talk and she says she loves him. Then he goes to meet Kevin again, and they just talk like people who are just reuniting for 15 minutes. Hey, that's what would've happen in real life, but they should get into something later. So buffed Chiron goes to his place and they talk a bit more and... he says he never did anything to anyone besides him, he cries a bit as Keving comforts him. And the movie ends.No payoff, resolution or even full build of character. We don't really see anyone coming of age, it's all skipped over. Maybe this would've been a better movie if it was three hours long, but maybe they'd just add more build-up and not finish the path they begin."
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,1/10,"i watched this movies because of the overrating reviews , i came to here just to wary the people who didn't watch this movie yet ( if we should call it like that ) from losing 2H hours of their life because there is no reason to watch it , i don't know how and why did it won the Oscar's , it's about a kid a gay kid depressive the hole movie , 2H watching a boring, depressing and going-no-where- movie , it make you feel depressive and very bored at the non-sense end."
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2021,8/10,Liked it a lot. Kept it real and raw. Some very touching moments and the acting was very good.
MOONLIGHT,11 March 2017,1/10,"Even if Homosexuality is recognized legal in the US, Why you trying to force it world wide by putting it in every movie? except the good image and lighting, the movie is awful, in one word to describe it, wast of time, nothing new, no story, and it giving a bad image of the black society in America."
MOONLIGHT,8 May 2017,2/10,"Moonlight had the potential to be a truly great film, but it falls flat. I'm not sure why people loved this. Nothing really happens in this film, plot-wise or action-wise. It's a lot of talking and standing around. This movie could have raised some interesting questions about humanity, the human brain, and what makes us who we are. Every time the movie tries to get this idea going, they cut to another scene, and kill any momentum that it was building up. Even though there was one definitive main character in Moonlight, we don't find out much about him. The character is nowhere as developed as he should be, and it's hard to care about him, when we don't get to know him. This movie is boring, and I am not sure why this won Best Picture at the Oscars."
MOONLIGHT,31 July 2018,10/10,"For a movie based on one person who does not speak much every character that played Chiron was amazing they said so much without speaking, hands down one of the best movies and best acting I've ever seen!"
MOONLIGHT,22 October 2016,9/10,"This movie is a really great movie. It is what film should aspire to be: well written, perfectly acted and the directing was spot on. This film told a story and set a mood that brought the viewer along for the ride.The story was told in 3 parts and each part was done so well that it made the transitions seamless. It was very easy to follow as the transitions happened and each actor brought something new and compelling to the story. I was left wanting more from each thread of the story and was really taken in immediately.The music in this movie was also amazing. It really helped to tell the story and added another layer or intoxication to the film and it made each complicated, but subtle moment of this story all the more engaging."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2019,1/10,"This is one of the biggest crimes in movie history. The fact that this won an Oscar at all. In honor of Oscar night 2019, I felt like I should tell people how horrible this movie is. It's about a C-. This is not about race, and this is not about minorities at all. This is about what deserved best picture. This didn't even deserve to be mentioned. Let alone win. Just an awful movie in every way. Just no storyline the ending didn't make sense. Everything sucked. Terrible."
MOONLIGHT,29 October 2016,7/10,"This movie is highly timely, interesting, very real and relatable. I was lucky enough to see this in the theater, however, it was absolutely empty the showtime I went to...which was thoroughly surprising.My husband and I were personally able to relate to the struggles of these characters. While I felt at times the storytelling itself was formulaic and the writing and dialogue could have been improved, the heart of the story, the characters, and the overall work made it a very special film. My feelings though that if it's not playing near you, just wait for it to hit ondemand. This is prime Oscar bait. But the story is so relatable and real that I applaud the filmmaker. This is a story that the world needs. The director could be better though."
MOONLIGHT,18 April 2018,9/10,"If you answered yes to that question, this is a movie you'll UNDERSTAND and ENJOY. 
Follow up questions:
Are you capable of empathy, even if someone isn't the same as you? Do you believe that movies don't need a complex plot, or a typical structure? Do you appreciate breaking convention and following new, uncommon methods of storytelling? If you answered no to ANY of those questions, Moonlight might be a bit too artsy for you, or you might not be the kind of person who will be moved by it. 
But if you answered yes to all those questions, Moonlight is a dream come true. The movie follows a young man in the Southeast, growing up in poverty and dealing with his identity and who he is. The movie shows him at three different critical moments in his life, and the amount of resonance that I felt with this film is indescribable. Granted, I'm not part of a minority, so I won't comment on politicized issues surroudning this film. However, I will say that the notion that Moonlight only made it to the Oscars because it featured marginalized groups prominently is FALSE. This movie made it where it is today of its own power.
Go into this film with an open mind, and try not to force Moonlight into your idea of what a film should be, let Moonlight shape a new concept for you.
Who knows, you might enjoy where it takes you."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2017,3/10,"I watched it cause of your hyper-critics, and deeply disagree with them.The acting is stereotypical, insisted, and uninteresting. Characters are all obvious, and repeat themselves one generation after another. The camera doesn't dig beyond surface, and photography is shallow and uninteresting. Dialogues!? A little drama, so far the protagonist is aphasic. If l were black, l'd consider it a bad racial movie, so far those (all black) characters are depicted in polarised, mechanical way. No hope, no change. The shooting is lengthy and misses suspense. A few lyrical moments, when old time friends meet up again, are reasonably, yet obviously, good. I wasted time and money, TV has much more on offer daily"
MOONLIGHT,14 May 2017,10/10,"I have never posted a review on this website, but reading the reviews for this movie made me want to write one because so many people do not recognize this movie for the genius it is. Many people describe it as ""boring"", ""a waste"", or that it has very little dialogue and is drawn out with nothing exciting or climactic. Those people that think that are overlooking what the whole movie is about. This is not a giant Hollywood production, it's a movie about real people and a real life. The silence, the limited dialogue, the music, the editing, and the acting all combine to create a breathtaking piece that deserved to win the best film of the year Oscar, because it was truly a work of art. It did not win because it was a movie about a black gay person to make up for 2016's whitewashed Oscars. Those complaining are too small to read into the film and actually appreciate if for the genius it is. This movie has left me thinking for months on end, and I recommend it to anyone looking for an actual good movie."
MOONLIGHT,11 March 2017,10/10,"I read one review that captured the essence of this movie very well by quoting from Billy Joel's Piano Man: ""They are drinking a cup they call loneliness but it's better than drinking alone."" That a character is poor, black, and gay is incidental, punctuation on the theme of loneliness, and a reminder of the wisdom of Sondheim's axiom that ""children will listen."""
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"I was writing a review to state how a waste of time watching this movie would be, and how overrated it is and how the academy is just trying to please everyone with no integrity, but after reading the reviews I knew that was everyone's opinion too.This movie is less than average and actually there is no plot, no actions, no message, nothing, absolutely nothing. AN EMPTY MOVIE."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,4/10,"I watched this movie till two thirds of the way through, based on it's IMDb 8 rating. The storytelling becomes very unlikely when one act of violence is brushed off, then in the next scene a similar act of violence is dealt with totally different. Weak and implausible. It either displays a fundamental flaw in American society or a weakness in certain audiences to differentiate between fiction and fantasy."
MOONLIGHT,19 February 2017,1/10,"Couldn't bear it any longer, was going nowhere. This has to be one of the most atrocious movies we've ever seen. The story line is snail paced and progresses nowhere. All the movie seems to cover is the coming out of a young black boy in the hood. Strange treatment of lead support character Juan in the movie. Think the writer needs a career change. Please ignore Mark Kermode, hope my review will help you dodge a bullet."
MOONLIGHT,26 June 2017,1/10,"This film shows us that the academy completely sold out to some whining racists that had complained that the Oscars were too ""white"". and it proves that the Oscar is no more than a door stop and means NOTHING. to think that Cool Hand Luke did not win best picture the year it was made and this film did shows the #OscarsAreSoBlind"". this film was obviously just handed all these awards just because the actors and crew are black.. which is DISGUSTLINGLY racist... how many white actors/filmmakers have EVER been nominated at the BET awards?? zero!! shame on the academy for turning their lame awards show into a ""racial thing"" and forever ruining their own image which was already seriously in doubt anyway, since Robert Shaw did not win a Oscar for Jaws!!!"
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,1/10,"The 10 star reviews are shocking and Best Picture Oscar are shocking. I found the film tedious and dull. Nothing engaging or interesting to draw my attention away from the awful dialogue and predictable story arcs. Whilst I haven't seen any films about gay black men growing up in poverty, this film told me nothing about that struggle that I couldn't have written myself on the back of an envelope. If the academy felt compelled to give Best Picture to a film featuring actors of colour, both Hidden Figures and Lion were far more deserving."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,10/10,"This was one of the most affecting movies I have seen in years. I'm so surprised to see such poor reviews of this film from users. I found myself riveted by the writing, directing and performances from the first scene to the last. This is a story that doesn't get told - at least not in American cinema. The performances are top notch, every single one. Yes, Ali and Harris deserve the attention they have been given. But all three actors portraying Little/Chiron/Black are also top notch. Jenkins shows such care to link these performances because you really feel that it's the same boy growing up in all three chapters. Directing-wise, I find it so refreshing to see a camera linger on an actor to show their behavior (character is behavior). You witness our protagonist nervously watch his aggressors from afar, see him prepare a bath alone in his home and brush his hair in anticipation of reuniting with an old friend. And because you see this in real human time, you identify in a way that you might not had it been quickly edited or explained to you.This is such an important film that raises questions about identity, parenting, child/parent archetypes, definitions of masculinity, education, community, belonging, responsibility, addiction and youth development. And it does so without ever becoming an issue film. It is ultimately a portrait of a young man surviving in his own skin, in need of love and discovering it where you might not expect to find it. There is a lot of pain in this film and it will leave the viewer with a lot of questions to chew on, but it is full of heart and beauty. One of the most deserving best picture winners in recent years."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,8/10,"As I said I liked this movie. It's slow perhaps and for me it is a typical Un-American movie. It remembered me to the Japanese 'Nobody knows'. No action, less words to speak and no special effects. Just a story of small all day people with their own problems. No happy stories but in that case maybe many peoples story that no one likes to see. I liked the stills very much and found the actors excellent."
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,1/10,"Im not one to write reviews. I don't usually have the time.But this ""movie"" was given 99 on metacritic. It was 7+ on IMDb, and won an Oscar. Must be better than gladiator and ben hur this right ???There were no effects at all, the budget was probably less than $100. There were about 4 people in the movie saying a total of probably 120 lines to each other. It was set in a familiar western city, mostly indoors. The speech was slow, perhaps 1 line was uttered every minute it seems. There was hardly any fear, or much emotion. The characters were bland and dull, doing nothing extraordinary. One could hear the monster movie next door, that was how quiet and this movie was. It was shockingly boring. You could go away for an hour, come back and still keep up with the movie easily.The trouble was, despite all the hoo haa, there was hardly any story going on at all. Two people grew up and met up again. I felt a big ""to be continued"" or ""intermission"" sign was missing at the end. No climax to the monotony at all. No message to dwell on. Absolutely nothing. No escapism in the slightest. Not entertaining.It seems people may have drawn out meaning from what to me seems a meaningless movie, or secretly used it as a potent tranquilizer. Perhaps millions were spent on advertising this to the elite.We felt completely defrauded after 2 hours of relentlessly slow emotionless humdrum, wishing for the first time to have a refund."
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,7/10,"This movie looks like well made low budget indie film Story is unique and actors were mostly great. But, when Chiron, a skinny weak and bullied kid came back from prison 10 years later, he became a thick muscly drug lord in Atlanta. And the actor who looks like 50 Cent the rapper didn't look like younger Chiron at all. It was so not believable that I lost interest in the story at that point. I don't understand Academy's choice to award Moonlight over La La Land. I think this movie scored extra points for being ""black"" ""gay"" movie which white liberal members of Academy felt compelled to give it to this because of those aspects over more grand scale Hollywood classic La La Land. I understand that some people relates to Moonlight and can't stand movie like La La Land, but Oscar became ""just an award show"" for me."
MOONLIGHT,9 March 2017,6/10,"I was looking forward to see Moonlight after it won the ""Best Picture"" award. Had to be something special - right? I was very disappointed. Good cinematography, some good acting, but no plot, no character development, and if there weren't subtitles I wouldn't have had a clue what the characters were talking about. Oh, and the main character said maybe 200-250 words the entire movie!"
MOONLIGHT,14 March 2017,4/10,"This is a film about three stages in a black child's life. Child, teen, adult living in a ghetto in Miami. While the boy suffered trials with bullies, crack addicted mother, sans father rotating boyfriends. it a story the black community should address since this isn't just the boy in the film but a way of life for many children.I want to say the film was slow, tedious, and lacking in dialogue. I am not sure if there was supposed to be a message?? Perhaps that he admitted he was gay? Life is without hope? Whatever it was I missed what the critics say they saw. Not an Oscar film although the supporting actors were good."
MOONLIGHT,25 August 2018,1/10,Don't even waste your time watching this!! Very disappointing
MOONLIGHT,4 May 2017,10/10,"if you didn't watch it yet, go straight to amazon to buy it or if you lucky enough and it's still playing in the cinema in your country, run ! go watch this magical movie I swear. the movie tell a story that actually quite universal, we are experience it at some point but still able to pull it off like the story we never see before, maybe the way Barry Jenkins directed this movie so beautifully or perhaps all the wonderful performance by the actors in this movie. or perhaps the way it explains my struggle in dealing with life, feeling such as an alien creature among st human, Moonlight is everything a movie could offer. you want to see a best treat ? go watch this, hauntingly beautiful."
MOONLIGHT,18 April 2017,9/10,"Today I finally got around to watching Moonlight. After watching it on my DVD player at home my only regret is that I did not see it at a theatre. I am a 60 something retired white teacher and a long time fan of The Wire. This film did not disappoint.The film is about growing up in an adverse environment, friendships, school bullying and a gay theme. It's the kind of film that made me watch it a second time, very rare for me, and one that I will be thinking about for a long time. There were some scenes that practically made me tear up because they seemed so real and authentic, particularly with Mahershala Ali. The three actors that played Little, Chiron and Black were terrific, each in their own way. While I have been accessing IMDb.com for many years this is my first review, partly because so many other user reviews were unimpressed with this film. I guess we all have our own preferences and that's OK. In past years I too have watched films that the critics loved and came away saying WTF. Not with this film. In fact I wish it had been made into a HBO series because the characters were that compelling. Two thumbs up!"
MOONLIGHT,21 June 2017,10/10,"I have been reading through the reviews of this movie, and I can't seem to grasp why they are so awful. I thought the IMDb community was smarter than this. Anyone who knows anything about a good film knows that Moonlight stands out. From the beautiful cinematography to the plot to the soundtrack, this film is spot on. Any person who says this film was ""boring"" is merely proving how simple-minded they are. There is a reason that Moonlight got a metascore of 99 and a score of 98 on Rotten Tomatoes. Do not listen to the reviews of people who think they are ""standing out"" by being bored by a film that won best picture at the Oscars. This movie is incredible."
MOONLIGHT,9 December 2018,8/10,"Again, another movie confirmed to me of how tough and hard teenage years could be. Fake being one of those bad kids was already hard bc you need to pretend yourself and join the group you didn't like just to get by, but being the bullied one man, way harder. Why are kids so hard on each other's self"
MOONLIGHT,21 February 2018,7/10,"Moonlight, all in all, was a good film. The thing is, though, it had the potential to be great, however it just narrowly missed the mark.
When Chiron is growing up, he goes through a lot of changes and hard times. A lot of this movie is marked by silence, though, so we don't really know exactly how he is feeling for a lot of it. One of the main problems with Moonlight is that nothing really gets resolved. We don't ever find out what happens to Theresa or Chiron's mother. We also don't know what happens between Chiron and Kevin- the movie has a very open-ended ending. As a viewer, the end of Moonlight left me very confused and wanting to see more what actually happened with all of the characters. It was a very good idea for a film, but I feel it wasn't represented as well as it should have been."
MOONLIGHT,29 June 2017,6/10,"I feel like everyone involved with this movie was moving in slow mo. The story had serious holes, the actors had little to no character development. I think it's pretty obvious the director and writers were just trying to cash in on 2 sensitive subjects at once (Being Black and Being gay). Other wise this movie would have gone unnoticed like it should have originally.I just don't understand the praise at all."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2018,10/10,Moonlight from the music to the characters to the script!!! This is such an master piece and I can tell Barry took his time making and righting this script!!
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2019,1/10,This film is weird and confusing. This picture tries to promote the agenda of homosexuality in the urban ghettos. You think the kid is in search of a father instead he's looking for a lover.
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2019,6/10,"Story: Been done before. Dialigue aa bit trite and predictible.
Acting: Excellent
Cinematography: Annoying. Too many spinning shots and long linguering shots. If spinning shots were suppose to symbolize the life confusion of these kids, it did not work for me.
Directing: Good given obvious budget constraints."
MOONLIGHT,8 August 2020,10/10,"This movie is breathtakingly simple and real. Nothing has ever affected me as deeply and as profoundly as this did. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, with tracks such as ""The Middle of the World"" and ""Who Is You?"" leaving the listener shaken and rattled. The acting is incredible; Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris' performances specifically are so impressive. When Chiron's mom said to him, ""you don't love me anymore,"" it moved me to tears.This movie is perfect. It does exactly what it was meant to, and it does it flawlessly. The cinematography is amazing, the writing is so clever, the overwhelming emotions you get from watching this are unreal.The ending is so satisfying. I appreciated it more the second time, because I understood that that is the only way it could have ended.Any movie lover should watch this immediately if they haven't already. Thank God it won over La La Land."
MOONLIGHT,25 July 2018,4/10,"Moonlight is considered a pretty big movie in the movie scene; winning prizes such as Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role among two hundred other awards. Winning three oscars isn't an easy feat, and I congratulate the movie and it's makers for reaching such an amazing feat. But truth to be told? It does not deserve it.The movie starts strongly, with amazing acting produced by Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris, but decays afterwards into what can be simply categorized as overrated. The first period of the whole movie (of three total) is superb, acting-wise, visually, and in terms of writing and dialogue, but then it is replaced by uneeded timeskips that could have been used to make the movie far more thrilling and deserving of the oscars. There were plenty of situations and times when acting could've done the job, but it was always kicked in it's teeth by a timeskip, equally boring was the writing, portraying unfortunately an awesome concept but still ultimately leaving you with nothing in the end. Yes, it is black people. Yes, it is homosexual people. But so what? These two automatically do not push anything into a good movie.The middle and end section of the movie goes through so flawlessly, with minimal conflict and little chance for the actors to shine in the drama genre. The ending, what could've been amazing, intense situation - is instead shrunk into a twilight-romance that just doesn't cut it for three oscars. If you've seen the movie, you must see it; there's just no way the ending is so simple as it is portrayed. Why was there no explanation or delving further into the adult protagonist? He was an empty shell, and not because the story wanted it that way - but because the story didn't ever produce anything to make us feel we ever needed, or wanted, the end that we got.Visually however: a masterpiece. The colours are not only flawless and the angles and beautiful scenery pushes this movie from complete garbage (again, aside from the beginning), to an acceptable movie. The colours specifically root into your memory, with specific colours and specific designs on character's clothes making you easily interpret who they are and understand the scenes with masterful ease.It's a shame that with such a badass, thought-provoking concept, the beautiful colours, and the awesome introduction, the rest of the movie became lackluster and in the end, overrated."
MOONLIGHT,15 July 2021,10/10,"I have seen Moonlight about 5 or 6 times. Ever since my first watch last year I was in love with this movie. It took me about a week after the first watch to decide that Moonlight was my favorite film of all time. I shouldn't be able to relate to this story as much as I do, I'm white and I'm straight but I still do, the themes of loneliness and the character Chiron resonate with me so much. This movie makes we feel a little less alone on bad days when I decide to give it a rewatch. Moonlight means so much to me and I urge everyone to see it at least once. Aside from my personal love for the film, it is simply a perfectly crafted movie, the ensemble cast all does amazing, the cinematography and score are amazing, and Barry Jenkins direction is absolutely amazing. I know every scene from Moonlight by heart at this point yet it is still just as great every rewatch. Everyone should see it at least once."
MOONLIGHT,19 August 2018,6/10,"I actually enjoyed watching this movie, but I still can't see any sense in watching it. What is the point?"
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is a coming-of-age film that details the life of Chiron as he travels on his journey to adulthood being a gay black man. The film is based on the play of a similar name In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. The movie is broken up into three acts, ""Little"", ""Chiron"" and ""Black"", all of which have significant meaning throughout the protagonist's journey of life. The film tackles everything from poverty, and crime to sexuality and race. The plot of the film helps contribute to the central theme of finding one's self and findings one's sexual identity.
 The first act of the movie is when Chiron is around ten years old. In this time of his life, he is dealing with bullies making fun of him as well as loneliness as well as having to be independent since his mother is frequently absent. He gains a father-figure, Juan who really takes care of him along with his girlfriend Teresa by giving him a place to stay when needed and teaching him life skills like learning how to swim.
Act two cuts into Chiron as a teenager still dealing with bullies but especially a certain one in particular named Terrell. He is also dealing with the loss of his father figure Juan as well as discovering and living with his drug-addicted mother. At one point he has a very intimate moment with his longtime friend Kevin on the beach, his first and only sexual experience. At the end of ""Chiron"", Chiron's bully forces Kevin to repeatedly punch Chiron and then eventually everyone joins in on assaulting Chiron. At the end of Act Two, Chiron is seen assaulting his bully Terrell with a chair and going off to Juvenile Hall. Then it cuts into the third and final act and we see Chiron as a grown adult. He is a completely different person. He has now gained a healthy amount of weight and takes the career that he has seen all his life which he calls "" trapping""; he is now into the drug dealing business, something that was unlike his character as a child and teenager. He is shown visiting his recovered addict mother as well as visiting Kevin who is now a chef, a person whom he has not seen since he was sent to Juvie. After some time together Chiron reveals to Kevin that he was his only sexual experience that one night on the beach. The end of the film shows Chiron as a kid on the beach in the moonlight.
 There is the repetition of symbolism throughout the film, specifically with water. Water is displayed across all three acts and is shown in many different forms. In Act One, water is seen as a new beginning. This is where Juan teaches Chiron how to swim and he gets the hang of it fairly quickly. In Act Two, water is shown at the intimate scene between Kevin and Chiron; the water here symbolizes a development and finding of new feelings. Act Two also showcases water after Chiron was severely beaten up and drowned his head in ice water. The water here, in this case, symbolizes newfound strength as he was able to build up the courage of attacking his longtime bully. Act Three is similar to Act Two as water is present when Chiron as an adult still bathes his face in ice water. Water is lastly present as the final scene of the film on a young Chiron on the beach as the waves are crashing. The film overall shows how Chiron developed as a character and how he dealt with his internal and external conflicts.He first dealt with internal conflicts as a young boy not truly understanding why people or himself thought was different. His internal conflicts develop into external conflict when he deals with his bully as a teenager.
The cinematography is something that is very important in the movie. What is very key in the movie is the closeness of certain scenes shown on the characters creating the illusion as if the characters are looking right at the audience. This is especially present in Act Three at the Diner when Chiron and Kevin are seen looking at each other. The closeness of the characters was shown a few times throughout the film. Lighting is also of importance in the film, especially the color blue. You can see in certain scenes of dialogue, the color blue is present which attributes to the title of the film. The movie overall shows a young boys journey into adulthood as he deals with life struggles and conflicts."

MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight (2016) directed by Barry Jenkins, a magnificent film that won many distinguished awards, illustrates a young African American boy grow up and become a man in a rough neighborhood in Miami, Florida. His struggles and feats throughout his life are depicted and shown throughout the film in extraordinary ways. The way director Barry Jenkins features this story revels the truth in racism, sexuality, masculinity, drug addictions, and poverty. 
From the beginning of this film to the end, Chiron does not fit into society's image of what a young African American should be. And Chiron's character does is not strong enough to stick up for himself. In school he is picked on, beat on, and teased about his sexuality and his drug addicted mother. Juan, a drug dealer to Chiron's mother, husband of Teresa, takes Chiron under his wing and starts building him up, trying to make Chiron become true to himself and who Chiron wants to be. For instance, during one of the encounters Chiron had with Juan, Juan said, ""I've been here a long time. I'm from Cuba. Lotta black folks in Cuba. You wouldn't know that from being here, though. I was a wild little shorty, man. Just like you. Running around with no shoes on, when the moon was out. This one time, I ran by this old... this old lady. I was runnin' and hollerin', and cuttin' a fool, boy. This old lady, she stopped me. She said... Imitating an old lady's voice...""Runnin' around, catching up all that light. In moonlight, black boys look blue. You blue, that's what I'm gon' call you. 'Blue'."" In which Chiron responded with, ""So your name 'Blue'? "", Juan chuckled, ""Nah. At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you gonna be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you"" (Moonlight 2016). This quote from the movie represents the film perfectly, this film is about Chiron and Chiron has to decide for himself who he is going to be. He cannot let nobody make his decision for him. Juan is Chiron's role model, his mother and peers belittle him but Juan makes him feel proud and no regret of who or what he is or likes. 
A lot of the scenes use color, music and the sounds to become more dramatic and appealing which impact the appearance of certain scenes, helping the point they are trying to make become more apparent and obvious. Color, music and the sounds are strong story functions. In the film, the colors that stood out to me the most were red and blue. In one scene, near the beginning at 00:31:35, Chiron's mother is screaming and yelling at him after coming back home, she is also under the influence of drugs, drugs that she received from Juan. Just ten seconds before her arrival back home, the music begins. As she nears home the music starts to pick up and gives you that feeling that something is going to happen, the music is used as an anticipation tactic used to bring about the anxious feeling to the viewer. Once she arrives home, she is dressed in her red shirt, and there is red on the walls near the entrance where she is standing. She starts to yell and scream at Chiron, but, it is silent. The color red in the film represents hate, unhappiness, and loathing. All the viewer can hear is the music rapidly playing, you feel like you are drowning in his mother's chaos, into the music, into the redness. This subjective audio experience shows us what Chiron is imagining, and hearing, allowing us to get the feeling, and know and understand what Chiron is feeling and thinking. In addition to red, was also the color blue. Blue represented more of Chiron's core emotions during the film. For example, in one scene at 01:15:40, the music slowly becomes audible. The music is a slow song entitled Cucurrucuc√∫ Paloma, a Mexican huapango-style song, in which the lyrics suggest the mood of ""lovesickness"". Coincidently, Chiron is headed back to his home-town to meet the man that he had his first sexual encounter with, Kevin. As the music starts playing, and as Chiron is on the road driving to meet Kevin. As he is driving along the screen color becomes tinted blue, leading into the blue water, into the blue night sky with the bright white full moon. Almost as if he is reminiscing the times he spent with Juan and the advice he received from him. 
Throughout the film, Chiron evolved in three phases. The first being that Chiron is a weak child who is always bullied. Moving onto the second where he still has his tormentor, he is emotionally hurt, Chiron shows that he is gay along with his childhood friend, Kevin Chiron becomes violent during this second phase which ends up getting him into juvie. The last phase, which is the third phase, Chiron moves on, however, not with his love life. Chiron builds himself from the ground up and becomes a drug dealer in Atlanta, Georgia to try to make himself hard, which is similar to Juan. Not long after Chiron and Kevin find themselves together and find their true selves. 
Moonlight was an outstanding, the director was fantastic with discussing issues and concerns that are usually not addressed, and he made it powerful. I would most definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind."

MOONLIGHT,15 January 2020,4/10,"Bland story set in the safest hood in America. My high school in middle class Houston was harder than the school in this movie. Wildly unbelievable characters. A 1980s drug dealer with very progressive views about same-sex attraction takes a troubled young gay boy under his wing. He is the kindest, sweetest crack dealer who ever lived. Never loses his patience with the boy, who deals with complex emotional pain throughout his childhood. In reality, Mahershala Ali's character would have lost his patience with the child almost immediately and taught him to ""be a real man"" by doing something cruel and traumatizing. In reality, the inner city high school students wouldn't have sat quietly in their seats facing the teacher during the lesson. In reality, the male students in the school would have been killing each other in the evenings instead of merely getting in fights. There would be intoxicated homeless people lying on the sidewalk at all times of the day and night. This story could have been set in the suburbs without changing much about the main character's experience. It was enjoyable enough to watch, but I was expecting something better."
MOONLIGHT,18 April 2020,2/10,"I have no idea how this movie won Best Picture. The acting was fantastic, it was well shot, but it was too long with not enough story. This film went nowhere, and it went there slowly. I give it two stars for the excellent acting and competent direction, but why was this movie made? No idea. I could see this as a stage play, but it is a waste of film. Don't waste your time, I regret wasting mine."
MOONLIGHT,12 May 2019,9/10,"I've seen Moonlight four times and I feel that this is the best film of all time. Never has anything I've ever seen come close to Moonlight, Barry Jenkins is going to achieve legendary status as a director in the near future as he wrings beauty in every scene despite the bleakest of circumstances. The three act structure is beautiful as we see a vulnerable boy who can't be himself struggle to find himself in his bleak life in working class America. It's a film unlike any other and one of the most deserved best picture winners ever. This will and always will be my favourite film and I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every single film Jenkins makes."
MOONLIGHT,22 December 2018,4/10,"The first two acts were interesting and well played. I was moved by the simplicity that many people liked about this film.
And then, the last part, which supposed to close the story in a certain way to give it meaning, was just really bad. It was not convincing and it was so clich√©. I still can't believe that there weren't better movies to give an Oscar to during that year.
One of the most overrated films I've seen in a long time."
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2019,9/10,"His one moved me and it stayed with me days after I watched it. I loved everything about this film - the cast, the acting, the multiple storyline arcs and how they were developed, the shots and camera angles (raw and realistic as opposed to veneer), the beautiful visual metaphors. I also haven't seen the coming of age story so convincingly handled by three different actors (all playing the same main character) since Cinema Paradiso."
MOONLIGHT,29 December 2018,9/10,"Moonlight is the tale of a urban youth and his life in 3 stages. Childhood, Adolescence, and Adulthood. Even though this is a detailed look of life in an urban upbringing there really isn't much too the story. After it ends you are sort of left wondering to yourself.. that's it? Good acting, good stories, anticlimactic."
MOONLIGHT,13 April 2021,10/10,Now this is how a good drama should look like! Great story and great acting. Painful and beautiful at the same time.
MOONLIGHT,12 January 2017,9/10,"A unique look at the life of a gay black man growing up. The film is separated into 3 parts. Young Little, Teenage Chiron and Adult Black give us a look into the life of a gay black man who struggles to come to terms with his sexuality because of his environment is not supportive. This film really moved me and opened my eyes to the struggles some must face to live their lives. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone who wants to be more informed about what people have to go through to simply live their lives. I find it sad that this goes on more than we would like to accept. The fact that Chiron had to grow up ""hard"" and not pursue love and a relationship really hits me hard. I am married to a black man and I see the struggle on a daily basis. I think it is important to show and understand it is a very difficult road to be out, open and black. Black gay men are some of the strongest men in the universe."
MOONLIGHT,24 March 2019,10/10,"This might be one of the best, if not the best movie if ever watched.
Chiron's Story touched me deeply,
I felt a lot of joy when B and Kev met after all these years.
I cried during the movie, mostly because I saw a lot of similarities in me and Chiron.
I love my mother with all my heart, but I had to raise myself and stayed alone most of the time.
Beautiful, highly emotional movie 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,15 May 2019,5/10,"This movie was just so average with horrible pascing, average acting and a bad story yet it wins so many awards and get 98% on rotten tomatoes just for having a black gay man. Honestly this isn't a review its just showing how sick i am of all these great movies getting over thrown by worse movies that were loved more just for having black men or independant women. Listen people a messege doesnt make the movie. The movie has to be good in it's own way and the fact this movie doesn't even try to push out its messege in a clever way and just use a black gay man to portray it, is dissapointing and lazy"
MOONLIGHT,20 May 2019,9/10,"It's sad to think, also, that there is such a lack of quality drama involving non-white characters. This will hopefully encourage others to buck the trend"
MOONLIGHT,29 May 2019,10/10,"This movie is absolutely incredible. the cinematography is beautiful, the structure is so well done, etc. i had strong emotional connections to all of the characters. i cried."
MOONLIGHT,27 April 2021,10/10,"There isn't much I can say that other reviewers haven't already said. You will either get it, or you won't. My favorite aspects were the real conversations, and the beautiful portrayal of suffering that didn't romanticize it, but didn't make it ugly like it really is. Poetic, emotional, artfully structured...."
MOONLIGHT,3 June 2017,10/10,"All I can saw is WOW! This movie had me from the opening scene to the end! Although I didn't want it to end because it was so riveting! Jenkins keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. You're not sure what's going to happen!From the Acting to the Cinematography to the Directing, it was all done so well! It was like a painting at the Louve; where one can stare at it for hours! For this being Bary Jenkin's second feature film in which he directed, what a MASTERPIECE! He hit's a home-run! I haven't yet seen Medicine for Melancholy, but now it's a must see! It was no wonder how Jenkins went from a Zero Star Talent in that movie to some notable names in MOONLIGHT! The acting is just phenomenal. In all three phases of Black's Life, you see how he is still the little introverted boy under that skin!I highly recommend this film! It's not just a film for Gay People, it's a film for all people! It crosses Cultural and Socio-Economical boundaries like I've never seen before. 10 STARS! No wonder why it's won 3 Oscars! For the little film that could, it gives Indie Filmmakers hope that they can make it too as long as you stay true to your craft!"
MOONLIGHT,10 April 2020,1/10,"Waste of time, boring and mentally draining. I feel like i need to see a therapist after watching this no joke. Don't put yourself through the torture. As to how this even made it to the big screen let alone get an Oscar is beyond a joke. I signed up for an account just so i can post this review as i have never had to do this before."
MOONLIGHT,29 May 2020,10/10,"Moonlight is one of the few films I can happily watch on mute. The story is perfectly captured visually through clear actions, so watching the film on silent almost has just as much value as watching it with the sound. However, I will say that the score of this film is also in a class of its own. After watching, I had so much love and compassion for the main character. I also felt a certain grace for all of the characters on screen. This is truly a beautiful and succinct film that every single person needs to see."
MOONLIGHT,15 January 2021,3/10,"I was really hyped about this film, as I expected some raw social critique about the various issues the film touches. I think it does a good job in presenting these tough subjects but my issue is with the plot itself. It is basically nothing. It doesn't happen anything and the film it is incredibly dull. It is really anti-climatic, it isn not entertaining at all and I think there are huge plot holes that should have been exploited so the film could make at least some sense. I think it had potential but there is not even a plot nothing really happens in the movie. I would've loved to know what happened with Juan and etc. I get that they wanted to show the different stages of Chiron's life but it is just too loose I think it lacks some consistency and that is why it falls apart. Maybe I didn't understand the film well enough and I should give it another go. I was too hyped and it just blew up in my face I didn't really enjoy it, let alone comparing it to other films such as La La Land. Tremendous disappointment."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2021,7/10,"It's not a bad movie, but the fact that when it was released it was sold as a masterpiece made it forget in the eyes of the general public."
MOONLIGHT,20 March 2021,10/10,"I've never been so touched by a movie before. The depth of tragic meaning of the movie is beyond word. the emotions, the sadness, the fate all integrate together smoothly. the cast are brilliant.."
MOONLIGHT,26 July 2021,,"Bad acting, bad plot. I went when it was released in my area. Partway through the film people were walking out f the theater."
MOONLIGHT,26 February 2017,10/10,"I'll admit it, going in to see the film, I had a preconceived notion that this film was simply going to fetish-ize gay, black love, make it sexy and beautiful as added arsenal to the liberal agenda. Well, it did all that, plus a whole lot more.Moonlight tells the universal story of a young man trying to find his place in the world. This particular young man had a few extra hurdles to face growing up which I can relate to, and can tell from some of the other reviewers that they did not; they were blessed enough to grow up in a safe, supportive environment and just do not get this movie and never will.The story is gritty in its realness of hostile school environments and the devastating effect of drugs on the ability of adults to nurture and guide their children. Yet the story is also beautiful, in it's characters' relationships - it tells the truth about the unique ""blended"" families in the black community, where it's not just about blood, but also who looks out for you in this cold, cold world.People are knocking the third act but it was my favorite. About 10 minutes into the diner scene, I realize we're still there, and there's no rush to leave and I admire that realistic view for once. It's rare that films will linger in such a manner, bringing you into the scene and having it encompass you like you are there, nice and slow, to be enjoyed like a multi-course, fine dining meal. Instead we are often ""treated"" to fast food movies, jumping from one scene to the next, just staying in one scene long enough to move the plot line along, as if in a race. If there is a race, Moonlight is the tortoise against all the other hares and wins the race.Some may call this movie a chick flick for gay men, but I think this film is an intimate, 20-page love letter to anyone living with self-doubt, pain, uncertainty, and the fear of being themselves. It is truly a gem."
MOONLIGHT,6 October 2021,1/10,Waste of time.and don't think it deserves any Oscar winning.
MOONLIGHT,30 May 2017,9/10,"I enjoyed the movie and was impressed by the script and direction. I had heard of it before the Oscar buzz as I enjoy independent film quite a bit. The focus in this ""genre"" is on writing, acting and atmosphere rather then budget and big-name actors. Not to say the actors are not well known as the main actors have impressive resumes and are excellent. Reading other reviews, I think the 1 or 2 stars simply don't ""get"" this type of movie or just watched it after the Oscars expecting another big budget melodrama. The 5 or 6 star reviews are at least honest in that they watched the entire movie and it just wasn't their cup of tea.Yes, it moves a bit slow and doesn't have a lot of dialog. It isn't packed with speeches and monologues and melodramatic interactions...it's all about atmosphere and body language and narrative. For those who say it's ""politically correct"", I don't really understand that statement. This is a story told by a gay black man who grew up in Florida...this is his story and he is telling it without any overt political messages. With virtually no marketing this movie made 60 million dollars on a 1.5 million dollar budget (which is ridiculously small for a movie with trained professional actors, sound editing cinematography etc etc). At least half of that was before it had any media buzz at all. That is why it got Oscar attention, not because of some politically correct conspiracy within the academy. How do you win an Oscar? 1) make a ton on money 2)cast daniel day lewis and spend a ton of money 3) make a musical with big name actors and spend a ton of money or 4) Simply write and direct a real honest story with good acting that us ""99 percenters"" can relate to. Most Oscar winning movies are in the first 3 categories, but once in a while the academy recognizes an independent quality film that has made an impact. They do it every few years.I'm not sure why i keep going on about other reviews...but was just surprised by the polarity of the reviews (most are either 2 or 10). Maybe IMDb should present the median score rather than the average. 9/10 stars (The cinematography could have been better..but for this price it's hard to criticize..other than that it was great)."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2017,5/10,"It was a 2 hours movie. I read the plot, i saw the rating, here, at IMDb. Plus, it was nominated and got some Oscar prizes. After all these, i am trying to find a way to like this movie or to find where the Oscar prizes are. By the plot, you can understand that the movie contains gangs, racism for the blacks, drugs in a better way, in a more complicated way -get in things-, a more LIVE movie. Nothing watched during these two hours. Just a guy that was gay, scared of himself, with basically no parents and nothing to talk about. Very closed to himself. He was afraid of the truth. What's the point?I rated this film with 5 stars, because 5 stars is the minimum i can give(1 star for other people).Next please.."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"The world is upside down! It is not normal to promote such ideas. That is Oscar gay!!!! Stupid people with no imagination. More specifically, Americans tired of life. It does not have anything interesting in this film, is dull and devoid of emotion for a normal person. Unfortunately it is not the first time (Brokeback Mountain). Rubbish like this happens and increasingly often."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,5/10,"This film is interesting and does give an insight into a different side of African American drug/gangster life and delves into subjects we very rarely see on main stream cinema, so this film is unique (in my opinion). There was good acting from all the main characters. Overall I would recommend its worth watching, but don't expect much. That said, and considering all the other Oscar nominated films, I really can't see what was so Oscar winning about this film to warrant the award for Best film and Best Supporting actor, when Mahershala Ali only appeared for a short time in the film, (don't get me wrong he is a good actor but not for this film). This film, in my opinion should not have won these Awards. I can't see what the big deal was with this film. The mix-up at the Awards ceremony was more like a Freudian slip."
MOONLIGHT,25 January 2017,7/10,"Son of a mother addicted to heroin (Naomie Harris, nominated for her performance at the Globe), Chiron's life is marked by abuses of others. Chiron child finds a supporter in the person of Juan (Mahershala Ali). Adolescence comes with the discovery of love, but it's a doomed love social; adulthood, we find again Chiron - but he is now the one that childhood dream? Story is good and well acted by all the cast all around.The movie is about finding one's identity and place in society, and masculinity and what it means to be a man.Naomie Harris captures well the psychology heroin addict in Moonlight, making portrait of a mother torn from reality, irresponsible moments of ""awakening"" that secures the son of her love."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2017,3/10,"This is a plane boring and useless movie. watching this movie has forced me to write the review. There is absolutely nothing in this movie to look forward to. It again proved that Oscar winning movies are seriously boring and seriously lack entertainment quotient. stereotypical mother , same old story which has been used by Hollywood from pst so many years."
MOONLIGHT,5 May 2017,1/10,"I've been IMDb member since the dawn of the internet. Voted for ~1500 movies. This is my first mini-review. You can imagine my frustration. There are two reasons I watched this movie: 1) Won an Oscar (often false alert) 2) IMDb score of above 7.5 I'm not frustrated that the movie won an Oscar. It was expected, considering the political times right now. What I'm frustrated about is that the IMDb community gave it such a high score and tricked me into seeing this unbelievable garbage. Don't watch this. Seriously. If you save 2 hours of your life and do pretty much ANYTHING else, you'd have a better time. If you just lay down on a lawn, staring at the black sky, you'd have a better time. If you go to the your city center and just stare at the passing people, you'd have a better time. If you stay in the parking lot in front of the cinema, you'd have a better time. I gave this movie a 2/10 score instead of 1, because of the brilliant Naomi Harris and another guy that suddenly disappears after the middle of the movie. IMDb, please allow us to vote ZERO, because this is what this movie's plot deserves."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,9/10,"Please. Much praise for Boyhood, it was same ""boring"" concept, but with Moonlight it worked because it was touchy and something new for us white people to see. So what if you can't relate to it, that's the f*cking point? Once you cut through the layers of where we're raised, with how much money and by whom, same old struggle remains and same feelings in us that form us. Thats about as much of a point from these movies as you can get"
MOONLIGHT,18 March 2017,9/10,"Since nothing is perfect, I give it a 9. For those of you who say the movie was about nothing, or was a response to last years #oscarssowhite and therefore a shallow attempt to bring balance to the film industry -- you are wrong. Yes, you are wrong. If you didn't like the movie or connect with it, then you need to try a little harder, or educate yourself, or please make a better effort at explaining why you did not connect with the film.The cinematography was beautiful. Every shot was done with consideration of the story and character. Do you remember any wide shots of a landscape? There were not many for a reason. I loved how close you were to the characters, you needed to see the emotions on their faces. That reason alone is what made this movie great...How could you watch the scene between Chiron's mom and Juan when she confronts him about selling crack to her, and not feel anything, or not understand the pain on Juan's face when he realizes the awful position he is in. OK, maybe most of us have never been in THAT exact situation, but we can empathize...and now apply that empathy to ever scene in the movie. All 3 stages of Chiron's life established this human connection. Do not say it is a story that has been told before....what does that even mean? I have never seen a story like this and the way it was brought to life on the screen is something truly unique to cinema i.e. the moving image with music and dialogue. Films like this have the power to evoke strong emotions from the viewer; Pathos, unlike any other art medium out there. Please see this movie."
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2018,3/10,And unbelievably bad movie! Poor story(telling) and even worse directing.
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,10/10,"Moonlight brings to light the harsh realities for lesbian, gay, bi and trans youth in African American communities. This is a great story about acceptance, drug abuse, poverty, sexuality and masculinity that in my opinion would benefit with better pacing. The film follows the life of Chiron as he grows up in poverty and an abusive household. With subtitled acts, we see Chiron as a kid, a teenager and as an adult. Personally, I felt at least twenty minutes could be cut out of the first act as it was a little drawn out and tedious."
MOONLIGHT,3 February 2017,10/10,"This is a movie that goes through the life of a guy. Even though the story tells you the story of a black guy, it is ultimately the story of a simple guy. It is a love story, or life story, and not for a single moment I had to think about gay relationships when I watched this. I really don't know how to describe it. It is beautiful.I haven't seen a movie so simple and yet so engaging, for a while now. There is not a single dull moment in this rather simple storyline. There is a not a single shocking moment in this movie but I was glued to the screen during the entire movie. Kudos to the writer and the director."
MOONLIGHT,30 January 2017,5/10,"I cannot see what so many others see in this film. The story line is predictable and formulaic. At times the camera work is poor, especially in the night scenes. A couple of times I felt that the camera lens must have had dirt on it. The continuity in some scenes was terrible. For example, in the early scene where they were playing football, the chain around Kevins' neck was out when shot from 1 angle then inside his shirt from another angle. Later on in the film, items were put onto a table and then when the shot widened they had disappeared. I was not the only one at the screening I went to that thought the last scene was very poor and did not really finish the film well. It was if there should have been a fourth section but they ran out of money to film it."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,4/10,"The themes in this movie are important. It is good to be aware of the struggles gay men face, and how repression and humiliation may lead one to a life of violence and criminality.I left the cinema with the firm belief that such a mission could have been performed so much better in the hands of a better director. The movie is ham-fisted. It is clich√©d. It is simplistic. It is trying to be artsy for the sake of being artsy. Some camera work is just strange: it does not seem to serve any purpose except to make the viewer nauseous. The dialogue is simple and clich√©d. There was not a single moment i felt truly touched by this movie. My partner had the same experience. We both tried, truly."
MOONLIGHT,4 January 2019,1/10,"No plot, no excitement, just a complete waste of time."
MOONLIGHT,29 October 2021,9/10,"Watching this movie at first was hard to get into it and undestand what was going on, even to understand the lingo. Was going to rate 2/10However, each stage has a purpose, the build up to the hard, drug dealing lifeless adult little has become only to see his human side appear with meeting Kevin again.Watch it a second time with the commentry by Barry Jenkins, it will help to understand the depth of each charactor."
MOONLIGHT,7 April 2017,7/10,"The first half of 2016's Best Picture, Moonlight, was really good. Great acting. Superb artistic direction. And this film was easily on its way to being an 8.5 on my list. But the last :40 was slow, boring, singular-pointed, lacked any concrete resolution, and it had a really lazy ending. I'm disappointed in a movie that had a lot to say, and had so much potential after the first hour... but ultimately failed in the end. I'm also disappointed that the professional critics seemed to judge it on its potential (99?) versus the IMDb users who judged it on it's complete merits (7.6)."
MOONLIGHT,11 August 2017,9/10,"This could/should have been a beautiful tender romance, just the last shot was out for me. Why couldn't they just be who they are in the 21st century. seal it with a kiss. It's like the film still had to act macho and be a 'coming of age' story. It's a love story. What are you ashamed of? . Love is stronger than that."
MOONLIGHT,9 May 2017,2/10,"I went to see this movie at the cinema, expecting to be a masterpiece since it worn the Oscar. The movie is really boring, it doesn't have an interesting plot. I left the cinema after 45 minutes of pure boredom. This is the fist movie where i walked out of the cinema. I am only giving it two stars because the I've enjoyed the popcorn and the soda."
MOONLIGHT,13 May 2017,10/10,"A touching elegiac piece of the tallest order. Jenkins is luminary and a real master of the art of cinema in showing and not telling and not slapping you around the face with unnecessary information. Each shot felt like a painting and told a thousand tales at once.I was particularly impressed by the tenderness and character development of Little, Chiron and Black as I felt it dealt with the micro complexities that exist within the male body beautifully. It allowed me to look at and understand not only their tussle for identity and defining his sexuality but most importantly posed a question, what does it actually mean to be a man? The inner turmoil of trying to be yourself amongst the masses that are trying to fit in is also a powerful element of universality to which is not exclusive to gender, race or sexuality which is something that we often all battle with. These two universal elements are what the films success are for me.From a craft perspective, the simple three act structure worked wonderfully and allowed you to be with each character at the crucial moments and to stay with them and be immersed within that particular reality, thus being able to relate or compare it to your own experience of those ages and periods within your own life whether you are gay or not, or even relating it to someone you may have known that went through the same thing. From picture, humanity, to universality and craft this film is timeless."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"I'll be quick, poor storyline, bad dialogs, no more than a movie trying to break any sterotype and trying to make you feel weird about it, Im the less racist person but if the whole cast would have been white this would make no sense really, they just get a black bullied guy as it happens to be gay then as an adult just gets like a 50 cent like person and still gay, which makes no sense anyone can be gay so what? no one cares"
MOONLIGHT,4 December 2017,10/10,"Moonlight is one of the best films of the year. It packs an emotional punch and has a lot to say. Director Barry Jenkins tackles many issues throughout it's one hundred and eleven minutes run time, such as violence, drugs and homophobia in urban culture. Moonlight follows the life path of our protagonist Chiron, a black youth growing up in the city of Miami Florida (A24Films.com). The film has a distinct three act structure, where you see Chiron as a young child, a teenager and as an adult, played by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes respectively. The film opens with a young Chiron is being relentlessly chased by his peers and is being called homophobic slurs. He outruns his attackers into an old apartment building where he is later found by Juan (played by Mahershala Ali) who is a local drug dealer in the town. He takes Chiron to his house to his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae) where they give him a nice meal and over time the three of them bond, to make a nice family dynamic. There is a heartbreaking scene in which the three of them are seated around the table and Chiron asks Juan what the word ""faggot"" means. Juans tells him that it's a term to make gay people feel bad. And Chiron asks, ""Am I a faggot?"" which made me tear up a little. It shows that homosexuality in urban culture is not looked upon kindly. Chiron also has a terrible home life, where he lives with his mother (played by Naomie Harris) They all act phenomenally in their roles. Naomie Harris also shines, in her role as Chiron's mother, Paula. Paula is not the best of mom's. She is addicted to crack cocaine, coincidentally sold to her by Juan. Chirons only friend is Kyle, who he eventually develops a sexual relationship with.During the second part of the film, Chiron continues to deal with even more problems. He is constantly getting picked on by a bully named Terrell (Patrick Decile) and his mom has gotten even more dependant on drugs, and is even stealing money from her son to buy drugs. (A24Films.com) He is also hiding the fact that he has been intimate with Kyle, who has become a very popular kid at school. There is one scene it which Terrel (who is friends with Kyle) wants Kyle to beat up Chiron. Kyle lands a few blows on Chiron and Chiron falls to the ground. Chiron stands up from the beating and Kyle tells Chiron to stay down with tears in his eyes. Then Kyle is pressured to keep hitting Chiron by Terrell, and really hurts Chiron before the school staff can break up the beating. I won't spoil it, but the decision that Chiron makes following the beating changed the lives of Chiron forever. The final act of the film takes place when Chiron is a young man, and I won't say how it ends.Barry Jenkins did a phenomenal job creating this film. He in fact wrote the film and directed it. He beautifully utilizes color in the film, especially the deep blues. From a technical standpoint, the film looks extremely beautiful. It is edited very nicely Nat Sanders. The actors individually shine throughout the movie. It almost didn't seem like a movie, it seemed like I was watching real life, which is the biggest compliment I can give to a movie like this. This is not a happy film. It is dreary and sad from start to finish with little hope in sight It is very depressing, much like last years Manchester By The Sea. It was a film that you only really want to see once because it is so sad. There is not a lot of replay value here. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. Schindler's list a great, powerful film, but I wouldn't necessarily want to watch it again. This film is extremely human and thought provoking. It is a film I believe everyone should watch at least once. Moonlight is a masterpiece.Grade: A+"
MOONLIGHT,17 March 2017,10/10,"At last! Not only do we have an accurate account of gay loneliness-- An account of how an environment can force gay people into uncomfortable shapes-- An account of how gay men fight in harsh communities-- But we also have a movie that understands and excels at its own medium.Moonlight is as close to perfect that a movie can get. It backs away from dialogue and, through the stunning performances by the three actors who play the main character (and who never met before or during the production at all!), shows how emotion can be expressed without words. Some people don't like or understand this creative decision, but it was absolutely critical in the unveiling and developing of Chiron, a boy who has had to hide within his own skin for his entire childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.Poetic visuals, careful editing, and terrific cinematography express in such a beautiful way how certain events in a person's life can dramatically alter their futures. The pacing and the subdivision into three parts that stand on their own as stories within a greater story add to this effect. It really felt like I was living a life, and THAT'S what a movie should be. On top of tremendous acting and directing and overall craftsmanship, a great movie will have a story that demands its audience to step out of their own skin for 2 hours and empathize with each and every event that happens to the characters. Moonlight is the very first movie in a long life of movie-watching that has made me do this without any trouble at all.This movie was beautiful-- every frame was necessary and built on to the movie like a layer of wax. At the same time, it was so hard to watch, simply because of how well Barry Jenkins made us care about the outcome of Chiron's life. Because there were no clich√©s at all in the telling of this risk-taking story, I clung to every moment in anticipation for what was to come. The realism of this movie is unparalleled; it had me waiting out each scene without any knowledge of what was to come.I can't express enough just how great and important this movie is. Please don't listen to the poor reviews on this website! Make time for this movie and really let yourself go. Let yourself enjoy, empathize, and pay close attention to every minute detail. You won't be disappointed. This movie is a cinematic feast and it whole-heartily deserved Best Picture."
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2018,2/10,"Chiron as an adult is the best thing in the movie. We miss the whole 10 years from his life which could have made this movie really special. But rather than that, we only watch a movie going on circles about Chiron's sexuality."
MOONLIGHT,14 July 2018,10/10,Just a fantastic movie... it brings you in and has you emotionally attached to the characters
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"Unbelievably bad, bad camera work, long and drawn out, bad acting, you name it, everything was just bad. I felt like I was watching a low budget, student film. It was a struggle to finish this. I feel like this movie was a joke. The Academy has lost their collective minds.. This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I always make it a point to watch all the Best Pictures and usually they are somewhat on point. This was just insane, I don't get it. If they wanted to get political Hidden Figures should have won, at least that was a good move."
MOONLIGHT,24 March 2018,3/10,There is nothing interesting about the story. Acting was awful. Directing was poor. I hated myslef for even picking this garbage to watch.
MOONLIGHT,11 April 2020,10/10,A visually stunning coming of age story. Moonlight's elegant and intimate storytelling keeps you gripped throughout the entire film; not a second wasted was on irrelevant subplots or unnecessary conflicts. The approach taken on this Urban journey of self love and growth is genius and it's a must see.
MOONLIGHT,4 April 2017,7/10,"This is one of interesting movies that I ever seen. Acting, background music, camera movements all great, keep you going with the story. It's almost 2 hours long movie but after watching it I felt like I spent only 20 minutes... the ending part left me thinking... is it the end? It's nice to watch Ali with his great presence in the screen."
MOONLIGHT,9 March 2017,2/10,"Simply put, a film about nothing! Boring, predictable, dull. Why do so many films and series nowadays need to have a gay appeal? Really, it just seems so pushed and needles sometimes. It is hard to believe that this movie has won the Oscar, specially when compared with great movie like Arrival, for instance."
MOONLIGHT,1 July 2020,10/10,"Maybe some of the reviewers here don't enjoy the nuance of a moment. We live and our lives are interrupted by addiction, anger, betrayal, depression, love, and passion. This film explores all of the human emotions in a modern context. It's truly beautiful and accurate and I just think it's flawless."
MOONLIGHT,26 February 2017,10/10,"I truly appreciated this movie! The film & all those of you who made it & stared in it, really touched my heart! A brilliant movie! I felt I was sharing & appreciating a look into the life of someone I would never have known personally. I'm a middle aged woman who did not grown up with any similar life experiences or environment of ""Chiron"", but the movie transcended my unfamiliarity and allowed me to feel Chiron's life experience as if we'd went through it together, of course I was only an observer but it still made me feel a true empathy because of the way the movie was written, directed & acted! All three of these ingredients lent to an exceptional ability to make Chiron's emotions so palpable. I've never made a review on this website but I was so impacted emotionally by this movie I want to share it and say watch this film! Hopefully you will share an appreciation of Chiron's life. An experience I would normally know nothing about but felt a connection and some understanding of someone I might never have had a pleasure to know so intimately. Bravo!"
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,2/10,"This has got to be the worst movie to ever win an Oscar for best picture. This movie can owe its Oscar to the current social and political climate in the USA. A gift from the elitist, entitled lefties in Hollywood. Hollywood owes me 2 hours; if it won an Oscar for best picture...then it must be worth watching right? Wrong."
MOONLIGHT,27 October 2017,1/10,"There is nothing in this movie. I don't know what is the hype all about.You can not find a single interesting thing in this movie.This is the most uninteresting movie I have ever seen in my life. Save your two hours, watch something else. Movies are made to entertain people and this movie sucks at that."
MOONLIGHT,1 October 2017,4/10,"moonlight is a film that deserves recognition on its technical basis - it's a beautifully filmed motion picture. the colour palette is incredible, and the camera work is lovely. there are some strong performances by some of the actors too.however, this has unfortunately blinded everyone to the fact that the plot is majorly lacking in depth; it touches on some important elements of life (bullying, homophobia, drug abuse etc.), but fails to explore them enough to have an emotional impact on viewers. I commend them for acknowledging the existence of topics that are so very relevant, real and difficult, but the execution of them was poor. there is nothing transcendent about this film, it doesn't leave you thinking about anything.films don't always have to have a huge meaning, but when advertised as something ground breaking and having emotional impact, I'd have expected more than what moonlight consists of. this film presents themes, but doesn't deal with them. unfortunately, this is not enough to satisfy me or justify winning an Oscar - it just proves that the public are too scared of being honest about the quality of a piece of work when it touches on sensitive subjects."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,8/10,"I was not prepared for this movie on what it was about. But for kids growing up in Miami is not easy, especially Liberty City. I have been through there driving and did not know it's history, but was fine and had no problems. (I was lost) This movie showed what it was like to be a black gay child growing up in an extremely bad area. Most kids do not make it out. When you think of Miami, you think of South Beach and all the sexy stars and people and loads of money and probably not 10 miles away you have this worst poor area in the U.S. This movie just made me think after I saw it of the kids growing up in poverty."
MOONLIGHT,14 November 2016,9/10,"An excellent example of what a cinematic experience should be. For a movie to inspire, captivate and satisfy is an accomplishment and Moonlight delivers.An intimate story of struggle for a young boy growing up in borderline destitution with a drug addicted mother, without a father figure, bullying and if it wasn't enough -- the challenge of discovering his sexuality in being gay.Moonlight is presented to it's audience in three gripping acts; childhood, adolescence and becoming an adult with each being as fascinating and poignant as the next.The direction by Barry Jenkins combined with James Laxton's gorgeous cinematography makes for an immersive and fulfilling cinematic memory that are sure to be recognized for their accomplishments."
MOONLIGHT,9 April 2017,9/10,"Why so many negative reviews? I enjoyed the movie very much..excellent character portrayals. This is not really a bang bang fast movie as some people might have been anticipating, hence their disappointment, but it was a very thoughtful movie..I found it touching and insightful as to what children and adults endure in life..Glad to see portrayal of gay characters with such sensitivity."
MOONLIGHT,8 January 2017,9/10,"This was simply beautiful story telling. From the first frame I knew that we were in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing. This is the first time I've ever been moved to leave a review for anything. I have so much hope for this director and for the actors in this film. The only issue I have with this film sadly isn't with the film at all but with the fact that I'm sure there are plenty of other beautiful scripts out there featuring people of colour, African Americans specifically, that don't get greenlit because they aren't about a young child trying to survive in the mean streets of whatever city they happen to be in. You could argue that that's more politics than art but I'd say you can't really separate the two."
MOONLIGHT,17 June 2017,10/10,"I see review titles like 'Overrated', 'About Nothing', or 'Waste of Time' and these always get the featured review. Why? This film is incredible. Its not about nothing. Its most certainly not a waste of time. The cinematography is stunning, the story is subtle and carefully crafted, the performances are all amazing. The fact that each actor carries Chiron's mannerisms from boyhood to adulthood speaks volumes of their talent. The director creates a three-pillar story in the style of something that Kubrick did regularly (2001, Full Metal Jacket, and Clockwork Orange) and was praised for it. I can't think of any reason why this film deserves the hated lambasting its gotten other than the context of its story. Yes, it is about a gay man. No, its not about him being gay. Its about how a person of 'another' group handles being different, and how love of all forms can overcome the hatred and toxicity of one's environment, if only given a chance. It doesn't beat you over the head with its message like Hacksaw Ridge nor does it try to blow your mind like Arrival (both great films in their own right), but rather lets you experience in as close proximity as possible the torrential wave of unnecessary hate plaguing this nation to this day. Its not about nothing. To even suggest this infuriates me. It shows a willful and deliberate ignorance and disregard for the film entirely. If you don't like it, fine. But have a legitimate reason."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,6/10,"In its mission to annoy the idiot from the white house, the Academy makes us all idiots for staying the night, watching the awards. Apart from the performance of Ali (only first 30 minutes, for about 10 minutes of screen time), Moonlight is one of the most boring, uninteresting and predictable movies i have ever seen. Bullied, black kid turned bullied black gay adolescent, turned bully black man wishing to come out of the closet. √ènspiring? Best picture? Screenplay ????? It's a horrible joke."
MOONLIGHT,9 March 2017,2/10,"It's a preference of mine to know as least as possible about a film going into it. With Moonlight winning best picture, I was extremely excited to see it. Well I sure wish someone would have told me it was a HOMOSEXUAL LOVE STORY! I was expecting there to be some racial stereotypes and showing the strength of black people, which is another reason why I wanted to see it. But gaw-damn do you think that someone could have put that on the poster or something??? It was super awkward in that theatre I'll say that much. It's my belief whatever drives Hollywood wants more children to grow up gay, for reasons I'm not sure on but possibly population control?? Easier to control more feminine culture? Spoiler time!!! The first third of the movie is probably the best part. Young ""Little"" has pretty much the shittiest life you can have. His Mom is a crackhead prostitute and he gets bullied to no end. In enters Mahershala Ali as blue, he absolutely nailed it. He turns out to be his Mom's crack dealer which sounds like an awesome twist! What happens next? After a ""pep talk"" we'll call it where Ali pretty much tells him he is gay at like 8 years old cause some kids called him ""Faggot"", we fast forward to Teenager Little. Now there's like zero mention of what happened to Ali, unless I missed something other than he died. I'm getting bored of writing this the movie sucked big time."
MOONLIGHT,1 November 2017,1/10,"I did my best to watch this movie till the end and now I honestly regret that. The only reason this dull movie got 3 Oscars is because it is about black and gay people. Totally disaster of a movie. There is no story, no guideline, actors are shallow and only one that deserves thumbs up is Ali, but that is also far away from role that deserves an Oscar. If you want spend 2 hours of you life more useful better stare at a wall then watch this joke of a movie."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,10/10,"Not to sound like a pretentious asshole, but this is a movie you actually have to pay attention to instead of having people shout and shoot guns to emphasize the plot. It's an intellectual film that moves slowly in order to represent how life feels to a person living one. Those who call the film clich√© are absolutely ridiculous. Find me another film about a vulnerable yet masculine gay man who is black and at the end of the film embraces his sexuality without either dying or being terribly upset forever. If you can do that, I will give you a million dollars because nothing of that nature exists. This movie draws upon the lives of Barry Jenkins and the playwright themselves. The cinematography is unparalleled. The acting is fantastic. The story is flawless. The movie is about watching and experiencing and feeling. Yeah, it's slow at some parts, but it's supPOSED to be. The scene with Black and Kevin in the diner in the third act is incredibly slow moving as it plays with the ambiance and timbre of ""Hello Stranger"" by Barbara Lewis to reflect the dripping tension between the two characters. It's a film for those who can truly appreciate the art of storytelling and images to create something fluid and beautiful. Those calling it boring and clich√© merely did not watch it correctly. I find that most of these are white people saying that it's the Oscars way of making up for not having POCs win last year, but Moonlight is an excellent film all on its own. If you don't like it, you should really ask yourself why. Is it because there's no white people in the cast, and you find it hard to relate? Is it because it's about struggling with your sexuality, and you've never had that problem before? Really consider these two things and watch the movie again. It's truly a transformative experience if you erase your bitterness and listen to what it's trying to tell you. Some people just aren't smart enough to do that."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,6/10,"good acting, interesting cinematography, utterly plain and uninteresting story of a poor black kid, crack-addicted mother, a drug dealer for a role model, some sexual identity problems, and he grows up to be a - surprise !! - a drug dealer. oh, and his mommy is sorry -some 20 years later- for mistreating him. No interesting plot, no interesting characters, nothing inspirational or at least mildly surprising. The best thing that can be said about the scenario is that is lacking some major stereotypes like black gangs in bandanna's brandishing weapons at every corner. Acting and cinematography worthier of a better story."
MOONLIGHT,11 November 2018,10/10,La historia es muy po√©tica y la fotograf√≠a es de una extraordinaria belleza.
MOONLIGHT,23 February 2017,10/10,"Moonlight is one of those rare films that steers away from conventional methods of storytelling and cinema without edging on pretentious or boring. Despite being a film with a very small demographic when seen in face value(namely grasping your sexuality, family troubles, African American neighborhoods, masculinity), but dig deeper, it's an universal story. Any singular person would find a struggle as shown in the film. Buoyed by the three magnificent actors and small mellow roles by Janelle Monae and Andre Holland, it is Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali who steals the show. Naomie Harris plays Paula to such an astonishing level of perfection, that one might find it impossible to believe that it was shot in three days or that this is her first film where she plays an addict woman. Mahershala Ali, oh my, words defy the brilliance of this man. and 2016 is the year he finally got his due. His act of Juan, The rough dubious mentor with a heart of gold is a breathtaking performance that overshadows anything this year. The subtle changes in expression, the body language, the tinge of hurt and anger on his face everything Chiron is pulled away from him by Paula. I cannot even begin to imagine anyone else in the role. The narrative of breaking the story line into three was a risky choice, as this method is largely restricted to plays, but it paid off and how so. Each act is distinct and unique, yet the same. Barry Jenkins stitched the film with utter perfection and with a searing sizzle that keeps you thoroughly engaged. The music, from the song at the start with a word i am not entitled to say, or the slow piano notes throughout. it augments the film to another level, while never being in any direct sight. The Writing and Direction need no mention, because if they were anything short of the almighty, We wouldn't be raving about the film like this. In all, Barry Jenkins has crafted a film that is not for everybody, but for Everybody. Identity is a long highway, and it was a privilege to drive on the road to Chiron."
MOONLIGHT,25 February 2021,9/10,"Moonlight is an incredible movie for many reasons. It's not just about being black and gay. It's about so much more. It depicts the struggles of a young man. It's about identity, about family, about masculinity. It's about coming of age, about dealing with bullying, about finding out who you are and what your purpose is. Who to trust and who not to of those around you as you grow up. All of this is shown through great cinematography and visuals (consider the use of color analogies all throughout). The whole thing is elevated even further thanks to the incredible performances from basically every single actor/character in the film. One of the many great things of this movie plot-wise was the dynamic built around Chiron's relationships with his mother and with Juan respectively. Both have hard lives as well, both struggle in their own ways. Juan comes across as a father figure to Chiron more than anyone, even though he's a drug dealer. And Chiron's mother, even though she's addicted and never took care of him as a child, is apologizing to him in the end, telling him that she loves him no matter what. It shows that even though people may do bad things, it doesn't mean they're bad people or that they aren't capable of doing good things. Going a little more in depth: the scene in the ocean where Chiron is taught how to swim is by merely itself Best Picture worthy material. So is the final scene where for the first time in his whole life, he finally learns to accept himself for who he is. Moonlight depicts the journey of a man coming to senses with himself and with his purpose like no other. Moonlight has such an emotional impact that it just leaves you breathless after watching. At least that's what happened to me. Truly an unforgettable cinematic experience."
MOONLIGHT,7 November 2016,10/10,"Barry Jenkins and James Laxton gave a fantastic cinematographic look to this film, a beautiful dance of different compositions, and camera movements to bring life to this fascinating story. Really happy to spend my Sunday night watching this lovely film, and inspiration to many... Where love is all matter... Love the beach scene and how closed you could feel their feelings and the amazing execution of the different shots, the bokeh in the back absolutely gorgeous. This story inspire me in many ways of my life to keep fighting harder every day, because we all human beings and we all deserve to be treat and respected. I have strong feelings this movie will make it very far and hope to see it at The Academy Awards too."
MOONLIGHT,10 March 2017,10/10,"It's a rare pleasure to experience a film that exemplifies the artistic potential of its medium but the characteristic of Moonlight that I find most endearing is its truth. I know for a fact that the story is genuine not only because the ensemble did an exemplary job of fleshing out the characters but because as a black gay male from Jacksonville, Florida I can relate in a way that makes me wonder how the writer got in my head. The cherry on top is the final chapter of the movie where Kevin and ""Black"" share an emotional intimacy that belies physical contact. The fact that there isn't an explicit sex scene at the end only intensifies the emotional and sexual undertones. Bravo!!!"
MOONLIGHT,5 May 2017,10/10,"Yes, this movie is extremely simple there's nothing extremely eye catching about it and no dramatic moments, at least nothing action life, nothing crazy. However this movie was not meant to be an extremely action movie with plot twists or anything of that nature, it's about an experience and it's not a black versus white movie it is the experience of a black person movie. This movie is so much more than a gay black boy growing up, it speaks volumes about the black community, just being black in a black coming, as a person who grew up around that and in Miami that's literally my home and as bisexual woman this movie resonated with me in so many ways like it's supposed to, so no not everyone will get the same impact the same great impact that it has. This is about the emotional trauma and turmoil that we go through trying to defy the expectations and not just to society outside of our community but the hard expectations within our community and what it does to this man, this boy, can't even say more than three words and hardly spells, like he's had this emotional traumatic experience growing up within this community, and that hits you so hard when you see that and it's not just him being shy it's it's him being broken. This movie was great even not looking at the content look at the acting the amazing Dynamic acting and how everything is so real and it's a raw emotion. watching him as a grown man, sill being this broken person unable to hardly speak full sentences and still being unsure of himself, it's beautiful, it was a beautiful masterpiece and you guys just don't get it because you're expecting some big deal, you expect so much from black people, for y'all to see a black movie as great it has to be over and beyond all these high expectations but it's great because it resonates an experience that a great portion of us minorities can relate to. It's a journey, a beautiful and tragic one."
MOONLIGHT,4 February 2017,8/10,"Moonlight is as a sea which the main actor is on a boat among this ocean. The emotions is like the waves of this sea. But never the main actor reach the beach, never. The acts is not completely rolled. It couldn't show the bad actions that happened on black people in America on that years. And there is a lot of hole in scenario. There is a well rhythm between the acts and the scenario and actually the good film screening. I liked this movie smooth video recording. Mise en scene beautifully arranged by director.Jenkins' repeated use of the ""Moonlight"" colors - blue, light purple, and dark blue - add brilliantly to the central protagonist's ambition and moods. But surely I can say this film is one of the best twenty films of the year."
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2016,10/10,"Told in three parts, the story of a bullied boy ('Little"") growing up with a lack of love and guidance in the slums of Miami, his life as an isolated, beleaguered teenager (""Chiron"") and finally his persona and relationships as a man (""Black"" ). Script, directing, acting, cinematography, music were all outstanding. The acting will blow you away. The themes at play have rarely been given such a realistic rendering. You feel as if you are watching a real boy cope with the strange unfairness he finds at every turn. And you are grateful for the occasional kindnesses he receives. The audience I was with at Telluride LOVED it. I feel it is a masterpiece."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,10/10,"Everybody who didn't like this movie is smoking. This is one of the best films of 2016 by far. The amazing actors, cinematography, and score support the character-driven story. To those saying it is slow and boring, sorry that it's not john wick 2 and doesn't feature gun battles and famous celebrities. The pace of this movie is perfect. This is how a movie should be. This is how ART should be. Most of the mainstream movies today are a source of entertainment, which is fine, but it does not make the viewers think in any sort of intellectual way. People forget that film is supposed to be an art form. They think its just for entertainment but are missing out on great works because of what they think. Moonlight is great and is my favorite film of 2016."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,10/10,"Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. It's also important to remember that just because you don't understand something, that doesn't mean it is unimportant or invalid. Just because you can't relate to the entire story doesn't mean pieces of it can't teach you something about life. Just because the narrative is one that isn't widely told, doesn't mean it should be disregarded. If you don't understand this film or find it a waste, look deep inside yourself and ask why. 10/10 would recommend."
MOONLIGHT,24 February 2017,10/10,"This movie floored me, flattered me an is easily one of the best Movies of 2016. There isn't a single shot in this film that feels misplaced. Moonlight is a masterwork. The cinematography in this movie is amazing and the editing is perfect. There are some Oscar worthy performances in the movie including Naomi Harrisses as Chirons mother and Mahershala Ali's as Juan. I think you should all go see this movie cause it's great."
MOONLIGHT,10 February 2018,7/10,"I wanted to turn the movie off for 5 seconds. You can't do that. You just can't. Show me the person who was responsible for the opening track. I tell him thank you. With the first seconds to set the pace, mood, atmosphere. The key scene falls exactly on the middle of the time. She had so many questions, frustration and a feeling that some people for the first time in my life I saw men kissing. Man and threw the skin color of the characters. You don't like that? Not look. Nobody. No one's forcing you. It's a movie, and then you need. The final version of Chiron accurately falls into place and time. Pierced ears, grills, a chain, a gold watch, a cool low-ride car, but it's the image of a drug dealer gangster. The final shot with Little. People have changed outwardly, but what he was in the shower?This is not a review, but thoughts out loud. Reviews are not needed.light"
MOONLIGHT,10 January 2019,2/10,"I watched this movie for two reasons
1. It won the best picture oscar
2. its been rated 99 on metacritic.com
I am actually very dissapointed how a movie so far fetched, full of cliches and over-the-top drama could make it this big? I am an indian, I dont understand black and white culture, but I know when a story is promising.
The only thing I liked was cinematography. Rest I couldn't take. yet I sat through it."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,4/10,There is really no polite way of putting it. Moonlight did not deserve to win the Oscar for best picture albeit the entire cast gave a heartfelt performance. The cast is let down by a plot that leaves so many blank spaces. There little to no clues to help the audience put the pieces together. Maybe the #Oscarsowhite (which they were) movement got to the Academy and this was an attempt to clear their conscience. when a movie leaves you with suspense you're left exclaiming what now! you're glued to your sit even when the credits begin to roll trying to figure out what will happen to the characters. Moonlight has most viewers asking what now? not out of suspense but in an attempt to fill the many blank spaces left. I do not advise against watching this movie however I caution against having your expectations high.
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,10/10,"Written on 28th Jan 2017 before general release How ironic is this? Recently I have been watching Kevin Spacey's House of Cards on DVD - Remy Denton grabbed my attention as he is so FIT I was drooling, then I received an email from Curzon with an image from Moonlight - and it is Remy with Alex Hibbert ( Child Chiron ) noting the word 'sexuality' and that Remy is in the film I did not hesitate to book a ticket for a special Q&A viewing with The Director Barry Jenkins.So on 27th Jan on auto pilot I headed for the Curzon in Soho, been here so many times, arriving just after the 6.25pm start time, 'I hope there are plenty of trailers' then I got a rather puzzled expression and glancing at my printed ticket the response was 'Moonlight is showing at Curzon Chelsea' doh! - ¬£15 later I arrived, missing at least twenty minutes was of no consequence, I so wanted to be there for the Q&A.Within moments I was mesmerized, it is very rare that I will watch a released film more than once - only 12 years a Slave so far, the film has to be exceptional - and Moonlight is so in this category.Made on a tiny budget with a cast that in the main had little or no previous acting experience, Alex Hibbert as child Chiron had only been in a school drama class six weeks. Barry Jenkins has used filming techniques that are groundbreaking, and has created a film that is so beautiful and gives time and space for the audience to absorb.For me this film is far more significant than Brokeback Mountain.It is so rare for the black on black genre of sexuality to be explored on the big screen. The advice had been that there would be a 'limited audience' the reality has been the opposite, it has been a smash all over the world.I was sitting at this sold out event and we are talking 713 seats and noted how diverse the audience.Barry Jenkins Q&A so many of us after commented that we could have listened to the brilliant Director for hours.There are segments of the film that will reduce you to tears but will also fill your heart with joy.How often has a low budget film with NO CGI or Drones used for filming left Multi Million Dollar productions look pale? This film is perfection at every level so if you rarely venture to the cinema, and may be thinking, I will wait until it's released on DVD - DON'T WAIT, make an exception and go see Moonlight in the Cinema."
MOONLIGHT,27 May 2017,1/10,"Suffered through this whole movie because of the Oscar win. Big mistake. Amazon should give me an extra day on my free trial for this waste of time. The main character has 15 words of dialogue in the entire film, and I'm supposed to feel a connection? Next time I have the urge to watch the struggles of a gay, black man in the 'hood, I'll go with The Wire. ""Little"" has got nothing on Omar Little."
MOONLIGHT,30 January 2017,1/10,"Without a doubt this should be at the top of the most overrated movies of 2016. I cannot believe that I managed to stay awake during this trite story that goes absolutely nowhere. Not sure what message the director was trying to convey, but it utterly lost in the unbelievably slow pace and sleep inducing dialogue. Evidently this is supposed to be a story about a young, black man who is coming to terms with being gay in the gang/drug culture of Miami. Maybe that's a good story line, but it is impossible to relate to any of the characters due to the horribly boring writing. Definitely a movie to be missed. Borderline unwatchable and certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,1/10,This is the worst movie i ever watched in my life. watch it only if u wanna waste 2 hours of you life. There is nothing in this movie nothing.i just wanna say the peoples who give Oscar to this movie are stupid or ether high on weed. Please do not watch this sh*t
MOONLIGHT,13 April 2017,6/10,"Moonlight is the 2017 Best Picture Winner, directed by Barry Jenkins on an incredibly small budget of just 1.5 million dollars.It tells the story of a young, African-American, gay man called Chiron growing up in a rough neighbourhood in Miami, touching upon subjects of homosexuality, being bullied and being raised by a drug-addicted mother. The story itself is split into 3 main parts which revolve around the different age brackets of Chiron's life; childhood, adolescence and adulthood.While the film promotes an all-black cast starring House of Cards & Luke Cage's, Mahershala Ali and Spectre's, Naomie Harris, the stand out performance is most definitely Aston Saunders who portrays Chiron during the second part of the film, through his teenage years. He perfectly captures the mannerisms and vulnerability of the character set out by young Alex R. Hibbert who plays Chiron in the first part of the film. I have to applaud the casting director who paired these two together as it works really well, so much so that you can completely believe the time jump between ages; it feels very real, almost like you're watching a 'Boyhood' styled documentary.For the most part, I enjoyed Moonlight, it instantly caught my attention with interesting and unusual camera work. Every shot appears to be well thought-out, allowing the story to be shown beautifully through the lens. The look and tone of film is spot on, the director has used a high contrast between light & dark to really capture the vivid 'Miami' colours while setting a mood of depression, loneliness and violence. Moonlight knows exactly what it is and never deviates from this with any unnecessary subplots or an unbelievable third act that we come to expect from 'Hollywood' of late.Ultimately though, I feel the film is too slow and mainly let down by its story. It crawls along without a great deal happening which is surprising given its 1 hour and 51 minute run time. It never quite reaches the level of excitement I had hoped for given the amount of hype the film had received during the awards season.The issues that are raised are current and interesting living in today's society but I feel they could have been explored in greater depth. It has a lot to say without ever really saying it, which is a great shame.We never truly experience the full pain and heart-ache of being raised by a drug-addicted mother or difficulty in discovering your sexuality and consequently being bullied at school. Perhaps it should have focused on one time period of Chiron's life and/ or covered only one of the many issues that the story raises instead of trying to cover them all? As a result the film leaves you feeling quite empty and thinking the story of Chiron could have been told better.Overall though, it is a good film, just a little disappointing. For all the faults or issues I had with it, I found myself engaged and unable to look away which is certainly down to the superb performances and direction displayed throughout. It's definitely worth watching for these elements alone but I wouldn't particularly recommend it as a 'must see' as I believe a lot of people could find it slow and lose interest quickly."
MOONLIGHT,13 November 2016,5/10,"The story behind Moonlight is heart wrenching. A tale of a gentle and sweet boy who grew up under awful circumstances with a drug addicted mother in the slums of Miami, surrounded by drug dealers and a culture where failure to ""be hard"" resulted in being singled out and picked on. The boy named Chiron, survives with support from a kind drug dealer and his wife Teresa, and his only friend Kevin with whom he has a brief sexual encounter as a teenager. The two young men suppress any feelings afterward and continue surviving in their bleak environment. After being beaten up by a group of boys including Kevin in a hazing incident, who was challenged to engage in the brutality as proof of his masculinity, Chiron finally loses control and breaks a chair over the head of the ringleader. In the third part of the chronicle Chiron moves to Atlanta where we are told he becomes a drug dealer and tries to harden his attitude towards life and suppress his homosexuality. Finally, a decade later he returns to see Kevin, ultimately confessing his unrequited love and the two grown men are united at last. Unfortunately for the viewer of the movie the story is told horrendously and is a complete failure at making the characters or any of the relationships come to life. Having read the early reviews I couldn't wait to see this film. It sounded so compelling and poignant I could not imagine how it could be anything other than spectacular. Boy was I wrong. Moonlight is the equivalent of buying a product you are convinced you will love and then slowly discovering that it is seriously mis-engineered, all the while desperately trying to convince yourself that its underlying great qualities will ultimately redeem it. Finally, you reach the depressing point of acceptance and cast it aside, shaking your head and feeling foolish for ever buying the darn thing. That was how I felt walking out of this movie.The inexplicable thing about the failure of Moonlight to reach the viewer is it truly has all the elements of greatness but never pulls them together in any meaningful way. The filmmaking itself is gorgeous at times. The acting by Ashton Sanders who plays the teenaged Chiron is absolutely excellent and could have been amazing had they allowed the opportunity to fully develop his character. The movie ends up being awful, but beyond that is was just uniquely disappointing. The best way to describe the failure of this film is thru all the non existent relationships they keep leading you to and that you are dying to see them build, and then¬Ö nothing happens. The boys crackhead mom Paula, played by Naomie Harris is a character who we are led to believe, despite her drug induced psychosis ultimately loves her son. The mother and son never show an inkling of chemistry and no relationship of any kind ever materializes, not even a dysfunctional one really. Mahershala Ali who plays the drug dealer Juan who befriends Chiron does a superb job and is the one believable relationship we see in the movie. Neither the teenage or adult friend Kevin do anything to convince the viewer that he has any true feelings of love for Chiron. The wife of the drug dealer is Teresa, the actress Janelle Monae. Again, she is a supposed surrogate mother who provides food, shelter, and what we assume is emotional support to the young man, but we never see it expressed in any way. It's probably the best example of a disappointment that leaves you craving to see something of significance occur between the two. But the dynamic between the two comes off as simply contrived. My guess is a lot of people are going to have their expectations crushed after seeing this film. Somebody could make this into an amazing novel, I hope they do actually."
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,7/10,"Moonlight is a beautifully made movie that serves to please the professional critics or those that have studied film making in college! This is definitely not everybody's cup of tea, not even mine. I don't get the sense of fulfilling after finished watching it for a movie that supposed to be the best film of the year. Despite all the technical accomplishments (cinematography, editing, soundtracks and screenplay are exceptional!), my personal problem with this movie is the absence of narrative arc and some mediocre acting. I mean, I get the message. The struggle about black gay boy bla bla but I was expecting the storyline is crafted to be a lil bit complicated and emotional as that's what drama should be . The storyline is too simple and fell flat. The dialogues are mediocre. I don't really get the same emotional effect like I did after watching movie that convey more-or-less identical theme and message like Brokeback Mountain. I mean, like come on, you can be great at both technical and storyline, so why choose either one? I was expecting to be drowned in emotional journey before watching as I know it bears an important topic/issue in society. But, when the director decides to play with all the filmmaking techniques existed, the drama wasn't there, the story wasn't convincing enough and at the end, you feel extremely bored. Some of the powerful scenes like Juan and Chiron in the beach, Chiron's mother demands for money, but with narrative arc, there can be more and this what I think the movie misses; to be an efficient storyteller.Some of the acting are outstanding. For instance, Naomi Harris, young Chiron and teenage Chiron. When you were convinced with their character, struggles and honesty, then, you know they play the parts really well. For me, Mahershala Ali has done quite a good job as well. But I just don't really get his role. For someone who lives in the hood, selling cracks, troubled kids everywhere, then, one day, you saw this one kid running around and instantly, get interested and helped to raise him. It just doesn't make sense for me. On the other hand, the rest of the actors are mediocre. Adult Chiron is too straight to play that role and the final scene with the longtime lover is too plain and mundane. I think, that scene should bear the potential to be a powerful scene, but again, the director tends to play safe and let them hug like father and son. Overall, obviously my rants above are mostly negative as I just finished watching and get angry and straight away writing this review. Don't get me wrong! I enjoy slow movies, even I found Manchester by the Sea, Spotlight, Doubt and so on are enjoyable and even prefer this slow drama type that conveys important issue than action movies. The movie is a beautiful one, but if it bears a good, efficient storytelling, then, I would be gladly say the movie is the best of the year. Like I said earlier, this movie serves those that have vast, formal knowledge in filmmaking. They might enjoy it to the fullest. Perhaps it would be good as a syllabus in a film class. But that's all that. For an amateur audience like myself who watched for the cinematic experience (which I get from the distinct technical aspects) plus a good story, this doesn't do much to me. The worst feeling is when you feel like you wasted your two hours."
MOONLIGHT,14 August 2021,8/10,"Years after my first watch, honestly I like the movie less and less the more I think about it, it is impressive that it only cost around 1.5M dollars but my god this movie has no story. Amazing everything (acting, music, directing) but nothing really happens."
MOONLIGHT,12 December 2016,9/10,"Moonlight is a beautiful story about finding one's own identity in a world that seems to tell you who you have to be. It is also a story about family and how there can people in our lives that help us to grow and learn even if they are not blood related. The film is told through three defining identities of Chiron's life: Little, Chiron, and Black. These chapters show the struggle Chiron faces dealing with bullies and a crack addicted mother who neglects him. There are also glimpses into his sexuality and how hard it is to come to terms with it. Each of the actors who play Chiron, portray him differently yet there is cohesion between them, each help us relate to them and see them as one singular entity. Moonlight is a fantastic film highlighting the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality. This story is a must see! Truly beautiful and something you don't see every day."
MOONLIGHT,1 December 2016,9/10,"Jenkins uses his remarkable ability to bring raw emotions to the surface with this heartbreaking tale of a young boy's journey which takes us through 3 stages of his life from childhood to adulthood. Born into a world of poverty and inequality, we see how certain events throughout his life alter and define the path that he chooses to ensue. Jenkins manages to uncover veiled intersectionality within our society and portrays the significantly negative impact that this mindset can cause within ourselves as well as the lives of others. The diverse orchestral music score provides us with emotional turbulence throughout while also revealing the unique style of Jenkins as a director. Providing us with incredible talent as well, the array of little known actors and actresses only adds to the overall genuine feel of the film. I have and will continue to recommend this film to many friends and family members to come. It is a must see for 2016."
MOONLIGHT,5 December 2016,8/10,"Moonlight is the story of Chiron (nicknamed Little) told in three parts. Part one shows him as a child struggling to fit in, part two shows him as a teenager working to discover who he is, and part three explores his life as an adult. Its story is paced well, and although it isn't the most complicated story, the movie was engaging and rarely got boring. The writers took chances, such as only having Chiron speak periodically. They used silence very well in this movie. The camera work was generally unimpressive, save for a few interesting uses, such as the very opening shot of the movie. The same could be said about the lighting, however this movie didn't exactly need any special lighting effects. The character driven plot and writing were more than enough to keep this movie interesting.Barry Jenkins (director, writer) and Yesi Ramirez (casting director) did a great job mixing well known actors with less experienced ones. Mahershala Ali (House of Cards, Luke Cage, The Hunger Games), and Naomie Harris (Skyfall, Spectre, Pirates of the Caribbean) highlight a deep cast, one in which it is hard to find a weak link. Moonlight deserves the praise it garnered at the Toronto Film Festival, where it premiered. This film tells a story which is often overlooked, and one that is important to hear."
MOONLIGHT,7 December 2016,,"THERE WILL BE SPOILERS THIS REVIEW DIVES DEEP INTO THE MOVIE!!!Moonlight is a fantastic film highlighting the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality. In this movie we see Chiron, a black man, as a young child, a teenager, and an adult. Chiron is attempting to find himself as a young black man living in a rougher part of Miami. As a child he witnesses his mother's growing crack addiction, and is tormented by the other kids for it. He is constantly looking for who he is, trying to understand why the kids call him names, and if he really is the ""fag"" they call him, if his mother really is what they call her. As a teenager Chiron explores his sexuality only to have his first love brutally beat him in order to maintain his own masculinity. This in turn grows into a story of self-acceptance and what it means to be yourself, versus what is expected of you to be."
MOONLIGHT,7 December 2016,8/10,"Moonlight to me, was one of the best movies of the year. It is a very visual movie that true fans of film will surely appreciate, but it's story is compelling enough to make sure everyone is able to follow the story. The story is about a young homosexual black man and his constant search for himself. He finds inspiration on who he should be through drug dealers, bullies, and friends. It is interesting that the person he pushes away the most is his mother, who is addicted to the same drugs that Chiron's mentor sells. The movie is divided into three different sections, each one he explores a different idea of himself. In the end he becomes what his community stereotypes so much and what he vilified before. Moonlight had to one of those movies that was able to say a lot without dialogue. It gave a feeling of nostalgia through it uses sound and color. It makes you ask how many people have been shunned from our society and may have just fallen into a stereotype because they had no where else to go? The search for one's self is something everyone goes through, and here in Moonlight, it is beautifully displayed."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2017,1/10,"When I saw that hype around this movie, I felt it was going to be a really wonderful movie, but turned out to be one of or if not the worst movie I have watched in my life. I literally wasted almost 2 hours of my time. And to think that this movie won best picture at the Oscars is mind-boggling."
MOONLIGHT,25 April 2020,1/10,I really don't know how can a movie like that wins a best picture oh my god it is one of the most boring most uneventful movie I have seen and add to that an oscar for a supporting actor dir a guy who appears for 10 minutes its is just a bad movie.
MOONLIGHT,19 August 2017,10/10,"Not many films leave you in complete silence after finishing. Glued to your seat with your brain still in awe of what you have just seen. But This film does just that.With beautiful cinematography and a beautifully simple yet heart wrenching story, to miss this film would be a sin.This is everything Boyhood should've been, It felt 100 times more believable despite the change in actors for the main role throughout the film... I would say this film is almost perfect, almost.The one problem i have with this film which is so minor it is completely forgettable, with out getting into spoiler territory is the lack of development for a couple of characters, who i believe their stories were left prematurely and could've been explored more.If you haven't seen it yet, stop what you are doing, get comfy and watch this film"
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,3/10,"At the beginning off the film the camera work is truly appalling, although it does get better as the film progresses. Perhaps my expectations were a little low to start with given the subject matter and the fact that it wasn't my choice, but that of a girlfriend. Although the cinematography is appalling, it starts fairly well, but there is a fairly huge jump in the timeline that doesn't help.I won't bother you with the plot line l but would say that at 1hour and 50 minutes long it isn't a worthwhile use of your time.This is, however, only one mans opinion and your time is yours to waste as you please."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,3/10,"I was expecting more for a best picture award. This movie drags, in our PC world I shouldn't be surprised this got best picture. The plot was thin and predictable. The only thing missing was a transgender bathroom. At least the police weren't villains. I wouldn't bother watching unless you need a sleeping aid."
MOONLIGHT,4 April 2017,9/10,"'Moonlight' tells a truly unique and impactful coming-of-age story, crafted in a manner that is equally as unique and impactful. While there are many layers of impeccable artistry to this film, what truly stuck out to me the most was the stunning cinematography- each shot is scrupulously framed, the use of color is outstanding and almost all the action takes place in very shallow focus, making this film incredibly visually interesting and a true treat for the eyes. Every frame of this movie is breathtaking, and I can't think of many other films to which I would give that praise. The musical score is also hauntingly beautiful and stuck with me long after I stopped watching. The use of a mostly orchestral and instrumental soundtrack in an urban setting was a creative departure from the expected. The performances of the actors draw power from their subtlety. In this slowly-paced film, where a great deal is left unsaid, the slightest change in facial expression, body language or a lingering gaze allow us to read the raw emotions of the characters on a deeper level than dialogue alone. Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris deliver knockout performances, but the entire cast fills up the film's environment in a way that makes them truly engaging to watch. My only minor criticism of this film is the presence of a few glaring continuity errors, which, in a film that relies on a steady flow of movement that makes it feel like a waking dream, can really take you out of the action. Also, I felt myself getting a little antsy in the third act during the diner scene, not because of the slow pacing alone, but because I felt the important information in this scene could have been delivered in about half the time without losing any of its impact. Overall, 'Moonlight' is a truly beautiful and haunting film that had me thinking about it for days afterward. This film is poignant, engrossing, innovative and unexpected, and will pull you in with its unassuming and understated grace."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,8/10,"while I admit with many reviews of this movie being slow art some parts, I very much enjoyed this movie. It had me feel every emotion sad, happy, anxious and everywhere in between. The use of lighting was cool and kept me engaged and some scenes stuck in my head days after. Sometimes you have to give movies a chance and really feel them, which is something many people don't have the patience to do."
MOONLIGHT,6 February 2017,9/10,"I was a little skeptical heading into this film even after only hearing good things about it and I was completely blown away. Moonlight is beautifully done from beginning to end, not a single scene feels misplaced or useless to the plot. The acting performances from the entire cast were phenomenal in every way, they blew me away just as much as the cinematography and script itself. Chiron was beautifully acted by all 3 actors who portrayed him from start to finish. The cinematography was some of the best I have seen from a film in recent memory. The way it was filmed just made it feel so real to me, it felt like I was there with Chiron. Miami was a wonderful choice for the location of the movie it definitely matched the vibe the movie was trying to give off. If you are interested in writing scripts or screenplays for movies or plays I highly suggest watching this movie and downloading the script to read (which is what I did) it is truly a masterpiece in every way. Even if you are a bit skeptical like I was I suggest seeing this movie, because you will not be disappointed at all. In my opinion, this is easily the movie of the year."
MOONLIGHT,9 April 2017,8/10,The film is dark and gritty but the cinematography and use of colour are beautiful. Skipping ahead to different stages in Chiron's illustrates very clearly the changes he goes through but it means that we have to fill in the gaps in the story for ourselves. I feel this leaves us missing out on his development and results in a lack of connection to the character. Overall it's a really good film with a resonating message but left me wanting more (in a bad way).
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,6/10,I mean it is a decent movie but is it great enough to win the best picture? NO. Very sick of this PC BS. Oscars you own La La Land the best picture! I like stories that are about the stories themselves and not just using racial groups to tell the story in a special area. Is La La Land too white to win the best picture? I am disappointed
MOONLIGHT,18 February 2017,9/10,"Chiron is a black man and a homosexual.He is different than the other humans.As a black man,he isn't passionate.Because he's acts,let him got bully.Some people put black people down with racism.Chiron got bully because he is a homosexual.I think it is ironic to me.Humans are selfish.In part 3,Chiron become black.His body,acts,....... It makes him like Cottonmouth(x)Juan(o).HE is not himself.Because of the environment,most people become ""what the world want they to do.""Black's life have only one friend.Also his lover.He won't let someone touch him except Kev.Black is alone in his whole life.He fight with world by himself.Just a man,he cares him very much.He became shy and confused when he talk with Kev.This movie isn't point out emphatically what is true or false.It just says a man is alone.A letter to the people who are alone."
MOONLIGHT,20 February 2017,1/10,"I watched this movie due to all the amazing reviews for it and let me say this is the worst movie I have ever seen; i use the term movie lightly as it made no sense, had no story line or plot that is understandable. There is no point to this movie. Do not waste your time and believe the reviews."
MOONLIGHT,21 February 2017,2/10,"I'm extremely lost as to why this movie has received so much praise. It was like watching a cake bake at 200 degrees and taking it out after 2 hours -- nothing to show for. Just a bunch of warm ingredients in a pan.Barely any character development, and no flavor. It was set in Miami, and as a (black) Miami native (who currently lives here), I didn't get any Miami vibes. The characters did not look or act Miami (for lack of better words). This was distracting and disappointing to me. Like, what was the mother's accent??? And Theresa didn't look like a Miami hood chick at all. It annoyed the hell out of me that she had the same weave in when Chiron was 8 as when he was 16. How, Sway? Miami girls switch up their wigs and weaves weekly. They should have cast Miami natives. Secondly, the casting of young adult Kevin & Chiron was dreadful. Chiron went from being an awkward-looking, not so attractive teenager to quite attractive eye candy as a young adult (mmm, he was fine!). Teenage Chiron had some pretty notable facial features (which added to his awkwardness) that adult Chiron bore no resemblance to. I think the awkwardness as a teen was a central part of the character's identity. I understand that he became more streetwise and confident when he moved to Atlanta, but it was also clear that he strangely remained asexual since that experience with Kevin when he was 16. That is NOT normal -- to me that screams awkward and undeveloped adult... not the sexy, full of swag young adult that Black was. The transition was too extreme and the remaining awkwardness we should have seen was no where to be found. I would have liked to see young adult Black as more average looking, and somehow exuding his more streetwise ways, *despite* his awkwardness. (And I'm sorry, the shyness did not come through as awkwardness to me.) This was very distracting and showed a complete lack of attention to casting. Kevin went from looking kind of mixed as a kid and teenager to not at all as an adult. Disappointing choice there, too.Let's not even talk about that horrible attempt at grey hair on the mom of adult Chiron. Why didn't they give the lady a damn wig.As for the rest of the movie, if you're going to have a slow moving drama like this, character development is so important. I should have felt attached to the characters. Unspoken things should have made more of a punch, like Juan's death. I wasn't even sure if it was his funeral they were referring to. They could have done so much better with that. At the end of the movie, I didn't really feel anything for anyone. Except a from Trevante Rhodes. I had all the feelings for him. LOL. I could have seen more of him with his shirt off, since that was the highlight of the movie."
MOONLIGHT,22 February 2017,4/10,"I was very excited to see this movie, but got very disappointed with what I saw. Despite the good performance of Naomi Harris, the move is very boring for me taste. The movie is very slow and way overrated. I really don't see the deal with the performance of Mr. Ali but maybe it's just me..."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,4/10,Got the Oscar as a gesture to prevent critics complaining no black actors ever win ! How many times has a movie been made about bully's ? Nothing new at all here if you want to see a better film on this subject I suggest a monster calls a much better film and original to boot !
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2017,1/10,My dad says this movie is a piece of sh*t that shouldn't have won an Oscar. Watch Fences with Denzel Washington instead. Honestly this movie shouldn't get more than a 6.5. If you watched the Oscar's you would know that the actor who won an Oscar for being in the film was only in it for 10 minutes. That should explain the politics behind the lenient and circle-jerking ratings behind all the awful movies these days.
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,3/10,"Please help me I must be stupid. This film has had amazing reviews and won at the Oscars. How? There is no plot, you cant hear what they are saying, which to be fair didn't make any difference as there was no plot.. The camera work was nauseous. Right at the start of the film the camera is going round and round the two actors, made me feel sick, then the camera is on the little boys shoulder as he runs, just awful. But it also gets an award for best cinematography. The acting was brilliant. Oscar worthy, not on your life."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,2/10,"Wow. I have to agree with many people, this is very disappointing. Very good subject matter, but VERY poor execution that doesn't do it justice at all. I feel like this is a film relying entirely on it's proposed subject matter, and not at all on the actual execution of the film. Apparently it's about a young man's coming of age struggle as a gay man, but in NOWHERE in the film is it EVER made evident that any other character is actually aware he is gay. How do we at all know that the bullying he received was because he was gay? It finally seemed like the story was beginning, then BANG, it's over. Seriously, I was wondering 'where is the rest'? It feels like all back story, to a story that never happens. It's just weak...like, seriously weak. I didn't come away feeling like I had seen something that was necessary viewing. To me, it felt as though someone had come up with very compelling subject matter, but had no real ability to realise it on film. Maybe because of it's subject matter (or supposed subject), critics couldn't feel like they could say what they really thought, as it might be taken as criticizing the themes the film touches upon. In my opinion, suggests interesting subject, with terrible film making."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,1/10,"I don't want to waste any more time than I already wasted on that POS movie, so this review is going to be short.The plot is boring, the acting average, the cinematography meh.Bottom line. We watch movies to be entertained. There little to be entertained by Moonlight.Go give the money you save from not watching this terrible movie to a homeless person. You will have a much better evening in doing so."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2017,,"It seems that Hollywood and the media want to dictate what we should and should not like nowadays. This movie totally sucked, it was slow and completely uneventful and uninspiring. To give this ""average"" at best film a best film award was so clearly racially motivated it was disgusting and shameful. I won't waste my money on this film in the theater, nor would I waste my time at home watching it for free, it really was that bad. Two thumbs down"
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,4/10,"I don't understand how it might even be compared with the other academy award nominees.this film got nothing.the first half an hour is okay with Ali and the boy.then comes the teenage Chiron who wanted to be gay from the start, do nasty things for no reason!there is nothing impressive with the third phase black ..he is more gross than the two.the story is too weak that one can't afford to waste the time for this! Better watch hacksaw ridge or other nominees..this movie is hell waste of time"
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,3/10,"I watched this movie because of its great success at the Oscars this year, and I was pretty disappointed. The actors are great, yes, but the story is extremely slow, often boring and there doesn't seem to be a real story line. The conversations are often dull and pointless. During the entire movie I was hoping that finally something unpredictable would happen, but it never did. In the end, the viewer feels like he just watched a documentary of the life of the main actor, which was quite boring from the start to the end and without any interesting twists or tensions or emotions. Can't say i'd recommend that movie."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"As the title indicates it is so bad that I made an account just to give a review. You know when movies are so bad that they go full circle that they turn out to be good again(sharknado), this isn't one of those movies. I watched this movie after seeing the Oscar winners, I thought it would be a good watch as it won best picture over lala land which was the favorite. But in my opinion it only won because it was a story about a gay dude whos black whos been bullied and then turns out to be a drug dealer, cant get any more minoritier than that. I mean they basically cornered the Oscars into giving them the best picture for fear of being called racist and/or homophobic. Its probably the same situation with IMDb and other sites and also with critics who gave this movie such high praise."
MOONLIGHT,28 February 2017,1/10,"Wow. This movie was a complete waste of time. I am offended it was up for so many awards. Best picture, sure, that one is deserving.. Anything else, HA! Slowest, most boring movie I've ever seen. I couldn't even finish it because it was going absolutely nowhere. Chiron's character annoyed me the whole way through. This could have been a silent film with how little MEANINGFUL GOOD dialogue there was."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,9/10,"I feel compelled to write a review after reading the first page of the reviews which were all portraying Moonlight negatively. I was very impressed with this movie and teared up several times. The main character, throughout his life, is shown as a child that has been forgotten and left out, left behind. But we see as he grows up, whatever his tough exterior, he is a sensitive boy at heart. It is stereotype vs. real. And this movie was based on real experiences, I had heard an interview with the creators on the radio. It highlights painful epidemics in the black community and puts a face to them. I watched Manchester by the Sea the day before (in an attempt to watch some Oscar picks), and found myself much more connected and emotionally invested in Moonlight. I highly recommend!"
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,10/10,"I went into this movie with no expectations. I rarely go to the movie. But my office mate, who is a gay white male, asked me one day if I saw it and suggested I should. When I asked him about it (the plot) he just said it's kind of about this guys life but it's really beautiful.I understood what he meant after seeing the movie. I could feel the depth of the characters and their complexities. I never before saw a black male drug dealer depicted so humanely and real as in this movie. I like that he is one of the first characters we are introduced to because it places importance on even the most denigrated person in American society and shows him in love, compassion, and turmoil without any unrealistic glossiness. This theme played out through the movie in presentation and dialogue. The acting was superb and the shots were photographic. I recommend this movie to everyone (and I mean young, old, black, brown). It is a glimpse into society rarely shown from an unpretentious or demoralizing perspective.This movie is a reminder that life is an individual experience and is the most beautiful when viewed with judgment."
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,1/10,What can I say? This movie is terrible. How it won an Oscar is beyond me. I suspect it has something to do with 'Oscars So White' from last year. First time I've ever left a review here but felt compelled to do so because the movie was terrible beyond words. Please save your money and go watch La La Land or something else which is actually Oscar worthy.
MOONLIGHT,1 March 2017,1/10,"Donald Trump is correct, Hollywood is garbage. This movie was very boring and the acting was awful. If Hollywood continues producing this type of garbage the studios deserve to go bankrupt. Absolute waste of time and money and should never have received a nomination. La La Land was garbage as well."
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,1/10,7.9Wow. Pfft. Critics please start doing your job properly. The actors were wasted terribly in this film. I felt more sorry for myself having to sit through the film than little/Sharon/black (whatever the f his name is) Do me a favor.
MOONLIGHT,2 March 2017,10/10,This was a great movie with a REAL life storyline!! All the people who are all of a sudden trashing this movie because it won an Oscar need to get over it! The best movie won point blank period!! Sorry racist white people! Better luck next time! Go see Moonlight if you want to see great acting and an amazing story.
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2017,2/10,The only good thing about this movie was Mahershala Ali. I seriously Don't understand how he could be considered as a Supporting role as he was in the movie in the first quarter of the movie. And After he was dropped out you can fast forward and actually not lose anything of the movie.
MOONLIGHT,5 March 2017,1/10,"This is a very dark portrait of black America which has no redeeming qualities. All of the main characters in the movie are either drug dealers, hopelessly addicted junkies or violent bullies Don't see it unless you have a wish to see people at their worst with little hope of redemption. How the Oscar people rated it as best picture is beyond me!"
MOONLIGHT,6 March 2017,2/10,"I was very excited to watch this film. Unfortunately, it has a broken, or to be honest no plot! There are several story lines, but all fail to develop. I was left more confused than anything after watching the film. So I watched it again, thinking I missed something, but was even more confused!The acting is good in parts, but with no plot. I don't even see how this film was in consideration for Best picture. The only other nominated film that I have seen so far is Hidden Figures a solid 8-9/10... how the academy gave this film Best Picture over it is beyond me. It is like giving Napoleon Dynamite best picture over Shawshank Redemption!!! And I still haven't seen the other nominated films.For some reason Hollywood seems to want to get into politics. There are becoming like kids Sports where everyone deserves a medal! And we have multi millionaire stars getting on stage claiming they understand the day to day struggles of the average American, better than the actual Average American.Interestingly, I watched the Oscars for the first time in years (I think I'm good now for another 10 years). Side note, while scanning the crowd , for all their righteousness and liberal claims, were 1% of the stars in attendance non Caucasian? Warning: Hollywood, get back in touch with your customers or you will suffer the same fate as many pro sports leagues that have lost large percentages of their fan base!"
MOONLIGHT,7 March 2017,1/10,"went to see this after the academy awards. I had seen every movie but it, Lion, and Manchester by the Sea. I went to see LaLa Land with two friends. One loved it, one thought OK, and I wanted my money back.. shortly afterwards I watched a rerun of the Cotton Club from the 1980's. Now that was a movie.. LaLa Land had low costumes, easy dance routines, and not a great plot...So I had no expectations for Moonlight.. good or bad...WOW, I have never in my life left a movie that I paid cash money to see.. I lasted 1 hour and that was it, I was done... depressing, awful plot line, I can't even find words for it... If this is what America calls ""the best of the best"" it is no wonder everything is down the tubes in this country...Hacksaw Ridge was a great movie with great acting, great special effects and an outstanding job by Vince Vaughn. Fences, Hidden Figures, and several other movies I saw that got NO recognition were much better movies...WHO DECIDEDS THIS???????"
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"OK, when you make a prank video, you post it on Youtube, make it short, and more importantly, you make it funny. The movie is boring, yes its plain boring. There's nothing much to it. If you are really enjoying your time then this is the way to balance it. The movie is about nothing, ya, maybe that is what the official genre should have been, it teaches you how to sit quietly for two hours and not protest. This year Oscars have really disappointed me. Or maybe they've played a sad ass prank. Don't ever watch this movie."
MOONLIGHT,8 March 2017,1/10,"Who are the people reviewing this movie with 5 stars??!! Am I in the twilight zone? Did we watch the same movie?? It HAS TO BE paid bloggers giving this movie high marks because there is NO WAY any person in their right mind could say this was a 5, 4 or 3 star movie...no way. First of all, the Red Box description never said this was a GAY movie. I have nothing against gays, I just choose NOT to watch gay movies. This movie is absolutely the most boring, dark, non-eventful piece of nothing that I have ever watched. I usually don't do movie reviews but I had to speak out about this one. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. There really is only one small physical part where he kisses another boy...that's it. So it's not about that....it's about dark, boring scenes, no dialogue, him walking, him sitting down, him getting picked on....and him not speaking!! It was so torturous to finish watching this movie. Probably the worst thing I've seen in 20 years. I felt nothing for the characters and was not moved by one single scene. This is a disgrace that the other GREAT films up for best picture were cheated out of an Oscar. This was obviously another pity vote for a gay themed movie. It's becoming an insult to the entire movie profession."
MOONLIGHT,9 March 2017,6/10,"After being spectacularly surprised that Mahershala Ali had landed an Oscar and Best Picture for Moonlight, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Rumblings had gone thru the internet for some time but I never committed to viewing it. Well Last night I did, to an empty movie theater all by myself. I had gone in with the expectation that this was going to be me a major drama of children growing into Gangsters. But it was radically different from what I imagined, and quite honestly questioned its overall nomination and win at the Oscar's. It's not that this was a drama that had no acting chops to it, it's that the story never did major character building and exploration between its 3 Segments. Nor does it really reflect the Oscar win for Mahershala considering the small screen time he had in the movie. His acting was on point and phenomenal but way to short.Part 1 starts with a young child, Chiron, living a life in the rough hoods of Miami, constantly abused and bullied by other children. These kids do worse to his psych by calling him a Faggot or Gay. And you see the innocence in a young Chiron whose child like gaze portrays the ugliness of the words we throw at young ages. For children like him who don't see the world by ugly words, doesn't quite understand what is being slung at him. How damaging it may be. Quite honestly that innocent portrayal in the face of ugliness tugged at me, making me wonder about the struggles my own children may have had to go thru in school that they are embarrassed to bring up and speak about. It is a glaring look at the bullying problem that goes unchecked at many children. Makes me wanna check out the ambiance my own children are living thru. But I don't think that was the message in the long run but more a look at a young Chiron's innocence being bashed and how he finds relief. Juan(Mahershala Ali) sees this bullying and as a drug dealer on the streets somehow pities the young Chiron, taking him under his wing to give him relief. Part 1 flows in and out with Chiron's experiences as a young child and Juan trying to be some type of figure for a child, who is lost by himself with a crack addicted mother offering no moral support. I think it did phenomenally with this first part, and tugged the heart the right way to reel you in.Part 2 loosens the hook it has on you. I was expecting a movie full of Flash backs during Chiron's teenage years and the abuse he continues to experience in Highschool. At least flash backs to better more relieving times of Chiron and Juan's bond, but the director never pushes that thru. He pushes a story in the second part with Juan written off as murdered and Chiron experiencing this pain and torment of bullying and of discovering who he is by himself. No Juan in the picture, only Juan's wife who still acts a mother figure, and a lot of Blank stares from a Teenage Chiron. Those blank stare moments would have been perfect intros to flashbacks to tell a heart tugging story of Juan and Chiron till his murder. A Chiron who experiences a humiliating set back in highschool after discovering himself, and the prideful stare he gives his best friend over this humiliating moment, pulls you back in but just slightly to end Part 2 quite powerfully.Part 3 goes downhill to give no further story telling or more character building not even a flashback to justify Mahershala Ali's Oscar win even further. This is not a hardcore telling of gangsters trapin' in the streets but simple movie of showing a growing child morphing thru different parts of his life, in quick snippets at that. As an Adult Chiron has turned to become a drug dealer himself, a quite slap inducing change to your face as a viewer who saw a meek part 1 child, and a meek Part 2 teenager that discovered something life changing. Part 3 shines in the Adult Chiron where those stares and innocence still try and pop out, but you know darn well he has changed into a life that was never meant for him. Kevin his best friend who participated in a horrific act in Part 2 reaches out to him to make amends, and Chiron tempted to rekindle a connection of that friendship hesitantly goes back to Miami. Its a slow ride in this Part 3 but because the first 2 parts cemented you in enough, you don't want to walk out on the movie.Your expecting heartfelt confessions or deep apologies and retellings of a hard knock life, but you get none of it to Fully complete the movie. The movie firmly stands with me at a 6 out of 10 stars because the movie tells a fitting story that molds and sometimes reflect what our children are going thru in Parts 1 & 2. It tells a story that may be going in the hoods and ghettos of America in one form or another. But stays Above Average Bland to keep you seated without feeling there was nothing substantial. It's more of a movie where you have to feel the characters and what they are going thru and reflect along side them. If you were looking for some Hardcore rough and tough story this isn't it. It's a story of that vulgarly and verbally abused young Chiron trying to find out whether those words had any meaning in the first place or if it made him better or worse."
MOONLIGHT,12 March 2017,4/10,"When Moonlight won the Best Picture Award, I thought this Movie must be something. So, I watched it. This movie is nothing close to getting the Best Picture Award. This movie is an average movie with an Intense and Serious plot. Ali played a great role and his acting in the Movie was good, He's always good. Other than this, This movie deserves nothing."
MOONLIGHT,15 March 2017,7/10,"With Moonlight, Barry Jenkins made an impressive entrance in the well-known list of Oscar award winner. And in my opinion, it is well-deserved. Although he may not have developed an incredible depth in the dialogues between the characters, the entire movie goes beyond that to make people think about current issues in their everyday- life, or at least in someone's everyday-life.Moonlight is divided in three parts taking place in different era of Chiron's life, an African-American living in Miami. The first part shows us a nine-year-old boy being bullied on the way back of school when a pacific drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali ). While Chiron is a reserved and shy child due to the lack of his father's presence and the drug addiction of the mother (Naomie Harris ), Juan and his wife finally manage to make Chiron share feelings with them. The second part stars Chiron aged 16 back in his old bad habits (even more reserved than before). Juan is dead and his mother more addicted than ever. The key moment of this part is his sexual relation with another boy, Kevin, kind of his only friend. But the day after, when Kevin is forced to assault Chiron because of a group pressure, Chiron is going to completely change his personality. The last part begins with a muscular and extravagant (false teeth, pimped car) 26-year old man doing drug business. He happened to be a physically-transformed Chiron more confused than ever. Till his only friend ever gives him a call¬ÖWhat I truly appreciated in Moonlight is the ease of exposing current and controversial topics in such true-to-life situation, yet not too simplistic. In a single movie, Barry Jenkins exposes the general audience to topics as sensitive as bullying at school, the single-parent education, the homosexuality, African-Americans and their differences nowadays, the drug issue without putting boredom in his movie. Sometimes you may feel uncomfortable with what you would imagine is a clich√© but in fact, discrimination in every form does happen to others every day. Another good asset of Moonlight is precisely that ""not too clich√©"", not too Manichean view because a movie like this could easily fall into these traps. But it doesn't. Juan, who should be despised as a drug dealer, truly is a humanist, very kind and full of good intentions but still is responsible of Chiron's mother misery, which bothers enormously Juan, a bit lost between survival and doing good. My only regret is the non-in-depth analyses of some topics. Moonlight is a heart-pounding movie with a giant amount of feelings passing by in your head and with lots of creativity and daring. A pleasure for the eye and a good challenge for the head!"
MOONLIGHT,16 March 2017,10/10,"The best movie I have ever seen in my life. Its been a week and I can not get it off my mind. The story is magnificently portrayed, the music in the movie is phenomenal. This movie is a beautiful piece of art work. When I left the movie theater I didn't feel impressed buy days later I couldn't get the movie on my mind and it is now my new favorite movie."
MOONLIGHT,17 March 2017,5/10,As with many over reviewers I watched Moonlight due to the Oscar nod. The plot and cast were worth the watch but the challenge for me was knowing and realizing that the Oscars would rather celebrate an average movie with a Black casts that depicts the negative stereotypes of African Americans such as drug abusers and thugs than celebrate an excellent movie like Hiden Figures that depicts African Americans as intelligent and contributing to part of this Nations history that was positive and successful. This is the real problem in Hollywood!
MOONLIGHT,18 March 2017,10/10,"One of the best depictions of growing-up-gay trauma and its aftermath I've ever seen. A beautifully made and highly relatable film that also speaks to a very specific time, place and experience. Although I don't share all of the life experiences of these characters, I identified emotionally. For me, a very satisfying experience."
MOONLIGHT,22 March 2017,1/10,Only signed up on IMDb so i could rate this time wasting awful movie. movie is just a story of common man so what. story goes no where. nothing. you just wait for the movie to get at some point. but no . you will have to try not to sleep during the movie. this is i guess the worst movie ever .
MOONLIGHT,25 March 2017,1/10,This movie is absolutely a waste of time. As matter of fact it was so bad that I for the first time created an account to tell people to not waste their time. I'm real disappointed in all the nomination that this film received what a joke! I understand the 2016 Oscars didn't have enough diversity but you can't just nominate a bad movie because it has an all black star! Hidden Figure by far was much more superior.
MOONLIGHT,26 March 2017,2/10,"I have watched this movie instead of going in to bed earlier so i can wake up in the morning to go on my university. Guys if anyone thinks about doing the same thing, i warn you not to! it doesn't have a point, endless non point talk, nothing happening, i have never watched a movie that its so not going to anywhere, NO POINT! Don't WAIST TIMEEE!"
MOONLIGHT,26 March 2017,5/10,"I am neither Black nor Gay.I thought that the Little-Chiron-Black character was made such a cipher to make it easier to cast older actors in the role. My partner, with experience as a schoolteacher and with balky kids found the characters less opaque - she claims to have read the characters' body language. I would have preferred a bit more backstory, a bit more psychology, a bit more of a handle on this very odd person.I also thought the film may not have been about growing up Queer and Black but just growing up, and confused all the time. The only Gay action occurs in the middle sequence and with Kevin, who seems to be sexually exploratory. Kevin initiates the encounter. And that leaves open the question as to whether Chiron is actually Gay. In the final section, when Black re-initiates contact with Kevin, Black claims Kevin was the only person to accept and touch him. (Kinda hard to believe if Little-Chiron-Black was actually Gay he would not have followed-up on his positive first encounter with others). Maybe Kevin is bisexual and Chiron is only needy?I thought the film failed in not following through on the fate of Juan, who seems to have been a real influence on Little-Chiron-Black. In the third sequence, Black is a virtual body-double to Juan.I do not believe the film earned it's Best Picture Oscar, although it may have been an important film to see."
MOONLIGHT,1 April 2017,1/10,"If this picture was chosen by the Academy as Best Picture of the year, there is something seriously wrong with the process.This film has almost no redeeming value. Literally every character in the film is odious. The main character's mother is a crack addict who sleeps with whatever she can find for money. Everybody in the neighborhood is a bully. The couple who take him in and show him some kindness are drug dealers. The main character himself is completely uninteresting. He almost never says anything, and when he does, it doesn't make any sense. He has no interesting ideas. Actually, he has no ideas at all. Finally, when he randomly decides he is gay and has some gay interlude on a beach, I couldn't watch any more and turned it off.OK, so maybe this film is politically correct. It is about gays. It is about black people. But to give a film the best picture award, it has to do more than portray two minority types. At least I hope so. I mean, how about having a plot? How about good acting? How about interesting characters?"
MOONLIGHT,29 April 2017,1/10,"Never made a comment here ... but for this movie, I will be forced to leave my opinion.* Boring movie * Movie without plot * Endless movie * Movie without explanation and connection of facts * Movie without notionSeriously, it was the worst movie I've ever seen! I am not a racist, I come from a family of black slaves, I have a black girlfriend (woman) .... Seriously ... movie wasted time."
MOONLIGHT,10 April 2017,10/10,"When you've been fed a movie diet that's basic fast food fare, then ""Moonlight"" is not likely to be your taste. But it's exotic flavor is the very reason I will always love this film.I cannot understand the criticisms that talk about stereotypes because few of them are confirmed anywhere in this film. Paula may start as a single mother crack addict living in the projects, but she ends as a recovered woman with a commitment to helping other addicts. Juan may be a drug dealer participating in the destruction of the lives and families in his community, but he's also the only man to show a confused, painfully quiet boy any sense of love or compassion. When was the last movie where you saw a dope dealer with gold fronts teaching a young gay boy to swim? These characters and situations are hardly stereotypical or undeveloped. Chiron, the main character, best illustrates this idea. He struggles the whole movie to understand himself, which is why the three chapters contain three different names he answers to in the film. In the first chapter, he questions what a ""faggot"" is, and he is called ""faggot"" in the second chapter by school bullies, but he is never, ever the stereotypical flamboyant gay boy -- no switch, lisp, limp wrist, makeup, etc. In the final chapter as Black, he is about as far removed from ""faggot"" as you can get. Can't recall the last black male character in a movie that sold drugs, wore gold fronts, packed steel, wheeled around in a pimped-out ride and said things like, ""You're the only man that's ever touched me. You the only one.""The movie is thoughtful and it invites thought on the part of the viewer, but in this age of plagiarism and endless movie remakes, I guess many do not want thoughtful movies that make them think. They want the same old celluloid fast food. Well, they can have it. I'll continue to watch Moonlight."
MOONLIGHT,11 April 2017,1/10,"Well, I wish i could give this movie -10 but as you know there is no such option like that. I specially signed up on IMDb to write this review and save you all from wasting your precious time. I have been using IMDb from many years now but never bothered to write any review, But this movie was so so awful that I had to write this review. I wish I could get my time back that I wasted on this movie. I don't know why this movie is even made. There is no story, no screenplay, no direction. I feel that critics who nominated this movie for Oscar award took bribe from the film maker or they literally have no sense at all. Else its me who's an idiot that I couldn't understand even one thing about this movie.My advice- save your precious time."
MOONLIGHT,21 April 2017,8/10,"Its basically a coming-of-age film and struggle for identity (sexual as well as personal) of a young black boy over the course of his life from a kid to an adult set amidst a black neighborhood. Janelle Monae is gorgeous. I quite liked Juan's character but I felt it was a bit out of place for some reason. Despite the Oscar hype I didn't have much idea about the film. Overall, a very decent watch."
MOONLIGHT,23 April 2017,6/10,"After I was finished watching this movie, the first thing that popped in my head was, why was this movie even nominated, let alone win best picture.The plot is weak. No character build up. Story line seems forced and random. There is no proper story and concept. The only good thing I would say about this movie is the the acting. I watched La La Land, and that movie deserved to win best picture over Moonlight.I believe the Oscar judges were under a lot of pressure from last year when they were ridiculed for not selecting people from non-white races. I think they selected Moonlight to avoid going through that humiliation again."
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2017,10/10,"Great movie from beginning to end. I related to this movie in so many ways from a kid growing up with a single mother, to the swimming scene wishing my father would have taught me the same thing as ""Little"" was taught. I learned that the cast did not have much time to shoot this movie. My hat goes off to everyone involved in making this movie such success. Not to mention their Awards! Awesome work."
MOONLIGHT,9 June 2017,10/10,"In a time were people are made to choose between two sides, between being democratic or republican, climate change or creationism, socialism or capitalism, to vote or to vote at all, to being political correct or to to tweet out whatever the eff we want, there comes a movie that just don't play by those rules. My sister mentioned Moonlight and showed me the trailer and as an angry white hetero i could feel myself closing up and avoid. But if you knew my sister... well i watched this movie and every time i do something crawls out of my body, out of my mind and goes straight to the liquid management of my eyes. At first this seemed like a movie about black people. Or a movie about homosexual people, something that still should be massively important to everyone but it isn't about that, to me at least. To me it doesn't make me chose between this and that, right or wrong. No one in this movie is really guilty and everyone kinda is at the same time, except for the children. And if there is one more important message to tweet then go ahead and destroy the matrix. I believe this film is the best movie of our time because it is blurring all of our right and wrongs, blacks and whites, those thin red lines which aren't thin at all. I just want to be that boy again and be taken care of."
MOONLIGHT,20 June 2017,4/10,"This just goes to show you that the Academy Awards is just bs. With this movie being up for so many awards, I figured it was worth a watch. There is no plot to this movie. BORING BORING BORING. It started out OK, but it went absolutely no where. Don't watch this thinking, oh the reviews are probably wrong. Read some of the bad reviews, whatever they are saying is 100% correct, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"
MOONLIGHT,15 August 2017,6/10,"I'll be cutting between the polarities. I believe that a few years from now when the political and racial context is forgotten this movie would be a little more appreciated. I must say that I was the first one who spoke against this concept. SpoilerA black ghetto guy is not a new concept, not by a long shot. But take a racial subject, a black gangster and make him gay and you've covered all the sensitive social topics and indirectly blackmailed liberal Hollywood into giving you an Oscar. Now, the movie is shot competently and has a opaque atmosphere, actors are great. Problem lies between being provocative and prudent at the same time and when you walk on that line you are restricted and you can't show anything. Consequently, that's what you get story-wise - nothing.So I think this movie deserves to be seen, we will probably discard it as a propaganda material, but some new generations might appreciate it better when the Oscar situation blows off."
MOONLIGHT,25 July 2020,10/10,I've read reviews that there was no story in this film... were they watching the same movie? I was a beautiful tale of the life struggle of a young black man. It wasn't designed to smack you in the face and tell you what emotions to feel. It was created to allow you to access your own emotions in response to this mans start to life. I personally loved the elegant ending.
MOONLIGHT,27 August 2017,9/10,"OK, everyone dissing this film GO watch la la land... l o l for real you seem like you have never seen a Drama movie.I liked it. The part where Juan confronts the mother is so good but it just shows you how life goes for Chiron too many things wrong that he can not express himself, then he gets very little help.This film is very personal and so real. I get why it won, good for them. The ending fits so well. I like to think that is when Chiron finally gets to be himself because he is with someone that never asked him what he knew already. Also because he is grown. I was just worried because children need so much care and he did not get that from his mother and I felt that he was not going to make it."
MOONLIGHT,3 September 2017,5/10,"This movie is really good and very honest to reality. It is enjoyable despite focusing on the darker side of life. The most negative aspect is the gay side. Why this sexual options is so much focused in so many movies? There are many other facts of life that are not, and should not be covered. It must be fashion."
MOONLIGHT,9 April 2020,10/10,"Outstanding. One of the best films of the decade easily. Everything about this movie feels genuine and mesmerizing, from the dialogue to the incredible camerawork. This is a realistic look into the life of a young man, struggling to find himself accepted in his community, and each breath of this film is executed to near perfection."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2017,10/10,A beautiful and timeless film in every aspect. It was very emotional and reminded me of my childhood and familiarized few things similar to the event in the story.Loved and cried every minute of it. Hats off to the brilliant cast and makers of Moonlight.The main character was flawless and simply outstanding.
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,8/10,"Moonlight was a film like no other I have seen in a long time. I can't say I enjoyed watching it, although I think it was a great film. It's not something I plan on actively seeking out for a second viewing in the near future, however if I stumble upon it I'm not opposed to watching it. Moonlight follows Chiron from elementary school up through his adult life. It's a true coming of age story, throughout which we learn that Chiron is gay. In one scene towards the beginning of the film Chiron asks Juan (his father figure) what a ""faggot"" was and why the other kids called him that. At this point it is unclear to both Chiron and the viewer what his sexual orientation is, however by the end of act 2 it is clearly established that he is a homosexual. When I first heard about Moonlight one of the first things I heard about was how incredibly the director used color to convey different moods. Being someone with deuteranopia I took this with a grain of salt given in my life I've never perceived color to have that great of an impact on things. However, upon seeing Moonlight twice I definitely agree with the statement that color plays a subtle but significant role in the film. The use of colored lighting in night scenes on the black skinned cast was used brilliantly to convey moods. Anger filled scenes were lit with a hot fire like color, and sad emotional scenes were lit with cooler blues and purples. The sound design of Moonlight was superb as well. In several instances the subject would be either speaking or yelling but be completely silent to the viewer. This is seen many places in films, however in Moonlight it was particularly effective at conveying the feeling of disconnect between Chiron and the world around him. At times where Chiron felt alone, the viewer felt alone too. There are few films which are truly great, but not films I feel the need to see again. I want to be very clear in saying that I think Moonlight was an incredible film which addressed several very important, and deeply rooted issues in our society. I think that it absolutely deserved every award it won, and I am very glad I saw it. I just don't feel as if a third or fourth viewing will enhance the experience of watching it as is the case with many other films. Much of the power of Moonlight comes from it's gripping plot, and the growth of a boy into a man. The viewer is with Chiron through several hard experiences, and we feel with him and sympathize with him throughout the entire film. The events and imagery such as the beach scene, or the fight scene are shocking and very powerful on the first viewing. I remember the first time I watched Moonlight the feeling of betrayal in the scenes following the beach scene where Chiron has his first experience of intimacy. On my second viewing I knew what was going to happen and the scenes had significantly less meaning. Overall Moonlight was a unique, well directed, well lit, and superbly acted film which dealt with very important issues seen in society today. The first viewing experience was absolutely incredible, however the second failed to live up to the high expectations set by the first."
MOONLIGHT,18 May 2018,9/10,Simply amazing film. Every performance is captivating and
MOONLIGHT,13 November 2017,1/10,"Most boring film I've seen this year. The lead character has neither dialog nor facial expressions in most scenes. The first actor that plays him could have been replaced with a plastic manikin without affecting the film in any way, and the second two aren't much better. The vast majority of the film consists of the main character silently sulking while people buy him food and go out of their way to be nice to him to try to get him to talk. As someone who usually loves quiet, understated films, I hated this as there was simply nothing to engage with. It might have worked as a novel, which would have allowed some insight into the character, but filling a screen with an expressionless face for two hours doesn't communicate anything."
MOONLIGHT,1 August 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is a purely beautiful film. From beginning to end, the stunning cinematography, compelling characters and subtle but effective storytelling create a masterpiece of a work that leaves the audience in awe. Common critiques include complaints of slow pacing and lack of subject matter, and while the film definitely takes its time in the first two acts, the latter could not be more untrue.Those used to hasty, oversaturated and uninspiring plots found in many of today's high-grossing films are, of course, going to struggle with Moonlight. This film makes textbook-equivalent use of the ""show, don't tell"" rule. This is not a feature for individuals who require stories to be spelled out to them. Moonlight is an exploration of the heart and soul, and of what it means to live as true to oneself. The themes of this film are present in every second of its runtime. In the conversations between mother and son, in the tender gazes between two childhood best friends-turned pining lovers. An important point worth mentioning is, of course, the treatment of these marginalized characters. The LGBT community's presence in cinema has been long standing, but poorly acknowledged. This is especially true of black and brown LGBT folk. Representation in media comes at a constant risk of falling into detrimental stereotypes, and very often it does. I come to expect this from every movie about gay characters. Therefore, going into Moonlight, I was naturally worried. Worried that I would have to endure yet more disappointment. As I watched the majority of the film through bated breath, I wondered what the outcome of our protagonist would be. To my surprise, I was greeted not with a painful and heartwrenching conclusion involving death or rejection, but with acceptance and comfort. The ending to this film left me crying not tears of sadness, but of affection. I have to admit that every time I watch Moonlight, I feel a familiar softness in my heart, a sort of vulnerability that overtakes me. The beauty of the writing and expert portrayal by the actors, wrapped up in engaging visuals along with a magnificent score make for one of the most gorgeous, touching, and fulfilling films of all time."
MOONLIGHT,1 January 2018,10/10,"The stars above tell a story in this film. It is not for the ""faint of heart "" You know...But the feint subtle perilous journey through Life without being defeated is Surreal yet So Real."
MOONLIGHT,7 February 2018,3/10,"I thought the acting was amazing and the directing was spot on, capturing the emotions on screen was spectacular. The problem with the movie is that it lacks the potential what the movie could have been. Good concept, but not well written. The issue is that it didn't deliver with the character story like they should have, I get it he is black, gay and he lives in the ""hood"" aka the ghetto. Now, I wanted to see more of the life around him what is causing his inner self to be awaken by such diversity that surrounds him. They miss the opportunity to go in deep with a real thought-provoking inspirational story. Never giving us the cruel reality that this isn't just a movie, but this is a real life issue that goes on everyday. Personally I thought the movie was boring and it drag a lot, kept making me lose interest in the character. It wasn't revolutionary, It wasn't life changing, it was a typical Hollywood movie that took away a good subject and butchered it and shoved it in our faces with a non complex story with a ending that doesn't make us feel sorry but, feel lonely. It lost its message. I was hoping something like ""crash"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" hitting issues and making the characters seem so real. But, like every other movie it is up to ""YOU"" to watch it and decide for yourself. Some people I know love it and some hate it. In the end I do recommend to watch it to see good acting and really great directing."
MOONLIGHT,4 March 2018,1/10,Mind numbing garbage of the highest order. Time I will never get back watching this utter drivel.
MOONLIGHT,3 March 2019,10/10,"When I watched the movie I felt really close to Chiron, even knowing I'm not black, I'm not gay, I'm not poor and neither am i an American! Still i felt deeply connected to Chiron for a simple reason: I'm am, just as well as he is, an introverted, insecure person who is permanently afraid of how the others expect me to be. This really shows to the viewer how well done is the movie, because we can identify ourselves in the different characters. Moreover the making, the music and the filming of the movie all contribute on showing us what is going on in Chiron's mind in the three most important parts of his life. For all these details I think Moonlight truly deserved the Oscar.
Sorry La La Land, I still loved you, but you more deserved a 9/10 while Moonlight deserves a 10/10."
MOONLIGHT,9 April 2018,7/10,"Finally watched it! It is such a beautiful and tender story about a black man struggling with his race, sexuality, bullying and parents. It chronicled his self-discovery into three stages, kid, teenager and grownup. There wasn't too much violent conflicts in the movie but somehow I still felt disturbed to watch a drug-addict mom roaring at her own kid for money. And it was depressing to see a poor kid grow up to be a drug dealer. Despite all these dark sides, I like the love story. The narrative approach is so soft but powerful. This is a great movie and worth watching. But is it good enough to win Best Pic Oscar? I am not sure. It includes all favorable ingredients for prize winner, homosexuality, racism, drugs etc. The subject contributes a big part for its success."
MOONLIGHT,11 April 2018,10/10,"Extremely disappointed with these negative reviews... I think I see where they are coming from and honestly I think it's ignorance. It's not action packed and it's not going to make you laugh. But it's going to make you watch and listen, maybe cry a little. At least I think that's what was intended. I love this movie for all that it is. Mind you, the last bit threw me off but it still didn't take away from making me feel some kinda way. Definitely a must watch. With no distractions. Do it!"
MOONLIGHT,16 April 2018,3/10,I've been waiting the whole movie for a good moment. Never came. This movie has a great potential to be good but it's just not. I want my 2 hours back! :'(
MOONLIGHT,2 June 2018,1/10,"Left asking why we wasting 2 hours on this. Acting by the supporting actors were good. Jenelle Monae was great. However, the story just went on and on with no real point or plot. Just a lot of silence and frustration."
MOONLIGHT,20 September 2018,8/10,"In Moonlight, a coming-of-age story about Chiron, a gay, black man in Miami, Florida, the cinematic techniques are used in an elegant way to add further meaning to the story. From the very beginning, the camera is constantly moving, even when the characters are not. There were two moments in the film, one at the very beginning, the other near the end, where the camera moves 360 degrees around the two people talking. These shots are not normally seen in movies, and stands out because from that point on, we are able to notice that the camera is almost always in motion. The filming style is as if the camera was hand-held, as it is rarely ever still. When Chiron and Juan are in the diner, throughout the entire scene the camera is moving in towards them ever so slightly. The only few times when the camera is completely static is when Chiron is quiet and lost in thought, even if things or characters are moving or speaking around him. This contrast emphasizes the difference between the events happening around Chiron, and his own emotions. 
 The cinematic point of view switches between subjective and indirect-subjective. Scenes with subjective point of view provide us with the visual viewpoint, as well as the emotional intensity. Although there are fewer scenes in this viewpoint, the first one noted was when the camera was running with the kids chasing him. Although we are not in Chiron's point of view, we feel the intensity of running and chasing. The main cinematic point of view employed in this film was the indirect-subjective. Although we are not in Chiron's shoes, we are always close to the action, and experiencing the intense emotions people are displaying to him. For example, his mother. When his mother is talking to him and trying to convince him to come into her house, the camera stays focused on her face, and we have to read the emotions on her face and see the desperation in her eyes. Even when the camera is not close to a character's face, we are still experiencing the same things as Chiron. When he was first learning to swim, the camera angle was below eye-level, half submerged in the water. This gives us as viewers the feeling of being in the water with him. By using this technique, we are more engrossed in the film because it feels like as if we are a part of it, experiencing the same things the characters are experiencing. 
 The camera does not shy away with getting up close and personal with it's characters. The close-up shots are used in a way to emphasize the character's emotions to the viewers. What was also interesting was how when Chiron got a close up, most of the time he showed little to no emotion. This adds to the characters depth, as we come to understand that Chiron is a quiet and reserved person. One example of close-up shots being used was during the fight scene, where Kevin is being pressured to punch Chiron, the day after they kissed on the beach. The angle is close up to their face, and is focused on their faces, as they are in the center of the screen. The people surrounding them are slightly out of focus as the shots switch back and forth between Chiron and Kevin. When the camera is close up to Kevin's face, we see the pain and fear on his face, but we also see the pain and hurt on Chiron's face as he keeps punching him, and he keeps getting back up. In contrast to this, there wasn't as many long-shots used in the film. This is done in order to keep the viewer invested in the film, as well as engrossed in the emotional intensity that is occuring. 
 Overall, Moonlight is a beautiful cinematic work that gives the viewer an in-depth, emotional experience of Chiron's life, while touching on his identity, masculinity, race, and sexuality."
MOONLIGHT,22 September 2018,9/10,"Barry Jenkins's film Moonlight follows the complex coming of age of a young, African-American, gay man in such a beautifully methodical, yet, simple way. The film has a linear dramatic structure and is explicitly divided into three sections: Chiron as a child, then as a teenager, and finally as an adult. This broken-up depiction of Chiron's life is almost symbolic of how his life actually feels to him. Throughout the film, Chiron struggles with the external conflicts of his environment-living with a crack-addicted mother in a drug-filled slum, along with constant bullying from his peers. Additionally, Chiron deals with understanding who he is as a person, why he feels the way he does, and how he's supposed to exist in society. A reocurring feature of Moonlight is contradiction. The decision to make Juan, the neighborhood drug dealer, become a kind and accepting father-figure in Chiron's life contradicts what is expected of Juan's character. Not only that, but Juan's home is shown to be very modern and clean and becomes a sanctuary for Chiron. By doing this, Jenkins is able to show the audience the confusion Chiron is experiencing in his life.Jenkins's deliberate use (or rather, lack of use) of audio and lighting sets the tone for every scene and helps drive the plot. To go along with the contradiction aspect mentioned previously, Jenkins featured several scenes where the music from the car was blasting hip-hop music and then immediately cuts out, leaving the environment completely silent once the character gets out of the vehicle. Often times, the film has no background music, which is very different from most films. This lack of audio actually makes the film feel real and makes the viewer feel like they are living the moments with Chiron. During very important parts of the plot and in Chiron's development, Jenkins doesn't use any audio (i.e. when his mother shouts ""faggot"" at him after she comes home intoxicated and when he breaks the chair over Terrel). Not having the audio drives these monumental scenes because it lets the actions speak for themselves. They are pivotal moments in what Chiron feels and the choices he makes following them. Jenkins also clues the audience into specific moments in Chiron's life using lighting. During moments where Chiron was about to get himself into trouble, the scene has warm tones to it. In times where Chiron is learning and growing as an individual, the scene takes on cooler bluish tones. These subtle additions to the scene make every second of the film that much more impactful.
On a plot-based level, Jenkins handles character development in such an authentic way and touches upon topics like drug abuse/addiction and homosexuality with a lot of care. This helps the story feel believable and allows the viewer to form a deep, emotional connection to the film and all of the characters in it. In the movie, Chiron grows up with a mother who decays from her drug addiction. Chiron, who is already quiet to begin with, is shown withdrawing into himself. He becomes lost within himself, and even though he keeps his quiet nature into adulthood, his outward appearance changes drastically, and he presents himself in a totally different manner. Chiron goes to jail, becomes the drug dealer, and takes on a persona that matches the stereotype of what a masculine, black man's life should be. This goes back to the contradiction Jenkins likes to impose throughout the film. Chiron is a gay man and longs to just be loved, yet those things are the opposite of what he is expected to be in society. On the surface, Moonlight could be seen as a just a standard, coming-of-age movie. Calling it this, however, would be a great disservice to the depth and masterful cinematographic tactics employed by Jenkins. Jenkins created a piece that exposes characters in their most human form and shows what it means to find yourself in a world that seems to be against you."
MOONLIGHT,23 September 2018,8/10,"Barry Jenkins' Moonlight tells the story of a boy on his journey through self-discovery through three carefully directed acts. The main character, Chiron, struggles with rejection from his distant and abusive mother, isolation from the rest of his peers, and confusion on how to express himself. During the one hundred and fifteen minutes of screen time, the audience can observe seemingly random shots of the ocean or a sink filled with water; however, the director's intent is relatively clear and purposeful. Jenkins uses water and intricate camera angles frequently throughout the film to demonstrate everything Chiron does not explicitly tell the viewer and to explain how the past can be washed clean, as well as how Chiron searches for his self-expression through the symbolism of water.One of the most recognizable scenes in the film occurs in the first act, as Juan teaches the young Chiron how to swim. Not only does this scene symbolize companionship, and Juan teaching the boy to stay afloat in life, but the ocean provides a place for a metaphorical baptism to occur. The camera is positioned barely above the waves and looks up at the two; they tower above the audience, and there is a sense that in this moment they hold a great amount of power and holiness. The placement of the actors is similar to that of a priest caressing a devoted disciple moments before he submerges the follower in the water. Chiron is experiencing a spiritual cleansing, and the sins of the past are washed away. The boy realizes Juan's father-like care means more than the acceptance of his peers and his mother, and most importantly, his self-expression triumphs all. The boy emerges from the water as Chiron, no longer bearing the name ""Little"".Shortly after, the audience sees Chiron playing with the waves, running in to meet the receding tide, and then retreating back as it follows him in. The scene is Jenkins' way of slightly foreshadowing what's to come, implying that Chiron may be cleansed for now, but he may become stained and dirtied once more. He's not embracing the water, or wading in it, but running and playing with it; it's not his time to live waist-deep in the water and forever cleansed, but he hasn't walked away from the water and its purifying attributes forever either. Additionally, the water brings him a better understanding of himself, and although he may have realized he is gay, he may not have fully accepted himself for it yet.In the next act, Chiron is a teen, no longer accepting his former title of ""Little"". He has a dream in which he can hear waves nearby, but he does not actually see them. Additionally, he pictures his friend having sexual acts with another girl while he watches. Jenkins highlights Chiron's want to express his sexuality, for the teen wants to find the water, which doubles as his sexuality and purity, but does not know where it is. Chiron sits along the beach with his friend, Kevin, later on in the act, and they grow more closer in that moment; Chiron also grows closer to his sexuality. Many of the camera shots in this scene shoot Chiron and Kevin from behind, displaying the ocean in the background. Once again, Chiron feels the pain of the past troubles wash away, and discovers more about himself, while also becoming more comfortable with his inner self.There are two scenes near the end where Chiron, both as a teen and adult, wash their face in the sink as the camera is positioned at a bird's eye view angle. These events happen after Kevin betrays him, and appear as if he is trying to manually wash the prior events away from his memory. He pretends he never shared a part of himself with Kevin, or possibly that he never opened up to Juan; he just wants to make himself anew with his own water instead of the ocean's waves. Thus, young Chiron proceeds to march straight into the school to take revenge on his classmate and prove himself to no longer be the quiet and little kid. The audience observes older Chiron washing his face with water as he gets out of bed, almost as if it is a regular habit for him, this perceived self-cleansing; however, as a man, he regrets the choices he made that took him away from Kevin.Despite Chiron's struggle with finding his true self, his visit with Kevin metaphorically brings the ocean back to him and brings him closer to what he's looking for. As Chiron is driving back to Miami, Jenkins switches to a scene with children splashing around in the ocean, implying that by meeting with Kevin, the man is reliving his youth, but this time shaping it to suit his own desires and to help him further express his sexuality. The last scene of the film includes young Chiron standing at the ocean alone having finally found himself in Kevin's arms; he doesn't have to hide anymore, nor face isolation from his peers and mother, and finally has someone to help him ""swim"" through self-discovery."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2018,7/10,"In Moonlight, we follow an black-American gay man grow into adulthood in a crime-ridden Miami neighborhood. In the first act, we are told through the characters' actions that Chiron is a weak, bullied, and shy child and that Juan and Teresa want to help him. Even the title of the act and what other characters call Chiron at this point, ""Little"", gives the audience important information about Chiron's character and his mannerisms. In this first act, there are some important scenes that do not focus on Chiron, but rather his mother. We feel bad for Chiron and want him to succeed in life because we are shown that he has a lot of misfortune thrust upon him by his mother and others, and he just wants to be happy. Because of that, the audience feels all the more strongly the negative impact that his mother Paula's abuse has on him. In the scene where Paula buys crack from Juan's street dealer, she attacks his morals by daring him to stop selling to her if he really cared about Chiron, knowing he won't. This interaction gives new meaning to the previous scenes of Juan returning Chiron home where Paula ushers Chiron inside and closes the door coldly on Juan. Despite the fact that she intends to hide her drug habit from Chiron, as evidenced by her hiding in her room and minimizing contact with Juan, Chiron finds out by the end of act one. Her fear of this is emphasized in the scene where Paula yells at Chiron in their home not to look at her. She is ashamed of her addiction and Chiron materializes her guilt. The first act is a wonderful cocktail of meaningful visuals that evoke emotion and little dialogue from our main character, and shows rather than tells. In act two, ""Chiron"", our main character is now a skinny teenager called by his real name by his family and only friend from childhood, Kevin. His tormentor and foil, Terrel, calls him by what everyone did in the last act of both the movie and his life, ""Little"". Terrel antagonizes Chiron throughout the act and constantly performs shows of dominance. In moments of respite, Chiron meets with his friend Kevin who seems to be doing much better than him on the social front. In a talk with Chiron, Kevin nicknames Chiron ""Black"". Later that day, we learn that Juan has passed away during the years between ""Chiron"" and ""Little"", by Chiron visiting Teresa, who lives alone. She still offers him a home away from his addict mother, and acts more motherly toward Chiron than Paula. After heading home, he is greeted by Paula, whose addiction has obviously worsened, and she demands Chiron give her all the money Teresa gave him. After she tries to take it from his pockets, Chiron is too emotionally hurt to say no to his mother any longer and gives her the money. That night, Chiron takes a trip to the beach to be alone, and Kevin meets him unexpectedly. They share a blunt and for the first time in the movie we are shown that Chiron is gay, along with Kevin. Here we are given new context for all of Chiron's social struggles. A young boy growing up unsure about his sexuality around a very masculine group of boys would obviously have trouble, especially with nobody to ask about that sort of thing. The next day, Terrel forces Kevin to punch Chiron as a game, and Chiron ends up getting beaten down by Terrel's group. This scene is tense because Kevin has agreed to do this without knowing who he would have to hit and has ties to Terrel that he cannot ignore. He tells Chiron to stay down, but Chiron continues to get up and look Kevin in the eyes. Next, Chiron commits the first violent action of his life (on screen, at least). By coming back to school and smashing a chair over Terrel's back during class, Chiron gets taken away by the police and manages to shoot Kevin a glance. I believe that this scene means that Chiron had gotten revenge for Kevin, because Kevin was forced to hit Chiron. Overall, the second act sags a little in terms of visuals, but still does a good job of showing the audience Chiron's progress toward finding himself. In act three, ""Black"", Chiron is a grown man living in Atlanta, Georgia, muscled and intimidating. He resembles Juan, who Chiron can only hate for selling his mother crack, in his looks and in his line of work. He lives alone, and acts out a lonely existence. After finally becoming ""hard"", Chiron has turned into a person missing the shy and childish mannerisms of his past. His group who sells his drugs call him Black, which further separates Black from Chiron. Black is stoic, strong, and intimidating enough to make it on the streets, which holds no room for his old self. He gets a call from Kevin one night, who apologizes for what happened during school. In that moment, Chiron silently sheds a tear, and is immediately brought back to his old self. He cares for Kevin as he always has, and considers his invitation to a free meal in Miami where Kevin is now working as a cook. The next morning, Chiron visits his mother at a clinic on his way to Kevin, where he forgives her after she apologizes for her treatment of him as a child. This scene brings back to mind a scene from part one where Juan tells Chiron that even if he might hate his mom now, he shouldn't because one day she will be gone. When Chiron gets to Kevin's restaurant, they chat and catch up. After they go back to Kevin's apartment, Chiron tells Kevin that nobody had touched him like Kevin had since. The film ends with a cut from Kevin stroking Chiron's head as they lean on eachother to a shot of little Chiron standing on the beach. At the end, the story returns with intriguing visuals that tell us Chiron's internal state of being with a heartwarming return to his childhood. Being back in Kevin's arms, Chiron is no longer Black, just Chiron. I would have liked to have seen more lasting consequences in Chiron's character from his stint in juvie and his life in Atlanta. The way that Chiron and Kevin came back together felt all too convenient, that nothing was in between them stopping their likely romantic reunion. Even a small conflict there could be resolved by Chiron becoming more in touch with his inner self. Other than that, this movie is an emotional experience that one would be challenged to not get invested in with its stunning visuals, engaging storytelling, and believable characterization."
MOONLIGHT,23 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight shines a light on a forgotten America. Directed by Barry Jenkins, Moonlight is a story about the plights of a young black man in modern america. I think the two most important aspects to take away from this film are its immaculate cinematography and the rich story that Jenkins portrays about growing up in the modern state of the United States. I love this film because it is one of the only films that accurately shows the struggles of growing up in the United States. It is easy to categorize this film about gangbanging, drug use, and violence but one must dive deeper into the film to finds the gems in Chiron's life.
 There are many overarching themes in Moonlight that make it a great coming of age story. Some of the primary themes throughout the film are sexuality, drug addiction, love, and manhood. There are many other themes present throughout the film but these four accurately represent the struggles that many young americans struggle with today. If you haven't seen the film, it is separated into 3 acts that portray different sections of Chiron's life from childhood, the teenage years, and adulthood. Throughout each act of Chiron's life, he encounters a wide variety of difficult situations that influence how he blossoms into his adult life. Act I based in Chiron's childhood sets up the beginning of his life struggles. With an abusive drug addict mom, Chiron is forced to live the early years of his life in silence. Chiron is forced to be independent at an early age because of his mother actions. On top of being neglected by his own flesh and blood, he is bullied by his peers because they suspect that he is homosexual and because he is smaller than all the other kids. These situations already raise questions in his young age about sexuality, love, and manhood. These situations continue to grow in the second and third act where he grows and learns to deal with these themes in his life. 
 Sexuality is an apparent theme throughout the film because the main character is gay. He first encounters the idea of being gay when his peers repeatedly call him a faggot and he asks his mentor what a faggot means. He then develops his sexuality in act two, where he has his first sexual encounter which his classmate, Kevin. The film beautifully develops Chiron's growing emotions and hesitations that come along with them. Much like real life, it is hard to anticipate the upcoming actions that happens in Chiron's. One example of this is the day after the night at the beach, when he suddenly has to face the only person that understands his sexuality. This encounter catalyzes a major change in Chiron's mentality about manhood when he decides to finally stand up for himself. This is an ironic moment in the film because Kevin is the person that tells Chiron to stand up for himself in act one when they were still children, and he ends up finally doing it when he is forced to face him. 
 Manhood is another theme that plays an immense role in the film. Throughout the film, Chiron is abused physically and mentally by his peers and his own flesh and blood. The first person that shows Chiron how to be a man is his mentor Juan. Although Juan is a drug dealer, he plays the biggest role on Chiron's life. After finding Chiron hiding from his bullies in an abandoned building, he takes Chiron in as his own. He recognizes that Chiron is different from the other kids and for an unknown reason decides to become his mentor. Juan teaches Chiron his first lessons in life about being a young black man in america. Juan's mentorship has such a huge effect on Chiron's life that he decides to follow in his footstep after relocating to Atlanta.
 Chiron's life story is nothing like any other film out there and tells an immaculate story about growing up in the current state of the United States. This story relates to what many young growing americans go through with their struggles about sexuality, manhood, and love. Barry Jenkins has stitched together the most important and standout coming of age film in the modern era."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2018,7/10,"Moonlight is about an African American boy named Chiron who goes through conflict. Externally, Chiron gets bullied by other kids from his school. Internally, Chiron deals with psychological damage that will affect him throughout life. Chiron struggles to understand his homosexuality and he doesn't know how to deal with his broken relationship with his drug addicted mother.
 Juan becomes the father figure to Chiron which is ironic. First of all, there's an irony in character. Juan is a drug dealer yet he's the one trying take care and become a parent to Chiron. Juan is goes against the stereotype of how a drug dealer is ""supposed to act"" while Paula goes against the stereotype of a supportive/loving mother. Another thing that is ironic is that Juan sold drugs to Paula. This does bring up the question, why was Juan so supportive of Chiron? Was it because he felt guilty or does he feel obligated to become a parent figure to Chiron? Either way, Juan became a foil character to Paula.
 Water is very symbolic in the movie. The scene where Juan teaches Chiron how to swim can be seen as a baptism. Chiron could never learn how to swim or he could struggle, learn, and face the waves. This is symbolic because Chiron did nothing when the kids in school bullied him. But eventually, he learned how to fight back and stand up for himself. He became physically and mentally stronger, as if he became a new person.
The film is separated into three parts which represents the different stages of his life: ""Little"", ""Chiron"", and ""Black"". In each stage of Chiron's life he becomes a different person. Little was constantly picked on, Chiron struggles as his mother's addiction worsens, and Black has hardened and repressed his past self. This is due to the societal expectations of masculinity that Chiron cannot seem to reach. It is heartbreaking to learn that ""Black"" becomes a drug dealer because it was drugs that tore his family apart. He lost his identity and takes the character design of Juan. 
The camera angle and placement was excellent in the film. In many scenes throughout the movie, the director placed the camera in between characters to create a subjective point of view. This is seen when there is verbal fighting between Chiron and Terrel and it makes the viewer feel that they are the one being screamed at. During the dinner scene with Chiron, Juan, and Teresa, the camera is pans smoothly across the three people and it makes the viewer feels warmth and connection in the scene.
Throughout the film, the camera is pointed behind Chiron which makes him seem distant. It isn't until the end, where Kevin asks, ""Who is you, Chiron?"" that he can finally see himself. The music choice in the film is also worthy of mention. Director Barry Jenkins says, ""instead of taking the hood to the arthouse, we're gonna bring the arthouse to the hood."" There is classical music playing in multiple scenes rather than hip hop or gunshots. 
 Another thing that is important to note is that there are no white characters in the movie. The director of the film wanted it to be the story of black lives. Every character and actor in the film was African American which made it more powerful. Although the viewer may not relate to drug abuse, bullying, poverty, or being a minority, the director did an amazing job to make the viewer feel the same emotion the characters had.
 Moonlight is a story about finding one's true self. In the final scene, Chiron finally opens up and expresses his need to be touched by Kevin. The final shot switches to his young self, and he turns back and looks at the camera. This is a symbolic because it shows that he has come to terms with who he really is."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2018,8/10,"Moonlight is a film about the life of Chiron and his stages of growing up with the various challenges he is faced with. The film starts off with Chiron being chased down the street by a few kids he goes to school with, who eventually cause him more trouble later. The film takes place in Miami with the plot mainly about his radioactive family life, his confused sexuality, and about expressing himself. What makes this film so good and effective at captivating the audience is its rich story, deep character development, and the way the Chiron's emotions and psychological tendencies are portrayed with sound and cinematography. Chiron's emotions and the way he expresses them are a very important part of his character development. During times of conflict there is no music, just the sound of their actions. For example, when Chiron came home to his mom high with her boyfriend she just yells and walks away, and the time when the mother sold the tv for meth; there wasn't any music, just a bubble and the only sound that can be heard is of footsteps and voices. This lack of exterior sound creates an intensity about the situation, which is done very well. At time of extreme conflict, the voices and all the sounds around Chiron are muted. An example of this is when Juan dropped off Chiron at his house and his mom pulled in Chiron, walked a few paces in front while camera was facing her from behind Chiron. She turned towards Chiron with the camera now in front of Chiron and she shortly yells very angerly at him and walks away. The sound was entirely muted since she turned towards Chiron, but after she walked away the camera faced Chiron's face and you could see his blank face with no emotion. This is used to display his trauma caused by large exposure to these situations, as it is his coping mechanism in response to his PTSD. We later learn that she called him a faggot, which contributes to his confused sexuality. We see that the characters evolve and change as the acts progress, but Chiron doesn't change very much until late in the second act. He was always quiet and expressionless, mostly due to his ptsd. There are certain things that doesn't change about Chiron, like the way he always runs away to Juan when things get rough. When Chiron ran to Juan's house early on because of his mom being high off meth, Juan took him to the beach. Chiron learned to swim that day, and by the time night came they were talking about moonlight. This is one of the few times we see Chiron smile in the film. Juan told him a story about himself in Cuba and about what the blue moonlight shows. Chiron comes back to the beach often in the film. The beach and the moonlight that comes with it represents safety, calmness and peace for him. These are things that are very rare for him to feel. In act two Juan is gone and the only person that is left for Chiron to run to is his girlfriend. One day some of the bully's at his school confront Chiron as a teen and tells him not to go back to her house. There is no exterior sound for this scene, just their voices. Chiron proceeds to ride on the train for hours, until he goes to the beach. When he gets there he sits on the sand and stairs at the moonlight. The only sound is the sound of the waves, which brings a natural peace. For Chiron this peace is treasured. His friend eventually shows up and sits with him and they talk for a while until they eventually hook up. Chiron has been confused about his sexuality throughout the film and he still continues to be. The camera angle during this scene shows them from the back in the same shot with Chiron looking up at the moon, which switched to a shot his hands relaxing and moving deeper in the sand. In a fight the next day the school bully's make Chiron's friend to repeatedly punch Chiron. The camera switched from a shot of the friend with a very sad, and guilty face before his punch to Chiron's blank expression. The camera stays on Chiron's face through each punch, then you can hear his friend tell him to stay on the ground. This continued a few times till he stayed on the ground and the rest of the bully's kicked him till security came. Throughout the entire sequence the only thing that could be heard is the voices of the crowd, the bully's telling the friend to hit him harder and the friend apologizing/telling him to stay down. The director makes you feel the anger, frustration, and all his emotions that were bottled up for all those years. When Chiron puts his face in the ice and looks up at the mirror, we can see his face and the mirror, then just his face. This is an attempt by the director to make us step into his shoes and think about everything that has happened to him and what he should do. His act of violence and rage was bottle up for so long, it ended up with him badly beating the bully and getting himself in jail. In the third act before he is released we see him put his head in water, then he moves his head up to stair at the mirror and reveal himself as an adult. This is a way for us to see the changes over the years. He has just become more emotionless and detached. We notice that he drives a similar car to Juan with the same crown on the dashboard, doing the same job. This shows that Juan probably had a similar upbringing, as he took a liking to Chiron early on. When Chiron visits his friend at the end and goes back to his house, we see Chiron in his arms. There is no sound in this shot, just them looking down with Chiron at peace looking down. As he closes his eyes we see his younger self at the beach looking towards the moon lit night sky above the ocean. We hear the subtle crashes of waves at his feet, and then he turns towards us and stairs at the camera. The film cuts to black a few seconds after he turns. Overall this is a very well-done film that really uses limiting certain aspects in Chiron's life to make others really stand out."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2018,7/10,"Moonlight was an interesting movie, but left me confused. The movie explored a lot of interesting concepts and I enjoyed it. The setting was immediately interesting. Most of the movies I watch are more action oriented and and intimate story about a gay man from Miami was new. Since, I have not watched a lot of movies like this I was interested, which will not be true for everyone. The setting and themes do a good job with going places that movies do not normally go. Not only urban Miami, but also a gay main character is unique and I enjoyed the perspective. This film does a great job of showing the viewer what it would be like to be the main character, Chiron. The film is also, shown in a unique way.
The film is divided in to three chapters and each chapter is a part of Chiron's life. However, instead of feeling like a normal growing up story each chapter feels more like a new character. When I watched the movie it felt more like a series of short films. Each film showing a new character at a different age each one reacting to the same problems. For example Chiron has a new nickname everytime we switch perspectives. First he is Little, then Chiron, then Black. Each nickname not only has a deeper meaning, but also helps develop the idea of three independent characters and not one man (also they are the names of each chapter). It made the film feel fractured which is how Chiron is. Chiron is battling between many different ideas of who he should be within himself and fracturing the film in to parts makes the viewer feel this feeling. Chiron is facing many conflicting ideas. His only role model was a strong black male drug dealer, but the stereotypes of his sexuality directly conflict this idea. To make matters worse most of his peers and even his mom belittle him. He is desperately trying to fit in and it leaves him fractured. 
Furthermore, the setting is also an important part of the film. The setting of inner city Miami made me more interested in the movie do to the fact that I was not used to seeing movies like this. The way film is told feels very intimate and the setting helps add to that. When I compare this to most films I watch which are globe racing action movies or at least movies on a large scale, Moonlight feels very different. The city feels tiny even though in reality it is large. The viewer only sees a few streets, the beach, and school. This is because this is from Chirions perspective and that is all of Miami to him. Also the movie shines a light on a large portion of America that is often times under represented, especially in film. Movies have ability to make the viewer feel and understand what it is like to be the main character. Moonlight does this very well.
However, there were some parts I disliked. The movies end felt sudden. When the film cut to black and the credits rolled my initial thought were not what I thought of the movie, but surprise that is was over. I felt like the movie was finally getting started. We had seen all the bad and now Chiron would overcome it or a least another chapter. I can understand the choice to end the movie this way. It goes along with the theme of a fractured life and the movie told all the story it needed to tell, but I personally dislike it. I would have liked a more traditional ending where everything works out, but I know how unrealistic that is."
MOONLIGHT,25 September 2018,9/10,"Moonlight (2016), written and directed by Barry Jenkins is a breathtaking drama based on the semi-autobiographical play Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney. The film shamelessly dives into the very real parts of American life that are so prevalent, yet rarely discussed. Drug abuse, poverty, sexuality, identity, race, and violence are all themes amongst the backdrop of a predominantly African American neighborhood in Miami in which this film takes place. Jenkins seamlessly portrays these harsh realities through music, light, color, and shots that allow this film to be watched and read like poetry. 
The film is broken up into three ""acts"" as we watch the life of the protagonist, Chiron, a closeted, fatherless, African American boy living in a very poor part of town in Florida. Each act corresponds to a time in Chiron's life, aging from a young boy at nine (played by Alex R. Hibbert), to a teenager at 16 (played by Ashton Sanders) to finally, a young adult at 26 (played by Trevante Rhodes). These three acts are titled as various labels Chiron has acquired as he struggles to figure out who he is, who he wishes he could be, and how others feel he should be. The first act, titled ""Little"", was a nickname given to him by his classmates when he was young that belittles and ostracizes him from the start. Following ""Little"", the film jumps forward a few years and we see him attempt to bring back his given name, ""Chiron"". The final act titled ""Black"" shows audiences that Chiron has submerged himself to simply his race, showing that even as he aged, he hasn't figured out where he belongs in the poor, homophobic town. Throughout these three acts we see Jenkins' powerful use of music (or silence), dramatic lighting, rich color, and a balance between simplistic & complex shots to portray Chiron's fear, confusion, and vulnerability as he navigates his internal and external relationships.
Early in the film we meet Juan (or Blue, as he is known) (played by Mahershala Ali), a drug dealer who stumbles upon Chiron hiding away from a bunch of kids who were chasing him down. Blue, despite being powerful and strong in stature, is kind and gentle and takes young Chiron under his wing, acting as a father figure and somewhat of a constant in Chiron's inconsistent life. Blue's home where he lives with his girlfriend, Teressa (played by Janelle Monae) becomes a place of refuge for Chiron, a place of stability, and a place for him to be heard despite his choice to use few words. A beautiful, pivotal scene Jenkins crafted is when Blue takes Chiron to the beach for the first time and teaches him how to float and how to swim. As the scene progresses we see Chiron becoming more comfortable with the water, paralleling himself becoming closer to Blue. As they sit beside the water afterword's, Blue sets up the rest of the film & essentially summarizes Chiron's character by telling him that at some point, he needs to decide who he wants to be. The relationship between Blue, Chiron, and Teressa further progresses on when Chiron asks the two why his classmates call him a ""faggot"". The couple explains that it is a cruel term people use for people who are gay and proceeds to tell Chiron that there's nothing wrong with being homosexual and that ""he'll know when he knows."" Blue seems to leave the story without explanation (we assume he passes away) but the lessons he taught Chiron in their short time together seem to carry out through his life, even up until the very last scene of the movie where Chiron finds himself on the beach, a vivid blue light illuminating the scene. 
The complexity of the story continues when we find out that Blue is dealing drugs to Chiron's mother, Paula (played by Naomie Harris), and shamefully admits it to the boy. Chiron's relationship with his crack-addicted mother is unstable and intense and leaves Chiron more alone and helpless than ever as the school bullying gets worse as he ages in act two, ""Chiron"". 
The beauty of the slow camera movements in many of the scenes sets a calming tone that contrasts the hectic, violent, and high intensity of the situations that the protagonist is going through. In comparison however, this slow, silent style mirrors perfectly Chiron's quiet, gentle demeaner. Moonlight strikes audiences through it's shocking, but entirely prevalent topics and it's breathtaking film style. Its timeless themes transcend to all audiences but we effortlessly empathize with this silent, unsure, neglected, and bullied boy as we watch him understand the world and where he fits amongst it."
MOONLIGHT,24 September 2018,8/10,"Moonlight details the life of a young African American named Chiron, who grows up in a poor Miami neighborhood and faces both physical and emotional abuse as he struggles to understand his sexuality. The characters he encounters consist of his mother Paula, the drug dealer Juan, Juan's girlfriend Teresa, and Chiron's high school friend Kevin. The movie is split into three parts; part one is about Chiron's life as a little kid, part two focuses on his teenage years, and part three explores his adult life.
The most significant aspect of Moonlight, in my opinion, is the cinematography. The film is very inventive in how it handles its shots. Often the shakiness of the camera will indicate Chiron's uneasiness at a given time. For example, in the very beginning of the film, when Chiron is running away from the bully and stumbles across the crack house, the camera follows him for a brief moment, and it is shaking violently. This is to match the frantic peril that Chiron is feeling at that moment, and it immediately gets the audience to sympathize with him. Once that shot has done its job, a new shot takes its place. This one slowly reveals Chiron climbing up to the balcony on the crack house, and then surprises us when the bully pursuing Chiron is revealed at the end to have reached the top at a faster pace than we expected.
This type of experimentation of film has already been done before, but the way it alarms and grabs the audience this early into the film is very telling of what the director has in store for us. Later, when Chiron is walking back to his house and his mother approaches him, the audience witnesses both the mood of the scene, and as a result Chiron's view of his mother, morph from pleasantness to an ugly truth. At first, Chiron is happy to see his mom, and so is she. The sun is shining, the grass is green, and it all just looks so gorgeous. However, as the medium shot of the mom talking lingers, the effects of her drug use start to show. She starts rambling, and then the movie starts randomly cutting and skipping frames. The lighting begins to make everything blurry. The sound stops syncing with the action, and eventually fades into static. It becomes disorienting to the viewer, and when the mom walks away from the foreground, the camera starts shaking. It is as if simply through the behavior of the camera and audio, the director is taking us through the mind of Chiron. He starts to realize that he doesn't care for her at all, and that she is only a means to get more drugs off of him. This is confirmed by the mom stealing money from her own son immediately after this.
The use of color is very important in this movie. The lighting is capable of illuminating rooms and turning entire scenes into a specific hue. The color is indicative of Chiron's emotions at a given moment, and the specific colors that are used throughout the film stem from vital moments in his life. For example, blue, which is the most famously used color in this film, comes from Juan's lecture about black boys being blue in moonlight. Blue becomes the theme of being true to yourself, and we see this in the moments where Chiron has his first sexual encounter, as well as the moments where the audience sees that Chiron followed Juan's path and became a drug dealer. There is a shot where the kitchen is drenched in blue light.
Another notable aspect of Moonlight is its use of sound. There are many moments in the film where the sound is manipulated to match what Chiron is paying attention to. For example, when the older woman is talking to him after he gets beaten up, the sound fades into nothing. This is to indicate to the viewer that Chiron is not paying attention to her.
Even though Moonlight was released only two years ago, its place in the pantheon of film classics has already been cemented by various critics and audience members throughout the industry. It has acquired several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, and has even been described as one of the ""best films of the 21st century so far"" by the New York Times. To the average movie goer, these accolades do not mean much. The idea of an Oscar-winning picture has almost always been synonymous with typically posh romantic dramas which have saturated the industry. I will be honest, when I first watched this movie, I was convinced that it was going to be a ghetto film filled with guns and violence. However, as the film progressed, I realized that Moonlight was going for something else entirely. Moonlight is not the typical ""Oscar-bait"" cash grab. It is not concerned with checking a list of ""requirements"" or being a popular movie amongst the masses. It is simply laser-focused on illustrating the life and emotional struggles of its protagonist, and it pulls it off phenomenally.
The best thing I can say about this film is that it tells the audience Chiron's story, not just through words, but mainly through cinematic techniques and audio cues. It completely embraces the advantages the medium of film has in telling personal and intimate stories."
MOONLIGHT,25 September 2018,10/10,"After first seeing Moonlight, I was completely in love with it. The cinematography was stunning and the story is one that I think needs to be told. It paints the people as multi dimension, taking what is generally viewed in society as ""good"" and ""bad"" and showing the grey areas of how people make the choices they make. It makes the viewer connect with his struggles on a personal level and shows how universal some feelings are. Obviously, his experiences were much more difficult to deal with than the average person's but everyone watching could easily connect with how he was feeling. The way the film was broken into 3 parts gave the viewer just enough direction that they could easily infer what was happening between the different parts without feeling like they were being beat over the head with it. You can see the ramifications of things that happened when he was a child still so deeply affecting him as an adult and everything very clearly ties together. This film also uses sound, or the lack of sound, so beautifully to tell the story. There is a lot more pure silence than in almost any other movie I have seen which really brings out his feelings of isolation. In some scenes, the audio that we as viewers expect to hear is cut out to show where his focus really is. The audio plays into beautifully shot scenes to boggle the viewers mind on how they could have created something so beautiful. All around, the way this film was constructed was beyond what I had expected. For many years, I have heard a lot about this film but had never gotten around to actually seeing it. I now understand why it is so highly acclaimed and I recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful movie to watch."
MOONLIGHT,25 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is powerful and beautiful film that is vital to black cinema, as it touches upon issues and concerns that are not usually addressed. The ability for Barry Jenkins to bring together race, sexuality, poverty, drugs and other issues into one magnificent movie is breathtaking. He is able to bring light upon these important issues that nobody wants to address. 
Barry Jenkins uses a variety of different film techniques to fully relay feeling and various emotions to the audience. One of the first techniques the audience is exposed to is camera perspective. For example, the film starts off with a drug deal. The camera circles around the two men giving the audience a view of everything that is occuring, while also showing the deal through both the dealer and buyer's perspectives. A few moments later the viewers are chasing a boy whom they later find out is Chiron, the main character. This chasing or running scene makes the audience feel like they are there living the moment with the characters. 
The use of color throughout the film is also a vital part of the storytelling. Jenkins uses three main colors, yellow, blue and red, to show different emotions and to emphasis the importance of the emotions within the scenes. By making the colors so prominent causes the viewer to be attracted to the color, and then associate the color with certain emotions. The color blue is most prominent when Chiron feel comfortable, secure, or is being submissive. When he is around Juan, Teresa, and Kevin, the color blue is usually everywhere, as he feels secure. In other situations, such as when he is being bullied, he is also wearing blue, as he is going along with the bullies and not standing up for himself. Red is also a very important color within this film, as it indicates anger, upsetting situations, and brings attention to the people that bring chaos into Chiron's life. Chiron's mother and bully, Tyrell, wear the color red a lot, especially when they are attacking Chiron either physically or verbally. In addition to wearing articles of clothing that are red, Chiron's mother's room has a red light that shines out of it. When his mother yells at him in the hallway the red light flows out on her. The light fades away with her as she goes into her room and away from Chiron. The last prominent color seen throughout the movie is yellow. Yellow symbolizes his uneasy feeling towards something, along with his inability to be confident and have courage within a scene. For example, his house is painted yellow, symbolizing his uneasy attitude about it, as his druggie mother lives there. Many times all of these colors are seen at once, illustrating Chiron's unknown thoughts or feelings. 
Another important aspect of this movie is its structure. The movie is split into three acts which play a powerful role in showing character development. The acts are each named either his name, or a nickname. Act one is ""Little"", act two is ""Chiron"" and act three is ""Black"". In the beginning Chiron is given a nickname ""Little"" by the other boys in school. He goes along with the name, even though he knows he is tough and not little. In act two he gains more confidence, becoming his true self. In this act he finally takes action against the bullies. The final act is named after a nickname Kevin gives him. This symbolizes how Chiron has finally realized who he is and learned that it is okay to be gay. The use of the acts makes it is easy for the audience to follow his character development and become emotionally connected to him. 
The audio and music used throughout the film impact the way scenes are received by the audience. For example, there are many scenes where the audience sees someone talking but does not hear anything. This connects them to the Chiron, because they are viewing and hearing the situation like he is. This happens a lot when people are yelling at him, such as his mom or the principal. Many times when voices are muted, there is light instrumental music being played. Chiron is in this calmer state because he muted everyone out, thus the calm music also puts the audience into this calm state that would otherwise feel very stressful. Music is used throughout the film to change the mood of the scene. Many times music is not used in ""silent"" spaces like normally used in traditional film. For example, when Juan is confronting Chiron's mom in the car there is no music. All that is heard are footsteps, the car doors, their voices and the lighter. This connects the audience to the scene more, as there is no artificial sounds. The audience feels like they are there, creating an emotional connection to such a powerful scene.
There are many more techniques used throughout the movie that connect with each other creating a large impact on the audience. The movie Moonlight is a powerful movie that all people should see. The ability for this movie to hit upon many important issues and concepts within society is breathtaking. The issues addressed within the movie are usually ones people push to the side and try to forget, thus making this movie vital to the growth of cinema."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is a movie that addresses not only the issues faced by black individuals, but also by gay ones. Through the use of color, sound, and certain shots and editing, the story is able to be told in an interesting way. The story progresses over three sections, each with a different title relating to Chiron, the main character's, life as he grows up. Beginning with him as a small boy and ending with him as an adult, the film could be described as a coming of age movie.
The use of color in Moonlight is very interesting, specifically in that before the beginning of each section, the screen goes black and a color orb appears, with each time being a different color. When the second section of the movie begins the color blue appears, perhaps in some ways signifying Chiron's dislike and unhappiness towards his current situation. At the beginning of the third and final section the color red appears as the orb, potentially signifying Chiron's general anger towards everything. During the third section, Chiron is initially angry at everything, including past and current events, which is evident in both his body language and general attitude. Near the very end of the film though his attitude and outlook changes, meaning that the representation that the color red has also has changed. The different colors work to establish the general theme and mood of each section, even if that meaning changes over time as Chiron grows and the film progresses.
When discussing sound, a few scenes come to mind. When the scene where Chiron's mom is yelling at him is initially shown and all of the sounds are absent, including her yelling, that stuck in my head. It is up to the viewer to initially try and determine what she says to him, at least until the scene is shown again later and what she says is revealed. By having a completely quiet scene, the disconnection between Chiron and the events that are occurring to him at the moment is very obvious. The audience is not allowed to know what Chiron's mom is yelling at him, also creating a disconnect between the events occurring and the audience.
Regarding both sound and cinematography, the scene where Chiron is running through his high school to try and take down Terrel really impressed me. The changing angles as he ran through the doors, was really fascinating and helped to convey the idea that he was rushing through the school to do this. As well as changing the angles as he ran through the doors, Chiron would sometimes enter one doorway and exit through one in another part of the school, but the shot would line up to make it look like one uniform entrance and exit. In addition, the sounds in that scene that really stand out are the running of his feet against the floor of the school, including the squeaking sounds, and the door opening and closing noises. The scene is otherwise silent and Chiron is alone in the hallways, with only the sounds he's making present. The sound and the fact that Chiron is alone in a way works to build up the suspension and tension before he goes into the classroom. Once the classroom is entered however, not only are there a lot more people, the noise level in the classroom is significantly higher, until Chiron hits Terrel with the chair, breaking the tension.
Overall Moonlight was a very enjoyable film that had absolutely amazing cinematography and sound design. The plot and story were amazing and well-developed, as well as the story-telling method being very appealing and interesting. There are a large variety of shots and angles incorporated into the film, but they felt natural and as if they meshed with the story."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,3/10,"""Moonlight"" is a tragic example of a movie receiving too many positive reviews and awards that the viewer is unnecessarily convinced that their experience watching this film will be worthwhile. While the viewer may not feel that completing this film is a tedious and time-consuming task, it is easy to feel as though those two hours spent screening ""Moonlight"" had been wasted on a film with no truly impactful ending. The film explores a mother's failure to provide her son with the support he needs, a son's search for a role model and guidance, drug use, and exploration of sexuality. Unfortunately, the film failed to come to any meaningful conclusion with any of these topics, as it clearly overreached in its goals. It feels as though this movie had too many goals and in trying to reach them all, it failed to achieve any. ""Moonlight"" is not the first entertainment media to explore these topics. The tv show ""Atlanta"", produced by Donald Glover, is an excellent example of entertainment exploring multitudes of struggles experienced by the black community in a unique and enjoyable way. The show takes time to develop relationships, mixes comedy in with its serious themes, and tackles topics that are controversial without completely alienating its viewers, allowing ""Atlanta"" to leave a lasting impact on its audience. ""Moonlight"", however, chose to look at these topics in a bland, overused way that leaves the audience wondering ""Haven't I seen this before?"". There are no truly unique features added to the plot, characters, setting, etc. that separate this film from any other exploring the aforementioned themes.One may compliment ""Moonlight"" on its fluidity, as the film gradually flows through the timeline of the main character's life without any major action or suspense. It lays out all of the main plot points as they come up. For example, Juan's death is addressed shortly after the start of act II, when Chiron's mother mentions a funeral. The audience is not left wondering where Juan is; there is no buildup of suspense around the sudden disappearance of this character from the film. Unfortunately, this fluid structure is not what a movie like ""Moonlight"" needs. The movie lacked any real climactic moment, and in a film where such serious topics are addressed, a climax is definitely needed to leave any sort of lasting impact. Another problem that this movie has is in its character development. Very few characters are given time to portray any important character traits that would allow the audience to really care about them. For example, Kevin hardly receives any dialogue throughout the movie, but the audience is expected to care about him and understand Chiron's connection with him. Building a relationship between characters requires both internal and external development. There are clearly examples of internal development, as the viewer sees in the exchanged glances and physical reactions of Kevin and Chiron, however there are hardly any examples of dialogue that provide for external development. The audience experiences a few key exchanges between Chiron and Kevin, but they are not given any supplementary dialogue. It seems that they only speak when the dialogue is meant to provide the audience with important plot points.What this film lacks in supplementary dialogue, it makes up for with an excess of unimportant visuals. An example of this is the part of act I where Juan is teaching Chiron how to swim. Although one may argue that this helps to cement Juan's role as a mentor in Chiron's life, it does not do much to move the plot along and stands out to the viewer when it is never mentioned again. While the ocean will play an important role in acts II and III, swimming does not and the viewer does not see Chiron enter any body of water after this. There is a much better example of development in Chiron and Juan's relationship just moments later, when Juan gives Chiron some money before Chiron returns to his house. This comes up again in act II when Chiron's mother states that she knows Juan and Theresa have been giving him money. These scenes are simple, but they play an important role in tying the movie together. The scene where Chiron is learning to swim does not have this same effect, however, and it feels as though it could have been removed entirely without affecting the plot in any way. In a movie where nearly every line of dialogue is plays a major part in the plot and the overall structure is rooted in fluidity, throwaway scenes like this one stand out even more and severely tarnish the film's continuity.""Moonlight"" had great potential with its stunning cinematography, beautiful sets, great casting, and righteous intentions, but it failed to utilize these pieces to create a truly impactful film. This movie could have been an important stepping stone for the black community towards getting outsiders to better understand their experiences, but it leaves the audience without any real groundbreaking ending that will have any lasting effect on its viewers."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,9/10,"Moonlight is uncomfortable. It's not a ""feel good"" movie, and it's not supposed to be. It's not a clich√© movie where the good guy wins, and everyone's happy. And these are all great things. The discomfort you feel keeps you glued to the screen.
The way Moonlight is structured keeps you questioning things. Moonlight is broken into 3 parts, and in between each part is a several year time-span. The only information you get about these gaps is conversational exposition. The audience is left to guess what happened. You want answers, you want closure. If you don't get those, you feel... off. Something about it doesn't sit right. You keep watching to see if your questions get answered. This may seem like they just wanted to split the story into three parts, but it's actually an incredible way to get you more involved in the film. Since no one knows for sure what happened in these gaps, everyone fills in their own version of the story that's plausible enough. This makes the viewer feel like they experienced the last several years, even though there's no way to confirm if they were right or not. As the movie progresses, you continue to fill in some small gaps in your ""guess"", eventually feeling as if you have the whole story. This keeps you engaged, as you want to see if your ideas were correct. As a viewer, you don't want to feel uncomfortable, no one does. The director knows this, and knows you will want to watch more to fill in the gaps in your story.
The content of Moonlight is uncomfortable. No one enjoys watching a kid get bullied. No one enjoys watching someone see their own mother suffering from withdrawal. Watching two teenage kids have their first sexual experience isn't comfortable. And that's the point. Chiron spends his life uncomfortable. It's incredibly hard for the viewer to put themselves in Chiron's shoes. If you didn't come from a low-income, single parent household as a homosexual struggling with their identity, it's impossible for you to feel how he feels during the film. The only way to portray this, is to make the viewer as uncomfortable with the on screen events as possible. The viewer then feels like they can relate to Chiron, as they both feel uncomfortable at the same times. We then want Chiron to solve his problems, so we get the same sense of relief. This secondhand discomfort is one of the main elements of this film that keeps you interested.
Moonlight is a wonderfully uncomfortable movie. I've never seen a movie that made me feel this bad or this awkward for someone. I wanted Chiron to succeed, and to find out who he is so I could feel better. No one wants to feel uncomfortable. You become involved with this movie and it makes want to stay and watch the rest of it. On top of all the psychological reasons you want to watch it, it's incredibly well made. The acting is superb, each character plays their role perfectly. The movie is shot very well. Most of the scenes are very aesthetically pleasing, the lights of Miami flow very well with the color symbolism in the movie. Overall, Moonlight is a brilliant film. Once you start watching it, you won't want to leave."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is a film that revels in its own reservations, peeling back the dramatic veneer of its contemporaries and finding tremendous beauty underneath. A striking statement, if a little too broad to be called a true commentary, on race, sexuality, masculinity, drug abuse, and poverty is this film, told in the most human way such a story could be told. In an impoverished world, even the most basic of masculine ideas becomes warped into a toxic social pressure, and in this place, Moonlight asks the question: ""Where is a black boy to go when he does not fit those pressures?"" The result is a coming-of-age narrative that employs intense psychological imagery and character relationships all characterized as some level of tragic.
 The film follows the story of Chiron, a boy who's nothing more than a victim of circumstance, as he finds his way through life alongside and in spite of his drug-addicted mother, his best friend Kevin, and his quasi-parental figures in Juan and Teresa. As Moonlight is not necessarily a traditional three-act structure, the film is divided into three hard sections taking place in their own time period, with each telling a more localized story, and each with its own individual theme. The first part defines Chiron through the people trying to reach him, the second tests Chiron against the cruel world, and the third shows a Chiron that has found a path in the world, for better or for worse, through being forced to deny himself and fit into the masculine world he was rejected from years before. Each of these parts ends with Chiron no readier to move to the future than he was when he began, save for the third, in which at last he finds the smallest bit of respite expressing his complicated, long held emotions. 
 Juan is the first character introduced to us, even before Chiron is, which bookends this film in a sense, as Juan is also entrapped in the same unfortunate circumstances that Chiron becomes, and makes a living selling drugs. However, while Juan is ultimately defeated by the hypocrisy of his own morals, having sold drugs to Chiron's mother but disapproving of her behavior, Chiron grows to understand that denying those feelings got him in such a tragic position to begin with, ending the film with Chiron succeeding where Juan could not. Unfortunately, those emotions stemmed from insecurities growing throughout his life, and the foil for that anxiety was none other than his childhood best friend, Kevin. Kevin was, for all intents and purposes, far more well-adjusted than his friend, more popular, more confident, but more willing to go with the crowd, even when it meant going against his friend, causing him to move through life in what the film presents as a somewhat formulaic manner, ending with a nice place for himself, satisfied if not fulfilled. This, of course, creates a disconnect between him and Chiron, but he remained the person Chiron was closest to in his youth, leading to the further complication of Chiron's feelings towards Kevin when the boy became Chiron's first romantic encounter. Indeed, Chiron's sexuality is a major theme that pervades the film, as he is bullied for it even before he understands what it is, even if it was for the femininity that he was perceived to project, these doubts about that sexuality caused him to doubt himself for most of his life. 
 The cinematography is another outstanding element of this film that adds to the psychology of the presentation and allows the narrative to be visually presented. One scene in particular that stood out in this regard was in part 2, when Chiron is speaking with Teresa after being bullied at school that day, when the shot turns to Chiron, the camera sways, and parts of the world fall in and out of focus, while the reverse shot of Teresa is static to reflect her own apparent lack of doubt. Similarly, the opening scene of the film features a rotating long shot, causing the viewer to constantly have to get their bearings as an introduction to the familiar-yet-unfamiliar mood of the setting. Color also remains an important motif throughout the movie, reflecting the title of the memoir it was based on, Moonlight Makes Black Boys Look Blue, as the screen is washed in blue in the few times that Chiron is able to truly identify with his own emotions, with the sole exception of the last time at the end of the movie, where the light shines a bright yellow, wiping away the dreamlike nature of his emotions and bringing them into reality. Conversely, red tends to follow antagonistic scenes such as those with Chiron's mother's abuse.
Moonlight maintains a sense of raw realism that seeks to give its message in a powerful, if nontraditional, human manner. The cinematography deeply conveys the psyche of the protagonist and the film itself, and the relationships of the characters each serve a unique purpose that may not be immediately clear from the beginning. All of these weave together in a well-paced character driven narrative that doesn't shy away from the complexities of its own emotions and forms a work of stunning beauty."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,9/10,"Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a film about a man who represents the pain and struggles of so many. Moonlight speaks about race, sexuality, poverty, family, and masculinity in ways far more elegant than we see in many other films of its time. There's never a moment when you feel a moral or lesson is being forced on you. The experience is more of an exposure to all of the aforementioned topics. The main character, Chiron, is shown to us in three stages of his life, each defining an act to the movie. Each act develops on his pain as a poor, black, gay, and fatherless man. As a young child, Chiron has disconnect with his single mother, and run ins with bullies on a daily basis. While running away, Chiron runs into Juan, a friendly and well-intentioned drug dealer. Juan and his girlfriend Theresa represent a beacon of light within the darkness Chiron lives in. These two act as his surrogate parents in way, watching him when his mom kicks him out to treat her crack addiction. During this act, we're also introduced to Kevin, Chiron's only real friend his age. Right from the beginning we see that Kevin is a foil to Chiron's closed and sad personality, being talkative and outgoing during their conversations. As we move on to Chiron's teenage years, we see that Juan has died, his mom's problem is getting worse, and that he is struggling to find his identity. His bullying issue is getting harder on him, consuming much of his thought. As Chiron reaches the edge of how much stress he can handle, he finds some answers to his questions of sexuality when Kevin, who seems to feel confidence within his bisexuality, encounters him on the beach where they share a sexual encounter. Shortly after, we see Chiron in his happiest since spending time with his father figure, Juan. Days later, Kevin beats Chiron in an attempt to fit in with the school bullies. Chiron is broken physically and emotionally. Here he's left with Theresa being the last person on the planet he trusts. The next day he enters school in a fit of pure rage and breaks a chair over the head of a bully, staring down Kevin and police drag him away. In the last chapter of Chiron's life presented to us, we see how heavily juvy has changed him. Right from the beginning of the act, we see Chiron has gone from scrawny and reserved to bulky and angry. He now lives alone, head of a drug dealing group hundreds of miles from his home of Miami. He gets a call from Kevin, requesting that he come visit some time. Soon Chiron heads back down to Miami, where he finds his mother done with rehab, finally getting to chance to hear her apologize for her terrible treatment of him. We see his mask of his false sense of masculinity quickly crumble as emotions overwhelm him. Despite his issues with family showing improvement, Chiron doesn't seem happy as travels down to see Kevin. We soon realize Chiron still suffers from a lack of comfort in his sexuality, as well as his skin as a whole. As he reconnects with Kevin after the beating from the previous act, Chiron slowly sheds his cold shell to tell Kevin he's never been with another man since their time on the beach. Chiron's expression pain finally switches into a look of hope as Kevin accepts him for his true self.
 In Chiron's youth, we see Juan take him out to the ocean where tells the young Chiron a story of a cuban woman telling him that ""in the moonlight, black boys look blue"". Throughout the very candid shots of Moonlight, we see Chiron's skin become blue as he struggles to find himself. Blue, as well as many other colors take a large role in the storytelling Jenkins' achieves in each shot. We see a bright red take over his mother's skin as she silently screams at Chiron in his nightmares. We see the soft yellow of streetlights when Chiron thinks of his youth in Miami. The strong colors of the film take each scene from eerily quiet to visually blaring. We experience conversations in long, exposed angles, rather than just shot reverse shot. The setting of the projects in Miami is presented not as a set, but a living, struggling community. Each of these factors contributes a movie so visually engaging as it is challenging. On top of this, Jenkins' alternates between body-shaking rap and absolute silence. Both the sound of anger and empty space push our emotions just that much further. The result is an experience every part of the body involved in film.
 Moonlight asks us why we suffer. Why we let others suffer. Moonlight asks us to understand what others live through. It asks us to understand what we've lived through. There are few movies that can take a simply concept, put it in a simple setting, and create an experience you are left pondering long after you see it. Moonlight succeeds on all levels of all storytelling. This being said, there are moments when the visuals may have benefited from more subtlety. While engaging, not every scene needs to stun the audience with visual messages and sudden color changes. Overall, a discussion is reached with more depth than we typically see. What is masculinity? How can we accept what we can't change? How do you love family that doesn't love you? How do we survive each day? 9.6/10.0"
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,7/10,"There are a lot of sensitive topics in today's society that individuals often neglect to talk about. Whether it be race, gender, sexual orientation, or political standing these ideas create distress and discomfort resulting them to often be left undiscussed. The movie ""Moonlight"", written and directed by Barry Jenkins, delves into a world primarily based around associated stereotypes including mainly race and gender. It presents a story of Chiron through three different stages and evaluates elements of love and manhood. While at first the film presents itself to be very one dimensional in nature by describing a strictly African American urban neighborhood, commonly associated to crime and drugs, it soon rises above that commonality and develops to be more sensitive through cinematography. 
 
The film seems to hold a universal theme relating less to the fact that Chiron was a homosexual African American and more to us as individuals discovering who we are in such an unforgiving place. One of the main reasons the story presents itself to be so outstanding is due to the character development. Each character, mainly stating, Juan, Chiron's mother, Teresa, and Kevin provide the main development for the film. I leave Chiron out of this brief list because although he is thought to be the main character, I believe Jenkins leaves out large portions of his life on purpose. Even though Chiron is physically in the center of most slides in the movie it is the effect of lively shades of everything in the background that gives the audience every detail they need. As an audience member breaking down the intricacies of a film it clear to state that this film is presented in a classic three act structure. It outlines Chiron's journey from childhood to adulthood and explores how his experiences and the many people who he meets impact him and form him into the man we eventually see in the final act of the film. Everyone experiences a point in their life where they question who they are and often try and hide who they truly are. Chiron has a constant inner conflict with himself where he tries to hide his real feelings by portraying himself as a hard drug dealer. This conflict brings us as audience members to a state where we being to question ourselves. We question our self because we feel as if we are in Chiron's place, in his shoes. The film represents reality, through real interactions, through characters who are relatable, through evident stereotypes, but the fact is that it represents the side of reality no one wants to talk about. The other most striking aspect of this motion picture is its ability to give such definition to something as undermined as the term ""color"". Throughout the film we realize that the color blue holds a significance. We see blue first in the nighttime sky that rests itself over the neighborhood holding a more key significance when a lady says that ""black boys look blue in the nighttime"". Second, we see the color on many elements of Paula, Chiron's mothers clothing. Chiron's mother was clearly not your finest mother figure, as she was addicted to drugs and seemed to rarely actually provide for her son, essentially another negative element of Chiron's life. Barry Jenkins has provided a film of classic structure containing symbolism and life lesson provided in a way that a majority audience can clearly relate with. Jenkins wants everyone to just be themselves and realize who they are, so they can live genuinely. However, it is impossible to live that life when you spend most of it seeping away from the truth and pretending to love something you don't."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,10/10,"Directed by Barry Jenkins, Moonlight, in my opinion, is an exemplary film that not only engulfs the audience into the life of Chiron, but also accurately captures the true nature and struggles people like Chiron go through growing up in such a hostile environment. Jenkins illustrates these concepts throughout the movie using many different cinematic techniques; however, the aspect in Moonlight that stood out the most to me was the use of audio techniques throughout the movie, whether it was the careful choice of music, the sound of the ocean, of even the absence of sound.
 I feel as though the choice of music in Moonlight played a large role in the development of the film and that the choice of songs was very deliberate, as they were primarily by African-American artists. For example, the first song we hear in Moonlight is ""Every N***** is a Star"", by Boris Gardiner (which originally contained a racial slur in the tite). The title itself is ironic such that the word used to describe African-Americans is meant to oppress and belittle; however, it is contrasted with saying that every African-American is a star, or something special. This can be interpreted as meaning that no matter who you are, there is a star in everyone, and I feel as though this coincides with Chiron being called homophobic slurs his entire childhood and yet eventually still ends up finding his own 'star' in the end. That's why I personally feel as though that particular song was chosen quite deliberately to be the first one the audience hears as it is a reflection of a theme in Moonlight.
 Another example of song choice that plays a significant role in the film is that of ""One Step Ahead"", by Aretha Franklin. This song plays a significant role, such that it plays at two different instances in the film, and both lead into very high-tension moments. This song could even signify foreshadowing of these types of moments. For example, the first time we hear the song is right before we see Chiron's mother scream at him as she is high on crack, while the second time we hear it is as Chiron enters the restaurant where he is going to meet Kevin. Both of these moments in Chiron's life prove to be two of the most significant one's, and it can be implied that this song was deliberately chosen to be played at both of these significant moments in his life.
Other than music choice, there are other examples of cinematic audio techniques utilized that contribute to the overall work. One of the more prominent examples is the portrayal of Chiron's selective hearing in some of the most stressful moments in his life. We see this in times of extreme stress for Chiron in which all the loud noises bombarding Chiron are completely muted, illustrating his selective hearing. For example, this muting happens in one of Chiron's most traumatic childhood experiences. This is when his enebriated mother screams at him as an innocent child, and the moment she starts to scream, he puts up his barrier using his selective listening to protect himself. In fact, this moment haunts him for many years to come, and even into adulthood he still has nightmares of that moment in his life; however, in his nightmares the director chooses to play the audio of the screaming, implying that he did, in fact, hear and experience it, despite his seemingly muting of the situation. 
Throughout Moonlight, Barry Jenkins utilizes many techniques of audio in order to convey his message through the film. I believe that the audio plays one of the largest roles in portraying both the black experience as well as the gay experience in America, particularly in hostile environments such as Chiron's home."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,9/10,"This is not your typical movie, where you would just sit down and enjoy the amazing CGI and the popcorn. Moonlight is a film that reveals the sexuality, race and mistreatment of the society. Movie does not focus on how the character grow up, but rather skipped a lot of these stories and let viewers to figure the stories connecting the scenes. Start with a drug deal happening in Miami, we are not introduced to the main character but rather someone that will soon leave. Right after Juan, then we see our main character Chiron aka Little being chased cause he is different. Chiron was forced to hide in an abandoned house and Juan offered to feed him. We still have no idea where this boy comes from or why he is being chased yet. Soon as the movie develops, viewers understand that Chiron is gay and his mother has drug-addiction. His only ""family"" is Juan and his girlfriend Teresa. Their House becomes Chiron's shelter. Where he can worry free and get a hot meal and a clean bed with decent sleep. Juan basically become his father. When Juan confronts Paula (Chiron's mother), it was heartbreaking. But what's more heartbreaking is when young Chiron confronts Juan at dinner table. Then we were fast tracked to later on in Chiron's life, he became a teenager and he knew his difference between other kids. He got no friends except Teresa and a kid called Kevin. When Kevin and Chiron were talking on the beach, Chiron had the best time of his life that night. He is not isolated, not hated by the people around him. But that will soon be over because a fight broke out in school and Chiron will be sent to prison. Now fast tracked again, many years later, we see a totally different Chiron on screen. He is strong and he is now a drug dealer, which what ruined his family in the first place. But does it really matter to him? Chiron now is powerful, no one is looking down at him, everyone respects him but deep down, he is lonely. He is always by himself, he got no one to care for or to love, is all this worth it. But the call from Kevin will soon change that and left Audience with a meaning ending. 
Not just the story, the filming and editing are truly amazing. The whole film have a sense of color contrast which give viewers a distinct comparison when switching scenes. The color contrast was mostly blue and red, which represents the emotions of Chiron. Red represents anger, mistreatment and hate; while Blue represents Peace and joy. When he is with his loves ones, the shots have a blue tint filter on. When he is fill of rage or hate, the shots switches to red tint. It is really amazing editing and makes the movies really enjoyable.
Next up is the sound of the film, the sound is astonishing. The Middle of the World by Nicholas Britell is perhaps is finest touch of this whole film. This music was played several times throughout the film and it is truly amazing. The violin viewers heard playing in the swimming scene is actually a piece that is 300 years old. Britell mixed the violin playing and edited with some southern hip hop style so that the music would sound distinct the pit went down so does the music and it is truly fascinating how they accomplish that. 
Overall, this film is one of the best in Black Cinema and it deserves whatever awards it receives."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight is a story of coming of age in a place that one doesn't feel safe or accepted. The character the audience follows, Chiron, is incredibly developed, and well acted by all three people who acted for him. It's one of the first movies in a long time that where child actors were as amazing as the adult counterparts. Things like the realistic setting, the beautiful score, and the striking color palette show the uniqueness of this film incredibly well, and the film is definitely unique. Barry Jenkins mixes elements of formalism and realism film making to cause contrast of emotional scenes and pivotal life scenes for Chiron, a good example of this is moment when sound cuts out when Paula yells, and or when teen Chiron blocks out the principal's lecture, as audience members, this voice could be considered obstructive, but it really adds to the empathy we have for Chiron. I can definitely see why a movie of this caliber won best picture. The Best picture winner at the oscars is usually very hit or miss, but I really enjoyed this film. The use of color to connate the scenes emotional tone was especially poignant when in reference to the actual memoir this film was based on. Moonlight created and explored a world with it's own developed hardships that are very real and tangible to some people. I thought the cinematography was beautifully done, effortly using shaky cam and close up shots. The way that the camera follows the children in the first section gives this sense of closeness, of being involved in the scene. It uses its setting and camera work to instill this childlike feeling into it. The scenes in which our main character gets beaten by large groups it's slow, personal, and almost point of view. The use of sound, diegetic and nondiegetic really add to the experience. The lack of sound in certain scenes, and the swell of music in others really add to the emotionality of the scene. The actors are extremely good, this is definitely a character study at its best. The movie was very intimate, small scale, and incredibly powerful. The audience learns to really care for chiron, the withdrawn and quiet black boy coming into his own, learning how to perform masculinity, and how to be himself and understand his own sexuality. The subjective filmmaking really makes the audience feel Chiron's struggle to avoid vulnerability, even in the face of his father figure Juan, in the swimming scene. I've watched the scene a few times, and I think it is one of the most striking. Everything about the scene where he's actually swimming shows that he feels freer, down to the way it is no longer edited using only long, constraining shots. Juan, as a character subverts the narrative of what black masculinity is normally played as in movies. Juan is kind, and compassionate, and treats his girlfriend very well. He teaches Chiron to swim, and metaphorically he teaches him to ""swim"" so he won't drown in his life. He teaches him a kinder, softer masculinity. He even goes as far as to affirm that there is not anything wrong with being gay. In the final act, it is shown subtly by things like the matching crowns on their dashboards that Chiron is attempting to perform masculinity in the way that Juan did, as Juan was his father figure throughout his young life, prior to his death. Chiron is ""hard"", very muscular, and it's almost surprising that he's the same person as the little boy in the context of the narrative. The emotional scenes with his mother are beautifully done, with so much emotion. The final scenes with Kevin, show a prospect for redemption and acceptance in chiron's adult life, despite all that has happened to him, the movie leaves us with hope that he will find happiness somewhere. The film is stunning in its portrayal of emotion, struggle with masculinity and sexuality, and from what I've read it also portrays growing up in a hard place very well too. I'm glad we rewarded such a talented director on his unique story and it's beauty."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,8/10,"Moonlight is a a film directed by Barry Jenkins that portrays a young black man in three different stages of his life as he comes to terms with who he is meant to be and his sexuality. The general concept of this movie is not new, but the combination of being black, male, and gay with a unique focus on color is captivating. As I watched and reflected on this film, I was reminded of Call Me By Your Name, Love Simon, GBF, and many other films, but Moonlight is different from these films in terms of cinematography. One of my favorite attributes about Moonlight is the extreme close-ups. Often times in the film, we are not distracted by busy backgrounds, but we are focused on someone's face. The only times scenery is notable is when they are monumentous to the story line. When Little was running away from his bullies, we saw the abandoned house in more detail; when Chiron was having a romantic moment with Kevin, we saw the the sand of the beach meet the ocean; and when Black reunited with Kevin, the layout of the diner seemed crystal clear to me. Lighting and coloring is also a vital part of Moonlight. From the actual cinematography to the script, color and lighting stands out the most. I appreciate the subtle color tints in the film that could easily be overlooked because of the escalation in the heavy storyline. As Chiron soaked his face in ice water and looked up, the droplets of water covering his face added a glicaning glow. Reflecting on this scene, I realize that this is the moment Chiron becomes Black. I love the subtle foreshadowing Jenkin and the writers of Moonlight implemented throughout the film like the ice water scene.Jenkins puts the audience in a subjective point of view by introducing us to Chiron when he was young, weak, and went by 'Little.' Seeing Little chased by a group of boys invoked sympathy, causing me to feel a need to support him. As I was watching, I wanted Little to suddenly become the strong man I knew was inevitably planned to be, but the events leading up to this progression is where I must applaud the writers. When Chiron walked into the classroom, I did not expect for him to hit Terrel with a chair, but I wish we were informed of what happened to Terrel after such events. As the Kevin and Black sat down in the dinner together, I could not focus on their exchange due to my wandering mind: Where is Terrel? Is he alive? Is he paralyzed? Did Theresa find someone else after Juan's death? How did Paula end up in the rehab facility? While I personally wanted to know the answer to these questions, the lack of follow up information did not harm the flow of the film, but added to it. Jenkins and the writers purposely left holes in the movie to add to the artistic build up. There are large gaps of information between the stages of Chiron's life where the audience have to fill in the gap with context clues or imagination, but it made the film very enjoyable. Like Call Me By Your Name, Moonlight ends with a very realistic approach. The writers did not create a fairy tail ending where Black is suddenly an upstanding contributor to society and living a happy life with Kevin as his partner, they made Black become the person he did not think he would be and his relationship with Kevin vague. Jenkins took a strong story and made it stronger with the specific camera and lighting quirks he chose. Moonlight's plot is not completely new in this generation, but it is one of the most moving, and well directed films of this genre."
MOONLIGHT,26 September 2018,8/10,"Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a wonderful film about life and how hard it truly can be. It was somber and sad but very realistic to what you would expect in the setting we are brought into. The film rings the audience through the three main stages of life by showing us those stages in Chiron, an African-American gay man living in Miami. For this review, I'll do the same. Little The story of Chiron's early days is titled little and focuses more on the character of Juan than it does Chiron himself. What I liked about this section of the film was it really showed that even with the rough living conditions these people face, there are still good people. Story-wise, I believe this section to be my favorite of the three. The film-makers do a very good job of getting the audience to relate and care about the characters. The stand out character for this section was Juan and the story of how he came to really care for this little boy who he barely knew. The audience is able to connect with Juan on an emotional level and can feel what he does. The acting from Mahershala Ali created a bond with the audience and is able to bring them close to tears when he deals with the hardships he knows the boy is going through. The brief amount of time we are given with the character is enough to leave a lasting impression. Chiron The story picks back up when Chiron is in high school and while the section wasn't my favorite of the film it was beautiful in its own way. The stand out character was Chiron himself in this part and that is mainly caused by the brilliant cinematography. The film is able to tell a great story and show how much Chiron is struggling with very little dialogue. Of course the dialogue that is used is still powerful and helps further the sorrow you feel for the character. The film is great at showing that while Chiron does have people in his life who truly care about him, e.i. Terresa and to some extent Kevin, he is still broken because of the abuse he deals with at home and at school. The music in this section, as well as throughout the whole film, help set the tone of each scene and each moment and help get the viewer to feel the right way without them realizing what was happening. Along with this he visuals where beautiful in a subdued sort of way. They weren't elegant landscapes that you would see in other dramas, nor where they the bright and flashy frames you would get in comedies or action movies. They are dull and dark but fit so well with the story being told that they help the mood tremendously. The story told in this section leads up to the point in which Chiron finally breaks and can no longer take it and when he does, you, as the audience, fully understand. In some films, the actions taken don't make the most sense but with the buildup that this film has you totally understand and, even if it's not what you personally would have done, you get why it was done. Black For the final section, Chiron is older and is different. You are able to see that the final event that took place in the last section has changed him in a major way even though years of his life are missing from the film. The same visual style that is present in the first two sections are present here as well, with the long, drawn out close ups and focus on people's faces still used to capture this world. In this section, Kevin is the stand-out for me. The film is quickly able to show that Kevin is changed and that that event has affected him deeply as well. The kid Kevin was shown to be in the previous parts of the film was gone and replaced with a man who cares if he has a life and a future. He has a job and a son that he is happy with and has more or less left behind the life that Chiron is still majorly a part of. This Section stood out to me because of the dialogue more than anything else. Chiron has changed to fit the world that he was raised to fit into and two of those people who raised his have left it behind. The interaction between him and his mother is so moving in such a sad way because you can see for pretty much the first time that even with her mistakes and poor life choices that she does love him and has such regret for her past sins. Along with this, Kevin's talk with him, though it was more heavily Kevin who spoke, was inherently sad. It showed that he has grown to accept his life and he loves his son but he has regrets and things in his past he would change if he could. Overall, the film was amazing and so real. This story could very well be a true story of a kid right now, anywhere in the country and I believe that the realism of this is what makes it so good. There are no big flashy fights or anything very spectacular about the events in the plot. It's ordinary and sad and that's what makes it a great film."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,9/10,"I find that Moonlight is a really interesting way of approaching the concept of a coming of age story. The composition of the movie was very surprising in the sense that many of the major events in the main character's life was off-screen and would be recapped and minimized in the next act. I feel like it also kind of shows how Chiron dealt with his issues as he was growing up. Whenever there was a major point in the film like Juan's death, it was off the screen and it seems like Chiron was affected by what happened but chooses to not think about it. This can be represented by how they skipped past the visuals of that happening. Also by cutting out visuals for the viewer, we are able to focus more on how those events affected Chiron more so than what those events looked like and how it happened. It opens up the imagination when one chooses to think about the possibilities or how to visualize what was described of the event. This can make a stronger impact than if the director chose to show everything. I think it is a nice two-way street in asking why so many major moments that affected the dynamic of Chiron. The lack of visual knowledge allows for fluid views of the events.
 I feel as though it is also important to notice why the film chose to place in the intervals of the acts. In the end, I feel like it keeps the story somewhat open to interpretation and very flexible in what you want the main reflection to be. I feel like with how the movie ends with the boy in blue light, it shows that in the end, Chiron (Black) was able to obtain peace. The blue light really emphasized this idea for me since color was playing such an important role in the film with blue representing something more calm and peaceful and free whereas the red lights would represent the stress and the hatred and terror in Chiron's life. It makes the end feel like things were okay even though his whole mess of a storyline he had to deal with was there. Back to the idea with how the film used transitions and purposefully left things out, I feel like because it makes the audience see more of the result of the cause in Chiron's life than the causes themselves, the causes seem a lot smaller than they usually can be (like someone dying), and with the blue light and how Chiron was feeling at the end, it makes us also want to think that all those issues that caused the dynamic changes in his life didn't really matter to him either, or at the very least, he felt like he was at peace with how he came to grow up.
 In conclusion, I found Moonlight to be a nice film that makes my heart want to break, but is saved by a bit of hope and openness of the film. Chiron's coming of age story is one that we usually don't see much of, being that he is a presumably gay, black male who grew up being bullied for his sexuality. His life was filled with just pain and suffering, but in spite of everything that was thrown in his way, we can be assured at the very least that as an adult, he found some peace in his life with some thanks to his friend/lover, and the colors of blue representing something of calm and happiness tinting his younger image at the very end when everything seemed so calm and quiet."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,7/10,"The movie Moonlight, directed by Barry Jenkins, is simply a ""coming of age"" story. However, instead of dealing with typical teenage drama and angst, it develops deeper topics such as drug culture, sexuality, and growing up in a low economic environment. The film follows the main character, Chiron, throughout three main stages in his life. His mother Paula was unable to provide him with the love and support he needed when he was growing up, so he seeked this elsewhere. In film, there are elements that are more heavily influential than others. Some evident elements used in this film are audio, color, and costume design. In this review, I'm going to focus on some specific color aspects of this film. Color is a medium used by artists mainly to depict the mood of the characters or scene. In Moonlight, the color element is very accessible to the audience, but when looked at in a more complex way, it is very metaphorical. While the colors help develop an aesthetic that is pleasing and satisfying to watch, it is a gateway to a deeper understanding of the relationships within the film. The colors do not always have to be obvious, in fact, they have more of an impact when it is subtle and incorporated within the shots. This movie has a strong balance of mixing styles to display how significant color is in the background of the shots, clothing, and quick cuts of color that are more obvious than others. The most obvious colors that are used in this film are red and black. Red is usually associated with the words anger and love. On the other hand, black is usually associated with mystery and rebellion. These moods are displayed through color in different parts of the film.The color red is shown as Chiron's external conflicts in this film. The color is very identifiable with negative influences in his life. A major one being his mother. In the beginning, when Chiron is being bullied by the other boys, Paula is quick to understand the other boys' motives. From a young age, Paula makes the assumption that her son is gay, which is correct, and makes it known to others that this makes him an easy target; Paula does not make a strong effort to support her son in this journey. Chiron is already judged and bullied for his sexuality before he is fully understanding of himself. In scenes where he is with his mother in a negative light the color red is heavily influenced. On the surface, Paula is aggressive and bitter towards her son on issues revolving around sexuality. Most parents, when discovering this information about their kids, act out in aggression because they are worried about how the world will treat them simply because they are different. Eventually, we learn that all Paula wanted for her son was love but she could not give it to him because of her mental state and her heavy use of drugs. The combination of these emotions can be directly translated to the color red. Another source of external conflict that Chiron deals with in high school is the continuation of bullying. In the first scene of the teenage stage of Chiron, we see him in a classroom. He is obviously lost in his own world but quickly gets drawn back into reality when he is being called derogatory names by a peer, Terrell. These characters have constant conflicts as Terrell is an instigator in Chiron's life. In this scene, Terrell is wearing a red sweatshirt, which is a very obvious choice made by the costume designer as the previous scene is of Chiron's mother yelling at him with a red shirt on as well. This specific color choice shows that these two characters are important external conflicts in Chiron's life. The color black is used in a similar metaphorical way and in a very literal way. One of Chiron's nicknames growing up is ""Black"", which he eventually keeps and makes it his own in the final chapter in his life shown in the film. His car, clothing, and personality are all black. It's very obvious that he has significant character development towards the end of Moonlight. As he gets older, he starts to get involved in the drug culture that he was constantly surrounded with growing up. His personality becomes darker and he becomes more unapproachable and distant. The color black, as mentioned previously, represents mystery. Chiron is haunted by his unfortunate childhood and it slowly begins to transform him into a darker person. When he visits an old friend, Kevin, he is so different that Kevin does not recognize him until they make eye contact, which signifies that there is still aspects of his old self inside. In this scene, Kevin is shown wearing white, the opposite of black, showing a clear difference between his new life and his old. The use of the color black is symbolic because it shows the viewer how drastically different Chiron or ""Black"" is in this part of his life. The utilization of color in this film helps develop a clear and concise message and atmosphere that is displayed through different forms. The color palette could be seen as just another aspect of this movie, however, when analyzed it is known that the colors are there for obvious reasons. The interpretation of the colors used in the film can be different for everyone, although this is how I understood it to be seen."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,7/10,"The film Moonlight uses the passage of time as its main vehicle to show us three different points of the life of a Miami black man named Chiron. The director, Barry Jenkins, uses these windows in time, these snapshots, to give us glimpses of difficult yet defining times throughout Chiron's life. The movie opens with a conflict, Chiron being chased by other kids, which establishes that this is not the first time that Chiron has been given the short end of the social stick. It's established that Chiron is different very early on in the film and that he is lacking guidance in his life. During this first part, a good amount of information about who Chiron is and what he is like is conveyed not through speech but through lack of it. Chiron tends to go silent when faced with a difficult or revealing question and that is when the audience knows that there's something there; this ends up being a constant tell for Chiron throughout the movie. Chiron's lack of communication is then in and of itself an even louder form of communication where it otherwise wouldn't be. During scenes where not much is verbally said but leagues are said non-verbally, there is usually music to accompany it. Music is a central element used in this film to convey what the characters on screen are thinking and feeling at that time. Towards the end of the film, a song is what prompts one character to reach out to another thus kicking off the last few scenes. The sound in the film (other than music) is designed in such a way that it doesn't overstay its welcome and accentuates what is being visually presented to the viewer. It generally presents itself from the perspective of the character that is currently the focus of the scene. It's not just what is heard but what is also not heard; the lack of sound where it should be is also used to highlight different emotions. When a scene is played back again later, but the sound changes, it reflects how that scene is remembered and how Chiron is either accepting or altering how he feels about it. The sound comes in and out of focus during times like this and so does the image. Characters are moved in and out of focus in relation to whom the scene is revolving around and how they are feeling about them. The camera appears to be mostly handheld as it is never stationary for too long. The frame is always moving ever so slightly which gives it more of an ""alive"" feeling to it. There are very few times where the moving camera doesn't re-focus on the characters in the scene and whether that's intentional I cannot say. The lighting also revolves around how the camera moves, where characters who were once lit up fade away. When it comes to light and color, the color blue is used many times throughout the film. Starting when Chiron first discovers his affinity for the ocean and the story that Juan tells after swimming, blue (a naturally calming color) is used to highlight the more intimate and personal scenes throughout the movie. It reappears during the scene on the beach where Chiron and his friend Kevin find out more about themselves and their emotions and once again during a reunion at the end of the film. Ultimately I couldn't connect with the characters in the film, none touched me on a personal or emotional level, but the film itself is well done in all aspects - sight, sound, and script."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,8/10,"In the movie ""Moonlight"", Barry Jenkins creates a masterpiece of a movie that is about a black, gay main character named Chiron who grew up poor. The movie includes many scenes of drug abuse, violence in schools, bullying, and mass incarceration. It shows the journey of Chiron growing up with a drug addict of a mom and is basically raised by a drug dealer, Juan, and the experiences he has with Juan. A beautiful scene with Juan and Chiron is when Juan teaches the child version of Chiron to swim. Initially, Juan finds Chiron in a drug house hiding from school bullies after they chased him with the intention of beating him up. This is where Juan takes Chiron in and starts acting like the father figure in Chiron's life. Growing up as a child, Chiron was always treated different and he questioned why this was. In the film you can see his is different, he is the smallest boy, this gives him his nickname ""Little"" and is also different than the boys in other ways also. As we see Chiron grow up as the movie goes on you begin to see the difference between Chiron and others even more. He struggles trying to fit in while trying to figure out the connection and balancing the schoolyard homophobia of his friends and the questioning of his sexuality. The relationship gets worse with his mother as he gets older and she becomes even more of a drug addict. Chiron becomes even more dependent on Juan and his girlfriend Teresa also with Juan being his father figure and Teresa being a kind of domestic stability for him, a person who he can easily talk to, provide him meals, and a place he can sleep. In the movie you can see how it is about dignity, beauty, and vulnerability of black people. As you watch carefully, you realize the absence of white people throughout the whole movie. This story almost insists that the poor and oppressed are applied to specific people. You can also see the conflict with Juan between raising and caring for Chiron versus his business. Juan cares for Chiron and wants him to be taken care of especially by his drug addict of a mom, but at the same time he is the one supplying her with the drugs. There is a scene where Juan confronts his mother and expresses that he needs to be cared for and she responds by asking if he is going to stop selling drugs to her and is he going to raise Chiron. He sees a conflict here because he doesn't want to do both. Throughout the film many camera angles can be seen and these really make you feel like you are watching over everything or standing there observing. At a point in the movie we think Chiron is happy as he connects with a schoolmate named Kevin. There is a twist in the story as Kevin betrays Chiron and takes the side of his peer and beats him up. Another twist in the story is seen between two chapter of the story Juan dying, but this twist is only mentioned in passing by Teresa. The end of the story is done quite beautifully with the scenes of older Kevin and Chiron. After everything with betrayal and prison sentences served they still have a connection and are still friends or from what we can see maybe a little more than friends. It is also ironic how Chiron ends up being a dealer like Chiron especially after everything that he had been through with his mother. Chiron at the end of the movie finally sees himself and knows who he is."
MOONLIGHT,27 September 2018,10/10,"Moonlight follows Chiron and his best friend Kevin as they go from young children, to teens, to adults, and focuses on Chiron coming into his own personality and sexuality. The film is staged in to three sections, one section following Chiron as a child, one section following Chiron as a teenager, and one section following Chiron as an adult. In some form, all three stages begin in medias res. As a child, when the movie first introduces Chiron, he is fleeing from bullies. As a teen, the movie has already passed the death of a major character, Juan. As an adult, Chiron has already become a hardened drug dealer, and must confront his mother. The movie skips over several major elements such as Juan's death and Chiron's transition into adulthood, scenes that most other movies would have spent ample time on, to focus instead on some more intimate, emotional scenes with Chiron. Much of the movie is viewed from a subjective point of view. Many of the shots are close up, and characters often take up large portions of the screen. The camera is very frequently in motion, shaky, even. The handheld camera gives the audience a feeling of closeness with the characters on the screen, a feeling made important by the subject matter of the film.
A great example of the amazing camera work can be found early on in the screenplay, in the first act. Moonlight employs a low angle shot during the scene in which Juan teaches Chiron how to float, and then swim. The angle is low enough that for the duration of the scene, the waves of water frequently splash onto the camera lens, obscuring large sections of the screen. The shot gives the audience the feeling they are standing in the water themselves, almost submerged in it. The feeling must be extremely similar to the feeling Chiron is experiencing, as he learns to swim for the first time. Shots like this, that connect the viewer to Chiron on an emotional level, are a great part of what makes Moonlight so phenomenal.
Shortly after Juan teaches Chiron to swim, there is a scene in which Juan relates a story from his childhood. The basic gist of the story goes that Juan used to run around in the late night, and was told the moonlight makes a black man's skin look blue. Moonlight, deriving its name from the scene, makes very heavy use of bright, neon lighting. Many scenes are shot in a bright blue glow, or a bright red or pink glow.
The first act contains a notable shot using a the technique; the scene in which Chiron's mother screams at him after he returns home late in the night. The scene, which is silent until revisted via flashback in the third act, views Chiron in a bright white light, and Chiron's mother in a bright red light. In fact, in the first act, any scene depicting Chiron's mother disappearing into her room shows a bright red glow emanating from the room. The glow is used in this instance to give an antagonistic feeling to the room and to Chiron's mother herself. While Chiron's mother becomes a more sympathetic character later in the movie, in the early scenes this light reflects how Chiron feels about her, and so the feeling is relayed to the audience. Also notable would be that this scene is one of the few scenes in the movie shot with a rigid, non moving camera. Barry Jenkins employs small techniques like this constantly to try and draw the audience into relating with Chiron's feelings."
MOONLIGHT,17 May 2020,1/10,"Slow , boring and unintelligible dialogue.
Why did I ever believe the ratings.
Diabolical script, and dialogue.
This is a film to avoid like the plague, there is no plot, no interesting performance's it is just lack luster all the way"
MOONLIGHT,16 January 2019,10/10,"Moonlight is one of the BEST films I have ever seen in my entire life. The story follows Chiron's life in a three part structure. It deals with themes such as love, identity, sexuality, masculinity, and many others. The cinematography is impeccable and every actor does a wonderful job at portraying there roles. One thing that I loved about the film is that the actors do such a great job at portraying there deepest emotions through just facial expressions. It's all in the face. It is truly such a wonderfully written story that is wonderfully translated to the screen. I have watched this movie so many times now and everytime I notice something different. It has had a lasting effect on my heart. It's definitely worthy of all of the accolades it has received. Watching this movie will change your life. Go check it out!!!!!!!!!!!"
MOONLIGHT,5 January 2017,2/10,"If you love long drawn-out scenes with no dialogue, trite characters, and around an hour too long, then this is the film for you. The main character lives with a junkie mom, yet always appears bandbox fresh?The main character, is habitually, and is known for speaking slowly, or not at all! and with few words when he does. Slow doesn't begin to cover the tediousness of this habit on screen. This is just one more message film beating one over the head... okay we get it!Artistic? No way! Pretentious as hell."
MOONLIGHT,30 April 2020,10/10,"I will definitely review this film in depth laterally , but the fact that this has a lower rating on here than an Oscar Bait white washed mediocre film like Green Book is absolutely ridiculous."
MOONLIGHT,27 February 2019,10/10,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't get enough of this film it is everything I want out of this art form. It's a heartbreaking film with so much depth and complexity. I went into this film only seeing the ratings it's gotten and nothing else. I didn't know anything about this going in and as you watch it and see this story of real, tragic people, unfold, your heart will melt. This movie should be watched with any prior knowledge, in my opinion. If you have not watched this yet please go into it blind. Film should be enjoyed as art and entertainment. Some might find this boring, but for anyone studying film, this is a MUST-see. I can't express my love for this film there's not enough time or words and I do not want to go into spoilers because we'd be here all day. Everything has a purpose in this film and I love it. I recommend everyone to see this film and give it a chance it's a true masterpiece and I love it to death."
