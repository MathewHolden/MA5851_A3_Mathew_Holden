MANK,24 July 2021,7/10,"""Mank"" is a film that seems as if it was never intended to be seen by most of the public. And, while most film critics and the Oscars loved the movie, the average person would have doubtless left the theater (or Netflix) completely confused. After all, to really appreciate the film and follow it, you need to know who folks like Irving Thalberg, William Randolph Hearts and many of Herman Mankiewiecz's contemporaries. I do, mostly because I am a retired history teacher and old film nut...but I am also not the average person. For them, I really feel sorry, as the film bounces back and forth in time and involves all sorts of people long dead....and soon to be forgotten.*The story is a semi-fictionalized biography of Herman Mankiewiecz and it centers on how he wrote ""Citizen Kane"". The problem is that the movie goes on the assumption that he pretty much completely wrote the script and based it upon his contact with Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies. While this is true...it's partially true according to most sources. The contributions of John Houseman and, especially, Orson Welles, are almost completely ignored by the film. So, my advice is don't take the film as the gospel truth...though I do appreciate how the film also manages, at least a bit, to show that Marion Davies was NOT the talentless idiot she was shown to be in ""Citizen Kane""...something that just seemed cruel from that screenplay.Overall, I found the film fascinating and with some excellent performances. But it's also not a film that I loved...mostly because it seemed to have an agenda...one that was more important that giving the entire truth.*This film is full of inside jokes and cleverness that completely passes over the heads of most viewers and that annoyed me a bit. For example, when talking about the author Upton Sinclair, one comment made was that someone was so dumb that they thought he wrote ""Elmer Gantry""...a book, incidentally, that was written by Sinclair Lewis (though they never explained this confusion nor why it is easy to make for most people). This just seemed awfully elitist."
MANK,15 April 2021,5/10,"I agree with those who feel cheated because this film lacks the effort to show us the personalities of those who made movies in the golden days. Mankiewicz is so random and so troubled that I couldn't get a real direction. From word one I had trouble feeling any sympathy for this man. Gary Oldman is startlingly good, but the direction and writing put him on the stage alone. I would love to have gotten to know a bit more about the other characters from Thalberg to Hearst. I really looked forward to seeing this and sadly will not watch it agaain."
MANK,5 July 2021,4/10,"""Mank"" is an American mostly English-language movie that premiered back in 2020 and now finally reached movie theaters here as well and it was a long and hard road to watcht his one I can only say without wanting to go any further into detail. The outcome was unfortunately not as satisfactory as I would have liked it to be. I got mostly curious about it because this film was one of the biggest players this recent awards season and took home two Oscars as well. The one for its production design was expected by many, but the trophy for its cinematography came as a bit of a surprise because Nomadland dominated the awards season until that point in this category. I think the visual aspects are probably among the film's biggest strengths, so I am not entirely against these nominations. However, there are many nominations that I cannot really be supportive of. Most of all, Best Picture. This was not only not one of the best eight films of the year, but not one of the best 80 films either, maybe even 800 if we count international releases there too. Fincher's nomination is a bit baffling too. He has directed many films over the course of his career that are far greater achievements and have not really received a lot of praise. Admittedly his nomination is still more understandable than Amanda Seyfried's. I even like the actress, but her turn here has nothing to it that deserves awards recognition. Her hair was kinda nice. With Gary Oldman, you could say that he deserves it more, but I am not sure either. I mean it was almost painful really how this movie felt like nothing but a vehicle to propel his awards ambitions and with the nomination, you can say again that they were tricked. One baity moment after the next, but nothing really fit as a story overall. On a more interesting note, you can say that Fincher collaborated with Reznor and Ross once again and once again they were nominated for an Oscar and even won the category for another movie. And finally, the screenplay came from Fincher's dad Jack, over 15 years after the man died and he wrote it many decades ago. So this was really a posthumous Oscar nomination as late as it gets and it is something unique to a film that does not feel unique at all otherwise.This movie runs for comfortably over two hours and I did feel it dragged here and there. I am generally a sucker for black-and-white films, but the outcome here could also not make me overlook the weaknesses in storytelling. Perhaps Fincher should have gone 100% with his father's script, even if it was a family affair for him, but tried to get in some structure here. Either himself or with a better screen writer like Sorkin with whom he collaborated on The Social Network for example. One key issue here for me was the constant back-and-forth honestly. This is to some extent subjective because I prefer chronological movies, but not entirely. The scenes were just really brief and then we jumped a few years forward or back again and it was just truly confusing. The ending then actually also being the chronological ending again with the Oscar win for Citizen Kane with neither Wells not Mank present was fine, but I think that it also tricked many people into forgetting all the mediocrity before that. The final words from Mank when asked about Wells were decent again. Same applies about the mouth trap reference we read on the screen, a direct quote by Mankiewicz. This felt much smarter and interesting then the organ grinder's monkey reference that they wanted to turn into a big thing here. It did not work out at all. Another issue this film had that it was just trying to make too much of an impact in terms of dramatic scenes. Take one character's (alleged) death that we find out about in a letter. Take one character's suicide that could be seen coming (with the bullets being handed to Mank. I mean come on, he was supposed to be smarter than that.) and was supposed to be an emotional highlight (in a sad way), but felt like none of that. These characters or their loved ones needed better explanation and elaboration simply to make an impact. It felt fairly clumsy and rushed in instead.The good moment were fairly rare. Some of the dialogue writing was okay, but often it also felt rather fake and staged in a way where you would think that these characters were not talking like that, also not many, many decades ago. One female character's remark about how another character likes Mank in the first half was still among the better references, but even there the film was as always walking the fine line between quality dialogues and forced and exaggerated dialogues. Pity. One ot (too) many weaknesses. The alcoholism idea was also treated in a strange manner with how turning Mank into a poor man's Schindler who saved an entire village of German jews all of a sudden (maybe therefore the b&w approach? Even more desperate then) justifies giving him some liquor or so? Extremely strange. In general this inclusion felt once again a desperate approach to give the film additional relevance. They really went all by the books at times here, also when they tried to fuel Oldman's Oscar ambitions with this spectacular drunk speech towards the end that has everybody leave the table. It did not feel authentic at all. I am not even sure if Oldman is to blame there or the writing, but to me it was highly over-the-top and sometimes less can be more. Also I must definitely mention the political component. Already did a bit with this being set during the times of Nazi Germany and one statement from a character about Hitler and how he will disappear quickly felt like something really scripted too. Have seen that many times before and usually better. But the key problem with politics is how they tried to have this film appeal to the masses and liberal Hollywood these days. How Mank shakes his head at conservative Repiblicans from the countryside and of course we are supposed to see how wrong they are and how right he is at the same time. And how it is an embarrassment when the Republican candidate wins this important election and how his supporter are boastful and gloating and disrespectful. It was highly embarrassing to witness honestly. Those where the moments when this film really hit rock bottom.Okay, I think by now you understood already that I did not like the outcome here particularly. I think the film struggled mostly during these moments when it tried to truly make an impact. Having another character say that Mank just wrote his best piece ever and how controversial he is also gave me goosebumps, but not in a positive way. The moments and scenes I liked did not happen too often. The inclusion of the Internationale was nice on one occasion on the piano, but I am biased there as well because I simply like the tune. I also enjoyed Orson Welles and it would have been great if he could have been included more often, not just on the phone early on and in the end with the direct confrontation. Maybe the actor did not look 24, but he was fine, brought nice energy to the movie and it would have been nice to see more from him, especially as with the Oscar then in the end, Citizen Kane is really at the center of this movie and it did not feel like that at all. Or also the issue of Mank wanting credit for his work could really have been the vital ingredient of it all, but instead it felt once again rushed in for the sake of it near the end and again they messed up. I do not expect the general public to rate this film as low as I did, but I still find it nice to see the 6 on the left side of the comma here. It did feel like a very pseudo important film to me and I think I only mildly enjoyed it at times because before that, I had not been to movie theaters for many months. So with my usual rhythm, I probably would have disliked it even more maybe. Difficult to say more positive things here. Lily Collins is of course a stunner, there is no denying, even if maybe the lack of color took a bit away from her beauty. But also acting-wise she was not worse than Seyfried for example, just two very different characters. But I do not mean with that that she was awards-worthy. Only that neither were. What else? Charles Dance was wasted. Monika Gossmann was an interesting inclusion here because she is from my country and is not even remotely famous here. Okay, I guess that is it then. This film only deserves to be seen for visual aspects, cinematography, sets, costumes too and maybe also for the music to some extent. But plot, performances and story in general come really short on the quality scale. The tortured genius aspect here has been done a hundred times better in other movies as well. Thumbs-down. Skip the watch this time."
MANK,20 February 2021,3/10,"RKO 281 is a fine movie about the making of Citizen Kane.Mank is a mischievous movie about the co writer of Citizen Kane, Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman.)In recent years the authorship of Citizen Kane has been disputed. With some claiming that Orson Welles did not write any of it and Mankiewicz's contribution to the movie overlooked.Well not that overlooked. Citizen Kane only won one Oscar and that was for best screenplay. So Welles and Mankiewicz did not come away empty handed. The same cannot be said for Greg Toland for the cinematography or Robert Wise for the editing.The authorship dispute has been debunked decades ago by more neutral parties. It is as if some Welles haters like to ignore that Welles was more heavily involved in Citizen Kane. He did direct and star in it. He bought some innovative techniques to the movie along with his collaborators such as Toland.The reason why Mank is mischievous is that director David Fincher films it in the style of Citizen Kane.It has two timelines. One with the writing of the screenplay of Citizen Kane on the behest of Welles. The other are flashbacks. Where the sozzled embittered Mankiewicz dealt with the powerful people in the media industry and how they mixed with political figures.He comes into contact with the big lions roaming the jungle such as the predatory head of MGM Louis B Mayer (Arliss Howard.) Sinister press magnate William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and renowned producer Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley.)Mank is a messy film though. It is inert dull and long winded. David Fincher has taken a screenplay that his late father wrote some decades ago.David Fincher has decided to honour his father and gone for Oscar bait. You can tell as its filmed in black and white, hoping to follow in the footsteps of The Artist and Roma. Unfortunately the script is not very good.The other problem are that a few of the main actors are too old for their roles. Tom Burke who is nearly 40 is playing the baby faced Welles who was 26 when Citizen Kane was released. When I first saw Burke as Welles in this movie. I thought he stepped out of the set of F for Fake.Although Gary Oldman's performance has been lauded. He is a 63 year old playing someone in his 30s and early 40s. I doubt all that hard drinking aged Mankiewicz so much."
MANK,9 December 2020,10/10,"Citizen Kane ... if you are a movie lover you at least have heard of this movie. You may not have seen it yet, which is ok, there is time to do that, don't worry - and it makes sense to do just that, before you watch the movie. There is also a different movie that shines a light on the making of Citizen Kane - RKO 281. Also a very fine movie ... but david Fincher really outdid himself. Ok so this is not brutal or anything close to some of his other efforts ... but it is a love letter, not just to Kane and Welles ... but movies from days gone past.Technically you cannot fault the movie in any sense. Story wise you may have issues following this or even feel a certain degree of empathy. Gary Oldman is a powerhouse in this one and it is all about the Mank. So don't expect a lot of Welles in this. Now the movie and Fincher probably take a lot of liberties when it comes to how events unfolded.Performances overall are great, the rapid paced dialog and many homages to the era and Kane are there for everyone to see. Be it low angles, set ups and other stuff you may recognize or that may feel familiar from past days. There is something fresh about going way old school with this. Even sound wise.Fincher is a perfectionist, in case you didn't know or forgot ... this is an amazing movie. And while it is not necessary to be familiar with everything surrounding the movie Citizen Kane, having some knowledge of it and the background will help you enjoy this a lot! Maybe not as engaging as some would have wished this to be, but witty and original and fresh by way of the past ..."
MANK,16 February 2021,9/10,"Would it be inappropriate to state that this film is almost as good as ""Citizen Kane""? I'm exaggerating a little bit, but I did think it was very good. The 1930's ambience in all respects is exceptionally well done - fashion, vehicles, and the preponderance of studio names and celebrities, particularly the noted directors and producers of the era. Though the story line has to do with the writing of the celebrated movie by Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), the film doesn't dwell on it so much as mention it now and again when it's brought to the screenwriter's attention that the time frame for completion is about due. There seems to be more effort expended on the understated conflict between Hollywood's embrace of capitalism and the writings of socialist Upton Sinclair and his run for California governor in 1934 against Republican Frank Merriam, both of whom are not characters in the actual picture. That context offers to remind the viewer that today's political climate is nothing new and has been a decades long battle in this country. Fans of ""Citizen Kane"" will know that the principal character in 'Kane' is based on businessman and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance), and multiple nods in this movie are present to remind one of Xanadu with it's menagerie of zoo animals, and the infamous 'Rosebud' sled at the conclusion of that picture. Oldman is great as Mank, even as his character comes under the influence of alcohol affecting his numerous and lengthy diatribes, while the supporting cast performs credibly to spark his talented, though scathing wit. And if you needed anything else to recommend the movie, particularly for those of us who love old time Hollywood, the format is done in glorious black and white to evoke memories of a time gone by. I don't think it's a stretch to consider that the picture will earn it's share of award nominations during this year's extended Academy season, and just might capture an award or two."
MANK,22 March 2021,7/10,"Even a global pandemic like COVID-19 was not going to stop Awards Season, and when the nominations for the Academy Awards were announced, this was the film that received the most, and I was looking forward to it, directed by Oscar and Golden Globe nominated David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network, Gone Girl). Basically, in 1940, twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles (Tom Burke) is given complete creative freedom for his next project by RKO. Welles recruits scathing social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gary Oldman) for the screenplay. Herman, known to his friends as ""Mank"", is in Victorville, California recovering from a broken leg following a car accident. Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander (Lily Collins, Phil's daughter), who notices similarities between the main character and William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance). Producer John Houseman (Sam Troughton, Patrick's grandson) is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Joseph ""Joe"" Mankiewicz, Herman's brother (Tom Pelphrey) worries that it may anger the Hearst, the powerful businessman, newspaper publisher, and politician. In 1930, Herman visits an MGM location where he and the female lead, Marion Davies (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Amanda Seyfried), recognise each other. She introduces him to Hearst, her benefactor and lover, who takes a liking to Herman. In 1933, Herman and his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton) attend the birthday party for film producer and co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios (MGM) Louis B. Mayer (Full Metal Jacket's Arliss Howard) at Hearst Castle with many Hollywood celebrities. They discuss the rise of Nazi Germany and the upcoming state governor election, in particular candidate Upton Sinclair (Bill Nye). Herman and Marion go for a walk, where they bond over discussions on politics and the film industry. In 1940, Houseman is getting impatient with Herman's lack of progress. Rita is also concerned with the timing of the writing, as well as Herman's alcoholism. Herman eventually finishes the screenplay in time. Houseman is impressed but reminds Herman that he will receive no credit for his work. In 1934, Herman and Joseph begin working at MGM under Mayer. Studio executives, including Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley), actively work against Sinclair's electoral campaign. The studio produces propaganda films for a smear campaign, funded by Hearst, against Sinclair. Herman approaches Marion to get the films pulled but is unsuccessful as she has already left the studio for Warner Brothers. Herman and Sara later go to the Trocadero Nightclub for a party to watch the election night, where Mayer announces the winner, Frank Merriam. Herman's colleague, director Shelly Metcalf (Jamie McShane) is ridden with guilt over his role in the smear campaign, despite personally supporting Sinclair. Then, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Metcalf commits suicide by gunshot. In 1940, Charles Lederer (Joseph Cross) picks up the screenplay from Herman to deliver to the studio. Joe visits Herman after reading the screenplay and warns him of Hearst's reaction and how it might affect Marion. However, he does believe that it's the finest screenplay Herman has ever written. Marion also visits and tries to persuade Herman to change the screenplay but to no avail. She tells Herman she will try to stop the picture from getting made. In 1937, Herman crashes a party at Hearst Castle, where he drunkenly pitches the idea for the film that he will go on to write in 1940, offending everyone present including Hearst, Mayer, and Marion. Mayer is enraged and reveals that Herman is on Hearst's payroll and calls him a court jester. Hearst tells him an allegory about a monkey and an organ grinder and sees him out. In 1940, despite pressure from Hearst, Welles is determined to make the film, Citizen Kane, and intends to do a re-write without Herman. He visits Herman and offers him a buyout from the studio. However, renouncing the terms of his contract, Herman requests credit for the script, declaring it his greatest work. Welles is upset and tells Herman that he has supported him, before leaving angrily. Herman ultimately receives joint credit with Welles, and the two win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Citizen Kane two years later. Also starring Monika Gossmann as Fraulein Freda, Toby Leonard Moore as David O. Selznick, Jack Romano as Sid Perelman, Adam Shapiro as George S. Kaufman, John Churchill as Charles MacArthur, Jeff Harms as Ben Hecht, Derek Petropolis as Eddie Cantor, Paul Fox as Joe Von Sternberg, Tom Simmons as Doctor, Jessie Cohen as Norma Shearer Thalberg, Craig Welzbacher as Rexford Tugwell, Craig Robert Young as Charlie Chaplin, Scarlet Cummings and Grace Kennedy-Piehl as Bette Davis, Isabel Dresden as Carole Lombard, Emily Joy Lemus as Billie Dove, Joanne Thomson as Geraldine Fitzgerald, Michelle Twarowska as Joan Crawford, and Trevor Wooldridge as Darryl F. Zanuck. Oldman plays the drunken Mankiewicz struggling with the famous screenplay perfectly, Seyfried is luminous as the actress who is his close friend (the real Davies is apparently the inspiration for the name ""Rosebud""), and there is marvellous support from Dance, Burke, Howard, and others as recognisable Hollywood names. It is an interesting mix of the story of what many consider to be the greatest film ever made, and a celebration of classic cinema. The film was shot in black-and-white using RED cameras, giving the picture and sound quality a feel of something you may have seen from the 1930s or 1940s, with clever back-and-forth storytelling (text onscreen is both clever and helpful), great cinematography, superb costume and makeup period detail, and a brilliantly period-authentic score. Ignoring the political subplot, it is one of those films that really captures the subject matter and makes you feel like you're watching something from the old days, a terrific biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Production Design, and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Sound, Best Original Score for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Costume Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Original Score, Best Original Screenplay for Jack Fincher (David's father, posthumously), Best Costume Design, Best Cinematography, and Best Make Up & Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Score. Very good!"
MANK,7 December 2020,6/10,"Though beautifully photographed and evocative of the 1930s and 1940s, I had a tough time making it through ""Mank,"" the story of Herman J. Mankiewicz during his time writing the screenplay for Citizen Kane. That is a whole other movie and a huge controversy, so I won't go into it.Boring, self-conscious, inaccurate, there are a few acting kudos - Gary Oldman as Mankiewicz is remarkable. I love Lily Collins, and she doesn't disappoint here as Mank's secretary. Tom Burke makes a marvelous Welles.There is other good acting to be had in Mank, but there is also very self-conscious, let's pretend we're in the 1930s and '40s dialogue and acting. It all seemed very put on. That was mostly from minor characters.I loved the character of Marion Davies - her character is sympathetic - but I could have done without Amanda Seyfried's bad acting. Charles Dance was a fabulous Hearst.All in all, a big bore. However, if it inspires you to read more about Mankiewicz, the fight over the Citizen Kane screenplay, and old Hollywood, I recommend it. The governor's race between Merriman and Upton Sinclair is interesting, too - though it was just thrown into this story, possibly becaused the political discussions seemed timely."
MANK,23 January 2021,,"There are so many characters, and they are poorly explained. I don't know who is who. They just keep taking all the time and I don't understand what is happening."
MANK,9 December 2020,7/10,"This features another quite impressive, powerful, performance from Gary Oldman as David Fincher uses his stylish and authentic portrayal of the borderline iconoclast Herman J. Mankiewicz to take us on a tour of Hollywood in the 1930s. It's told by way of flashback, as the bed-ridden Oldman is working on his screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"" and through his frequently drunken hazes we experience much of the politics, bigotry, misogyny, and pretty blatant corruption that prevailed in the upper echelons of the studio system as espoused by the likes of Louis B. Meyer (Arliss Howard); Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley) and most especially the king of the hill - WR Hearst (Charles Dance). The monochrome photography adds much to the rich look of the film, and Jack Fincher provided the star with some wonderfully eloquent (often wittily loquacious) monologues - particularly towards the end as his battle against the booze starts to become more of an effort for him to fight and his friends begin to redefine their relationship with him. I was less impressed with the supporting cast - Dance dressed like a circus ringmaster for much of the time and Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins struggled to make much of an impact, even though both roles are significant in the lives of Mankiewicz and Hearst respectively. It's a considered work, this - it doesn't dwell on the salaciousness of the scenarios; indeed it seems hell bent on avoiding dirtying it's hands with any of the concomitant scandal that accompanied the era, and that is quite odd. It robs the storyline of the oxygen of the underling politics and power-broking that created the ambience Mankiewicz so resented - even loathed. I saw it on the big screen about a day before Netflix rolled it out, and on balance I think a television viewing is all this needs. It's good - but not great."

MANK,15 December 2020,8/10,"If you know that the 's' in George S Kaufman stands for Simon chances are you'll recognise ninety, maybe even one hundred per cent of the references in Mank. If you like films about filmmaking you may not enjoy it as much as you were hoping you would. I've given this review a header Touch Of Evil and that, I feel, can be justified on several levels; the way Mank treated Hearst, in whose home he had often been a guest, the way Welles treated Mank, or ... fill in your own example."
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"1940. Film studio RKO hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies. For his first film he calls in washed up alcoholic Herman J Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is Citizen Kane and this is the story of how it was written.I was quite excited at the release of this movie. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films of all time and the making of it deserves a movie. And here we have it, directed by the great David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, Gone Girl, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) no less and with a good cast - Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Charles Dance, Lily Collins. Surely a recipe for a masterpiece?Unfortunately, no. On the plus side, the story is reasonably interesting and the cast put in solid performances. Fincher's direction is spot-on, with the black-and-white cinematography an homage to Citizen Kane.However, the plot is never very engaging. The story never really finds a centre and pretty much drifts along. It's not dull but has a listlessness to it nonetheless. The flashbacks, while adding information, don't help the momentum either, resulting in a start-stop feel to the main plot and a bit of confusion at times.The conclusion is also a damp squib and is disparaging to one of the greatest creative forces in the history of cinema. It smacks of trying to make a controversy out of nothing.Overall it's okay, but nothing more."
MANK,11 December 2020,6/10,"I should have loved ""Mank.""Set in the Hollywood of the 1930s and 40s, featuring a bunch of actors playing such cinematic icons as Orson Welles, Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg and the like, telling the story behind the writing of ""Citizen Kane,"" one of the most seminal movies in film history, shot in a film noirish style reminiscent of ""Kane"" itself.So then why does the whole thing land with such a thud?I don't know about Gary Oldman. I thought we was a good actor. Maybe he is. But he's just so hammy in everything he does lately. Outside of Hollywood movies, has there ever been an alcoholic who walks around stumbling drunk, slurring his words, and crashing dinner parties like John Barrymore on a bender? The alcoholics I have personally known (and I've known an alarming number) never actually get drunk, and in fact try as hard as they can to hide the fact that they're even drinking a lot. But this movie is just one scene after another of Oldman acting like someone's best guess of what a really drunk person would be like.The film is all about how amazing the screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"" was, which is true, and which is why it's ironic that the screenplay of ""Mank"" is the worst thing about it. It tries to recreate ""Kane's"" fragmented chronology, but while in ""Kane"" that trick was enigmatic, in ""Mank"" it's just messy. The problem with trying to literally emulate a classic film in style is that if your film isn't really good in its own right, all you do is remind people of how much better than your own movie the classic one is.The attempts to point out the political and cultural parallels between America in the mid-30s and America of today feel shoe-horned into the film. They may be true, but they're telegraphed with all the subtlety of a Broadway marquee.There were scenes I really liked, like one where Herman Mankiewicz and Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfreid) stroll around the grounds of Randolph William Hearst's estate, the one that inspired ""Citizen Kane's"" Xanadu; and other scenes that I really didn't like, like the one late in the film where Mank crashes one of Hearst's dinner parties and ends with him barfing on the floor. It goes on forever and served as the tipping point for my patience with the movie.There's enough professionalism and craft behind ""Mank"" to keep it from being outright bad, and anyone who's interested in the history of Hollywood will probably want to see it, but it's almost painful to think how much better it could have and should have been given its subject matter.Grade: B-"
MANK,11 December 2020,9/10,"... that being people who are really into film history, and quite a bit of obscure film history at that.The film tells the tale of screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz as he labors over the screenplay for Citizen Kane in a remote desert bungalow, attended to by more people than he would like. The structure of the film is much like Kane itself - you have a story set in the present explained by a series of flashbacks. And those flashbacks explain who Mankiewicz is now and why he is writing such a hit piece on William Randolph Hearst in the first place.This is something I would probably want to watch a second time because there are quite a few things coming at you fast and furious. In particular, there is a scene at Hearst' San Simeon where, besides the well identified Irving Thalberg and L.B. Mayer, according to the cast list there is Norma Shearer and Charlie Chaplin in the crowd - I think he is at the piano but I'd have to watch again.Why do I think so many people think this is just an average film? A lot of the flashbacks have to do with the 1934 California governor's race in which the Democratic candidate is socialist author Upton Sinclair and the Republican candidate seems to be Brand X. In a year when I think most Americans have had it with listening to politics, political ads, and political bickering of all stripes, this might not be something that very many people want to watch. I wasn't familiar with this episode in political history and thus I found it interesting.A couple of questions the film raised - Was John Houseman of ""Paper Chase"" fame really such a complete nuisance that Welles and Mank just wanted to smack him with a fly swatter? Also, I'm pretty familiar with Marion Davies' filmography. There was a scene where she was about to be burned to the stake in what appeared to be a western. I have no idea what film that was supposed to be.I highly recommend this film, but your mileage will probably vary."
MANK,3 December 2020,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Just a writer."" The line made me laugh. How many times have writers not received the recognition they deserved, or were underestimated, only to have their words create a lasting impact? Hollywood often likes to portray writers as socially-awkward, loner types who rarely contribute much during conversations. Not this time. The subject is Oscar winning screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz, who was as quick with a dinner table zinger as he was writing the script to CITIZEN KANE (1941) while bedridden.More than 20 years in the works, this is director David Fincher's first film since GONE GIRL (2014), and it's based on a screenplay written by his late father, Jack Fincher. Dad receives sole writing credit here, though David and producer Eric Roth (Oscar winner for FORREST GUMP, 1994) admit to some polishing. It's a film seemingly designed for us film nerds, but likely entertaining and interesting enough for expanded appeal. CITIZEN KANE is often regarded as the ""best"" movie of all-time, though the origin of the film is much debated. We do know that struggling RKO Pictures gave 24 year old wunderkind Orson Welles free reign over his first film, and the result was something quite special.Director Fincher's film offers up three distinct aspects here: a look at Mankiewicz's writing process for 'Kane', some background on Mankiewicz's career, and a somewhat fictionalized dissection of 1930s Hollywood politics.
Oscar winner Gary Oldman (DARKEST HOUR, 2017) stars as Herman J ""Mank"" Mankiewicz, an international correspondent-turned NYC cultural critic-turned playwright-turned screenwriter. Herman was the older brother of Joseph L Mankiewicz, a four time Oscar winning writer-director (ALL ABOUT EVE, 1950), and grandfather to Ben Mankiewicz, a well-known host of Turner Classic Movies. Herman was also renowned as a boozer and gambler, and in 1940 (where this movie begins), he was a bedridden mess recovering from a car accident. Herman was part of the sphere of the infamous Algonquin Round Table, and in most of this film, he talks like he's still at one of those gatherings.Mank is taken to a desolate ranch house in Victorville, California, along with his assistant Rita Alexander (Lily Collins), his nurse (Monika Gossman) and his handler John Houseman (Sam Troughton). Orson Welles (Tom Burke) has given Mank 60 days to finish the script, and his only guidance seems to be ""write what you know"", and don't drink. The result was a controversial, yet brilliant script that Welles and his crew (Oscar winning Cinematographer Gregg Toland, Editor Robert Wise, a 4-time Oscar winner) turned into a classic film that still holds up 80 years later.We immediately start seeing flashbacks, as noted by old style on-screen typing. Ten years prior, Mank was the Head Writer at Paramount, where his staff included Ben Hecht, George S Kaufman, and Charles Lederer ... writers whose work would later include NOTORIOUS (1946), multiple Marx Brothers movies, and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES (1953), respectively. Lederer was also the nephew of starlet Marion Davies (played here by Amanda Seyfried), who was the long time mistress of media mogul William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance). Are you starting to see how this wicked web all fits together? Of course, Hearst was the model for Charles Foster Kane in Welles' classic movie, while Ms. Davies was supposedly the inspiration for Kane's wife, Susan. Other key players in these flashbacks are Producer David O Selznick (Toby Moore), Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley, son of Oscar winner Ben), MGM founder Louis B Mayer (Arliss Howard), Mank's brother Joseph (Tom Pelphrey), and Mank's wife ""Poor"" Sarah (Tuppence Middleton).Director Fincher's masterful film features a couple of standout sequences. The first involves the initial meeting between Mank and Hearst, while Marion Davies is filming a scene on the grounds of San Simeon (Xanadu in CITIZEN KANE). Rapid fire dialogue, multiple characters, and terrific editing with Mank keeping pace as Hearst overlooks the filming. Much later there is a scene following Mank and Marion as they stroll through the manicured gardens with the nearby exotic animals on display. The scene is fascinating to watch, while also reinforcing the kindred spirits of Mank and Marion - both talented, yet not quite allowed in the ""club"". Beyond those two sequences, we also get a quite funny segment where Mank and his Paramount writers are improvising a pitch to Selznick and director Josef von Sternberg, plus a telegram sent by Mank to Lederer that states, ""Millions to be made here and your only competition is idiots"" (a sentiment some believe still holds true today).Quite a bit of the film is focused on Hollywood politics of the 1930s, both in the studios and nationally. In particular, the 1934 Governor's race focuses on the campaign of writer and socialist Upton Sinclair (played by Bill Nye, the Science Guy), and the concerted efforts by Hearst and studio capitalists to prevent Sinclair from being elected. The symmetry and contrasts of modern day Hollywood and politics cannot be overlooked. Also made abundantly clear is the disconnect between studio heads, directors, and writers - quite the mishmash of disrespect.The brilliance of Fincher's movie is that it can be relished from multiple perspectives. Is Mank attempting to salvage a near-dead career or is he settling a grudge against Hearst? Did Welles intend to hold firm to Mank's contract and prevent him from receiving a screenwriting credit? And then there is the filmmaking side. Superb performances from Oldman and Seyfried highlight the terrific cast. It's filmed in black and white by cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt (""Mindhunter""), but not the razor-sharp images we are accustomed to these days, rather soft and hazy in keeping with the look of the times. The production design from Donald Graham Burt takes a couple of viewings to fully appreciate, and the music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is spot on, as usual. Even the opening credits provide nostalgia, as does the 1942 Academy Awards ceremony, which neither Mank nor Welles attended. Netflix delivers another winner, and one likely to receive awards consideration."
MANK,19 December 2020,5/10,"This was my first visit to the cinema for 9 months and undoubtedly my last for some months to come.So I was doubly disappointed with this film.
I have recently read the excellent biography of both brothers,so this made my disappointment all the more acute.
It was difficult to understand why they concentrated on the 1934 Governational contest for California rather than leaving bits and pieces for Citizen Kane.There is so much that could be said about that film,which was left out.The black and white photography is excellent and I did appreciate marking the film with the changeover cue dots.Easier to keep track of how long had elapsed.The film,regardless,is a misfire."
MANK,16 December 2020,7/10,"Hollywood likes to portray Hollywood, like the narcissistic city that it is, and so from time to time you get these high budget, grand cast extravaganzas that do nothing but explain their place of origin. Mank is a black and white ode to the 30's Hollywood era, all wrapped around a conspiracy theory core. You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present. You need to watch it even if only to see that fake news is not something new to 2020. It may be a little too presumptuous, a little self absorbed, but a good film nonetheless. I am sure it's better if you know what the hell it is referring to, though."
MANK,8 December 2020,,"""You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one."" Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman)David Fincher's Mank, about the Oscar-winning co-author of Citizen Kane, Herman Mankiewicz, is less about his entire life and more about the characters involved in the Orson Welles firmament as they in one way or another contribute to the romantic story of Kane's genesis and the world of '30's and '40's Hollywood.How writer Mank maneuvers in the movie jungle to produce the greatest filmscript of all time is the subject, and Mank is almost sober enough to convince us of his brilliance with words both written and verbal. Powerful people with whom he has to deal are MGM head Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard), newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance), and producer Irving Thalberg, (Ferdinand Kingsley), to name only a few.Some might say too many important figures with too little screen time but enough for Mank's verbal excellence and inebriation for us to get why the controversy and brilliance.The most important puzzle of all is how much Mank and Welles each contributed to the Oscar-winning screenplay. Fincher's take is that Welles did little if any writing but had a contract with Mank to give Welles co-writing honors. Although actual authorship proportions seem unknowable, Fincher draws a world where, despite the intrigue, such a masterpiece could have happened.At several points, Fincher uses Wellesean techniques like deep focus and hollow sound to echo Citizen Kane itself. Almost distracting, the stylistic flourishes give Fincher the period feel as well as the reflection of Welles's genius.Trish Summerville's costumes, Erik Messerschmidt's Cinematography, and Donald Graham Burt's production design make Mank not so much an Oscar winner as a satisfying trip back in time to when Hollywood was dominated by genius, not digits. Mank should be seen by those who want to know the intricate design of Citizen Kane and the historic importance of Hollywood to cinema."
MANK,19 January 2021,8/10,"""Mank"" is a must for any film buff or fan of old golden age Hollywood even if you liked the classic ""Citizen Kane"" or not this bio look at the behind the scenes life and flashback influences of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewiez(the fine and great Gary Oldman) is a must watch. Director David Fincher really did his work as his pace and style is in depth as this biopic is deep and revealing and eye opening in a raw way. The film has plenty of flashbacks as Herman looks back at how the studio system and politics and life influenced his writing which would lead him up to the ""Citizen Kane"" script. Plus it was revealing to see the power struggle between Herm and Welles as each didn't give in an inch over the credit for the pages.Cleary Herm was outspoken yet honest still he was raw and go against the grain as his life was controled by alcohol and the bottle and he was a ""Camel"" chain smoker. Still Mank delivered and told his story about William Hearst as we see the classic beauty Marion Davies(Amanda Seyfried) who brushed along side the newspaper giant in an intimate way. Really thru it all of the flashbacks, drama and influences the film is a fine homage to 30's Hollywood as it showed the behind the scenes trenches of how one of the greatest films ever was made while showing how a brash blunt hard living writer made it his way as the past and life influences helped him put it all on the page. Overall well done and watch as this is one historical bio picture that any historian or film buff must see."
MANK,16 January 2021,8/10,"""While it is undeniable that casting Oldman is roundly incongruous with the current wind of change, a slip might be completely overlooked by Fincher's wavelength, we can still grasp why he hires Oldman for the role. (trivia time, they both married and divorced the same woman, talking about the rapport of ex-husbands!) The latter is particularly fantastic in Mank's booze-influenced oratory and showmanship as a ""court jester"", the party pooper who finally gets his discontent toward this world off his chest, so that his conscience can be salved, but have you heard the joke of an organ grinder's monkey? It is a sad satire, suffused by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' period-specific score and Fincher's hypnotic injection of a dissimilar lifeworld, MANK is less empathetic than abstract, and Mank, the nonconformist, has his last hurrah. Alas, MANK doesn't shed any light on how he manages to secure his co-credit with the wunderkind Welles (Burke runs away with a sledgehammer Welles in short screen time).""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
MANK,17 December 2020,4/10,"Mank is a movie aimed squarely at film buffs that tells the story of the writing of Citizen Kane. I am a film buff. I love Citizen Kane. I am this movie's target audience. It is bad as a movie, and worse as a movie eager to be compared with the works of Orson Welles.In the film, Gary Oldman plays alcoholic scriptwriter Herman Mankiewicz, who holes up in the middle of nowhere with a broken leg and the assignment to write a full script in a month. He bases the script on the life of powerful millionaire William Randolph Hearst. In flashbacks, we see Mank's dissolute life as a screenwriter, drunk, and witticism machine, as well as his friendship with Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies.1. Mank as a movieI want to take about Mank's failures as a film for film buffs and it's failures as Welles-lite, but I don't want that to get in the way of the most important point, which is that this movie is simply dull. Oldham is persuasive as Mank, but the character is like one played by Thomas Mitchell in old 40s movie; a side character whose witticisms are fun but never make you want to find out what makes him tick.The alcoholic writer isn't an inherently uninteresting subject, but it's also not an inherently interesting one, and the movie doesn't give us any particular reason to care about Mank. The flashbacks are sometimes interesting and sometimes not, but in neither case do they change the movie from basically being a guy in a house typing and getting blackout drunk. There is nothing within the movie that makes you curious about the characters or the situation - the only thing that kept me watching was curiosity about Citizen Kane, and if I'd never seen that movie I wouldn't have finished this one. The acting is good, and Amanda Seyfried is actually exceptionally good as Davies, but there's really not much to this at all. It doesn't pull you in at the start, and the end feels as meh as the rest of it.2. Mank as a film buff movieThe best thing about Mank is the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, which does a dead-on impression of Greg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, down to emulating specific scenes. Set and costume design are also first-rate.But as behind-the-scenes look into Citizen Kane the movie is a failure. One thing I wanted to know was why, if Mank was friends with Hearst and with Davies, he turned on them so savagely.Some say that the treatment of Davies was the thing that most harmed Kane most of all. True, Not only was it reportedly the main reason Hearst wanted to destroy the movie, but Davies, a talented light comedian pushed into inappropriate roles by her sugar daddy, was charming and well-liked (which Seyfried captures wonderfully) and threw big Hollywood parties and because of that, Hollywood would not rally around Kane as Hearst attacked it. Even Welles admitted, years later, that he had been unfair to Davies.So why did Mank trash her? The movie offers a simplistic answer involving Upton Sinclair that doesn't make much sense and, when I researched it, isn't remotely what happened. There is no thoughtful attempt to consider why a writer would use his friends as grist for the mill, even though other writers have successfully looked at the very subject without reducing it all to petty, self-righteous vengeance.The movie also falls onto the long-exploded Pauline Kael side of the who-wrote-Kane debate, suggesting Welles did pretty much nothing on the script. A little research shows scholars have conclusively refuted this (one of the top of the ""most helpful"" IMDB user reviews gives a good overview of this).The only reason I kept with this movie was for the real-life story that it couldn't bother to tell.3. Mank vs. Orson WellesBy making a movie about Citizen Kane, and making it look just like Citizen Kane, director David Fincher would seem to be *daring* people to compare his work with Welles. But it falls short of Welles work in every non-superficial way.Welles was certainly a big fan of flashy cinematography. He could be gimmicky. But there was always intent to it. Gimmicks were always both ""oh, cool!"" and ""look how that emphasizes the point he's making in a fresh way.""Beyond the flash, Welles was a filmmaker who never gave you all the answers. He gave you clues. Citizen Kane is about the search for Rosebud, but once you know what it is, you still don't know Kane. It's another clue, but it's up to the viewer to decide how to sort these clues. Welles gave you jigsaw puzzles with some pieces missing and some extra pieces. It was true of Kane and pretty much everything he did through his final film, The Other Side of the Wind. Welles did not consider people explicable. They lie about their motives to others and themselves, they change from moment to moment and year to year. It is the complexity, not the cinematographic tricks, that make Welles one of history's greatest filmmakers.But Fincher's Mank isn't complex at all. His story arc is straightforward. He's a brilliant drunk. His motives are simplistic. He's self-destructive in a predictable fashion. Like all of us he has his good points and his bad points, moments of spite and moments of grace, but then, so does every character in a Hallmark movie.And the gimmicks in Mank are just gimmicks. If you know Kane's opening scene you'll recognize the falling whisky glass as a callback, but what does it say? Not a thing. Not. One. Single. Thing.Mank is a dull, unimaginative film that is infuriating because it has so many of the hallmarks of a good one. That makes it feel like a cheat. I regret watching it, and recommend everyone skip it."
MANK,11 September 2021,6/10,"It seems ironic that in trying to bolster the claim of maverick Hollywood screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz, the ""Mank"" of the title, to sole authorship of the screenplay of arguably the best and most famous (or infamous) movie in Hollywood history, ""Citizen Kane"", David Fincher's film should meet similar claims of duplicity and distortion.Personally, I find it hard to believe that in conceiving, directing and acting in the finished film, Welles wouldn't have contributed majorly to the screenplay, especially given the evidence of his future movies. One need look no further than his later acknowledged, uncredited input to Carol Reed's brilliant ""The Third Man"", the memorable ""cuckoo clocks"" speech. Moreover, early in this film, Welles's Mercury Productions associate, John Houseman, pointedly encourages Mankiewicz to push for even a shared writing credit which it seems he wasn't about to get at all or even expect, which of course he did receive in the end.Does it really matter then whether he did or didn't write the whole screenplay? To film buffs and historians, the answer is probably yes, but it does tend to over-dominate the rest of this fascinating man's chequered life. I'm fine with Fincher's attempt to at least reclaim Mankiewicz's subsequently diminished claim to the Oscar, especially as it's the only one he ever won, although the same could be said for Welles too. The thought occurred to me however whether two such rebellious anti-establishment figures as these would even care about baubles such as the Oscars, but then again I'm not in movies.Fincher certainly presents a beautifully realised pastiche of the era with stunning monochrome cinematography and witty dialogue, both often containing insider nods to ""Kane"", no doubt for avids like me. The now disputed attribution of Mankiewicz's motivation in turning against his former friend, William Randolph Hearst and by association his mistress Marion Davies, with whom Mankiewicz appeared to have a special bond, to Hearst's part in engineering the defeat of writer and socialist activist Upton Sinclair's 1934 bid for the California governorship does again seem a bit of a stretch. This especially when one learns that the depicted suicide of the director of the phony newsreel clips allegedly commissioned by Hearst which Sinclair attributed to his defeat from the jaws of victory, was itself a complete fabrication by Fincher and his writers. Which I have to say is where it gets murky for me and in fact I believe does a disservice to Mankiewicz's memory.Viewed as a behind-the-scenes insight into Golden Age Hollywood film-making, ""Mank"" is a joy and is helped in this by fine performances at its heart by Gary Oldman as Mank, even if he seems old for the part (unlike Amanda Seyfreid who by contrast seems way too young to play Davies) and Tom Pelphrey as his also gifted brother, the writer and future producer / director Joseph Mankiewicz, but in the end, when its central attempt to add a full stop to the whole ""Who wrote 'Kane'"" debate leaves instead, at least a semi-colon, if not a question-mark, for me, it rather undermines the point of the whole movie."
MANK,6 December 2020,9/10,"As pedant as it sounds, I guess any movie should be made for movie lovers... but the new Netflix sensation ""Mank"" goes a little further than that: it is not just for those who love movies but those who love to know about movies as well. Wasn't IMDb designed for these gold-diggers of film trivia and Oscar stats we call geeks?But even after 16 years of geeking on IMDb, I realized how my knowledge about one of the greatest American classics was limited. I thought ""Citizen Kane"" was the work of a cinema prodigy, a genius who at the age of 26 wrote, directed and starred in a film that revolutionized the art of storytelling and pushed the envelope in terms of filming techniques. IMDb informed me that Orson Welles actually co-wrote the screenplay with Herman Mankiewicz while I gathered from Wikipedia that Willam Randolph Hearst the then press-mogul and iconic tycoon pulled out all the stops to prevent the film from being released.I guess I was so admiring of the titanic achievement which was ""Citien Kane"" that I figured the second writer was some sort of assistant or just a rewriter who polished Welles' original draft. If it wasn't for David Fincher's ""Mank"" I would never had figured that the lion-share of prestige in the writing department had been usurped by the colossal legacy Welles forged through his long career... and I suspect I am not the only one in that case. So ""Mank"" does more than telling a story about how a classic was made possible, it repairs an injustice.And like many other films about the making of classic (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Ed Wood""...) the story is told with the right self-referential angle, using all the visual delights that made Hollywood Golden Age... and I am not talking of the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography from Eric Messerschmidt which, as splendid it is, became a sort of requirement after movies like ""The Artist"" or ""Roma"" more recently. I was more impressed by the writing (which fits the film's subject) from Fincher's father Jack who died in 2003. All the interactions, the shadows of ambiguity interfering with cigars' smoking cloud give the film the flavor of the very era it underlines.Stylistically, even the use of scenes heading appearing on the screen as if they were written from a typewriter and with the Courier font, will satisfy the wannabe screenwriters like myself. When the first heading appeared, my immediate reaction was ""Why didn't I think of that before?"" That's the kind of original masterstrokes I thought only Charlie Kaufman could come up with. This is a film about screenwriting embracing the magic of screenwriting, that a bunch of squared-shaped words on a blank paper could contain the embryo of a masterpiece to transport the eyes of all these people in the dark... I don't think it'ss a bold prediction to say this might be an Oscar winner, perhaps the second of the ceremony.There I just dropped the O word... well this is Fincher's first film since ""Gone Girl"" six years ago, a director of his caliber was bound to come back with something big. And not to diminish the film's merit outside the realm of competition, but ""Mank"" does have the makings of an Oscar winner (besides being about one), the cinematography resurrects the charm of old movies without overstating them, the editing uses cleverly the same flash-back devices of ""Citizen Kane"" without overplaying them either... and acting wise, Gary Oldman ensures his third Oscar nomination as the flayed and alcoholic writer with a certain penchant for self-destruction in the name of self-esteem, a non-conformist who should have tons of enemies if the venomous wit he infused in his words weren't so delightful to hear.More amusing than malicious but more principled than his detractors, Mank is his worst enemy and can only count on his talent and the support of his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton), so devoted that the epithet ""poor"" has been grafted on her name. This is Herman Menkiewicz, a much interesting subject for a character study and a biopic, but the film has also to offer a fine gallery a supporting characters, among them Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies, Hearst's wife, and the current frontrunner in the Best Supporting Actress category. I read many forum comments on her roles echoing the Oscar winning performance of Kim Basinger in ""L.A. Confidential"" but that kind of limits her appeal more than highlights it.To be honest, I'm always perplex when it comes to performances such as these, playing a woman of a certain period sounds like an actress' challenge but the more codes and restrictions there are,, the easier I think the acting is because the path is clearly shown and the risk of a false note is lower. Seyfried embraces the glamour of the era but doesn't fall into the easy trap of playing it like a femme fatale of a gangster's mole, she adds a nuance of sensitivity that makes the interactions with the more intellectual Mank a real treat for the eyes. Both have great chemistry but I was far more impressed by Arliss ""Private Cowboy"" Howard who played L.B. Mayer and had some of the best lines in the films especially in a riveting passage where he recites all the credos of the MGM company.Now, there's a lot of politics, Hollywood politics and politics politics but the best thing about Mank was his awareness in fine that he had written a masterpiece and that he wanted to have credit for it proved his flair of genius, including his own. The reaction of Welles (Tom Burked) inspired the climactic finale and ended their collaboration, but at least, Mankiewicz shared the film's sole Oscar win and sticked long enough in the credits to inspire a script from Fincher the father and a film from the son. Both the film and the script are posthumous victories."
MANK,14 December 2020,8/10,"I'm sure ""Mank"" will find an audience among cineastes, especially those who love movies about the movies but despite all the craft on display I doubt very much if this will set the box-office on fire, (though David Fincher aficionados might give it a go out of curiosity). Mank, (not a good title, by the way), is Herman J. Mankiewicz, co-writer with Orson Welles, of ""Citizen Kane"", and this movie, written by Fincher's father, Jack, some years ago, posits the idea that the screenplay of ""...Kane"" was written by Mankiewicz and Mankiewicz alone.This is a movie strong on name-dropping, (we are told who everyone is as soon as they appear), and it's definitely smart and, thanks to Erik Messerschmidt's stunning black and white cinematography, it looks incredible but it also has a strip-cartoon like quality giving it the feel of a potted history of Hollywood at a time when MGM had more stars than there were in the heavens. It is, in other words, a niche movie for a niche market.Mank is Gary Oldman, (excellent in an Oscar-bait performance). Welles is British actor Tom Burke, a splendid Charles Dance is William Randolph Hearst and Amanda Seyfried is an outstanding Marion Davies and there are scenes in the movie as good as anything you will see this year. It's also very good on the 'Hearst is Kane' idea and if we have to have gossipy show-biz biopics then we can't complain if they all look and sound as good as ""Mank"". This is the kind of film, come Oscar time, I'm sure the Academy will honour in a self-congratulatory frame of mind as if finally honouring ""Citizen Kane"" itself. It may not be Fincher's masterpiece but it just might be the one that will finally win him that little gold-plated man we call Oscar."
MANK,6 February 2021,8/10,"Hollywood loves to make films about Hollywood, and to turn the stars of the past into the heroes of contemporary films, even at the risk of producing revisionist versions of the history of the seventh art. 'Mank' released in 2020 on Netflix, directed by David Fincher on a screenplay written many years ago by his father, Jack Fincher, brings to screen one of the contributors to film making lesser known today - the publicist and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. His name was perhaps unjustly forgotten, as he co-wrote with Orson Welles the screenplay of 'Citizen Kane', considered one of the masterpieces of film history, and shared with him the only Academy Award that the film received, actually the only Academy Award that Welles ever received, if we exclude the honorary one from 1971. If we accept the version of events in the film, Mank was the one who won for Orson Welles this only Academy Award of his career. But let's be honest, the screenwriters are often overshadowed by actors, directors and producers, and the posthumous glory that 'Mank' creates for the film's hero is an exception anyway. 'Citizen Kane' is a masterpiece (and in the top 3 of my favorite films), David Fincher is an extremely talented director, the film 'Mank' is interesting both because it addresses the controversy of the creation of the script and because it is originally made cinematically - so we have gathered almost all the premises for a success. Many of the promises are fulfilled, but not all.
The principal thread of the story in the film takes place in a period of 60 days, in a ranch isolated from the world, in which Orson Welles (Tom Burke) secludes Mankiewicz - Mank (Gary Oldman) to write the script of a future film that will become 'Citizen Kane'. Mank had just had a rather serious car accident, so he needed the presence of a nurse in addition to a typist. Both women are refugees from war-torn Europe - the echo of the global events that were taking place during the writing and making of the film. In addition, the screenwriter faces alcohol addiction, although it is not obvious that he could create or even live without it. The young director, already considered a genius, had almost complete control of the film by contract, but his success or failure depended on the quality of the script that Mank wrote. Through a series of flashbacks, viewers witness his struggle with the memories of a decade of activity in Hollywood, interleaved with the incidents of a rebellious screenwriter, talented and appreciated for his spirit and sense of humour, but often in conflict with the studio magnates and with the press tycoons. 'Citizen Kane' will mirror these events in Mankiewicz's life. We know the result, but the road to success was twisted, glory did not come immediately, and life never rewarded Welles or Mankiewicz in proportion to their talent and contributions to the art of film. If posterity already restored Welles' glory, 'Mank' - the movie tries to do the same for Herman Mankiewicz.
What I liked. The cinematography is extraordinary. David Fincher gave the film a look and feel as close as possible to the style of the period in which 'Citizen Kane' was made. He used black and white, filmed and captured the sound with devices similar to those of the '30s, framed and moved the cameras according to the rules of the time, and the soundtrack is mono. Gary Oldman creates a notable performance as Mank, but this is no surprise, Oldman is one of the most talented and versatile film actors today. Among the other acting interpretations, Amanda Seyfried stands out in the role of a diva of the time, a role that is likely to bring her a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for supporting female role. What I liked less. Flashbacks include many details and characters that are perhaps familiar to those very knowledgeable in the history of Hollywood in the 30s, but which will be unknown and will lose their effect for the rest of the audience (the vast majority). 'Mank' is definitely a docu-drama, and I think that here David Fincher should have found the creative means to educate his less initiated spectators. Most of the supporting roles around Mank are a bit schematic, and worse, they include lines that sound 'implanted' from contemporary political speak. The intention of the authors to give current meanings and resonances to the events that take place on the screen was obvious, but I believe that this effect could have been achieved without explicit rhetoric.For me, 'Mank' changed the perspective of 'Citizen Kane', which is, as I said, one of my favourite movies. I love Welles' film for two reasons - revolutionary cinematic art and courageous political attitude and message. 'Mank' offers a new perspective, and attributes the political attitude, anti-populist message and anti-corporate satire not only to Welles but especially to the life experience of a brave and talented screenwriter, the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe, a rebel against great studios and of the magnates who led them. The future viewings of 'Citizen Kane' will be for me and for many who will see 'Mank', different."
MANK,4 December 2020,6/10,"For all that's been penned regarding the authorship of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), one could do worse (and better) than viewing two movies on Netflix to get the gist of the debate over who wrote the screenplay for the so-called ""greatest film ever,"" Herman Mankiewicz or Orson Welles. ""Mank"" takes the side of the former and is evidently largely based on the discredited research of Pauline Kael (author of ""Raising Kane,"" as well as famed film critic). The other Netflix movie is ""The Other Side of the Wind"" (2018), the completed incomplete film from Orson Welles where his semi-autobiographical stand-in slaps a thinly-veiled caricature of Kael. One could also read Robert L. Carringer's ""The Scripts of Citizen Kane"" (or book ""The Making of Citizen Kane"") or another factual account from actual film historians that make an open-and-shut case that the shared screen credit for Mankiewicz and Welles was an accurate representation of a collaborative effort, with the man, Mankiewicz, who made the most substantial contributions credited first, but where's the simplistic, counterfactual, score-settling drama of a contest of wills to be had in that. Cue yet another entry in the industry of belying the brilliance of ""Kane"" by dumbing it down. Ironic, though, that this is exactly what ""Mank"" valorizes its eponymous screenwriter for not doing, as his sticks to his convictions by not making his script any less biting or complex. David Fincher and company giving his late father sole screen credit for its script, though, for a movie about giving a writer his due, while not acknowledging that the movie basically rips off Kael's thesis, that's beyond ironic--it's insolent. And, that's still nothing compared to its travesty of history. Otherwise, ""Mank"" is entertaining and fairly well acted, although it's no ""Citizen Kane.""I appreciate to an extent what they were trying to do here by making the movie in the manner of its predecessor from 1941: the desaturated black-and-white look, the supposed film ""cigarette burns,"" chiaroscuro lighting, some rear-projection car views, old-fashioned-looking matte shots, some deep-focus cinematography, the flashback structure of the narrative, a gubernatorial election and even fake newsreels. There are a lot of little moments recalling particular scenes from ""Kane,"" including a bedridden Mankiewicz dropping a booze bottle instead of a snow globe or Welles angrily tossing things as though Susan Alexander Kane had just dumped him. Stylistically, I wish ""Mank"" went even further than being a fair pastiche, though, or rather went in another direction. Go with the 4:3 aspect ratio instead of widescreen or shoot on actual film instead of digital, for instance. Don't half-ass it. Mostly, ""Mank"" just isn't as visually appealing or adventurous as ""Citizen Kane."" With the exception of dialogue that bristles with wise cracks and pontification in the vein of the ""News on the March"" reporters of ""Kane,"" the same goes for the screenplay.What makes ""Kane"" great has very little to do with its titular character Charles Foster Kane being loosely based on William Randolph Hearst. But, the notion otherwise is another dumbed-down contest of wills for TV movies and entertainment critics to vomit for easy digestion. Along with his eventual argument with Welles, ""Mank"" spends most of its time on the supposed conflict brewing between Mankiewicz and Hearst, as well as on their various go-betweens like Marion Davies, Joseph Mankiewicz and Louis B. Mayer, and complete with a demonstrative speech of a movie pitch for a climax. It's enough to make me think ""The Social Network"" (2010) is perfidy, too, because it's the same sort of dramatics at play; I just don't know enough about social-media backstories as I do of those from film history to call BS on it. ""Kane"" is an ambiguous and complex scenario told from multiple perspectives just as the film is photographed from various angles while keeping everyone in focus. The flashbacks here are perfunctory by comparison--elaborations of supposed past inspirations for the screenplay. The most compelling part of the Hearst connection to Kane is that it's a character--newspaper man, politician, overseer of his lover's career--who shapes stories, even from his deathbed with the mysterious last word, ""Rosebud,"" which is just what the plot as narrated by different characters is about, too. Similarly, ""Mank"" is about a screenwriter, but the perspective is entirely one-sided, unambiguous and superficial.The worst part of all of this may be the politics. The movie fabricates a connection between Mankiewicz and Upton Sinclair's 1934 campaign for California governor. The pains this picture goes to make its anti-union, GOP-donating protagonist into a passionate supporter of socialism is shocking and entirely unfounded. His antagonism to Nazis is on firmer ground, and I'm not quite sure what to make of ""sad Sarah,"" his wife's claim of his ""silly platonic affairs,"" let alone a throwaway scene featuring a stenographer and only woman in a room full of male screenwriters being topless aside from pasties. Anyways, more outrageous is the invention of a fictional character to direct the fake newsreels just so to suicide him and fabricate that Mankiewicz had anything to do with any of that. Besides, the real radical leftist of the screenwriters of ""Kane"" was Welles. It's surely part of what led him to be exiled from Hollywood, taking up the mantle of the self-financed auteur and persona non grata upon studio lots--very much in the spirit of ""Kane."" ""Mank,"" on the other hand, is what the character of Kane became. It's Hollywood fluff. Everything managed and packaged by a small country of executives and contributors, running roughshod over facts and nuance, and sold off to Netflix, to the point that its story of a singular auteur is but a stupid joke. Hypocritical lies."
MANK,5 December 2020,,"Shot in swooning monochrome, bringing Old Hollywood to life in splendid detail and powered by yet another smashing showcase from the always reliable Gary Oldman, Mank chronicles the life of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the script for Citizen Kane and also offers an interesting glimpse into the influence & inner workings of 1930s Hollywood industry through his shrewd eyes & scathing wit.Directed by David Fincher, the film marks his return to the cinematic medium after a gap of 6 years and is adapted from a screenplay written by his late father. While it is a departure from his forte, Fincher's direction does retain the sublime craftsmanship & technical perfection that goes into his works and effortlessly transports the viewers to its period setting. The script sculpts the characters with deft care but the narrative still lacks the fluidity necessary for a story like this.The crisp black-n-white photography, methodical camerawork, ideal lighting, clever humour, smart editing & fitting score certainly enrich the experience but the relaxed pace & unduly focus on flashbacks also makes the ride a bit tedious. Performances are top-notch. Oldman plays the eponymous role from inside out, Amanda Seyfried is captivating in her role, and Tom Burke embodies Orson Welles to near-perfection, nailing the physicality & mannerism of the wunderkind to a tee.Overall, Mank is an ambitious & audacious venture that presents David Fincher in complete control of his craft but it also isn't a tale that's going to satisfy everyone's palate. More a withering study of power, corruption & politics within the filmmaking industry than a love letter to cinema, Fincher's latest is gripping when covering the writing process of Orson Welles' debut feature but loses steam whenever it reverts to an earlier timeline. All in all, Mank has its merits but unlike Fincher's best-known efforts, it fails to leave behind an indelible imprint."
MANK,15 April 2021,6/10,"Mank is a film made for filmmakers. It's a deliberately slow-paced, self-indulgent glimpse into the golden age of Hollywood. Nevertheless, it's not without its charms. I loved the dialogue in this movie. Even when I had no idea what they were talking about, I still enjoyed the way they said it. This film also looks fantastic and captures the feeling of that era. I just wish it had stayed focused on the creative process and not delved so much into politics."
MANK,12 December 2020,7/10,"Fincher by his determination to recreate Hollywood of the 40s both in the sets and even in the direction of his own film, appears at first glance dedicated to the entertainment of his audience. But there is a story hidden under the story. And that hidden story is Fincher's determination to out-do Mank himself with a script too clever by half. An enterprise which the limits the audience to fellow writers and Hollywood old-timers. And which was doomed to failure from the start."
MANK,16 December 2020,6/10,"Mank (2020)The movie that everyone wants to like. But why?Oh, Gary Oldman as Mankewitz is rather terrific. And the subject matter should hold water, concerning William Randolf Hearst and that 1930s world of excess, not to mention Orson Welles and that obvious Citizen Kane connection.But there are so many scenes where the writer is straining to make sure the audience is keeping up with things, for example giving us first names (and variations on first names) to clue us in on who is who. The strain of having to inform the audience chokes the intended authenticity. The scene early on where some screenwriters (including Ben Hecht) are chatting about screenplays and ideas is so forced it's embarrassing-especially since it's about screenwriting.The movie has its beauty, for sure, filmed in greyish black and white that is a softened, more detailed version of classic Hollywood. Films from the time it is set, mid-1930s to 1940, are noticably ""harder"" in tonality, meaning deeper blacks and more overall contrast. Citizen Kane is a prime example. It's worth noting that the photography for ""Mank"" is generally very poised and luminous, lots of backlighting and delineated grey scales, not much like the photography in Kane.Now you might expect the film to grow into its own vocabulary, to have a style of its own whatever the borrowings of its substance. But no, the script is stubbornly derivative and simplistic (almost as if the writers were in their 20s and just discovering Hollywood, and literature). And the reason for this is as old as the hills-the son David Fincher is adapting the screenplay of his beloved departed father, Jack Fincher. A natural mistake, but not one to put $50,000,000 on.The plot, what little there actually is, blunders along, dull as pancakes in July. The cliches abound, the supporting cast spouts obvious quips, and the name-dropping is endless and revealing. I do love Citizen Kane, and admire Welles, and I also greatly admire many of Fincher's films on another level, so it all is a disappointment.The saving grace is certainly Oldman, who acts his heart out, and sustains many scenes, even ones that don't offer much worth saving. True, he's a 62 year old playing the part of a man between 37 and 42, roughly, and that doesn't help. But he's committed and complex. A good job.And the movie isn't a total wreck...but with all the hype, it really deflates and confounds. How and why, with all this talent, did it end up so underachieving? Or then again, who really cares?"
MANK,1 January 2021,6/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.For me ""Mank"" (2020) was a disappointment considering that it was directed by one of the all time best in my opinion David Fincher. Also there are talents on screen doing excellent job - wherever you look at. But the main problem of ""Mank"" that it is a biopic about person, who wrote a masterpiece but its not about creating of that masterpiece, but about that persons struggles with alcoholism, his political believes and even about some god forgotten election that took place some 80 years ago that I did not give a slightest care - and even story about election took place on screen more time then anything resembling Citizen Kane. That is a big shame - such a wasted opportunity in my opinion. And also at running time 2 h 12 min. I found this movie to be extremely boring and not involving, the best thing about it was acting which kinda saved this movie from being complete boredom. All in all this is movie was not for me, and I kinda think it will hardly find its audience, even on Netflix."
MANK,28 February 2021,9/10,At times quite captivating performances especially from Gary Oldman and everything about MGM is so profound! Some of the dialogue is difficult to understand I'll admit but the film deserves better for sure; the nominations are worthy and I hope a few categories win in the golden globes. I understand the hate a little bit regardless Mank is superb!
MANK,31 December 2020,,"Among other things, ""Mank"" is the story of the birth of the screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), which some consider to be the best movie ever made. Obviously, ""Mank"" would mean a lot more to those who have watched ""Citizen Kane"", and remember it in detail. I qualify for in the first instance, but not the second. I have immediately added to my 2021 resolution list: re-watch ""Citizen Kane"". But until that happens, I may be missing quite a bit in ""Mank"".For the aforementioned ""other things"", first and foremost is a character study of Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), who shared an Oscar with director Orson Welles for the Best Screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"", the only Oscar it won, despite a total of 9 nomination. The sore point for Mankiewicz was that he was solely responsible for the award-winning script and Welles had made no contribution to it whatsoever.Filmed in retro black-and-white but with state-of-the-art modern cinematic technology, ""Mank"" depicts the two months during which Mank recuperates, with a leg completely in cast (car accident), in a remote ranch house. During this period, he dictates the script of ""Kane"" to his secretary Rita Alexander (Lily Collins, unrecognizable from Emily in ""Emily in Paris"" in persona, same lovely face notwithstanding), all the time fueled by generous consumption of alcohol, an act condoned by nurse-cum-housekeeper Fraulein Freda (Monika Gossmann) but frowned upon by Rita. The warmest scene in this otherwise somewhat ""cool"" (meant as a compliment) movie is the reconciliation between Mank and Rita, raising a glass to each other. Instrumental to this reconciliation is a touching conversation Rita had with Freda.While Freda is just a small part, there are two other important support female characters, both appearing largely in the prolific sprinkling of flashbacks throughout the movie. One is Mank's loving (and loved) wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton, well remembered from her roles in TV series ""War and peace"" and movie ""Downton Abbey""), nicknamed ""Poor Sara"", who best understands him. The other is Marion (Amanda Seyfried, unrecognizable from Sophie in ""Mamma Mia"" in persona, same lovely face notwithstanding),), an aspiring Hollywood starlet and mistress of media mega-tycoon William Randolph Hearst (the ever compelling screen presence of Charles Dance). She could be the daughter he wished he had.If there is a ""set piece"" in this movie, in the sense of that in an action blockbuster, it would be in one of those flashbacks where Mank, amply under the influence of alcohol, sketches the plot of Citizen Cane at a lavish, extravagantly-costumed dinner party, as the story of a modern-day Don Quixote. For this, he is called a ""court jester"", and told that Hearst, who pays half his salary, likes only the way he talks, but not the way he writes.While this movie is not exactly genre-revolutionizing, it is hard to put neatly into a niche. I have mentioned the story of the birth of ""Citizen Cane"" and a character study of Herman Mankiewicz. It is, I suppose, also a tribute to Hollywood, but not in the sense of Tarantino's affectionate look of ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"". Unlike that one, you will not particularly root for any of the characters (including the protagonist) although the three women aforementioned are all treated with benevolence. Consider it a series of sketches of Hollywood (""where millions to be made here and your only competition is idiots"") that are between witty and sardonic. The final climax, the confrontation with Orson Welles (Tom Burke) who ends up smashing case of alcohol, is a tad melodramaticThe virtuosic director David Fincher has already given movie-lovers a large variety of pleasure: mystery psychological thriller ""Gone Girl"", spy thriller ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"", fast-paced modern drama ""The social network"", tantalizing fantasy ""The curious case of Benjamin Button"", semi-doc procedural of serial killer ""Zodiac"" and, most devastating of all ""Se7en"". ""Mank"" is yet something he has not done before. It may not appeal to the general audience, but Oscar nods are almost certain."
MANK,1 March 2021,7/10,"""Mank"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch social critic and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz trying to finish the screenplay of the movie ""Citizen Kane"" while he is fighting with alcoholism. Hollywood reevaluates him and he has to prove them wrong.I liked this movie because it presented an aspect of Herman J. Mankiewicz and his work on ""Citizen Kane"" that I did not know and have not seen before. The plot is simple and we follow his story that is very interesting. The interpretation of Gary Oldman who played as Herman J. Mankiewicz was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tom Burke's who played as Orson Welles, Amanda Seyfried's who played as Marion Davies and Lily Collins' who played as Rita Alexander. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Mank"" is a nice and interesting biography movie that shows us a different face of Herman J. Mankiewicz, something that Hollywood was aware of but many people not."
MANK,28 December 2020,6/10,3 out of 5 stars.Mank is a fair biographical film about Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) and the development that he had to go through with his screen writing credit for Citizen Kane film.Great performances and a great cast ensemble. Led by Gary Oldman. The script did not really do anything to focus on the inspirational and in depth with Herman and 1940s Hollywood. Could have been so much more. Besides the movie focusing on Herman and his alcoholism.The film is also a bit boring as well. I love that the music composer Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor worked on it. And focusing on instrumental 1930s feel. But it was a bit unnoticed. And not one of David Finchers best films. But he sure can capture great performances from the cast.
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"There is no doubt that ""Mank"" tells a great story of ""Old Hollywood"" (1930s-40s) and its studio-driven system. It also does a fine job of intersecting current political or cultural themes with that of the times (showing how certain issues remain the same no matter the time period). The biggest potential viewer hurdle in really enjoying ""Mank"", however? The fact that one should (dare I say ""needs to"") watch ""Citizen Kane"" (or already have a deep understanding of Hollywood in that time period) to truly get all that is being presented here.For a very basic overview, ""Mank"" focuses on Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), a maverick (because of his progressive ideals) Hollywood screenwriter writing the script for what will ultimately become the iconic film ""Citizen Kane"". While hammering out the screenplay and jousting with star Orson Welles (Tom Burke), flashbacks show how Mank--a decade earlier--feuded with Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard), head of MGM studios, and befriended Marion Davis (Amanda Seyfried), partner of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance).There are many scenes in ""Mank"" that absolutely crackle with life and relevance. Practically any time that Herman jousts with the Hollywood execs or high-profile personalities, Oldman is electric. The repartee back-and-forth is not only entertaining, but also enlightening in that many of the same issues are likely bandied about today in similar scenarios.The major problem I had with this overall experience--which sapped it of at least a star ranking--is that clearly (by not being an amateur historian of the time period) I was not ""in on the joke"", so to speak, in many scenarios. I've seen Citizen Kane, but not for years. I know very little--aside from the basic structure--of the old Hollywood studio system. While viewing ""Mank"", I could clearly detect times where a moment or character was supposed to be significant, but I just didn't know why. Watching Citizen Kane again and then re-watching this would almost assuredly up it at least a star ranking.Another oddity: director David Fincher--in trying to be period-accurate--used only mono sound (one track) for this film. As such, any background noise, music, or effects tend to severely drown out the dialogue or make it seem echo-y. While I understand the aesthetic choice, I don't think it improves the experience at all (I'd argue for the opposite, sadly).Thus, ""Mank"" is a rather odd viewing experience. It is clearly a great screenplay, yet requires a great deal of extra-curricular activity from the viewer to truly appreciate (for better or worse)."
MANK,8 December 2020,6/10,"Like any sane cinephile I've been eagerly awaiting David Fincher's return to the cinematic landscape ever since his last feature film effort Gone Girl came and went all the way back in 2014.His work on the well-regarded Netflix show Mindhunter helped ease the pain of his lack of feature film movement but it wasn't until the announcement of his dream project Mank, a look at the life of famed Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and his creation of the legendary Hollywood script that became Citizen Kane, that we could really start getting excited about the adorded directors next piece of work.Based off a script from Fincher's own late father Jack, Mank is a typically astute production from the famously picky director who alongside his crew has gone to great lengths to capture the essence of 1930's/40's Hollywood, going so far as to capture sound using technology of the day, filming black and white and crafting a score alongside Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that feels as though it could've been lifted from the era itself as it accompanies Fincher's talk-heavy dramedy.It's a prestige film if I've ever seen one, one of Netflix's most prestigiously made so far but for all its technical marvels and wizardry and a great double turn from its leads Gary Oldman as the alcoholic Mankiewisz and Amanda Seyfried as actress and friend Marion Davies, there's an overwhelming sense of coldness to Mank that keeps you at arms lengths from its main characters and time crossing story throughout the entirety of its two hour runtime.For anyone that has only a small knowledge base of Hollywood of this time and Citizen Kane as a film, Mank will be even more hard to fall in love with as Fincher assumes a certain level of interest already in his subject matter and those that litter its story, with even Mankiewicz himself remaining a rather aloof figure throughout the tale as we see him bedridden after an accident beavering away on the script that would become his masterwork while also seeing him in action (eg mainly drunk) at various industry get togethers talking politics and world issues.Viewers hoping to get an insightful look into the mindset or creation of Mankiewicz the person, will leave disappointed while any enthusiastic Citizen Kane fans may find enjoyment in parts from seeing how real life events helped formed the films narrative but a rarely used Tom Burke as Orson Welles and a rather intriguing finale with little of Kane's legacy explored makes one feel as though there was a lot more to explore about this films main character and the feature he helped create.The work of the aforementioned Oldman (in rare non-makeup form) and Seyfried is certainly likely to attract great interest come awards season, much like the film itself that is the exact type of production that old Hollywood loves to fawn over but despite their best efforts and the craftsmanship that surrounds them, there's an overriding sense that Mank badly misses the mark when it comes to enrapturing you in its heart and soul.It's rare to see Fincher this playful and even reflective, outside of his underrated classic The Curious Case of Benjamin Button this is his most humanistic tale and one that he clearly relished exploring, you just wish he was able to make you fall in love with the collection of players littered throughout while stringing together a narrative that felt like more than a self-assured showing off of accurate period recreation and call backs to a whose who of the era.Final Say -Sure to find a place in the hearts and minds of many viewers and esteemed industry thespians, Mank is a hugely impressive showpiece for the craft it explores but despite all of this its a film devoid of emotion or heart and therefore only entertains to a certain level as we struggle to care beyond an outside interest level of engagement.3 Giraffes out of 5"
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"Mank (2020) :
Brief Review -Watch it only for Gary Oldman's performance and to know how Classic Citizen Kane was written. You know i think David Fincher doesn't have fine hands in drama genre like he has in thriller genre so expecting too much is unfair alright. Mank is biographical drama based on screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz's (pet name Mank) days during 30s in Hollywood and how he developed the idea of Orson Welles's most acclaimed film till date Citizen Kane. Well i was more interested to know about Cirizen Kane than knowing about Mank's life which does showcase anything useful or spectacular at all. The writing of Mank is at fault because it failed to clarify the main reasons behind peculiar activities done by him. What was he upto, why was he drinking too much, why was he having platonic affair with a married woman when he had faithful and loyal wife (and why she was still staying with him), why the hell did he put his earned money and reputation at stake for some election results? All these questions goes without any answers and that's why his character don't make much sense in 130 minutes long film. Gary Oldman's fantastic performance is the best thing to watch in Mank. I loved this guy in strong supporting roles in Nolan's films but in leading role he is overwhelming. Rest of the cast if fine but the problem is wrongly taken reference from the real characters. You need to have plenty of knowledge about old Hollywood (1930-1940) to feel the nostalgia here because set designing is awesome but if you do not know much then all of it will look damn rough to you. David Fincher's direction is good i would say despite the not so good writing. Fincher's idea to tell the past and the present on alternate occasions was nice. Overall, Mank offers you two big things one is Gary Oldman and the second is backdrop of Citizens Kane (if you have watched the film already). Rest, there is nothing notable.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest"
MANK,13 January 2021,3/10,"I'm an easy sell on movies about Hollywood, making ""Mank"" extra disappointing; more self-righteously self-aware Tinseltown tripe, dully highlighting industry corruption...shocking. Mank is far too boringly benevolent; his hang-ups are mentioned, but rarely shown. And for a movie about a screenwriter, the script is remarkably vapid. Fincher leans so heavily on design, performances & the black-&-white visuals he forgets to be interesting. Any small bits of goodness (Seyfried, Howard) are quickly forgotten."
MANK,3 April 2021,7/10,"I'm wondering, because 10 indications, 2 comprehensive, 3 would be too much, it didn't add much, it didn't involve me, it even made me lazy, I prefer the didactic ""The Laundry"" ... And the only interesting part, truly, the suicide , did not happen, in a biography, the most relevant and exciting fact was fiction, overestimated ..."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Mank is a newest film from one of best directors working today Fincher and i must say that i liked his latest work but not as much as i was hoping i will.Lets start with Oldman who was brilliant here as title character and i woudnt be surprised if he is nominated for best actor.Amanda,Lilly and Charles were also great here and they give good acts expecely Amanda and Lilly both of which surprised me.Story was little slowish at some times but i was able through without big problems.Tehnical parts are amazing ,entire look of film is beautiful,colors are brilliantly mixed and direction was strong.Mank isnt one of best Fincher films but its not awful either"
MANK,11 March 2021,5/10,"The bad: this movie is lacking spark. That's a nice way of saying nothing much happens AT ALL. It's rather ironic that a picture about a classic (jubilantly lauded) screenplay has a problem with it's screenplay itself. This story is DULL.Who can get excited about watching a writer in his room, writing for over 2 hours? I couldnt. No drama. No suspense. No mystery.Not any good? It is not a bad picture, because the acting is good, although not anything out of the ordinary. The photography is good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary either.Conclusion: I expected more from this brilliant director David Fincher. What I got was dull and lacking spark. Such a shame..."
MANK,20 April 2021,6/10,"""Mank"" (2020 release; 129 min.) is a biopic about Herman Mankiewicz, who wrote the screenplay for ""Citizen Kane"". As the movie opens, we are in ""Victorville, Ca, 1940"", and Mank arrives at the Valley North Ranch, a dry ranch where he will recover from a broken leg accident while writing the script from scratch, and at Orson Welles' insisting, within 60 days. We then go back to a flashback at ""Paramount Studios, 1930"", where Mank is hanging around with other studio people, and he runs into Marion Davies, the lover of William Hurst... At this point we are less than 15 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from director David Fincher (""The Social Network"", ""Gone Girl"", among many others). Working from a script of his late dad, Fincher looks at the life and times of the notorious script writer Herman Mankiewicz. Given Fincher's attachment to the movie, and all of the other top talent that is associated with it, not to mention that this film has garnered 10 Oscar nominations, my expectations for this were admittedly sky-high. And there certainly are some great aspects to the film: the cast, led by Gary Oldman as Mank and also featuring some real choice roles for Amanda. Seyfried (as Marion Davis) and Lily Collins (as Rita Alexander), is terrific all around. Even better is the spectacular old style B&W photography, as if literally this film was made in the 1940s. Also outstanding is the original score by long-time Fincher collaborators Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, who on this occasion forgo their usual electronic score, and instead bring a 1940s style orchestral and at times jazzy score, just beautiful. And last but certainly not least is the film's jaw-dropping production design, just wow. So what is the matter with the film? In one word: the script. I' sorry to say but the story simply isn't compelling and at no time did I find myself emotionally connected or invested in the film. That is a fatal flaw for any movie. While the film did get 10 Oscar nominations (more than any other film), I'm going on record that I'd be surprised if this wins more than 1 or 2 Oscars (Production Design; Original Score).""Mank"" is a Netflix release, and hence it received a very brief and limited theater run last November (and I missed the film) before it became an exclusive on Netflix (which I don't have). Thankfully, due to the 10 Oscar nominations it received, it was rereleased in theaters for another short run, and this time I did not miss it. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay: exactly 7 people including myself. That is in line with most movie screenings I have seen in the last 7-8 months, which typically tend to attract 5 to 10 people. The rest of the movieplex resembled a ghost town. I have no idea how theaters can operate profitably like this. If you have any interest in Herman Mankowiecz or simply are a fan of David Fincher's earlier work, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can but you better hurry), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
MANK,8 December 2020,4/10,"Mank is Director David Fincher's chronicle of Hollywood writer Herman Mankiewicz's (Gary Oldham) contribution to the Citizen Kane screenplay which was released in 1941. Shot in black and white with an anachronistic jazz score, the film begins in Victorville, CA where Mank is recovering from a severe leg injury after a car accident. Assisting him is his secretary Rita Alexander (Lily Collins) and housekeeper Fraulein Freda (Monika Grossman). He also receives visits from the Kane producer, John Houseman (Sam Troughton) who worries whether he'll be able to finish the script in time.
One can understand why Fincher decided to make this movie as his late father Jack wrote the screenplay and the project was in the works for years. But I think it was mistake on Fincher's part to have done a film focused mainly on Mankiewicz-yes there were flashbacks depicting the various Hollywood luminaries with whom Mankiewicz interacted beginning with the advent of sound in motion pictures around 1930, but this might have been much better as an ensemble piece (including more detailed points of view from characters such as Orson Welles, who gets remarkably short shrift here considering he was the creator of Citizen Kane).
But the larger mistake was to believe that Mank could be considered good fodder for a full-length dramatic film. This is borne out by just how slow-moving and dull the Mank narrative appears on screen. Mank himself, a curmudgeon and alcoholic, is hardly a likable enough character to sustain interest for the full 131 minute running time. Nor does the screenplay barely convey any of the charm (or idiosyncrasies) of the previously alluded to luminaries including Louis B. Mayer and William Randolph Hearst.
Interestingly enough, it's made clear Mankiewicz's portrait of William Randolph Hearst and his actress companion for many years, Marion Davies, was an exaggeration, decidedly fictional in nature. Mank even goes so far to apologizing to Davies (in one of the truly good scenes in the film) for creating negative portraits of both her and Hearst in the Kane screenplay, in which he basically admits that he used this false portrait as a means to restore his career.
Well not quite. Mank still believed that Hearst had betrayed the progressive values (so ably highlighted in the first half of Citizen Kane) by becoming a right-wing reactionary. One cannot criticize Mankiewicz for taking such a tack but it's the way in which he went about ""taking down"" Hearst in Kane, which basically amounted to a ""cheap shot."" Despite its technical wizardry, Citizen Kane becomes an ordinary melodrama in the second half when Kane (Hearst) becomes a pathetic, withdrawn recluse, haunted by the memory of his bad childhood (ironically represented by his pet sled, Rosebud).
It's as though Mankiewicz was projecting his own failings onto his fictional (second half) Kane character. Just as both Mank and Welles pretended to themselves that they were ""above"" the real-life Hearst (and their Kane amounted to some kind of tragic figure), Fincher treats Mank the same way! Indeed in one of the most significant scenes in the film, Mank, while completely inebriated, tells Hearst off (while his guests cannot tolerate the diatribe and begin leaving in droves) at Hearst's San Simeon estate.
Fincher actually wants it both ways. On one hand, his script acknowledges that Mank used Hearst perhaps to restore his career, and his self-destructive tendencies amounted to a portrait of some kind of tragic figure. But at the same time there is the implied tacit admission that the Citizen Kane screenplay was one of the greatest screenplays ever written in American cinematic history (regardless of Welles's contribution). So Mank gets the full Netflix (substitute Hollywood) treatment in a biopic in which he's a tragic self-destructive sourpuss but also deserving of accolades as a towering figure of a screenwriter.
Fincher attempts to buttress Mank's reputation through various flashbacks in which he exaggerates Mank's affiliation with progressive causes (in reality, Mank was not the progressive firebrand whom Fincher makes him out to be). Much is made of the obscure 1934 California gubernatorial race which pitted socialist Upton Sinclair against his conservative Republican opponent. Louis B. Mayer (along with MGM Executive Irving Thalberg) lines up against Sinclair and Mank attempts to have Davies convince Hearst to squelch a doctored documentary that besmirches Sinclair's reputation (that of course never happened).
Fincher trots out a complete fictional character, Shelly Metcalf (Jamie McShane) who supposedly betrays his principles by directing the bogus documentary much to Mank's chagrin. The coup de grace occurs when Metcalf commits suicide, again implying (falsely) that this was a big disappointment to Mank (allegedly such a progressive).
Worse yet are all the tedious machinations at the Victorville ranch house where Mank is slaving away to complete the Kane screenplay. More false information about Mank is conveyed when it's explicitly stated by housekeeper Freda that Mank was responsible for helping 100 families escape Nazi Germany after contributing money (in reality, he donated money to help refugees but hardly was responsible for directly saving so many lives).
Gary Oldham is saddled with a script that holds its protagonist up as thoroughly unlikable. Tuppence Middleton can do little with the role of Mank's long-suffering wife, Sara, who has little to do throughout, except basically berating Mank for all his self-destructive tendencies. Only Tom Burke as Orson Welles has the interesting (albeit very small) part in which he argues with Mank over whether Mank deserves screenplay credit at film's end.
Ultimately Fincher holds Mank up as a Hollywood icon despite his self-destructive tendencies. Both Mank and his screenplay deserve recognition as part of Hollywood history but are hardly worth the full blown treatment afforded here."
MANK,22 March 2021,4/10,"There's nothing Hollywood loves more than itself. Every year the Oscars are riddled with mediocre films (that often go as far as taking home the trophy) simply because they are based on the subject of film-making in one way or another. There have certainly been some bad cases of this over the years but 'Mank' has to be near the top. This is a well below average film that is getting by simply based on the Hollywood-appeasing story-line, the fact that many have seen it due to it being on Netflix and finally that David Fincher's name is attached to it.The film just has nothing interesting to offer. You could say it is a character study - and it probably is - but if the character doesn't have any drama or tension surrounding what they're doing it is still extremely tedious to watch. The first hour of the film for example is basically just prodding around the fact that he needs alcohol in order to write. Exciting stuff.I've read that Fincher makes his actors do dozens, even hundreds, of takes of certain scenes in order to exhaust them and take earnest out of their performance. I feel like Oldman's performance really struggled because of this. He seemed like he was trying to give extreme amounts of energy to the role, but just didn't have anything left in the tank to do it. He was still good, but I'd suggest he's no chance of taking home the Oscar for this reason.Amanda Seyfried has to consider herself lucky to be nominated. She does almost nothing note-worthy throughout the film and is only skating in because Best Supporting Actress is always one of the weakest categories on the night year in, year out.I found 'Mank' extremely hard work to get through. It never captured my interest at any point and felt extremely overlong and stretched out. There are much better films out there to spend your time on."
MANK,5 December 2020,,"MANK is pretty much sensational. The story of Herman Mankiewicz' writing the script for what would become CITIZEN KANE is also a story of Hollywood's power system. Anyway, Gary Oldman is mesmerizingly wondrous as Mank, a witty, smart-ass alcoholic who's a so-so success in tinsel town because he can't keep his mouth shut and he eventually pisses everyone off. He writes the script after a car accident and he writes it alone. Orson Welles swoops in after receiving the first draft and tries to wrest it away from him so he can put his own spin on the story (and take sole writing credit).The background of this shows the Hollywood of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies, and pushes its powerful grasp into the world of politics when Upton Sinclair runs for governor of California. Ultimately, Mank has a Pyrrhic victory by winning and Oscar (with Welles) for Kane but basically never works again.Amanda Seyfried plays Marion Davies with, as one review put it, world-weary effervescence. I was a little put off by her slight Noo Yawk accent but she captures the essence of Davies, although Davies stammered in real life (but not in this film). Charles Dance plays Hearst as royalty and Arliss Howard plays Mayer as a putz. Oh, and the one time Oldman pronounces Davies' last name he reverts to British and says DAVIS.The look of the film (B&W) is totally stunning and perfectly captures the era. A definite must-see film."
MANK,5 January 2021,5/10,"5/10 - as someone not very knowledgeable on older film history, I did not connect with this story and was routinely bored throughout the 2 and a quarter hour runtime"
MANK,26 December 2020,5/10,"Hollywood producer, screenwriter, co-author of Citizen Kane and fall down drunk Herman Mankiewicz hated Hollywood and we are thrown tidbits of his disdain for it in this gossipy tinsel town bio that has a field day with established ogres like Mayer and Hearst while doing a Kane redux on the character of Marion Davies.Boy wonder Orson Welles (24) is about to make his film directing debut and he contracts Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) to write the screenplay. Holed up with a broken leg in a dusty outpost with two assistants and the occasional visit from John Houseman to monitor his progress and sobriety he commences to work in fits and starts, with flashbacks aiding the process.Drunk that he is Herm is nevertheless the noblest man in Hollywood with the sharpest wit who has a unique way of devastating foes and alienating bosses and their conservative ""Red Scare"" tactics. He has a wife that can quickly forget and forgive his wasteful and drunken ways as well as put upon caretakers when it is revealed he is a minor Schindler. Albeit a self destructive one that deserves absolution.The film does have a sleek glistening period look but it soon calls attention to itself while eating up precious time with the worst moment coming very near the close at a costume party at San Simeon. Here the ubiquitously inebriated HM is allowed a six minute tirade that would get him tossed out of a waterfront dive after two no matter how altruistically slurred he tosses off. Mank is 90 proof mediocre."
MANK,8 April 2021,7/10,"Behind the scenes at the conception of Citizen Kane, as dictated by a fast-talking screenwriter who drank and gaffed his way out of a lucrative career in big-studio Hollywood. Herman J. Mankiewicz is said writer, a broken lush of the highest degree, who agrees to take the gloves off for a scathing cinematic shellacking of the famous William Randolph Hearst with the understanding that he'll remain anonymous. Wunderkind Orson Welles is happy to take the credit in his stead, then furious when the author has a change of heart and decides to stand behind his work after all.Most of the story occurs during flashbacks, as Mank reflects upon his working life, grows increasingly resentful over the series of slights and missteps that led to his current predicament, and pours that sense of vengeful truth into the script. In his prime, he was a real cad, quick-witted and outspoken, a colorful product of the times even in warm, sepia-hinted black and white. Gary Oldman does characteristically well with the part, fluctuating between loud, biting humor in the heat of the moment and uncertain self-doubt in the softer personal breaks after he's removed foot from mouth, but it often feels like a beefed-up supporting role and not a lead in the traditional sense.All the historical flashbacks are stuffed with references and name drops, an embarrassment of riches for classical cinephiles (or even fans of 20s and 30s cultural notoriety) that assumes an awful lot of existing knowledge from the viewing audience. If you aren't already sure who Hearst, Marion Davies and Louis B. Mayer were, you'll get a few strong hints, but you're going to miss a lot of implied depth. Speaking personally, I just recently finished a biography of Hearst that pretty well set the stage, and I still felt overwhelmed at times.A lot of work went into getting the sights, sounds and textures of depression-era California right, and in that respect it's a slam dunk for compulsively-obsessed David Fincher. Mank really feels like an immaculately-restored film from the golden age, which serves as beautiful compliment to the towering old backlots, sprawling palatial estates and smoke-cloaked executive offices which house most of the action. The screen shimmers and shines, even as the plot fails to change gears. It's a series of rich scenes left searching for a spark; the implication of menace without the arrival. As a historical fanboy, I was delighted to devour it, but as a moviegoer, I felt a little under-served."
MANK,25 March 2021,4/10,"I saw this movie because I almost always see every film nominated for Best Picture. I know the Academy loves movies about showbusiness and/or the movies. The examples of this type of thing are legion from All About Eve to The Artist. I enjoy films about the artistic process, or Hollywood, as much as the next cinephile but I am deeply surprised that this film has been such a nomination powerhouse. It is such a shallow and sour film. I know Fincher making a film from his father's script is a feel good story but let's try to look at texts on their own merits. Most of the problems stem from the script; it is a vaguely competent backstage drama that details-with a hefty dose of fiction-Mank's and Hearst's relationship leading to the writing of Citizen Kane. It has a few clever lines and Mank-the character-is a fun curmudgeon. But the script does not delve deeply into its source material and inspiration. The film is largely told in flashback-because Kane is. Unlike in Kane the decision is that shallow. It is mere homage. There's no greater narrative purpose I could discern. I find this utterly perplexing as an obvious choice was open to the scriptwriter. Welles and Mank-famously and as mentioned in the film-disagreed greatly over who wrote what on Kane. If the film was to be told in flashback centering the competing narratives of Mank and Welles was the stronger choice. It functions as a reason to have the story in flashback and retains the unreliable narrator(s) of Kane; it is would been a stronger homage and a deeper technique. Likewise, I was largely annoyed by how the script tried to force Mank into a Kane-isque story arch but only dealt with the surface level of Kane. The film is about the writing of Citizen Kane but seems to think that Kane was a just flashy film. Similar, Mank-for all his engaging persona-is a mere dysfunctional writer, down to the alcoholism. (This may be truthful to the real Mank but the film contains so much fiction I don't see the point of being authentic here). The film has such a basic and blinkered view of the writing process. Now other features are lackluster as well. Oldman-who is his charming chameleon self-side I didn't find any of the acting all that strong or memorable. The technical aspects are polished but only vaguely the result of a budget not inspiration. Fincher-director-has made far more alive films and this work seems as workmanlike as Benjamin Button was-which was Fincher's other shameless Oscar flick. I honestly don't get the love for the films. It is the Manos; The Hands of Fate of movies about Citizen Kane."
MANK,28 December 2020,1/10,"This film start with a bunch of people arriving at the ranch house, and the introduction of the main character ""Mank"" scene! As turnout, this film is about the process of Mank writing the screenplay of ""Citizen Kane"", and he eventually won the Oscar Best Screenwriter award with ""Orson Welles""! Entire film quite slow, and full of super annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the receiving phone call scene, overuse of the blackout scene, and overuse of the close-up book's title scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Mank receiving his award after the Oscar ceremony! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
MANK,19 December 2020,7/10,"Looks at the writing of the script of Citizen Kane by Herman Mankiewicz (Oldman) and his arguments with everyone about the screenplay and the corruption directed from the powerful players - Hearst and Mayer - to ensure their republican candidate gets in.Wonderfully playful script and a lively characterisation by Oldman ensures this is an intelligent but fun insight into the golden age of Hollywood. Helped in no small measure by an impressive number of supporting characters incl Charles Dance as Hearst, Seyfield as Marion Davies and Sam Troughton as John Houseman. The script does stray a little into flowery Aaron Sorkin mode from time to time, but this is a small quibble in an otherwise enjoyable Hollywood story."
MANK,4 December 2020,6/10,"The Fincher brothers are the intellectual version of the Coen brothers. That being said, The Coen brothers will probably always make more money. Why? Because US movie audiences are traditionally not erudite (and 90% of them don't even know what that word means), conventional, and prone to sex and violence. The Finchers have bravely gone where few others fear to tread in Hollywood; to the intellectual part of our collective brain in the audience. Kudos for bravery and an earnest attempt to scale Mount Stupid in Hollywood. I like Gary Oldham, but not as an intellectual; I think he was miscast. The filming was quite correctly done in black and white, but the lighting was a bit too dim for my tastes. I really don't want to feel as if I am dying while I am watching the screen. The San Simeon scenes were well done and accurate according to my Uncle Arthur, who was a waiter there for 23 years. He kept a lively journal with over 200 anecdotes which he left me. He retired to San Diego. I did not care for the time hopping and flashback sequences; they might be confusing to the average viewer. Also, it might have been more interesting to see how the career of Herman developed. We know how Joe's developed, but this was supposed to be a picture about Herman. Actually, Joe was a better writer than Herman. Mixing politics and careers is usually a bad idea.; ask those who were blackballed during the McCarthy era. If you want to be a communist; fine; just keep it to yourself. If you want to be to the right of Adolph Hitler, like Louis B Mayer and William R Hearst; fine; just keep your views to yourself. I personally met Patricia Hearst in NYC a few times during meetings several years ago after she headed Hearst Publications, and she was a charming woman, who never gave a hint of her political views. I had always respected that from people in power. But back to the review: the performances are top-notch, although a few are over the top. But, hey, this is Gary Oldham, king of over the top. Here he is the most restrained I have ever seen him. Citizen Kane angles have been done to death in the last 20 years, as Hollywood has become less and less original. At least the Fincher brothers are a breath of fresh air, and I look forward to their other projects. (how about a film about Joe for a sequel?)"
MANK,4 December 2020,9/10,"""Have you ever heard the parable of the organ-grinder's monkey?""After six years, David Fincher is back.With Mank, Fincher and his late father Jack tap into a sense of nostalgia for Old Hollywood that doesn't feel loving, but rather refreshingly cynical and spiteful, just like its main character. Although the film can sometimes be unbalanced under the weight of its many subplots and storylines, Gary Oldman turns in another brilliant performance as Herman Mankiewicz. If there's only one reason to see this film, it is him. He toes the line between sanity and eccentricity so well, as Mank and his values are put through the ringer and he constructs his unique revenge against the opposing system.But the real unsung star of Mank, the best thing about it, is the filmmaking and technical brilliance of it all. From frame one, we don't even get ""Netflix presents"", but rather ""Netflix International Pictures""; a minority of frames boast imperfections and cigarette burns; the sound design feels like it's bouncing off an old fashioned movie hall when in reality, I'm just sitting on my couch; every new scene features a scene heading; Erik Messerschmidt's gorgeous cinematography and lighting (no surprise given the former gaffer's previous work on Gone Girl); and Reznor/Ross strike gold again with an amazing throwback of a musical score.And then there are the story similarities to Citizen Kane. Whether telling it's story through flashbacks, or providing and account into the mind of Mank, or even having its own Rosebud moment, Fincher relies heavily on your knowledge of that film to pay off so many big and small moments here as well as provide some insight into the making of the script beyond what's already been famous. I can't wait to see all the general audience be confused and/or bored by Mank simply because they don't know what a Citizen Kane is. But you might need a refresher if it's been a while.Overall, Mank is a great start to what looks like a packed end to the moviegoing year. This would have looked gorgeous to see on a big screen, but it's a technically brilliant film nonetheless, and makes me really excited for the rest of Fincher's Netflix films lying in wait in the future."
MANK,26 February 2021,8/10,"A fascinating look about what supposedly went into 'Citizen Kane'.'Mank', a biopic about screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, is a very good watch. A lot goes on and it's pretty much all interesting to see, admittedly you'd need to have seen the 1941 film. I like that they done this in a non-linear format and in black-and-white, à la in '41.Kudos to the cast. Gary Oldman (Herman) is impressive, I did feel he was overacting - likewise with Amanda Seyfried (Marion) - just a little bit in parts but for the vast, vast majority he (and she) is top notch. Arliss Howard (Mayer), Lily Collins (Rita) and a few others are also pleasing to watch."
MANK,20 March 2021,7/10,"A fascinating portrait of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The only reason this movie avoids being boring is by its quick pacing and energetic, witty dialogue. The movie is definitely not for everyone and I'm surprised I sat through it all."
MANK,13 January 2021,6/10,"David Fincher's (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo/Seven) recent Netflix release is a love letter to his father (Jack wrote the script) about Citizen Kane's infamous alcoholic screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz (played by Oscar winner Gary Oldman) who at the adherence of the wunderkind director, Orson Welles, cranked out a screenplay in 90 days (scratch that...make it 60 days) while holed up in an out of the way cabin flanked by a nurse & an ace stenographer, played by Lily Collins, while keeping a case of alcohol at bay as a means of enticement, as he recuperates from a car crash (he was the passenger). As he dictates the epic tome, (occasionally visited by Welles right hand man, actor John Houseman, to keep the fires burning) we get flashbacks to his life as a screenwriter on retainer on the studio lot (luminaries of the period were his partners like Charles Lederer, Ben Hecht et al) as they spend their time making bets to pass the time but when they're called in by their boss to report, you can tell they're bs'ing their way through the entire process. We also see him getting younger brother Joseph a job in the movie business as well (he would go on to make All About Eve, Julius Caesar & Guys & Dolls to name a few). Fashioning his screenplay on William Randolph Heart, the print magnate, & his relationship w/a blonde talentless actress, played by Charles Dance & Amanda Seyfried respectively, we see where the through-line of where the Kane persona came from but other than that, this film engorges in the era from which the script was born which is maximum enjoyment for someone who loves the period but as a narrative we see there's way too much at the dinner table as it were, obfuscating the focus this film should be striving for. Not to belittle the presentation since it is of a piece w/all of Fincher's work, highly stylized but laser focused, but here (maybe as a tribute to his father's memory & writing) all the color (sorry it is shot in gorgeous black & white!), atmosphere & the notion of the affair takes a backseat to all the coming & going of characters & situations that don't play towards anything resembling forward momentum leaving this viewer begging the film to 'get on w/it!' If you want a better insight into the making of what many cinephiles consider the greatest movie ever made watch HBO's 1999 release RKO 281 which had Liev Schrieber playing Welles & John Malkovich playing Mankiewicz which follows this story more coherently & at a fraction of the run time."
MANK,27 March 2021,6/10,"Having recently removed Citizen Kane from my list of shame it seemed only right to follow it up with the critical darling, Mank! Throw in the fact that I've long been a fan of Gary Oldman and it seemed like a surefire recipe for success and eh, sorta? As the credits rolled on Mank I found myself feeling pretty much the same way I felt when they rolled on Kane. This is a very well made movie that is critically well done and worthy of praise but I just wasn't feeling it.It doesn't help that everything about this reads as Oscar Bait. It's a black and white character study about old hollywood and alcoholism based demons that had to be 'conquered' in the name of greatness that would last through the ages. The Academy LOVES that stuff and I'm sure this will get nominated for all the awards it possibly can, it may even win a few but that doesn't change the fact that this whole thing felt emotionally hollow to me. And it's not because of the Oscar Baiting or the fact that it's poorly done or anything. I actually think it feels hollow because it doesn't do enough. It's a movie about demons plaguing the talented people of hollywood back in the day and that is definitely not new ground. Hell, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood did it last year and did it well too.I think that's the crux of it really. You put Mank out on an island, all by it's lonesome and it's probably a great movie. Suddenly take away that island though and put it in the seemingly endless chasm of similar stories and it just doesn't feel different enough to separate from any of them. Now, I've been told this improves on multiple viewings and that may be the case but even if my standing on it changes in any significant way I really struggle to imagine a world where Mank is talked about with any sort of reverence in 5 years time.Anyhow, on to the recommendation. I honestly feel as though I have to give this the same outcome as Citizen Kane itself. For the average viewing public there's no real need or draw to watch this. There are so many other movies to be seen before ever making it to Mank and I can't imagine it being all that significant to people without a knowledge or at least passing appreciation for the legacy of Citizen Kane. For the movie buffs, this is more of an academic viewing than anything else, a chance to look behind the curtain a bit on a classic bit of cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. Fortunately, as a Netflix original that means it's readily available to just about everyone though so for those with the urge to watch it, there's not much stopping you."
MANK,15 March 2021,3/10,"I don't like to write reviews before I have finished the movie, but I've tried nearly 4 times to watch this one all the way through and I have only gotten to an 1hr10min. It's such a dull ride, which is such a shame, and incredibly odd considering it's a David Fincher film, and his films are often so interesting. The cinematography is stunning, love the black and white old Hollywood vibe, but it feels so artificial and so self absorbed it's hardly any fun to watch, and it's quite painful at times to be honest.My Rating: 3.25/10"
MANK,5 December 2020,1/10,"For some reason whenever there's a movie about or centering around Orson Welles he's always a villainous man-child, and this is no different... In real life, Mank was Welles's favorite scriptwriter and they loved each other but here they eventually become pitted enemies...Also, something about these Hollywood period pieces: They don't build a story about a person like Mank so we can get to know him and learn about him, which needs to happen since no one knows about him except hardcore movie fans... Instead there's this conceited drollness that assumes we're gonna love the character right off the bat because he's so... conceited and droll and sarcastic...Here they shove this boozing anti-hero in our faces without explaining what he's up against, or why he's a boozing anti-hero in the first place... It's as if the audience will adore him since it's Gary Oldman being directed by David Fincher... This Self-Aware Cinema, refusing to do any real work to enlighten the audience, is just tiresome...For a cinematic guy like Fincher, this entire movie looks and feels like a cable movie, which it is, actually, during a pandemic without theaters... And that's not entirely bad because the best stuff is on the small screen nowadays...But there's also a lack of urgency that Fincher's provided in the past, and the whole thing, again, plays out like yet another hatchet job against Orson Welles... Making it seem like Randy Hearst is still in charge of things, and...Don't you all know, it was WELLES AND MANK who toppled that braindead regime?"
MANK,6 December 2020,4/10,"Much as I wanted to like this film, I didn't. Even if I love B&M movies of the 40s, sharp dialogues and I watched Citizen Kane at least three times.I liked the photography playing a tribute to Citizen Kane, with dark, cavernous, sinister settings and also the few moments when Tom Burke (as Orson Welles) was on screen, which was not often enough.We're supposed to believe that drunkard Herman Mankiewicz, brother of the more famous and accomplished Joseph, was actually the only scriptwriter genius behind C.K. The plot twist is that Mank used to be an entertaining figure in Randolph Hearst entourage, but the relationship turned sour and Mank wrote Citizen Kane as a revenge.Mank had a reputation as a witty man, but none of his scripts were successful and his career was second rate. However in Fincher's version, Mank takes center stage and writes the Oscar-winning script while recovering from an accident and temporarily drying out.The story is told in innumerable flashbacks from which you gather Mank was a resentful drunk who unleashed his sarcasm on everybody and thought he was entitled to a better career. Unfortunately, he seems moved only by envy and I felt no sympathy.Besides the occasional sparkle, since most characters in the movie are completely forgotten, it's hard to understand fully the circumstances. The only clear things are that Mank himself did not deserve a whole movie and 2/3 of this are a snooze-feast."

Now this film's is the screenplay is imperfect but the is a masterclass in acting by Gary Oldman"
MANK,5 December 2020,10/10,"IN BRIEF: David Fincher's magnificent homage to the Hollywood Golden EraJIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Mank is a great film. Brilliantly directed by David Fincher, the film not only captures its era to perfection, but it celebrates the essence of filmmaking and the creative process in general. It is a monumental achievement, especially for film buffs and those who see this cinematic media as a valid art form. Some moviegoers might not truly appreciate its impact unless they have prior knowledge about film history, most specifically, one of the greatest films ever made, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. The connection to that 1940 classic is the direct inspiration for Mr. Fincher and his crew and they replicate the look and aura throughout their movie. It is magnificent in its execution and a thought-provoking testament to the art of filmmaking.Mank tells the story of Herman J. Mankiewicz, an alcoholic screenwriter, who sets out to write an indictment of wealthy William Randolph Hearst and the corrupt Hollywood system by teaming up with the unorthodox enfant terrible Orson Welles to make a little movie called Citizen Kane.Technically, the film is one of the best examples of artistic expression of this or any year. The glorious b&w cinematography by Erik Messerschmidt becomes an impressive homage to Welles' masterpiece with its stark lighting and use of chiaroscuro effects resembling that earlier film. Donald Graham Burt's production design dramatically evokes a long gone era. Kudos to him and Kirk Baxter's concise editing. His use of montages is excellent and aligns with Welles' film. The period costumes by Trish Summerville showcase the glamour that dreams were made of and the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adds a lyrical and haunting atmosphere to the festivities.The cast is exemplary. Gary Oldman, a tad too old for the role, plays the boozy writer and he is superb. His one lengthy drunken tirade at a sumptuous dinner at San Simeon is a masterclass in acting. Providing solid support are Lily Collins as his loyal assistant, Rita, and Tuppence Middleton as Sara, Mankiewicz's long-suffering wife. Playing more recognizable personalities are Arliss Howard as L. B. Mayer, Tom Pelphrey at Herman's talented brother, Joseph, Ferdinand Kingsley as Irving Thalberg, Tom Burke as Orson Welles, and Charles Dance as the villainous Mr. Hearst. All are terrific. Yet the most memorable performance is delivered by Amanda Seyfried as the tragic Marion Davies. She invokes an air of vulnerability to her character and yet a savvy survival instinct. This is, by far, the actress' personal best and she just may garner much attention at award time.The script, written by Mr. Fincher late father, Jack, is so wonderfully crafted with marvelous insightful dialog and many rich characterizations of the Hollywood elite of the 30's and 40's. The story does follow that non-linear structure many filmmakers seem to overuse these days and one does have to adapt to the breakneck flashbacks that come frequently. Still, the end result is so worthwhile, even if the end credits fail to add details and tie up the loose ends of some of the supporting characters' careers. (Many moviegoers may not know about the careers of some characters unless they research these people's lives. After all, this all happens some 80 years ago, even though there are current links to the divisive political climate and endless propaganda that still goes on today. History does repeat.)But it is Mr. Fincher who has crafted his best film to date and he has made some other gems. (The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, Zodiac, and Gone Girl are just a few examples of his growing legacy.). He expertly plies his craft to recreate Hollywood's Golden Age and brings his large cast of characters to life by never simplifies his narrative. His mantra: there will be no trivializing here and any moviegoer experiencing this film must be attentive and learn.Mank will be seen as one of Mr. Fincher's finest directorial achievements in an illustrious career. This is masterful filmmaking, the likes of which you may not see for another 80 years. Do not miss this masterwork! (GRADE: A-)"
MANK,7 March 2021,6/10,"Mank is, in many ways, a very uninvesting film. I cared very little about the story of any of the characters. It's impressive on a technical level, but that's it."
MANK,6 December 2020,6/10,"""We're expecting great things"". I was too, especially since I just finished watching a David Fincher film. Fincher is diverse, dark, and talented. He's a director that has been known to touch greatness (just watch 2007's Zodiac and you'll know what I mean).Anyhow 2020's Mank is my latest review. It was released in November by Netflix and is filmed in black and white. Truth be told, Fincher gives us one heck of a gimmick here. Watching Mank is surreal because it feels like you're literally taking in a flick from the 1940s. The lighting, the set design, the sound editing, and even the opening credits really bring you aback.Starring Gary Oldman and featuring a stirring musical score from a couple of Fincher veterans (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross), Mank runs a languid 131 minutes. Minus the solid performances and a bit of the whimsical, I felt like I was taking in a less entertaining version of The Aviator.So yeah, Mank is filled with flashbacks while being choppily edited and/or all over the place. David Fincher who's normally a supreme storyteller, loses a little bit of his focus here. There's a lot of scenes where the concept of point a to b almost doesn't exist. Added to that, Mank is dialogue-driven and it is dialogue-driven in the most recyclable way.Mank chronicles screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. Herman co-wrote the infamous Citizen Kane but that sort of takes a backdrop. Mank is more about Mankiewicz the man and less about his involvement with ""Kane"".Mankiewicz was an alcoholic who died young at the age of 55. Oldman channels him brilliantly but where's the stuff where Mankiewicz is doing some actual writing. Fincher sees him more as a drunken depressive who's witty, opinionated, and off the cuff. I liked Mank's technical prowess and old worldliness but I'm going with a mixed rating."
MANK,9 December 2020,8/10,"An exceptionally well-written screenplay by Jack Fincher for a biopic on yet another talented scriptwriter. Both are dead. Jack Fincher was the father of David Fincher. If they give a posthumous Oscar for a screenplay writer, he deserves it, and it is sad that this was his only work for films. I have never read his essays or his other published work. I will now attempt to locate and read them. Great talent. David Fincher' casting of Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried was very astute, both delivering Oscar winning performances. I have always felt Ms Seyfried (whose birthday I share) had great potential for more meaty roles ever since I viewed her in her second and unfortunately little discussed film she worked in called ""Nine Lives"" (2005). Finally, kudos for the cinematography of Eric Messerschmidt, (or is it Director David Fincher?) who seems to have borrowed a lot of visual ideas from Konchalovsky's award-winning Russian film ""Paradise."" Charles Dance, who plays William Randolph Hearst, seems to reprise his role as director D. W. Griffith in the Taviani brothers' equally remarkable film on Hollywood called ""Good Morning, Babylon"" (1987). Though I am not a die-hard David Fincher fan, this is his best work for me."
MANK,6 December 2020,7/10,"This movie was very well made, occasionally miscast, breezy and fascinating. Much of what it shows was long ago proven to be bull, but never let the truth get in the way of a good story."
MANK,12 December 2020,5/10,"I'm not saying it's a bad film it's just not for me. I don't mind black and white films, I just don't like the story, I don't find it particularly interesting but maybe cinephiles will love it."
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"Overall, I'm a bit disappointed with this film, technically it's flawless, Acting is top-notch but the script is never engaging enough. In spite of the homage this film pay to Citizen Kane like the cinematography and the narrative style, it never really come close to what makes Citizen Kane epic. When you compare Mank to Citizen Kane it's only then its main flaw comes to light.Citizen Kane is an epic story filled with multiple flashbacks and multiple point of view but it's the framing device of ""Rosebud"" that keeps the audience anchored. Mank by comparison, has no anchor. The story skip back and forth throughout Mank's life with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and it's difficult to tell what exactly the movie is trying to tell about its troubled protagonist. The cause of rift between Orson and mank, could have been an effective central conflict and anchor for the audience, but it's resolved as soon as it pops up.
The performances are world-class esp Gary Oldman's, his portrayal of the brilliant washed-up alcoholic writer Herman Mankiewicz is terrific and award-worthy, Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies is excellent, John Burke as Orson Weller is well-casted, he's got the voice and the whole mannerisms right, I'd have love to see more of him. Charles Dance as William R. Hearst is memorable as well.
The cinematography is first-rate; the B&W is a nice throwback to the 30s/40s movies, the production design, costumes, sets all felt authentic to the era. I also enjoy the fantastic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, as it fits the atmosphere and does it job.Overall, Mank, in terms of craft, presentation and technical aspects, it's very impressive but as a story, it's a cold movie that is a struggle to connect with, on a deeper level. Technically brilliant but emotionally distant."
MANK,10 December 2020,8/10,"... just as CK wasn't, so if you enjoy expending time and energy reviewing and commenting on a work of fiction as if it were moulded and forged from the past verbatim, you really need to reconsider how you approach and view the world of cinema and film - perhaps life in general! Perspective, interpretation and imagination are the keywords and, on this occasion, it helps if you have an interest or familiarity with some, not all, of the characters portrayed and the products of their toil and travails - as this will definitely impact your view on the rendering which, in my opinion, was enhanced by a spectacular performance from Gary Oldman, further elevated and reinforced by three stunning constructions from the supporting ladies and embellished with my ability to acknowledge fact from fiction in the name of entertainment. Watch a documentary or read a biography if you want to be educated!"
MANK,17 December 2020,2/10,"Mank - C- (Disappointing)I love a good old Hollywood movie, or movie about old Hollywood. I recently watched Secret Window and Gone with the Wind for the first time and absolutely loved it. Now here Mank had everything renowned director, actors, budget and Studio but it failed miserably.Netflix movies don't get screened or get tested for audiences gives directors free hand which can be a blessing but somehow for a curse for Netflix. As they throw money at all big directors and actors, they bring their half baked ideas which no studio will make bring to Netflix. There is a reason very few Netflix original movies people still remember or regards as masterpiece. Mostly good Netflix movies are the ones they bought from festivals than they actually sanctioned. Considering Netflix makes around 300 to 400 original movies this is truly sad that they don't respect their audience to make something good rather than just paying big names enough money so they can slap their names on just about anything to drop every Friday.Mank was an absolute pain to watch as story didn't make any sense at all. Promoted as how Citizen Kane was written, the movie actually just follows Mank back & forth being washedup alcoholic through financial crises, MGM politics and inner workings of studios. He is writing something, which everyone keep saying it is a masterpiece but that's about it you get about Citizen Kane.This is the most disappointing movie of the year for me considering the technical achievements, budget, Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Charles Danes and above all David Fincher's return to director's chair after Gone Girl and Mindhunters. It was just a ramblings of an old alcoholic man for 2 hours. Gary Oldman's performance was good but nothing extraordinary. His performance was overshadowed by incomparable Charles Danes and enchanting Amanda Seyfried every time they share screen.I can understand David wanted to honour his father's story, which he wrote many decades ago but his refusal to acknowledge todays audience and make sure it reaches people's hearts and mind is unforgivable. It was like a vanity piece on the name of art for his father. That's about it!!!"
MANK,27 November 2020,7/10,"""Mank"" from David Fincher is a Netflix production. This provider of streaming services has produced a couple of good films the last few years, such as ""Roma"" (2018, Alfonso Cuaron) and ""The Irishman"" (2019, Martin Scorsese). For Fincher it was his first feature film since ""Gone girl"" (2014), and a very different film then the ones I have seen from him thusfar. Apart from ""Gone girl"" I have seen ""Seven"" (1995), The game "" (1997) and ""Zodiac"" , all films with touches of crime in it. The script of ""Mank"" is based on work of the father of David Fincher, Jack Fincher.For me ""Mank"" is above all an ode to the Hollywood studio system at its peak in the late '30s and early 40's, just like ""Blancanieves"" (2012, Pablo Berger) is an ode to the silent movies and ""The artist"" (2011, Michel Hazanavicius) to the early talkies. Not that Hollywood is depicted as a sort of heaven on earth, see the malicious manipulations with respect to the election of the governor of California in 1934, but in the other mentioned films the sun does not always shine either.The main character of the film is Herman Mankiewicz. A perfect role of the versatile Gary Oldman. Herman is the older brother of director Joseph Mankiewicz (1950, ""All about Eve"") and has been somewhat forgotten. He has (co)written the scenario for films such as ""Dinner at eight"" (1933, George Cukor), ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming) and above all ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Orson Welles).In the 70's film critic Pauline Keal wrote an article in which she claims that the scenario for ""Citizen Kane"" was not a co production between Welles and Mankiewicz but actually written solely by Mankiewicz. This theory has since become obsolete. As a matter of fact I think that the article of Keal has to be interpreted in the context of a discussion she was involved in with the directors of the ""Nouvelle vague"". These directors saw the director of a movie as the author of the movie. Keal saw a movie as team performance. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. The relation of a director to his movie is different from the relation of the writer to his book or the painter to his painting. Nevertheless the director still is the central point where all the creative decisions converge.Does ""Mank"" try to revive a theory which has already been found incorrect? I don't think so. The films ends with the first draft of the script, which is the point in time where the role of Mankiewicz ends and the role of Welles begins.The subject of the film is the making of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Orson Welles). ""Mank"" tries to do that in the style of this film. Therefore ""Mank"" is (of course) in black and white. The film uses also many flashbacks. The present is Mankiewics working on his script in a remote country house, the numerous flashbacks tell the story of his Hollywood past. In one respect ""Mank"" falls short of his subject film. In ""Citizen Kane"" we get numerous opinions (and thus a multi facetted image) of Charles Foster Kane. In ""Mank"" we see all the action through the eyes of Herman Mankiewicz himself."
MANK,3 February 2021,,"When one considers a bio-pic based on the life of a writer, one always has to keep in mind that said subject became noteworthy because of their ability to spin tales and to synthesize ""facts"" to suit their compositions. This is particularly the case when approaching a movie about a scribe such as Herman Mankiewicz who was well known as a raconteur - and fabulist. Jack Fincher's (Director David Fincher's father) screenplay not surprisingly has flights of fancy both small (creating some minor characters) and large (making Mankiewicz into some sort of socialist sympathizer).
Nicknamed Mank (played by Gary Oldman), he was a famed screenwriter here summoned to write a screenplay for Hollywood's new wunderkind, Orson Welles (Tom Burke). The film was to become CITIZEN KANE. Welles's contract allowed no credit to be given to Mank. The author is laid up with a broken leg in the California desert town of Victorville. A secretary (Lily Collins; charming) takes dictation and Producer John Houseman (Sam Troughton) acts as an intermediary between Mank and Welles.
Fincher Sr.'s script, unsurprisingly, takes cues on how to tell it's story by aping Mank's own draft of CITIZEN KANE. There are flashbacks, a large cast of characters/witnesses and is quite conscious of its style. Much is made of Mank's personal relationship to William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance; quite fine) who served as the model for Charles Foster Kane. Jack Fincher passed away in 2003, so there is little doubt a lot of tinkering has occurred in bringing it to the screen. Still, it's quite clear that Jack's thesis is that Mank was the chief (and maybe ONLY) author of CITIZEN KANE.
MANK is a very well produced movie. The Production design by Donald Graham Burt makes great use of what remains of the big studio locations including Sony Studios (which was MGM at the time) to give a sense Hollywood's golden era. Where set design and decoration can't do the work, there are also significant visual effects which are tastefully integrated. Less successful are the Music and Cinematography. Composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross try to keep to the period with their score, but, classical composition isn't their forte (compare to Bernard Herrmann's music masterpiece in KANE itself). Erik Messerschmidt's Cinematography has also been over-praised. It's rendered in B&W, but if it's supposed to look like a 40s film, why is the aspect ratio 2:20 and not 1:37? And, the digital grain doesn't work at all. All the post-production computer wizardry can't hide the harsh clarity of the Red Ranger cameras used - and, what is up with all the lens flares? Did J.J. Abrams oversee the lighting?
The acting ensemble is very good with Oldman delivering a fully lived in performance, even though half of it is bed-ridden. Amanda Seyfried is excellent as Hearst's mistress Marion Davies. She brings a vigor to what is, in general, a very placid picture. Burke isn't very convincing as Welles, but, to be fair, he is given so little to do for most of the movie, that when the big scene with Mank occurs, he hasn't had the opportunity to convince us of his take on the legend. There are too many to mention in the ensemble, but special mention also to Tom Pelphrey (as Mank's brother) and Arliss Howard as Louis B. Mayer.
Still, as immaculate a movie as MANK is, there seems to be something lacking. The pacing is languid and there is little of David Fincher's usual energetic direction. It's as if he allows the period setting to remove tools from his filmmaking kit (ironic also, for Orson Welles is famous for his line, ""This is the biggest electric train set a boy ever had!""). MANK isn't KANE, of course, but, it's still too staid for its own good. While it is understood that the thesis of this movie is from Mank's POV, it still feels like David Fincher is evading the crux of the issue - the relationship between Mank and Welles. When we finally get to that meeting, it feels like too late and far too little. It makes the whole seem like a cheat.
Movies like MANK are rarely made any more in what's left of Hollywood, so it's still a cut above the usual big screen material, but, it's unfortunate that it feels so passionless."
MANK,15 December 2020,3/10,"Mank feels like an experiment to see if hardcore film buffs and fans of old Hollywood would enjoy prequel-style ""member berries"" as much as the geeks of the world. The whole film is bursting at the seams with references, and prioritizes those over telling any kind of compelling story. To someone like me, who is not a film scholar that reads up on Hollywood history and has only seen Citizen Kane once, it was nearly incomprehensible. There are clearly so many references to things that happened at the time, and people who were famous back then, but I could not track who was who and what they had to do with the story being told. The bigger problem was that the plot of Mank didn't make me care enough to find answers to my questions. If this were a more cohesive and well-told story then I could see myself delving deeper and researching more about Marion Davies or Charles Lederer. Perhaps I would even feel deeply compelled to watch Citizen Kane again to catch all the references. But about halfway through, the only thing I was looking up was how many more minutes I had to watch before the movie would end. What should have been an interesting look behind the scenes of one of the most iconic films ever made, actually managed to be boring.Mank is deeply hindered by the fact that it wants to emulate Citizen Kane. The non-linear storytelling is much too chaotic, and denies us the needed time that could possibly make the protagonist a relatable character. Instead I found Herman Mankiewicz to be a loud-mouth drunk that was utterly devoid of charm. Even when he's in the right and his anger is justified, I found it hard to root for this man, because he was so unpleasant. I suppose Gary Oldman delivered the performance that was expected from him, but I found it quite underwhelming and cliched. Even the look of the film came across like a winking reference rather than an authentic recreation. Perhaps it's just because I recognize so many of the actors and I'm used to seeing them in color, but watching this film in black-and-white just felt like looking at one of those old-timey photos that you get at an amusement park booth. It's a cheap facsimile that looks much too pristine to actually feel real. Even the fake cigarette burns digitally placed on the screen are just one more detail shoved in to make Mank a faux classic. I'm already the type of person who hates prequels, and add to that the fact that I'm a film watcher not a film scholar, so that makes Mank a movie that did nothing but disappoint me."
MANK,13 December 2020,7/10,"Movie night with Iris.A lot of the Kane-stuff is clearly signposted, and perhaps more interesting is the Trumpian overtones with the 1934's Californian election race. This is Churchill Oldman, and i found his Mank a clownish drunk rather than a tragic one. It's Seyfried as wide-eyed Davies, who really steals the film.For the geeks Fincher is obsessive in his replication of aged film, and imitating Welles' flashy montages and wild swings of the camera. But there's an artificiality to it, a strange kind of self-awareness. If you love Kane, you'll enjoy this. Otherwise not one for the non-devotees."
MANK,28 August 2021,5/10,"Based on a true story: Herman J. Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) was a co-screenwriter of the masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"". The film chronicles his struggles with alcoholism and a broken leg as he writes the first draft of the film on his own. Earlier flashbacks show Mankiewicz mingling with actress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) and her lover William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance), a media tycoon who was allegedly the inspiration for ""Citizen Kane"".""Mank"" must be praised for its superb production values. The black-and-white cinematography, score, set decoration, and costumes brilliantly take the viewer back to another era and create a very unique atmosphere. The story has various fascinating aspects including the political and cultural climates of California and Hollywood in the 1930s and early 1940s. But it seems to be accessible mainly (maybe only) to those who have at least a minimal amount of knowledge of ""Citizen Kane"" and its captivating behind-the-scenes history. There are also too many subplots that seem to go nowhere.While the first half seems engaging, the second half disappoints. This is most evident in two contrasting scenes that take place in the Hearst mansion. The earlier mansion scene of an elaborate party is absorbing with intelligent discussions on a California gubernatorial race among other things; the later mansion scene (a dinner party) is torturously long with a seemingly endless drunken rant.By the end, the viewer knows too little about the main character. This is ironic as ""Citizen Kane"" gave a perfectly thorough exposé on its main character. Also, considering the importance of the Hearst character from a historical perspective, the characterization in the current film is disappointingly minimal.""Mank"" is sadly an over-rated disappointment that could only be appreciated by film buffs but not necessarily liked by them. - dbamateurcritic."
MANK,26 December 2020,5/10,"Being ordinary is something both Welles and Mankiewicz hated and this film does them wrong. It's not a bad film, simply ordinary. There's nothing much to complain about, nor to rave about. It's simply ordinary."
MANK,24 December 2020,7/10,"Mank. If ever you were yearning for yet another journey into the gloriously corrupt, straight-laced, sleazy, sexy and scotch-fueled universe that was Old Hollywood, welcome back. Mank is the story of a historic writer and his tumultuous dance between alcoholism, writing one of the greatest films ever made and advising the propaganda campaign against rising political star Upton Sinclair. In more than one instance, this true story mirrors Citizen Kane and probably just as Mankiewicz himself wanted it to. Mank isn't about anything we haven't seen or known already about Old Hollywood, but it is the style and visual scope that is fabulously captivating. This ok is pure David Fincher. He's made yet another movie that looks like a work of art. His deceased father Jack writes a screenplay that's so smart and snappy. Welles would have blushed. Despite all of its triumphs (and there are many) be advised that this is a slow 2 hours. A really slow 2 hours. Fincher lets these scenes breathe and I respect that. But if that's not your cup of tea, you will be underwhelmed."
MANK,11 February 2021,7/10,"When I first saw the trailers for Mank (2020), the premise intrigued me. As a ""behind the scenes"" look at the screenwriter for Citizen Kane (1941), I was interested to see his process in penning one of the most famous screenplays of all time. On top of that, I've generally enjoyed David Fincher's work and wanted to see this movie based on this fact alone. However, despite all it had going for it, I was ultimately disappointed in what Mank had to offer.Perhaps the most jarring part of this movie was how it tried to emulate the style of the films from the 1940s while also using more modern cinematography techniques to tell its story. At times, this juxtaposition made me wonder if this was filmed in the '40s or if it was merely a black-and-white modern film. Additionally, there's a particular visual style for Fincher's films distinctly lacking here-which may have been in part due to the monochromatic approach. I'm more familiar with the darker and nuanced movies in his repertoire like Gone Girl (2014), The Social Network (2010), and Seven (1995), and Mank hardly fit my preconceived notions for a Fincher film.Don't get me wrong; there was still plenty of good acting here. Gary Oldman seems to play the lush well, which made his performance in the title role feel like a repeat of his Churchill from Darkest Hour (2017). And while I understood some of the background of Citizen Kane's origins, even my in-depth knowledge of the Hollywood players of the 1940s had some gaps in it. In the end, it dragged in far too many places, which I should have guessed when it decided to jump around the timeline instead of proceeding chronologically. After all, who wants to watch all that excitement, followed by 30 minutes of an injured drunk penning the greatest scrip ever?A slightly disappointing film considering the film that it's about, I give Mank 3.5 stars out of 5."
MANK,7 January 2021,8/10,"Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece CITIZEN KANE is truly a remarkable work of art (especially for the time it was created) and it regularly lands in either the #1 or #2 spot on my list of all-time favorite films (battling back and forth with THE GODFATHER - the one that ends up at #1 is usually the one I have watched most recently), so I am a sucker for films that are about (or around) the making of this classic.And...the Netflix film MANK does not disappoint in this regard.Starring Oscar winning actor Gary Oldman (he won the Oscar for portraying Sir Winston Churchill in DARKEST HOUR), Mank tells the tale of the writing of the screenplay of CITIZEN KANE by screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. It is an intriguing story of a self-destructive, alcoholic artist (is there any other kind in this kind of film) that (ultimately) produces one of the best scripts in Hollywood history, despite (or maybe because of) his condition and the people he interacts with along the way.Directed by David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB) - who is one of my favorite Directors working today - MANK starts slow but brews to a satisfying conclusion as Fincher focuses on the man and the relationships he has with the people around him, rather than the circumstances, which then draws to a forceful conclusion.Gary Oldman is, of course, stellar as Herman ""Mank"" Mankiewicz, the writer at the center of the story. This film hinges on this performance as the titular Mank is in almost every scene of this film - and at the beginning I was worried that Fincher was going to let Oldman revert to his ""hammy"" ways (a very real possibility with Oldman if he is left unchecked by a Director), but Fincher reels Oldman in just enough for him to bring a portrait of a troubled man, who has sold his soul to work and alcohol. This character needs to find that soul if he is to succeed. Since Mank won the Oscar for his screenplay - and I've already stated that I think the CITIZEN KANE screenplay is one of the best written of all time - you know how it will turn out, but it is fascinating (and satisfying) to watch Oldman on this journey.Fincher, of course, is smart enough to surround Oldman with some very good Supporting Actors, most notably the always evil Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister on GAME OF THRONES) as William Randolph Hearst (the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane). Dance spends most of the film observing Mank but in the final ""confrontation"" scene between the two, the screen sparkles as two wonderful thespians throw down.
Others in the Supporting cast - like Lilly Collins, Tom Burke (as Orson Welles), Jamie McShane and, especially Arliss Howard (as Louis B. Mayer) bring heft and the ability to go ""toe to toe"" with Oldman, not a small task.Special notice has to be made of the work of Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies - Hearst's mistress and a character that is used as a ""throw away toy"" in Citizen Kane. Davis and Mank form an interesting bond and the platonic chemistry between Seyfried and Oldman is strong. I gotta admit that when Seyfried first burst on the scene in such films as MAMA MIA and MEAN GIRLS, I figured she was just the ""pretty young Rom-Com girl of the time"" and would come and go quickly, but she has rounded into a very impressive actress and I can unequivocally state that I was wrong about her. She can act with the best of them.The Cinematography by Erik Messerschmidt is also a very important part of this film - as he (and Fincher) attempt to recreate in this film the look/feel of CITIZEN KANE and they pull this off very, very well.If you can get through the slow start of the film - and if you can stomach a protagonist that is not a very nice person in most of this film, than you'll be rewarded by a rich film experience.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
MANK,5 December 2020,9/10,"Mank is one of those films that they can only really release close to the end of the year. A definite one placed for the awards ceremonies with a stellar cast, big name director and ambitious story, this one actually lives up to the hope.We have Gary Oldman as 'Mank', who is the writer of the classic Citizen Kane movie original script, and we have here a movie filmed in a parallel style to Citizen Kane retelling the underlying story to it. Mank is no angel, but you grow to be engaged in this story of his time in a politically charged 1930's, which doesn't paint a fairytale view of the management of Hollywood. If anything, this is practically a film noir.There's no getting round the parallels this story is trying to make about the modern day 'fake news' and media manipulation, but I'll leave the politics out of this write-up for a more appropriate forum. However it's still a thoughtful reminder without shoving any points down your throat.I found the entire story to be captivating, although admittedly a bit tough to follow early on as its dialogue but let's the actions tell the story rather than any direct exposition. Gary Oldman is fabulous in the lead, and surely must be up for Oscar contenders for his sublime performance as the wailing alcoholic maverick screenwriter. However the whole cast is at their peak: Charles Dance as the cold Hearst, Amanda Seyfried as the 'Rosebud' inspiration and especially Tom Burke as Orson Welles are brilliant. Tom Burke's performance is so uncanny it's untrue.It was a brave choice to film this all in black & white, but the whole thing is lush. You could actually watch this whole film without the sound, it's so good just to look at. Add in a wonderful soundtrack and a fine pacing, you have a wonderful film.I just took out a Netflix subscription (yes, I know I'm very late to the party), but I still went to watch this film in the cinema. It was worth it! This film deserves to be seen on a big screen with others. This film is about cinema, and about the light & shade of the world. I really highly recommend this."
MANK,5 December 2020,10/10,"""I know this movie is gonna be amazing, even in the beginning this movie is amazed me especially the editing of the movie, i really like the old movie style that they use here, i feel like i'm watching the 40s, 50s and 60s movie but in the very good quality, this movie is very oscar worthy, Gary Oldman worth to be best actor, and the very unexpectedly Lily Collins I think she should be nominated to best actress or best supporting actress too because she is really amazing in here, and of course best picture worthy, they really choose a great cast for this movie, Tom Burke as Orson Welles is perfect, his face is very look same to Orson Welles and his performance is amazing too, and i really like when they introduce Orson Welles here, all of the perfomance in here really amazed me, the cinematography is solid, it's amazing, it's a long unbored movie, I highly recommended"""
MANK,10 December 2020,9/10,"""Mank"" is a biopic slice of the career of Herman Jacob Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), the Hollywood screenwriter who was the pen behind what is regularly voted by critics as being the greatest movie of all time - ""Citizen Kane"". ""Citizen Kane"" was written in 1940 (and released the following year) and much of the action in ""Mank"" takes place in a retreat in the Mojave desert when Mank, crippled by a full-cast on the leg, has been 'sent' by Orson Welles (Tom Burke) to complete the screenplay without alcohol and other worldly distractions. Helping administer to his writing and care needs are English typist Rita Alexander (Lily Collins) and carer Fraulein Freda (Monika Gossmann). However, although Mank produces brilliant stuff, his speed of progress exasperates his 'minder' and editor John Houseman (Sam Troughton). (Yes, THAT John Houseman, the actor.)In developing the story, we continuously flash-back six years - - nicely indicated by typed 'script notes' - - to 1934 where Mank is working at MGM studios for Louis B. Mayer (Arliss Howard) and mixing in the circles of millionaire publisher William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and his glamorous young wife, actress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried). Allegedly, the ""Citizen Kane"" script was based on Hearst. But what souring of the relationship could have led to such a stinging betrayal during those six years?Mank has an embarrassment of acting riches. Mankiewicz is a fascinating character: charismatic, reckless, passionate and the definition of a loose cannon. Basically, a dream for a great actor to portray. And Gary Oldham IS a great actor. After doing Churchill in ""Darkest Hour"", he here turns in a magnificent performance as the alcoholic writer. Never more so than in a furious tirade at a dinner table late in the film, which will likely be the equivalent to the Churchill ""tiger"" speech come Oscar time. Surely, there's a Best Actor nomination there?Equally impressive though are some of the supporting cast.Tom Burke - so good as TV's ""Strike"" - gives a fine impersonation of the great Orson Welles: full of confidence and swagger. It's only a cameo role, but he genuinely 'feels' like the young Welles.Amanda Seyfried: It took me almost half of the film to recognize her as Marion Davies, and her performance is pitch perfect - the best of her career in my view, and again Oscar-worthy.Arliss Howard for me almost steals the show as the megalomaniac Mayer: his introduction to Mank's brother Joe (Tom Pelphrey) has a memorable ""walk with me"" walkthrough of the studio with Mayer preaching on the real meaning of MGM and the movies in general. Breathtakingly good.But - I said ""nearly steals the show"".... the guy who made off with it in a swag-bag for me was our own Charles Dance as Hearst. Quietly impressive throughout, he just completely nails it with his ""organ-grinder's monkey"" speech towards the end of the movie. Probably my favourite monologue of 2020. Chilling. I'd really like to see Dance get a Supporting Actor nomination for this.The screenplay was originally written by director David Fincher's late father Jack. Jack Fincher died in 2002, and this project has literally been decades in the planning. Mankiewicz has a caustic turn of phrase, and there are laugh-out lines of dialogue scattered throughout the script. ""Write hard, aim low"" implores Houseman at one point. And my personal favourite: Mank's puncturing of the irony that the Screen Writers Guild has been formed without an apostrophe! A huge LOL!Aside from the witty dialogue, the script has a nuance to the storytelling that continually surprises. A revelation from Freda about Mank's philanthropic tendencies brings you up short in your face-value impression of his character. And the drivers that engineer the rift between Mankiewicz and Hearst - based around the story of the (fictional) director Shelly Metcalf (Jamie McShane) - are not slapped in your face, but elegantly slipped into your subconscious.In addition, certain aspects are frustratingly withheld from you. Mank's long-suffering wife (a definition of the phrase) Sara (Tuppence Middleton) only occasionally comes into focus. The only reference to his kids are a crash in the background as they ""remodel"" the family home. Is the charismatic Mank a faithful husband or a philanderer? Is the relationship with Rita Alexander just professional and platonic (you assume so), or is there more going on? There's a tension there in the storytelling that never quite gets resolved: and that's a good thing.Mank also has an embarrassment of technical riches. Even from the opening titles, you get the impression that this is a work of genius. All in black and white, and with the appearance of 40's titling, they scroll majestically in the sky and then - after ""Charles Dance"" - effortlessly scroll down to the desert highway. It's evidence of an attention to detail perhaps forced by lockdown. (""MUM - I'm bored"". ""Go up to your room and do some more work on that movie then"".)It's deliciously modern, yet retro. I love the fact that the cross-reel ""circle"" cue-marks appear so prominently... the indicators that the projectionist needs to spin up the next reel. I think they are still used in most modern films, but not as noticeably as in the old films... and this one!A key contributor to the movie is cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt. Everything looks just BEAUTIFUL, and it is now a big regret that I didn't go to watch this on the big screen after all. Surely there will be a cinematography Oscar nomination for this one. Unbelievably, this is Messerschmidt's debut feature as director of cinematography!Elsewhere, you can imagine multiple other technical Oscar noms. The tight and effective editing is by Kirk Baxter. And the combination of the glorious production design (Donald Graham Burt) and the costume design (Trish Summerville) make the movie emanate the same nostalgia for Hollywood as did last year's ""Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood"".... albeit set forty years earlier. Even the music (by the regular team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) might get nominated, since I had to go back and check that it actually HAD music at all: it's subtly unobtrusive and effective.The only area I had any issue with here was the sound mixing, since I had trouble picking up some of the dialogue.Although I can gush about this movie as a technical work of art, I'm going to hold off a 10* review on this one. For one reason only. I just didn't feel 100% engaged with the story (at least with a first watch). The illustrious Mrs Movie Man summed it up with the phrase ""I just didn't care enough what happened to any of the characters"". I think though that this one is sufficiently subtle and cerebral that it deserves another watch.Will it win Oscars. Yes, for sure. Hell, I would like to put a bet on that ""Mank"" will top the list of the ""most nominations"" when they are announced. (Hollywood likes nothing more than a navel-gazing look at its history of course). And an obvious nomination here will be David Fincher for Best Director. But, for me, this falls into a similar bucket as that other black and white multi-Oscar winner of two year's ago ""Roma"". It's glorious to look at; brilliantly directed; but not a movie I would choose to readily reach for to repeatedly watch again.(For the full graphical review, please check out bob the movie man on the web, or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"
MANK,10 December 2020,8/10,"""You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave an impression of one.""David Fincher's 'Mank' does an excellent job at that. Exquisitely directed, beautifully crafted, brilliantly stylized, with a superb script and phenomenal acting across the board. Gary Oldman excels as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and Amanda Seyfried, as actress Marion Davies, has never been better."
MANK,21 March 2021,7/10,"I went into this viewing not knowing who Herman J. Mankiewicz was or his impact on cinema from Hollywood's celebrated Golden Age.It left an indelible mark on me for several days unlike many biopics I have viewed over the years.The film is set in the 1930s decade and follows the script development of a film I incidentally reviewed only a few weeks prior, Citizen Kane.I looked back at that review. It concentrated a lot on the brilliant technical skills of 24 year old Orson Welles and director of photography Greg Tolman. However it made no comment on the screenplay origin.Mank does precisely that. Shot in black and white. The monochrome adding ambience to the 1930s period it is meant to portray.Directed by David Fincher, a celebrated director himself behind such films as Seven.The performances by some of the cast are excellent. In particular Gary Oldman. A sixties actor portraying the thirty something drunken Mankiewicz.Other cast members include Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst and Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies, an actress in the 1930s and Hearst's lover.I had no idea that Hearst may have been the inspiration for the Charles Foster Kane character in Citizen Kane.As for Mank itself. It follows several modern day films being displayed in black and white. Although the pristine, digital nature differs from the aged prints of old films from the 1930s!Mank made me want to find about Mankiewicz. Who he was, what he achieved in his life cut short by alcoholism. In that respect perhaps Fincher and his late father achieved their objectives?As for Oldman. What a contrast from the football hooligan he portrayed in a 1980s television film I first saw him in the 1980s, The Firm."
MANK,28 March 2021,8/10,"The backstory behind Mank, the writer of Citizen Kane, what inspired him to write the screenplay, and the struggle he had to deal with from Hollywood giants in order to produce the movie.What I enjoyed the most was the acting, which was good all around. However, Gary Oldman was especially phenomenal as Mank. He delivered the charisma of the character, as well as the conflicts that the character faced.The movie moved at a pretty slow pace. There were mostly conversations and discussion on politics and other movie stuff. There were scenes that felt like one take where the characters constantly talked. Since I wasn't familiar with the politics and other references, I was a bit confused, and felt the pacing was really slow at times.Surprisingly, the movie was watchable even if the audience didn't watch Citizen Kane. However, watching the classic before this movie definitely enhanced the experience and made me understand how why Citizen Kane was made, as certain plot points were mentioned.I also liked that fact that the movie paid homage to the classic by doing a non-linear story telling that went back and forth between the past and present. Also was the black-and-white and acting that resembled movies in the past.Overall, an interesting movie that made me understand and appreciate more the man behind the classic Citizen Kane. 7.5/10."
MANK,17 December 2020,8/10,"Even for younger demographics who haven't seen the classic film Citizen Kane, I feel like the majority of entertainment connoisseurs are at least aware of its existence and cultural relevance. Infamously being known as one of the greatest films to ever be released, it was only a matter of time before a film like Mank was made. Not directly about the making of Citizen Kane, but rather about the life of one man involved in the creation of it, Mank is now streaming on Netflix. Being David Fincher's latest project was enough to get me to watch it already, but I must say, even though I very much enjoyed watching it, it's absolutely one of his weakest films. That's not to say this is a bad film by any means though, because he's just that talented. Here are my thoughts on Mank.The story at hand takes place around 1939, with Herman Mackiewicz (Gary Oldman) trying to overcome his alcoholism as he attempts to write what some people will call his greatest screenplay of all time. With the help of flashbacks to the early 1930s in order to keep you invested in this otherwise thin premise, I found myself taking in the wonderful look and feel of the film, as well as the set pieces. Everything about this film feels authentic for the time period and the central performance by Gary Oldman really makes this film feel a million times better than it is. Yes, the content throughout this film is interesting, but I truly felt that there were about 30-45 minutes of amazing content in a film that's over two hours long. The slower portions of the film were still very, very admirable from a filmmaker's perspective, but I just didn't feel that there was enough meat to the story to call it a masterpiece or anything like that.That may seem like I'm going to be giving this film an average grade, but that's actually not the case. Yes, there is a very limited number of memorable moments from this movie, but I will always remember watching it for the terrific direction by David Fincher and the Black and White tone to the movie, along with the make-up, costumes, and set design. These all made for a film that left an imprint on my mind. These are also the things that most film lovers can get behind while watching Mank, even if they aren't immersed in the film for its story. I wasn't blown away by the content presented here, but I did appreciate learning some behind-the-scenes information about a film that's nearly eight decades old.I think Netflix was the absolute best place for a movie like this to end up in today's day, simply because I believe it would not have reached a wide audience. This is a very niche film in terms of how invested the average moviegoer can be. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane or at least know certain aspects about that film, there will be revelations toward the end of Mank that don't seem all that important. I knew what certain characters were talking about, but only because I've seen Citizen Kane. It's hard for a film like this to garner the attention of a new audience, especially when the backbone is of a film as old as Citizen Kane.Overall, Fincher has made some of my favourites films over the last 10-20 years, so I will always be eagerly awaiting his next project. For me, Mank was one of his weakest outings because it felt the least like his style. That's not usually a bad thing, but I feel that his director's touch is very much present throughout all of his projects, until this one. Yes, the elegance of direction is there and everything about this film is top-notch in terms of garnering awards and things like that, but it just didn't have enough to warrant a best picture nomination, at least in my eyes. I really enjoyed watching Mank for what it was, but I wish the film had a lot more to offer in terms of story. Still, it's a great watch for film lovers and if you were someone who has knowledge of the film Citizen Kane, I absolutely recommend checking it out."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"If you're a cinephile and enjoy the background story of historically famous movies like the 1941 film Citizen Kane you're sure to enjoy Mank as I did..
Garry Oldman is superbly cast as Herman J Mankiewicz who won the only Academy Award that was awarded to Citizen Kane in 1942. He shared the award for Best Screenplay with Orson Welles who played Kane in the film and in Mank Tom Burke gives a superb characterisation of Orson Welles,especially his voice, its eerie.The character of Herman Mankiewicz is another great portrayal of a very brilliant but very flawed man and in some ways I felt there were some similarities in style to Garry Oldman's superb portrayal of Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour.
That's why I'd be surprised if he wins the Best Actor Oscar for Mank in 2021 because he won for Churchill.
If he hadn't won for The Darkest Hour arguably a better role than Mank he would be a certainty and he will certainly receive a nomination.
While I acknowledge that Citizen Kane has earned its reputation as a great film it's certainly not my favourite film of that era. The things I love about Citizen Kane are the imagery that creates the brooding foreboding of William Randolph Hearst's world and the incredible music score by composer Bernard Herrmann.
I read that Mank was shot on RED Monstrochrome 8K cameras, no color version of this film exists.
The acting of course by Orson Welles is superb but in some ways I think the film itself while great art is a tad pretentious.
I mention my appraisal of Citizen Kane because I can't help thinking the same about Mank . I love the monochrome imagery of this film , especially in one scene .
The drunken nightclub scene where Mankiewicz political candidate for Governor is defeated. It's a definite homage frame by frame to Citizen Kane and the films excellent score by Composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is at times very evocative of Citizen Kane and also award worthy.
Herman Mankiewicz died prematurely at age 55 just 12 years after writing Citizen Kane and I'm not surprised considering the dangerous alcohol fuelled life style he led . Its amazing to me that he achieved what he did . The screenplays he contributed to are brilliant in films like Dinner at Eight , The Enchanted Cottage, It's Wonderful World , The Wizard of Oz, Man of the World and his most famous Citizen Kane.
His even more famous brother Joseph L.Mankiewicz who wrote an equally famous Screenplay which many say is the Best Screenplay ever written in Hollywood history ""All About Eve"" (1951) which he also directed .Joseph must have led a more sedate ordered life because he lived well into his eighties. Joseph also wrote and directed A Letter to Three Wives (1950) this gave him a record of consecutive academy awards totalling 4 in 2 years for writing and directing.
Mank is also a talented family collaboration of father and son the late Jack Fincher who commenced writing the script of Mank over 30 years ago in the late 1980's .
Sadly he never got to see his project come to life on the screen as he died in 2003 because the production was delayed by decades and his son David Fincher has skilfully directed the film for Netflix.
Some stand out performances apart from Garry Oldman in Mank are Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst ,not a large role but a possible Best Supporting Actor nomination . Amanda Seyfried is perfect as Hearst's mistress Marion Davies .She was Hearst's pampered magnificent obsession and the very lightly talented Queen of Hearst Castle San Simeon which today is a National Historic Landmark.
Amanda Seyfried was quoted as saying that David Fincher made her shoot one particular scene approximately 200 times, ""for an entire week"", just to get it perfect. She didn't even have any lines of dialogue.
in that scene but she has some great lines in the movie like "" "" Nobody but NOBODY makes a monkey outta William Randolph Hearst! Remember the character Susan Alexander Kane in Citizen Kane who Bernard Hermann composed the famous aria Salammbô well that's Mankiewicz and Orson Welle's characterisation of Marion Davies.
I so enjoyed the scene in Mank where the royalty of Hollywood are assembled for a San Simeon banquet when a drunken Mank enters uninvited to try explain his fictional but unmistakable treatment of Hearst in Citizen Kane its breathtaking and tense and Charles Dance as Hearst says very little but his expression of disdain and dismissal is worth an award.
It's a dinner party I'd love to have attended or just to have been a fly on the wall to witness the event.
I can't help thinking and comparing recent events concerning media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the outgoing President of the United States to Mank just imagine if there was a screenwriter clever and brave enough ( Aaron Sorkin comes to mind) to write a 21st Century Citizen Kane style expose of these two iconic characters that have historically influenced our media perception today.
There's a very telling quote in the film made by Mank which is
attributed to Joseph Goebbels "" ""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.
Sound familiar?
I said earlier I enjoyed Mank I think it's a film that I need to watch a few more times there's a lot in it for me regarding film history. Like "" Citizen Kane "" I think it's very clever but a tad pretentious. I'd be interested to know how audiences ,especially those that are not really into Vintage film history react to this very fine film."
MANK,21 March 2021,6/10,"The movie has a lot of soul, and feels like a genuine passion project. The characters are well written and exelently performed. Camerawork is also astounding. But storywise there is not really much to talk about. It has some nice gimmicks and is well themed. But overall the movie is a little unimaginative and dull.6/10: well made, but is held back by it's core"
MANK,28 December 2020,8/10,"'Mank' is an esoteric film to be best appreciated by an esoteric audience.The audience that is going to get something out of 'Mank' are the film fans well versed in their Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert. I don't think it has much crossover value otherwise except in that it is another showcase for the outstanding Gary Oldman. But as a fairy tale about the magic of make believe and the history of cinema 'Mank' is a highly enjoyable film. I think the great David Fincher understand this because 'Mank' is by far his most whimsical picture. It will stand out in the filmography. Like much of Fincher's work it is on the surface level about obsession. The ironic and delightful thing about 'Mank' is that it is the obsession the audience brings with them to the film.'Mank' is a fairy tale, pure and simple. Even someone with a mild interest in Hollywood lore can tell you that even the bits of truth in the picture have been liberally stretched to fit the narrative. We know that William Randolph Hearst and Louis B Mayer were unsavory characters. Seeing Thalberg portrayed as Mayer's lapdog is especially inaccurate. 'Mank' is a film about a revolutionary against the system and it thinks it's portrayal of Orson Welles as a Hollywood diva puppeteering the drunken depressed Mankiewicz is subversive and deep. If we dissect it down though to the base level does this story have anything close to dramatic stakes? In truth does it really matter who wrote 'Citizen Kane'? Does it take away from any of Orson Welles' technical and acting achievements in 'Kane' if Herman Mankiewicz wrote the film by himself? The only reason this movie has any stakes whatsoever is because we as film fans are placing them there after decades of versing ourselves in the lore. 'Mank' expertly plays to this audience.The beautiful black and white cinematography and sets all feel just a little bit grander and weirder than reality. Perhaps they will remind you of Toland's eye roaming through Xanadu.The film is expertly cast, the supporting cast might be a bigger draw than our lead. Charles Dance, the sly devilish villain of screen and stage is brilliant as William Randolph Hearst. 'Kane' made him a caricature but Dance is a lot more subtle than you would expect.Amanda Seyfried may very well receive an Academy Award nomination for her performance as Marion Davies. Davies is often lost in the 'Kane' myths and debate and has become more of a caricature than Hearst himself. Seyfried lends an eloquence and sadness to the role. She very much showcases that Davies lost her agency and identity when seen as Hearst's mistress and as the basis for Susan Alexander. Ironically for a film about 'Citizen Kane' I feel we get too little of Orson Welles who is played perfectly by Tom Burke. He embodies Welles to an uncanny degree, the big booming voice is especially unsettling. Fincher wisely films Welles like a specter over Mankiewicz. Whenever he enters the film the already surreal nature seems to be magnified.What more can you say about Oldman? Throughout his career he always showcases has tremendous charisma and his chameleon like ability to sink into a character. 'Mank' is no exception. He is most interesting in the fever dream portion of the film where Mankiewicz writes 'Kane' half dazed with a broken leg. These scenes show a vulnerability we seldom see from Oldman who has made a career out of playing bold powerful characters.Fincher has delivered a gift to film fans who still feel wonder watching classics and who still believe MGM has more stars than in the heavens. The people still lighting the candle for such an era are thinning out. 'Mank' will please them and hopefully inspire someone to look back."
MANK,29 November 2020,8/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Before I share my thoughts, a quick disclaimer. Mank will undoubtedly generate quite a divisive response from the general public. Why? From something as simple as the fact that the film is on black-and-white to the crime that is people not knowing a single thing about Citizen Kane (including never seeing it) but still choosing to watch Mank, there will be countless examples of viewers who will watch the latter with terribly unrealistic expectations. Audiences all around the world will find this movie ""boring, uneventful"", and say stuff like, ""I fell asleep five minutes in"", ""another artsy B&W uninteresting film for critics to blindly love"". Some of these comments will unavoidably come from people who just sat on their couch and clicked a random flick that they saw on Netflix.The marketing campaign could never place a pre-requirement to watch Mank, but I can, and I will. As straightforward and honest as I possibly can: if you've never watched Citizen Kane in your life, then either you do it before even opening your streaming service, or please, skip Mank because you'll probably not enjoy it at all. I firmly believe only 1/1000 viewers will like the latter if they have zero knowledge about Orson Welles' iconic movie. Ideally, (re)watch it, and research a bit about its background: what lead to the creation of the film, who was involved, what controversies surrounded the movie... I know what you're thinking: isn't that what Mank is supposed to tell me about? This takes me to one of my issues with the film.There are basically two options in this genre: either the director and/or the screenwriter choose to help the audience follow the story by introducing them to what they will witness, or they jump straight into the narrative itself. Fincher doesn't waste a second helping the audience understand what's happening or, in some cases, who even are the characters. Either the viewers know what they're getting themselves into (like I advise above) or prepare yourself for an incredibly intricate narrative, wholly packed with flashbacks, side stories, and many, many characters.This will be a significant reason why some people will definitely dislike this movie. I researched and studied Citizen Kane to exhaustion, and I still felt lost during some periods due to the overwhelming amount of subplots and its characters. Then, even though the following is connected to one of the aspects I love the most about Mank, there are at least a couple of other characters besides Herman J. Mankiewicz who I wish I could have learned more about, mainly Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) and Joseph L. Mankiewicz (Tom Pelphrey), the protagonist's brother. On the other hand, this also means that despite the high number of characters, most are indeed quite interesting, possessing emotionally compelling arcs.I just noticed I started my review stating my issues with the film, but don't be mistaken: I really, really like it. However, since I'm already here, I might as well let out my remaining problem. So, this isn't close to anything Fincher has done before. It genuinely feels like a remarkably personal project that he surely would have loved to share with his late father, Mank's posthumously screenwriter, Jack Fincher (I'll refer to him as Jack from now on, keeping Fincher related to David). If there's one thing I expected from this movie was Fincher paying homage to Citizen Kane through the technical aspects, including the narrative structure profoundly based on flashbacks to justify a particular opinion, conversation, or event happening in the present.Evidently, Mank follows the exact same storytelling method as Citizen Kane, and despite it being a brilliant decision from David and/or Jack Fincher, the former lets it take over the story instead of elevating it. The flashbacks are mostly earned and well-placed in the narrative, but sometimes it comes across as a mere technical feature exclusively to make that comparison with Citizen Kane, instead of its execution improving the story both Fincher want to tell. Nevertheless, these issues of mine are far from ruining the entire viewing, much on the contrary.When it comes to my number one requirement, Fincher nails it perfectly. I loved getting to know the real-life inspirations that led Mankiewicz to create one of the greatest screenplays of all-time, as well as the shocking (and unknown to me) conditions he had to work on. It's truly a filmmaking miracle to be able to write a masterpiece in the space of two months, being physically and mentally debilitated. Despite the imperfect efficiency of the flashbacks, most develop impactful characters in Mankiewicz's life, and I can't deny that it's a joy for any film lover to see or even hear the mention of some famous filmmakers from that time. Nevertheless, a character is only as great as the actor who portrays it (and vice-versa).Gary Oldman is undoubtedly a contender for this year's Best Actor awards. It would be a major snub for him not to be exhaustingly nominated on every single ceremony. I believe his performance in Darkest Hour as Winston Churchill is more visibly riveting (I've never been so captivated during a war drama before), but his phenomenal display in Mank is hard to deny. From his hilarious yet grounded portrayal of a drunk Mankiewicz to his more sober, sincere attitude, Oldman demonstrates mind-blowing variation, with his physical performance having a notable influence on the overall result. There's no doubt that he carries the entire narrative on his shoulders, and he does it effortlessly.However, Oldman is far from being the only bright spot. Amanda Seyfried can very well get her first serious awards season as the extremely captivating Marion Davies. Seyfried manages to deliver an exquisite balance between the purposefully exaggerated voice mannerisms and Marion's real personality. Tom Pelphrey is also extraordinary as Mankiewicz's brother, whom I immediately researched about as soon as I finished the movie. The intensity with which Pelphrey expresses some sentences is becoming one of his trademark characteristics.I've seen many people talking about these two actors, but Lily Collins (Rita Alexander) portrays my favorite character besides the protagonist. As Mankiewicz's secretary, Lily explores her character in such a heartfelt, authentic manner that, at times, I wished to go back to the present not because of learning more about Citizen Kane's screenplay actually being written, but due to Rita Alexander's interactions with her ""boss"". Their conversations are some of the most satisfying moments of the entire film, and I genuinely cared for both of them.I know that most of my readers probably don't care about technicalities, but if you've been following me for enough time, you know I value the technical aspects when they significantly impact the movie. Well, I dare state that a massive reason why I enjoy Mank so much is the near-perfect technical homage that Fincher pays to Orson Welles' precedent-setting film. From tiny little details like a ""cigarette burn"" here and there (I counted eight, and if you don't know what this means, then you clearly didn't watch Citizen Kane) to similar shot composition, Fincher creates flawless resemblances to the ""greatest movie of all-time"" in almost every scene, including his own version of a ""Rosebud"" moment.This obviously means that Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography is absolutely stunning. Erik previously worked with Fincher on Mindhunter, proving now that his film career still has a lot of ground to cover. Kirk Baxter could very well be nominated for Best Film Editing, and I can easily picture the exact scene the ceremony would show to demonstrate the seamless, clean cuts which make dialogues easier to follow. Donald Graham Burt, who has worked with Fincher since Zodiac, offers an exceptional production design, but it's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score that steals the show for me. Using only period-authentic instruments, Reznor and Ross deliver a rich, unique, memorable tribute to Bernard Herrmann's work.All in all, Netflix releases another massive contender for the awards season, Mank. With the perfectionist, dedicated David Fincher at the helm, his late father's screenplay ends up being Fincher's most personal project so far. It's a wonderful homage not only to Citizen Kane but also to the 30s/40s decades. Technically, every single component is award-worthy: cinematography, editing, production design, and especially the score. Fincher works with his team to deliver impressively similar iconic scenes and precedent-setting technical characteristics from Orson Welles' impactful movie. Outstanding performances across the board, but expect nominations flying the way of Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, and Lily Collins. However, Fincher's identical narrative structure to the 1941's flick sometimes feels just like a clever tribute instead of actually elevating the story. Jack Fincher's screenplay is overwhelmingly crowded with side stories and characters, making it challenging to follow comprehensibly, especially for viewers without any knowledge about the respective matter. Fortunately, the primary mission of representing Herman J. Mankiewicz's real-life inspirations that led to arguably one of the best screenplays ever written is flawlessly accomplished, making Mank a must-see for any film lover, as long as the viewer has at least watched the so-called ""greatest movie of all-time"".Rating: A-"
MANK,10 January 2021,6/10,"Well if your a Gary Oldman fan, that along with some of the recreated Hearst Castle shots might alone carry you through this. You will have to enjoy a film with quippiness; the film says a lot more than it does. The banter might even bear enabling subtitles for us who speak 'merican.Personally, I don't think you necessarily have to be well-versed in the story behind the story, the ""Citizen Kane"" chronicles. In fact, that would detract from the story (the ""based on a true tale"" is almost always a big negative) for me.Spoilers follow possibly...Mank as the rakish rapscallion, the chubby charmer, the lady's man who yet loves his suffering wife, the man who rescued an entire German community and nearly elected the right Californian governor, after a while this felt like a superhero film. Faster than a suicidal bullet...his only fault, that he cares too much?The precarious but affectionate relationships between Mank and the actual Citizen Kane and Kane's Mistress provided the most compelling screen moments. But I think Orson Welles himself put a better Falstaff on screen than our Mank for the People."
MANK,4 December 2020,9/10,"This film works like a time machine back to the very golden age of cinema. Not only is it set up and looks like a film from the decade, no every little aspect and detail fits it perfectly and if you wouldnt know better you would think it is production of those days.
David Fincher did a masterful job and offers one of the best hommages to this era we ever had seen on screen. What Steven Soderbergh tried with ""The Good German"" was brought to perfection by Fincher.
And the film is obviously also a love letter to his later father Jack Fincher who offers this unique screenplay. A Screenplay that feels so unreal in our current era of film as it bears many similiatires to Citizen Kane, the film that is depict here. A great piece of work and Fincher was ambitioned enough not to change any line of it.
Acting wise it is superb. Gary Oldman once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of our time. Here he embodies so many different characters he played int he past and puts it into his Mank which should easily bring him in serious consideration for a well deserved second Oscar. He really gave everything here and will be hard to be beaten this year. Gary Oldman and David Fincher is a collobaration that came very late and hopefully will continue in the future.
Amanda Seyfried also was fine enough. It could bring her a nom, but I dont see a win here. She was good however and more subtle than usual. She fits her role perfectly. Nice support by Charles Dance and especially Arliss Howard with a noteable mention of Tom Burke who gave us a great Orson Wells. Absolutely astonishing cinematography and a score that coudlnt have been chosen better. The film doesnt have too much of a thrilling plot, but it is just like Citizen Kane... it is impossible to portray such an intersting man in just 2 hours, but at least we can get a glimps of it."
MANK,9 December 2020,8/10,But Mank was a great movie thanks to a superb script. I'd never heard of Mank until I ran across it in flipping through Netflix. I think the dialog and acting was some of the best I have ever seen. The black and white color was hypnotic and made me so sleepy I couldn't finish Mank in one sitting. I took two long naps while watching it. I think it will be a long time before I see something this good again.
MANK,10 December 2020,8/10,"""MANK"" is a biographical drama film based on the life of Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. Starring Gary Oldman in the title role and directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, Gone Girl), it takes an unapologetic approach in telling the story of how one of the greatest movies of all time was conceived.In 1940, Herman J. ""Mank"" Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) is recovering from a broken leg after a car accident when he receives a phone call from Orson Welles (Tom Burke). Welles informs Mank that he wishes to recruit him to write the screenplay for his upcoming movie ""Citizen Kane"", after the studio allows the former full control on the project. With only a limited amount of time to complete the entire script, Mank works around the clock to get things ready, all while battling his own alcoholism and creative differences with the Hollywood elite.It's safe to say that those with even the most basic level of cinematic knowledge are aware of the existence of ""Citizen Kane"". After almost eighty years since its release, the film's influence and effect on the movie industry itself still has the power to leave a major impact on first time viewers due to its pioneering storytelling techniques and scathing critique on the upper class. While a film like ""MANK"" may not be the first to dramatise the production of such a monumental film (see ""RKO 281""), it certainly feels like the most essential look into the mindset of one of the people who was instrumental in its creation. What this film succeeds greatly in is bringing to light how this brash, unashamed screenwriter was able to call out many of the higher ups in Hollywood on their BS and helped shatter that image of perfection it tried so desperately to uphold to the general public. We the audience cannot help but cheer for Mank as one by one he ends up clashing with his employers over his creative decisions which ultimately led to him making several enemies along the way. This type of boldness was almost unheard of during that era so this makes it that much more fun for us to watch. It really makes you think of how different things could have turned out for Hollywood had someone like Mank never been involved in the making of this important film.With a director like David Fincher at the helm, you should know what to expect when it comes to his depiction of a character like the title subject here. Something I've always admired about Fincher is his ability to take an otherwise unlikeable character, real or fictional, and have his audience sympathising with them during any misfortunes they may face throughout the story. This is due to his talent in bringing out that spark of their human side, which is something viewers can identify with and make them temporarily forget about any of their negative traits. Fincher, whose late father Jack wrote this film's screenplay, directs very much in the style of ""Citizen Kane"" itself, with a non-linear narrative littered with flashbacks and vignettes. Of course, the most obvious thing viewers will notice right away is that the film is shot in black-and-white with mono sound. This was done to add an air of authenticity to the era this story is set in, complete with specks on the screen and some cracks in the audio. This provides an immersive experience to the viewer, so long as they are familiar with the films from these decades. The one major problem I have with this film, though, is that it may prove too confusing to the uninitiated. Anyone who enjoys cinema from this era will no doubt appreciate the effort Fincher has gone to with bringing it back to life, however, others will likely be scratching their heads trying to comprehend what may be happening. A prior knowledge on ""Citizen Kane"" definitely helps but it does unfortunately place a limit on how many modern audiences will be convinced to watch a film like this.It practically goes without saying that Gary Oldman is in fine form yet again, having given consistently great performances for over forty years now. Here, Oldman uses his versatility and a surprising lack of makeup to bring to life an individual like Herman J. Mankiewicz in a raw, reckless, and challenging light that audiences just can't look away from. It's hard to say where I would rank this role among so many others, though I would easily place this in the top ten. Worth mentioning as well is Amanda Seyfried as actress Marion Davies, whom Mank strikes up a friendship with. It seems that Marion was one of the few people Mank didn't intentionally try to make enemies with during his tumultuous time of rubbing shoulders with the Hollywood executives and this serves as a reminder to the audience that he was still a human being who enjoyed a positive connection with other people.As the film industry continues to evolve and change its scope, a film like ""MANK"" serves as a reminder that this has been happening for several decades now. It proves that we have a need for people like the title character to take risks and prevent creativity from stagnating. Naturally, this kind of approach has shown that it comes at the cost of making many powerful enemies but it also shows that if things are successful, the results will speak for themselves. If you ask me, modern cinema needs a new Mank-like figure to speak up against the Hollywood of today and at this stage it's only a matter of time before we get one.I rate it 8/10"
MANK,9 December 2020,7/10,"If you Google ""Mank,"" you will quickly learn about how this was David Fincher's passion project, how the script was written by his late father, etc. In other words, there are many meta stories about this movie...which is itself a meta story about another movie. But if you can stop obsessing about the story of this film and the story of Citizen Kane, you might just enjoy this film. It could not be less like a typical Fincher project. No serial killers. No fancy effects. No color, even. But even with a movie that truly felt like something from the 1940s, I was pretty riveted. The cast (especially Oldman) is amazing, the writing is sharp, and the flashback structure left me eagerly awaiting Mank's own personal rosebud. It was a little undercooked at points and got started slowly, but it was still beautiful and worth watching.Now back to serial killers."
MANK,24 December 2020,7/10,"Once upon a time, screenwriter and journalist Jack Fincher crafted a script for a biopic centering on hasbin screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. Intended to be directed by his son, acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher, the film never came into fruition for over 20 years, even passing Jack's death in 2003, until the late 2010s when the project was officially announced, with Gary Oldman starring in the lead role. Released to critical acclaim and audience appraisal, the ends seemed to have justified the means for this project to finally see the light of day. But how does it hold up after so many years in limbo?The film's main narrative centers around famed yet alcoholic screenwriter Mankiewicz, whose career in 1930s Hollywood connects to his written draft of ""Citizen Kane."" As this is a character piece focusing on the events of Mank throughout his time in the motion picture industry, there's so much worth unraveling. Whether it'd be Mank's personal demons throughout his life, the corrupt bosses he works for at MGM, or even his own opinions on the famed political businessman William Randolph Hearst and his mistress Marion Davies, it's clear that his career was met with so many encounters of hardship. The way the film structures these events is through flashbacks of Mank during his time working under big named people, and present day showcasing him crafting draft 1 of Citizen Kane. The flashback sequences showcase Classic Hollywood at its peak when major studios were thriving, as well as the people behind it like Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, and yet Mank is depicted as just another writer. It's no wonder the audience would feel for Mank as a cynical grump towards the bigger dogs.As for Gary Oldman portraying Mank himself, he is able to create internal and outer despair both in the past and present. His alcoholic tendencies may have destroyed his reputation as a sophisticated man of show business, but his clever craft of script structure made his contributions to the revolutionary Welles film justify the means. Outside of Mank's conflicting relationship with his family, including young brother Joe and wife, and the studio big wits, his more standout relationship centers around Marion Davies, who was more trustful and intelligent than the public gave her credit for. In addition to Amanda Seyfried capturing her personality through her spunk and thoughtfulness, Davies just happens to be connected with the powerful Hearst, for she still has a mind of her own and her conversations with Mank are quite charming and friendly. It makes their time together feel more genuine than the pretentious politics that surrounded Hollywood back then, since it becomes a contrast of the corrupt conservative executives and the more free thinking liberal minded artists.Given the film is set in the 1930s, it is also recreated to the look and feel of an old timey black & white movie from said time period. Not only is Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography look authentic to how those older films were presented through grainy cameras, but the sound design adds that extra spice of believability with a bit of muffledness and less clean audio as opposed to the modern day stereo. In a way, Mank feels to fit the time period a lot more than most biopics set in a specific time period around Hollywood. In addition, the setting of 1930s Hollywood looks phenomenal with the scope and scale courtesy of production designer Donald Graham Burt, who made every possible location in the motion picture industry look like a relic of that time period. Based on their past collaborations with Fincher, composers Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross have a quaint balance of upbeat jazzy tempos and very somber grim scores to reflect the film's more dramatic moments. Coincidentally like Kane, there was more than one artist to make this experience memorable.Now it's no doubt that Mank is certainly a thrilling experience, but one thing is for certain once you watch it on Netflix. Considering that it's still debated whether or not Welles himself wrote a single word in the script for Citizen Kane, ever since Pauline Kael's controversial Raising Kane essay, this film does reflect the Mankiewicz side of things more than the Welles side. However, one thing that can be said for certain is that Mankiewicz was really only one piece of the puzzle to a film that would influence people for decades. So whichever side you agree with, take this biopic with the utmost grain of salt possible."
MANK,25 March 2021,5/10,"When a movie about writing the screenplay for the ""greatest movie ever"" doesn't get a nomination for best screenplay, you better look out. 10 nominations in all, though. Take all the articles and essays written about this story, put in a blender and voila. Even if you are familiar with the subject, it's still hard to keep up. It does, however, capture ""old hollywood"". That's enjoyable. Hey matthew."
MANK,17 December 2020,7/10,"So it's agreed Citizen Kane is a masterpiece. It made Welles famous and infamous. Directing, Producing, Starring and writing. The writing was a joint(ish) effort though. Shared with Herman J. Mankiewicz. He rarely gets a mention and this is perhaps why Fincher has chosen to tell his story in Mank and however this turns out I'll forgive it for giving me reason to watch Kane again. The writing of Kane is a well known topic with any cinephile. Welles is known for taking the credit. Mank had to fight for his credit with RKO and eventually got second billing, despite being responsible for the genesis of the screenplay. It's true though that Welles brought a lot to the table, adding his own scenes and more than likely crafting it in a manner that Mank would never have taken it... maybe. Who knows? This is all a bit of guesswork. Everyone tells their own story, but it's certain Mank doesn't get the praise he rightly deserves. Back to the film. First of all it has to be noted that this is gorgeous to look at. It's made in a classic 40s style and I'm staggered at how well it works. Surely it's shot in black and white and hasn't be graded? I'll have to find out, but either way it's absolutely beautiful. The sound too, there's a subtle tone that makes it feel like it was captured on arcane equipment on a sound stage, it's lovely. Now I left out the origins of Citizen Kane in my review of that film. Knowing that much of that would be covered here. The inspiration for Kane's character was a friend of Mank's, William Hearst, played here by Charles Dance. But I'm jumping ahead, Mank (Gary Oldman) is set the task of creating a screenplay in 60 days by Welles (Tom Burke... who nails the voice), but before that... are you spotting a theme? Yes, we've a fluid timeline a la Kane. It works well here, in fact I think it would suffer if it were simplified. It playfully skips around, introducing characters and the Hollywood machine. Mank is a player, but an alcoholic one. The lovable drunk with a head full of ideas. Citizen Kane is a life story in 2 hours and this is the same. It doesn't compare, Mank himself doesn't have the range of the fictional Kane. But back to the inspiration. Hearst may have been Mank's starting point, but the character grew, thought now to be an amalgamation of up to four people, Kane came to life on the page, both Mank's and Welles'. It's quite remarkable it feels coherent with so many cooks. I guess Welles' final cut status helped, both in pulling it all together so well and fortifying his creative genius mantel, albeit at the expense of Mankiewicz. It's good to see the focus on Mank here though. Welles is a bit part. This essentially tells the story of Mank's world, his experiences and how he brought that to Citizen Kane, with hefty doses of the political undercurrent that surrounds Mank and how they subtly manipulate Kane's fiction. ""Write what you know"". Oldham is fantastic as the poetic plain talking writer. Sticking to his political guns, even at the sake of his career as we build to a fitting finale. It's dramatic and entertaining, with several memorable set pieces, namely whenever Oldham is let loose with a monologue. I don't imagine that this is for everyone though. On its own it'd struggle, only with the context and a love of Kane, could you love this. I don't love it, but I did really like it. In fact, I could happily watch it again right now. A movie for movie lovers."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"I love David Fincher's films. I haven't seen all of this but from the ones I've seen, I can tell he is a very talented director. Mank is yet another brilliant film by him but it is certainly not one of his best.Mank shows 1930s Hollywood through the eyes of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he writes the script of Citizen Kane.This was easily in my top 5 most anticipated movies of 2020. It's been six years since Fincher's last film and for Mank to be starring Gary Oldman and revolving around Citizen Kane and old Hollywood made me extremely excited. With Mank finally releasing on Netflix, I can say he did it again but it's one of his more divisive films.Mank is a very different Fincher film and I appreciate him for trying out something beyond his comfort zone. Its subject matter and content won't interest a lot of people and so this film is mainly targeted towards cinephiles. Like The Social Network, Mank is a very talky film. It is mainly dialogue driven and moves at a leisurely pace which may put some people off. I wasn't ever bored during the film but I wish the pacing would speed up at certain points. It's certainly not as engaging as some of his other works. I should also mention how most of the film doesn't even focus on the battle between Welles and Mankiewicz over Citizen Kane. The film rather puts its attention on Hollywood and its relation with politics at that time which was interesting to listen to and learn about.What I absolutely loved about Mank was its presentation. There is so much detail and care put into the overall look. The black and white felt very suitable, the costume design was great and I loved how the sound quality was adjusted to sound like how it would during the 1930-40s. I also loved little details like random cigarette burns appearing, something that's found in many old films. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was so different from what they normally do but I thought they did a great job and it matched perfectly with the time period. It truly impressed me how much effort was put into making the film feel like it was from that period of time. I also liked how the structure of the story was reminiscent of Citizen Kane.The acting was solid throughout. Gary Oldman did a great job and may possibly get a Best Actor nomination. I thought Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins and Tuppence Middleton were fantastic in their roles. Charles Dance was also extremely good here as William Randolph Hearst. Tom Pelphery and Arliss Howard were equally amazing and the rest of the cast did a fine job with each of their roles.All in all, I enjoyed Mank for what it was. The attention to detail in recreating the 1930-40s style of film was extraordinary and Jack Fincher's screenplay was pretty solid. This is easily going to be a frontrunner in the Oscars next year. Out of all the Fincher films I've seen, this is his least accessible and my least favourite so far. I admire its craft but it's not something I would want to watch again anytime soon."
MANK,4 December 2020,9/10,"Mank is one of the most fincherisque movie he made eventhough the plot is not similiar to his usual ones. Great performances by everyone and great cinematography. Overall, I loved it."
MANK,20 December 2020,6/10,"I had been looking forward to seeing this film. When you like movies, then movies about movies are double fun. In this case the subject looked promising: the making of Citizen Kane, regarded by many as one of the greatest movies of all time.But I was dissapointed. 'Mank' dives deep into 1930's Hollywood. Perhaps a bit too deep, because the viewer needs to know the ins and outs of the studio system and all the big players, in order to really appreciate this film. And even when he does, the story in itself is a bit thin. The film is essentially a portrait of Herman Mankiewicz, who wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane. But the parade of Hollywood people he deals with, is not very exciting and sometimes even confusing.A part of the film is also dedicated to politics. It draws a parallel with the present when it shows how Hollywood studio MGM produces film clips with misleading information, in order to let the Republican candidate win. An interesting observation, but it makes the story even more complicated.On the plus side is the beautiful cinematography of the film. It is shot in black & white, in the style of the era, and it looks simply superb. But that's not enough to make this film appeal to an audience that goes beyond die-hard fans of Citizen Kane."
MANK,15 February 2021,7/10,"Gary Oldman's Mank writes in a booze-filled haze, drawing on memories of his years of friendship with William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and the magnate's mistress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) to create cruel parodies of them in his script. Orson Welles (Tom Burke) makes only a small contribution to the writing process, we're told, although he shared the Best Original Screenplay award, the only Oscar KANE won despite going on to be hailed as a movie masterpiece.Like the 1930s pictures it evokes, MANK is very theatrical, more talk than action. Oldman is at his seedy and brilliant best, and Seyfried invests Marion Davies with more depth (and talent) than she is usually credited. Writer/director Jack Fincher gloriously recreates the spirit and the texture of the era of Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg, Hollywood's Golden Age. A splendid tribute to a high spot in cinema history."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"I wasn't sure how satisfied I was with Mank halfway through, but the central theme of a small group of powerful men controlling many areas of life shone through late in the movie. There is little to quibble with technically - the score, cinematography, and direction are all excellent and strongly evocative of 1930s Hollywood. Oldman is excellent as Mank, bringing out the quick-witted rebelliousness as well as an underlying dedication to his craft. I also quite liked Seyfried's performance and would see her as a deserving Best Supporting Actress, and I also loved Hearst's speech with the monkey allegory at the end of the movie. The moments that are most meaningful in Mank are those where we see the immense power taken for granted by the powerful men in the film, studio heads and Heart, juxtaposed with the powerlessness of everyone around them. Those men know they can do whatever they want, and everyone else has to adapt to their desires. Mank is seen as a loose cannon because he doesn't always abide by these hierarchies and social expectations, which puts him in difficult situations. It's hard for him to make the films he wants and get the credit he deserves, and there is a constant sense of pressure for him to churn out work. He clearly is a man who cares deeply and is thoughtful about the movies he writes, and turns to alcohol in part due to the ever-present pressure he feels to produce a script. Mank doesn't fall into generic tropes, which could have easily happened with Seyfried's character being a trapped pretty young airhead, or Mank being a man driven to depression through external pressure. Instead, we get more nuanced portraits - Mank still finishes the script and it is exceptional, and he even gets the credit for it, but he never writes another movie and dies 11 years later due to drinking, feeling like he was trapped (presumably within the power structures of the industry) and could never really escape. The governorship race was an interesting allegory to throw in as we see how little people in power care about all people's wellbeing - they just want the system that allowed them to be at the top to continue. Oldman is really great and drives home the challenges Mank faced as a good but imperfect man caught in an unpleasant power structure. I am curious to see how Mank does - I imagine it'll get many nominations, but could it win BP? Regardless, this is a film that I will not mind if it cleans up at awards season (though I have very high hopes for Nomadland)."
MANK,3 January 2021,,"""Mank,"" David Fincher's interpretation of the back story of ""Citizen Kane,"" the classic film based on the life of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, employs two of the same technical devices as its subject: flashbacks and moody black-and-white cinematography. The excellent Gary Oldman is cast against age and nationality as the title character, screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz who wrote the ""Kane"" script with Orson Welles and according to Fincher deserves at least as much credit for the final iconic product as co-writer and director Welles. Perhaps Fincher and Co. felt that if Oldman could pull off Winston Churchill in ""Darkest Hour"" he could do anything, though there must have been many other actors closer to Mankiewicz's's actual age at the time who could have done just as well. Oldman rises to the challenge and with the help of careful lighting and camera angles molds his sixty-something self into a dissipated thirty- and forty-something self, tastefully munching the scenery all the way.The single worthy and sensible point the film gets across is that the character in ""Kane"" that is supposed to be based on Hearst's consort Marion Davies is actually and intentionally based on the public's inaccurate perception of Davies rather than on the actual Davies, whom Mankiewicz knew well in real life. Davies was not the talentless concubine featured in ""Kane."" Any perusal of her YouTube clips easily puts that myth to rest. But the ""Mank"" script, written by David Fincher's late father Jack, also portrays her as a sort of old-timey Brooklyn ""goil,"" the type of character she may have been in her teens, but certainly left behind by the time she achieved major Hollywood stardom and became lady of the San Simeon manor. Additionally, the Fincher narrative asserts that by the mid-1930s her movies had been losing money for ""ten years"" which is nonsense. In any case, Amanda Seyfried does as well as one could hope with the material she's given.Speaking of historical inaccuracy, the Finchers get so much wrong that one can only surmise that they don't care about facts. They clumsily use the hook of a famous classic work of cinematic art to score contemporary socio-political points or to indulge a personal admiration for the tragic Mankiewicz who died young from complications of alcoholism and who was one of the better screenwriters of his time. The filmmakers' prejudices are quite evident in their overwhelmingly negative portrayal of Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley), particularly the way they portray his involvement in MGM's organized opposition to the 1934 gubernatorial campaign of leftist novelist Upton Sinclair, a subplot which seems to be dragged in to link Mankiewicz with left-wing politics. It's a distraction at best. Mankiewicz had little or nothing to do with the Sinclair episode. (A fascinating film could be made about the legendary showdown between Thalberg and Erich von Stroheim over the production of ""Greed"" in the 1920s.)More examples of wrongheadedness: A 1930 meeting at Paramount Studios in which various screenwriters engage in shop-talk with David O. Selznick about Universal's ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man."" The former was not released until the following year and the latter over a decade later. And throughout the early-30s scenes the action is accompanied, if not overwhelmed, by the Benny Goodman-esque big-band swing sound. Too many filmmakers reflexively use this World-War-Two-era music to evoke the whole interwar period. Think again, people. Watch a few films about contemporary life released in 1930 and compare the underscoring to what you hear in movies released in 1935 or 1940. Easy.In general, the constant random leaps from 1940 to 1930 to 1934, etc., along with dialogue consisting largely of ""quotable quotes"" or historical exposition in the form of pseudo-casual conversation, tires out the viewer, limiting ""Mank""'s to unusually tolerant film-buff fans of vintage Hollywood."
MANK,18 April 2021,5/10,"Perhaps I misread the synopsis, but I thought this film was going to be about the writing of 'Citizen Kane.' Instead, it was a movie about politics, and regardless of what your politics is, I think most would find it rather boring. Certainly, it isn't funny, and it isn't thrilling, and it isn't suspenseful, and it isn't dramatic - so I don't know what it is - other than boring. We couldn't get through the whole thing. Maybe we aren't intellectual enough or knowledgeable enough about the events being depicted, but like most of these true-to-life films, I'm guessing much of it was just made up anyway. I can't see this getting any sort of Academy nominations in a normal year. Not sure who would enjoy this."
MANK,20 January 2021,8/10,"I've never seen Citizen Kane, and had never heard of Herman Mankiewicz prior to this film. If you are in a similar position don't let that put you off. It's a great story with a very interesting central character of Mankiewicz, which will be sure to get you hooked.The highlight of the film for me was the performances. Gary Oldman was electric, and is surely due another Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Mank. Amanda Seyfried was fantastic. I'd love to see her get more roles like this. We were even treated to a great performance from Charles Dance, who has such a great sinister energy making him perfect for the role of Hearst. The entire ensemble were terrific and not a single actor felt out of place.Another real highlight was the style. The decision to opt for black and white was genius, and gave the film a splendid old time Hollywood feel. The screen wipes, the score, the camera work, the set design and costume, all complimented each other perfectly to make Mank a refined and stylised film. You'd expect nothing less from David Fincher.On top of all of this the dialogue was so tight. There were some long monologue style speeches from Oldman, and some fantastic exchanges between the characters, which were so expertly delivered.A really fantastic film, although I do fear that its being overhyped slightly, so don't go in expecting the world."
MANK,4 December 2020,,"As a pretty big fan of David Fincher, I'm disappointed to say that I'm mixed on Mank overall. Fincher's work deserves to win the Oscar for Best Director, but the film is less than the sum of its parts for my taste.The craft and filmmaking is sensational. Fincher strikes dynamite with an approach that blends imitating and homaging this specific early moment in time of Hollywood. It goes without saying, the photography, production, score and sound are undeniably sublime. The cast ensemble gels with the created style as perfectly as possible.All the while, I respect Mank more than I love or even enjoy it.The screenplay boasts cleverness and surprisingly funny humor, which, when meant with Fincher's execution create a nice bouncing momentum. The screenplay has more creativity and better, snappier dialogue than Trial of Chicago 7, but I care so much less about the plot in Mank. There could have been a better plot or a different focus to tell this story.Oldman's work holds up to the hype, Seyfried less so.More Citizen Kane and Charles Dance, less Communism v. Socialism."
MANK,18 March 2021,10/10,"The writing, cast and execution is worthy about a Mankiewitz film. Even the CGI depicting 1930s Los Angeles is very well done. Anyone who loves classic film will enjoy this movie.One glaring flaw in the movie. In a scene set in 1934, they mention the Pasadena Freeway. It wasn't completed until 1940. Did they think I wouldn't notice?"
MANK,16 March 2021,8/10,"With its many references, ""Mank"" is definitely an insider film. Those who don't know ""Citizen Kane"" will have less fun than others.Director David Fincher has long established a firm place in film history. It is all the nicer now that he is filming a screenplay by his late father Jack Fincher - for the latter one film stood above all others: Citizen Kane. In Mank, the story of his detachment is now attempted to get to the bottom. Maybe that's one of the downsides of the movies. Nevertheless, it is excellently filmed and equipped, and the film is convincing across the board."
MANK,9 January 2021,7/10,"Don't know what everyone's babbling about half the time but it's able to coast on its sharp editing and performances in the dia(not mono)logue scenes (see the excellent back and forth at the b-day party). Mank's journey through the shifty politics of movie studios in the 30s is much more interesting than the process of his screen-written response to it later though (especially when the connections aren't always clear), so the film would've done better to just make the flashbacks the whole movie.
6.5/10"
MANK,10 December 2020,5/10,"Considering how much talent is involved, this is a strangely uninvolving movie. It's technically impressive, but these days what does that mean? The level of expertise in the film industry seems to be getting higher with every passing year. But it doesn't mean the movie's going to be as riveting as the cinematography, acting, production design or special effects. It's all a bit, well, obvious here. What's the point of the monaural sound? Of getting Reznor and Ross to write the score against their grain -- fun for them, I expect, but it would have been more idiomatic to hire a composer to whom the style is second nature, like Michael Giacchino, for example? The screenplay leaves gaps for research afterwards: is that a good thing, to get audiences to go do homework in order to find out stuff about the period? I can't help feeling this was a labour of love for David Fincher to honor his late father's script. As the tale of one man's struggle, it leaves too much unsaid to be satisfying. As a tale of the way Hollywood treated its writers, it's not as hard-hitting as SUNSET BOULEVARD or BARTON FINK. There are treats along the way: Amanda Seyfried and Tom Burke are particularly strong. Oldman is a great actor and gives a great performance but, like TRUMBO a few years back, this film isn't really a fit memorial."

MANK,17 April 2021,7/10,"The golden days of Hollywood are far behind us, but every now and then we get another glimpse into the past thanks to films like 'Mank.' Famed screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz's eponymous biopic takes a dive into the ups and downs of the genius writer's life as he is tasked with writing what would go on to become what is considered to be the greatest film ever created - 'Citizen Kane.'To be clear, the David Fincher-directed 'Mank' really revolves around Gary Oldman's performance, as the character actor is in his element playing an eccentric alcoholic who says what's on his mind and doesn't fear offending others who are more powerful than he. This includes the crotchety head of the then-esteemed MGM Studios (Arliss Howard) and the wealthy financier William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance). We also see how Mankiewicz approaches relationships with women, from a strictly platonic one with actress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) to a more brotherly-sisterly sarcastic one with his assistant (Lily Collins) and a seemingly mismatched marriage to his wife, Sara (Tuppence Middleton). Given the subject matter, 'Mank' is very much a dialogue-heavy film, and without the bells and whistles that we're used to nowadays, the film is carried on these simple characteristics. Thankfully, Mankiewicz is an interesting enough guy to mostly hold the audience's attention (although there are a few scenes that test our patience).Another redeeming element of 'Mank' includes the cinematography, which is crisp, clear and achieves a look and feel that is authentic to the setting. In fact, there are only a few telltale signs that indicate it's not actually the cinema of another era.'Mank' may not be the most memorable film of its kind, and it will never match the quality of its inspiration, but its best picture nomination is enough proof that it has captured the attention of the moviegoing audience."
MANK,9 December 2020,10/10,"Magnificent, masterful and memorable; ""Mank"" showcases Hollywood's golden era in what feels like a feverish dream and adds another extraordinary film to David Fincher's repertoire.In this drama, 1930's Hollywood is reevaluated through the eyes of social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the screenplay of ""Citizen Kane"".It's hard to find the words to express how ""Mank"" really makes you feel; an alcohol-induced and cigarette smoking period piece that expertly captures the time, the place and the people of Hollywood in the 1930s-40s. Written by Fincher's father, Jack, prior to his death in 2003, ""Mank"" brings old Hollywood to life and focuses on these real-life characters perfectly. The script itself is outstanding. Anyone who's ever been interested in the golden age of Hollywood will have a field day with all the characters seen or mentioned in this film. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is pitch-perfect and jazzy for the period. Name me a better sounding score this year; I'll wait. Fincher's attention to detail is what drove me over the edge, in the sense that everything is researched and so authentic. Shot in glorious black and white and did I mention the sound? It's like you're watching a film of that era. The mono sound is an incredibly nice touch by Fincher and so are the cigarette burns in the editing. The performances are some of this years best. Gary Oldman is a firecracker and breathes, walks and talks like Herman Mankiewicz. Are we even surprised that Oldman can embody any character on screen? No. Amanda Seyfried is so elegant and majestic as Marion Davies. The starlet delivers one of the best supporting roles of 2020. A special mention goes to Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst, who delivers an impeccable performance. ""Mank"" is without a doubt one of the years best and most beautifully shot films and it's a film that will become a classic in its own right. This is a movie lovers dream.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
MANK,4 December 2020,10/10,"Even 9 years after the Best Picture Winning The Artist, black and white films seem like an impossibility. But thanks to David Fincher who we haven't seen behind the camera for six years his previous film being 2014s psychological thriller Gone Girl. His latest - Mank is a film that's both nigh impossible and is yet a miracle of a film, his skills behind the camera pop out once again, as Mank with its black and white often dark picturing sets the tone that it feels like if feels like it was filmed in the early 40s, plus it might be hard to spot at times but you can even hear the static of an old fashioned cinema projector. It's almost as if the Golden age of 30s Hollywood is relived in thriving life. And with Gary Oldman's brilliant Oscar worthy performance he brings his Herman Mankiewicz to life in glorious tones that are humorous, rustic and even sounds close to his Darkest Hour performance, not that, that is in any way a bad thing. As he races to write his masterpiece, Citizen Kane. Granted Mank is a little slow as it takes a long time for it to finally kick in but again that's not bad either because as it's set in the 40s it feels as if Fincher filmed it with all the time in the world. And thanks to Jack Fincher's (David's late father) sharply written, Mank like Citizen Kane 79 years before it will become a classic in its own right, a film like is rare and to exist at a time like this is nothing short of a miracle. 5/5. Fincher does it again. A must see."
MANK,3 May 2021,4/10,"The story of the movie is very good, but the movie is acceptable, very good performance by Gary Oldman."
MANK,6 January 2021,2/10,"I am a big fan of david fincher. I missed his work since gone girl. After 6 years, he's back as a director with mank starring gary oldman.
Mank is a true story based on herman mankeweiz, the co writer of citizen kane. The film focuses on the events that led him to write citizen kane and in what state he wrote it.
I saw citizen kane before watching mank. David fincher comes out of his directorial style and completely transforms himself into a 40s filmmaker as he recreates the 1940s era of Hollywood and shoots the film completely in black and white. The performances are also brilliant. Oldman is great as always and amanda seyfried also acted well.
But the narration is absolutely plain and not engaging at all. I was watching the whole film without any emotion. Today's generation will not be interested or get connected towards the film.
On the whole, mank is a film made for those born in 1930-40s as they can only understand this era. But unfortunately, most of them won't be alive today."
MANK,14 December 2020,4/10,I hate movies like this cause it's made not form us the audience but just for Oscar. Every year films come out just made for Oscar nomination and awards and this tops them for this year. The acting is great but the story is so bad and frustrating.
MANK,7 December 2020,6/10,"Mank is a film that proves it was made by true professionals. Everything about it on a technical level was perfect. Outside of the story, Mank offers everything that you'd want in a film, directing, acting, editing, and set design. This movie is just beautiful to watch and you can truly see the effort put into it. But although Mank is great on a technical level, it suffers a lot with the story and the characters.Mank is a biography about Herman J. Mankiewicz. I've seen tons of biographies in films, but Mank's storytelling is something that I've never seen in the genre. And although the storytelling is different, it suffers a lot from it. The film is set in Herman J. Mankiewicz's house, where he is writing the screenplay of Citizen Kane, while using flashbacks to tell his motives for making the screenplay. I overall just didn't like this choice. The film is too jumpy, there's too many flashbacks; none of them lasting that long. Some flashbacks felt absolutely pointless, especially the flashbacks in the first half of the movie. I would've preferred a more linear way of telling this story.With Gary Oldman being the main performance, it's obvious that you'd get great acting. Most films feel like a film, it doesn't feel like you're looking at real events, but Gary Oldman is one of those few actors who could make a movie feel real. His performance in Mank is seriously Oscar worthy, and I expect him to win the Oscar for best leading performance, or at least a nomination in that category.Overall, Mank was a disappoint for me. It was really dragging, with the flashbacks and the long runtime. I really did enjoy the way this film was made. David Fincher is such a legendary director, and Mank proves his status. But If Mank's screenplay was as good as the directing, then Mank would've easily been a 10/10; but with the way the story was handled, it's a 6/10."
MANK,14 August 2021,7/10,"Definitely more entertaining than I expected. Sure it's a lot of dialogues to handle, but the pacing is relatively tight, and the performances are mostly convincing (Charles Dance in particular). The care they put into the sound and cinematography to reconstruct the atmosphere of the time is more than remarkable.The film is presented as a docudrama, but Jack Fincher's original script is so outdated that many plot points have been already debunked by recent studies, including the infamous allegations that Orson Welles was not involved in the writing of ""Citizen Kane"". However, if we think of this film as Mankiewicz's own perspective of the events, the truth might not matter at all. The real problem the script takes for granted that we are all familiar with the insiders of Hollywood's Golden Age and the political climate of the time. The dialogues are packed with countless historical references, but we are hardly given context. The main events are pretty straightforward, but you will definitely need more than one Wikipedia research to fully enjoy the dialogues."
MANK,5 December 2020,10/10,"A drama based on real events.
It is about the life of an alcoholic writer and his process of creating the script that gave him the Oscar.
Quality.
Parsimonious in many moments.
With long soliloquies well achieved, few sarcasms and jokes of reference.
In black and white that give the time a touch.
The soundtrack is in place, as well as the well-recreated period, costumes, and setting.
It handles political issues of the time so as a spectator you must have references to: Hitler, socialism and communism, otherwise it will seem totally long and unnecessary.
The script is intelligent and of quality.
Gary Oldman is spectacular.
The edition goes in two moments, from the present to the past, only that sometimes they are not in order and you have to spin it.
It is one of those films that as a spectator demands a lot from you so that you go the rhythm that goes and sometimes you accommodate the parts."
MANK,12 May 2021,3/10,"Literally, you cannot understand anything if you do not know about Citizen Kane and Hollywood of 1940s. Only for cinephiles!!"
MANK,9 December 2020,7/10,"A fun and engaging depiction of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz's role as writer of ""Citizen Kane"", ""Mank"" appeals with the sophistication and verbal play of golden age Hollywood. Shot in attractive black and white the film shows the inner workings of the movie business and the characters involved that make it tick. Gary Oldman is a natural as the alcoholic and endearingly clever Mankiewicz as he wrestles with a deadline and his principles to get his point across. The rest of the cast deliver in seamless support. But the real star of the show is the smart and witty script that keeps the viewer on board with its scintillating back and forths and endless repartee. While no classic this is one of the more entertaining and watchable flicks of recent times. Who said writers are boring?"
MANK,1 April 2021,7/10,"I love it! Everything from the charming dialogue of the time to the weirdly meta reflection of Jack and David Fincher through Herman and Joe Mankiewicz is great. I would never have picked Herman Mankiewicz to be the subject of a film but it worked out.From a technical standpoint there's almost nothing wrong, maybe the cue marks look a little too fabricated and maybe the sound mix and design are a bit too crisp and maybe some sequences go on for too long and maybe there's an incredibly stupid rushed moment at the start of the third act, but this can all be forgiven in the grand scheme of the film. Every frame looks beautiful and every scene is incredibly well written, there's a long riveting sequence with an ensemble of characters in a single room together, it reveals so much about almost every individual who plays a part in this story at any point, Fincher creates immense tension with witty passive-aggressive dialogue primarily about the upcoming election candidates.From a story standpoint there's still lots to be desired. I never felt comfortable in the present day due to the overabundance of flashbacks, some unnecessary and others uninteresting, some of Mank's relationships aren't really fleshed out which lead to a few moments that feel as if they just came out of the blue. The score is way overused, a leitmotif plays to signify flashbacks in time but it's hardly changed throughout the entire film and is repeated and repeated and repeated until it holds no significance at all.My praise far outweighs my criticism but I can't help but wish it was a shorter more to the point film, cutting out all the dilly dallying would align with Herman Mankiewicz as a person too adding another layer to appreciate."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"For my greatest pleasure, Mank is much more than a ""behind the scenes"" of ""Citizen Kane"". On one hand, it explores the life of Herman Mankiewicz, but with the usual detachment of Fincher toward his character. On the other hand, it describes the correlation between politics and cinema during the 1930s and 1940s.As far as I am concerned, the film's biggest flaw is that Gary Oldman's role is built on clichés (Alcohol problems and Gambling problems). Fortunately, this isn't the case for the supporting characters played by Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, and Charles Dance.Finally, Mank is a good film. However, you'll need a little knowledge about Hollywood to understand it."
MANK,25 April 2021,7/10,"I hope you're ready for me to rock your world, because I'm a film student, and unless we count Alien 3 (we don't), this is the first David Fincher film I've seen. I understand that this is a bit of a departure from what he usually does, so I won't let it put me off watching the rest of his films, but I really couldn't have cared less about what was happening in this.So why the 3.5/5? Well...I can't really find anything wrong with this, except for the fact that I just...wasn't into it.It looks and sounds amazing, clearly wanting to look like films of the period when Citizen Kane was made, although it is a little distracting that it was shot on digital, and I can tell from this that people aren't lying when they talk about how great of a director Fincher is.I just wonder about how good of a writer his dad was based on this, because it seems to me like I really had no reason to care about Mank when all he does is be drunk and snarky towards everyone. Plus, quite a fair chunk of the flashback scenes felt kind of pointless to me. I guess you could say that the political themes are what inspired certain elements of Citizen Kane, but it's a fairly minor part of that film, especially for how long this film spends on it.The acting is the one thing that kept me interested for most of it, everyone is bloody excellent and I wouldn't be upset if Gary Oldman or Amanda Seyfried won those nominations.The production design is also absolutely brilliant, it nails the 30s aesthetic, and the score is a really nice change of pace for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, so like I said, I can't really find anything wrong with this except for the fact I just wasn't all that into it.I understand how you could really love it though, so don't let me stop you."
MANK,18 April 2021,6/10,"A film I eagerly awaited because of Fincher who is one of my favorite directors. Some of his films are among my favorite and best films ever. However, I was disappointed with the final product. From a technical point of view, the film is great, it was shot as if it originally came out of the 1930s, and so is the sound. Gary Oldman is the best part of the film as the title role because he is dominant in every scene. Everything else is mediocre and incomplete. Although the film is about how screenwriter Mankiewicz worked on the screenplay for Citizen Kane and his conflict with Welles, other events and numerous characters from that time period have been added. It wasn't easy for me to keep track of who's who because the characters were just coming and going, and I'm not that much of a Hollywood connoisseur from the 1930s. Orson Welles has very little time in the film, but there are plenty of characters who were tied to the studio and politics at the time. This film doesn't look like a David Fincher film and that's definitely a minus if we look at his career. He probably wanted to make a dedication to Hollywood and old-time film, but my interest in film only declined. To me personally definitely his worst movie."
MANK,15 December 2020,7/10,"This movie is certainly propelled by Oldmans excellent performance. The black and white cinematography is also lovely to look at as is the films re-creation of 1930s Hollywood. Certainly, worth a peek, especially if you love Citizen Kane, or old Hollywood in general. I personally loved all the wry dialogue, especially as uttered by Mank. That to me was one of the films charms, and strongest features."
MANK,15 December 2020,8/10,"Great films work on several levels, some of them outside of the film's reality. Here is a movie that celebrates screenwriting by celebrating a screenwriter who himself wished to celebrate another screenwriter. It was made by David Fincher from an old script by his late father Jack, and tells of writing legend Herman J. Mankiewicz, the drunkard genius who co-wrote RKO's world-changing Citizen Kane in the early days of talkies - even more cleverly, the story of Mankiewicz is told to us nonlinearly, à la the very feature it focuses on, signposting the time skips with title cards made to look like scene headings.In terms of imagery and audio, Mank may be the most perfect replication of 1940s cinema since The Man Who Wasn't There (all we're missing is a pre-CinemaScope picture size). Last but far from least is Gary Oldman, yet again getting lost in a character that's hard to rightly compare to anyone else he's portrayed.Other faces of Old Hollywood turn up, cast with the likes of Amanda Seyfried (flawless), Lily Collins, Arliss Howard, Tuppence Middleton, Tom Pelphrey, Sam Troughton, Charles Dance (as the media tycoon on whom the character Charles Foster Kane would eventually be based), and Tom Burke in the role of Orson Welles. Garbo, Chaplin, Gable, and others can also be spotted, all in a monochromatic La La Land that's lit and shot exactly right for the era of picture-making it portrays.Its view of Old Hollywood is at points nostalgic and magical, but it is also quite critical of what the Hollywood system was, is, and has always been.So, with all these things to praise and pick up on, why is it that many viewers got angry at Mank when it came to Netflix? On top of seeming one-sided in its depiction of the conflict that ultimately erupted between Welles and Mankiewicz over proper credit for Kane (the idea that Mankiewicz was the real genius, when he wasn't too inebriated, came from a 1971 Pauline Kael essay that has since been hotly contested), Mank has also angered people for casting reasons.Mankiewicz and his wife, Susan, are meant to be around the same age; the former is played by Oldman, who's over 60, and the latter by Middleton, a woman in her 30s (any actress older than this allegedly tends to get ""erased"", which is an understandable concern). Both are intended to be around 40, making the casting of Mankiewicz all the more strange. But what does it say about an actor's prowess that Oldman, with minimal SFX and makeup, is still more convincing than any digitally de-aged star of last year's The Irishman? That said, the accuracy of his socialism and endorsement of Upton Sinclair has been questioned as well.This might be one of my more boring reviews; indeed, a cineast on Twitter pointed out that names like Mankiewicz, Selznick, Hearst, Groucho, and even Welles might be gibberish to those who use Netflix for escapist fun or just didn't go to film school - even if they're generally media-savvy. Even so, Netflix is not just for casual binging anymore, if it ever was.It has become a place where creativity gets to flourish, whilst Hollywood is becoming more of a soulless, cash-grabbing factory that rarely distributes said cash to the heavy lifters in any sort of sensible way. Mank, a movie for the buffs, puts it in black-and-white (pardon the pun).It's too early to do a #KeepingUpWithTheOscars prediction, but there is no doubt that this will be another ""film about films"" adored by the Academy (who might not grasp the critiques of Hollywood, but no matter) and Oldman's chances of winning Best Actor are pretty good. This would be true even if the COVID pandemic hadn't caused an unprecedented scarcity of film releases throughout the year; then again, it might also cancel The Oscars. Where will Maya Rudolph make her funny faces now?"
MANK,16 February 2021,5/10,"But the biggest problem is the writing by the director's late father, Jack Fincher. David Fincher is a fascinating director and this is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and almost assuredly this year's Oscar winner for production design, but it's incoherent sometimes even for those who are familiar with the characters. The acting is fine by the entire cast, but no one thrilled or moved me. The cinematography is also a highlight as is the score, but ultimately a director I greatly admire has his biggest misfire. I do think that this might be one film that benefited from the pandemic. It's very hard to believe that this would have been a success at the box office. Technically it's a major achievement, but that's about it.Much to my great surprise for a Fincher film, most of this is boring."
MANK,4 February 2021,4/10,Show movies in the street.For 20 minutes this was the only part that I found interesting or funny. That was among the mumbling and poor sound.By 30 there had been no improvement.Oldman was doing OK in a routine sort of way. The supporting cast wasn't.
MANK,18 December 2020,7/10,"Hollywood in the 30's, through the eyes of Herman Mankiewicz, an alcoholic screenwriter whose task is to write what for many is the best film ever made: Citizen Kane.The narrative starts in a hurry, as if we already have some knowledge about the subject that is told in the story, which in a way can be advantageous (but not mandatory), to appreciate the film.It's an attractive biopic, because it's boring at certain times, in a good way, at least for me. It has its controversies, for being a faithful portrait, or not, of what really happened between Wells and Mank.Gary Oldman's interpretation is very solid, there is a clear at ease with the character, with very fluid expressions. The photography is good, with careful work in relation to the detail given to the techniques used in the Golden Era of Hollywood, in a certain homage to the style."
MANK,22 April 2021,8/10,"David Fincher's 'Mank' is the most universally well-reviewed film at this years Oscars with an incredible 10 nominations.Perhaps the greatest film-maker of our generation, the man behind Fight Club, Seven and the Social Network expertly narrates the phenomenal real-life story behind the making of the legendary 'Citizen Kane' (1940).Fincher describes in painstaking detail the eccentric life of the reprobate screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (Mank) as he brings to life perhaps the greatest screenplay ever written.Oldman is expectedly terrific in an exceptionally well-written role, revelling in playing the numerous shades of the character.Amanda Seyfried's nuanced performance as the beleaguered starlet Marion Davies should have been a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar if it was not for the spellbinding Yuh-Jung Youn in ""Minari"".An exceptional film. Fincher's best work since Fight Club. Yes, I rate it above Gone Girl, Zodiac, Social Network and Benjamin Button.The politics the film talks about are hauntingly topical to today's day and age. A Thomas Jefferson quote one of the characters mentioned stuck with me.

MANK,4 March 2021,8/10,"Mank - while sluggish and disjointed - is a story about Hollywood's golden age that's worth telling. It's about Herman J. Mankiewicz and his development of the script for Citizen Kane, the widely debated ""best film ever created."" Directed by David Fincher (who did Fight Club and The Social Network) and filmed in black-and-white, Mank is rich with atmosphere and tailored by extravagant performances.Gary Oldman's charisma fuels this slow-paced biopic. Not among his most transformative roles, but still engaging. A love letter to the early era of filmmaking, I recommend Mank only for die-hard film enthusiasts interested in the backstory of a figure who barely received credit for his work. Just know what you're getting into. It's a bit of a slog, but - similar to The Lighthouse - the acting and aesthetics are guaranteed to delight. I hope to see more films in this style in the future."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"Following on another Biographical Drama like David Fincher did previously with The Social Network, this time with Mank. A stylish and beautifully looking old-school classic movie, Mank throws you back into the old days of Hollywood following screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz through back and forth flashbacks on
life events and political activity of the time, giving him ideas and inspirations for what would end up being his masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"". That being said, if you're expecting loads of Orson Welles and Citizen Kane references, well you might be a little disappointed on that front. Mank instead stays interesting through the drama and learning more about the guy and the people and events he encounters through the different times and settings. It may sound like a slow drama and perhaps it still won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me personally the film's running time was never an issue and it zipped by faster than expected.There's always the question on my mind whether Mank would still work for someone having never seen Citizen Kane. I'd say yes, although catching some of the little nods throughout the film and the people related to it might help make things more coherent I suppose. Maybe a re-watch would help connect the dots better. I don't doubt some of the film's scenes were probably fictional, but that's fine in my books if the story and character stuff is consistent. The music and use of sound is very good, all the performances are great especially from Gary Oldman which is no surprise I guess, and overall the film is a nice companion piece to the legacy of Citizen Kane. It's definitely got that Oscar Buzz appeal to it, so I suspect it might get some big award nominations. Just goes to show Netflix can deliver great films, and Mank is definitely up there for this year.8/10"
MANK,5 December 2020,5/10,"I was so looking forward for this film but it turns out to be really disappointing. Well, it's so beautifully artsy with amazing cinematography, many stunning shots, beautiful locations and costumes, awesome Hollywood vibes, and brilliant performances by everyone. But unfortunately all of that didn't save the movie because of its bad script. The plot is incoherent, messy, and disturbing. I really felt so confused at certain points. Mank is obviously a very well made movie but I hated it, it's just boring and uninteresting to me. What a missed opportunity!"
MANK,30 May 2021,4/10,"I'm sure it's riveting, a momentous acheivement, a ""brilliant"" glimpse into some genius' life.Though as a single male in my 30s, I couldnt even get halfway through.I dont worship any -person- and the cult of personality , no matter how 'vulnerable' or 'real; they make him out to be, really turns me off.Im not obsessed with Citizen Kame enough to watch any movie about the people it's associated with except maybe RKO 1183 or whatever it was about Mankewitz and Orson's struggle with Heast's people at the time during it's conception. E
Even that was a pretty tough watch for .me."
MANK,7 December 2020,9/10,"Mr Mank! (Or Mankiewicz) is an alcoholic screenwriter racing to finish Citizen Kane. This endearing tale takes place during and after the great crash of 1929. The film, as is the story is done in old Hollywood style and filmography , as in B & W. I really like how the reels clip with the ""white dot"" in the corners where the splicing takes place as its false authenticity, lol. The witty reparte is also a hoot, "" Socialism is everyone sharing the wealth whilst Communism is sharing the poverty"". You'll be pleased at the story plot and how well the story carries from scene to scene. Enjoy! Pax, Murf"
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"Gary Oldman is a beast what a performance and he is let loose with a superb script and makes the most of it. You can tell he is loving every minute delivering the tasty dialogue.What a terrific story too that was paced right and told with directorial flair by Fincher, a complete triumph.The script is witty, funny, clever and interesting and always engaging even if some of the characters are lightly drawn or explored and with moments where it does veer off course slightly or drag a little.Overall though i had a great time watching this and will now be knee deep in researching all these different characters represented here."
MANK,13 December 2020,4/10,"Critics are no doubt head over heels in love with this self-reverential bit of nepotistic overindulgence, made worse by an unholy intersection of politics and Hollywood gossip which never quite gels.The script by Jack, father of acclaimed director David, is abysmal. Son David's direction fares little better, full of Hollywood clichés, beholding to a lifeless script full of overlong soap opera-ish moments of excruciating dialog. Revelations about Mankiewicz' character and the Hollywood machine around him are for the most part absent; instead we get dull, seemingly endless conversations, any wit or humor lost in the overbearing seriousness of it all.On the bright side, the black and white cinematography is worth watching as is some of the acting, most notably that of Oldham even if his overlong scenes with Seyfried lack sparkle, almost as if the two are reciting lines instead of living them."
MANK,4 February 2021,2/10,"When I first saw previews for this I was excited, thinking this was going to be another movie like Trumbo, I was very wrong. From the time it started it steady when downhill! Even the opening shot with a 1939 Ford being followed by a 1939 Buick, the Ford had wrong headlights! Other items in this show was just as off. Not to mention that that Mank was not a likable person. Again this is another show that is set in 1940 but keeps jumping back in time as much as 8 years coming back to 1940 and going back again. If you like a show in which lead person is bed ridden drunk cause of alcohol fueled car wreck you love this time waster of a movie!"
MANK,25 November 2020,9/10,"Mank is a great film about an alcoholic screenwriter who co wrote the screenplay of Citizen Kane with Orson Welles. It begins with Mank writing the screenplay and then delves into flashbacks when he was highly thought after in the early 30's. The black and white cinematography is stunning to look at with the shadows and bright lights. Gary Oldman as Mank is terrific portraying a great screenwriter but also showing his dark side with the drinking and gambling and womanizing. The screenplay is very cleverly written with some great snappy dialogue, with some witty one liners. The direction from Fincher is top notch and I think he is a lock for Best Director at the Oscars. Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davis is terrific, very witty and pops off the screen her performance was a pleasure to watch. There is the argument over who really got more credit over the screenplay for Citizen Kane, i personally think Mank wrote the bulk of it and Orson contributed. Orson of course was the actor, producer and director of the film and it was an amazing achievement. This is a great film in itself and I highly recommend it. If you love movies about old Hollywood this is for you."
MANK,8 February 2021,7/10,"Like ""1917"" just a year before, ""Mank"" is the best movie of the year on a purely technical level. Filmed in dreamy black-and-white, scored with period-accurate instruments, and recorded with the best sound equipment 1933 can buy, David Fincher's return to feature filmmaking is his twisted version of a Hollywood love-letter.For better and worse, ""Mank'' is the encapsulation of Fincher's filmography. The technical aspects are amazing and performances from titular leading man Gary Oldman and supporting star Amanda Seyfried are spectacular.Unfortunately, the screenplay from Fincher's late father is not up to snuff as it doesn't offer enough insight into its mythical subject. Who wrote ""Citizen Kane"" has been an unsolvable mystery for nearly as long as color has been in movies. Fincher's movie doesn't attempt to answer that question nor does it contain anything else in terms of worthy supplements.I still expect the film to emerge the leader on Oscar nomination morning thanks to its extremely talented cast and crew."
MANK,9 May 2021,6/10,"POSITIVES:1) The performances from the central 3 of Oldman, Seyfried and Collins are all fantastic
2) Technically the film is brilliant: the score, cinematography and production design are all exquisite
3) I respected the dedication to making a film that feels like it was made in the era it's depictingNEGATIVES:1) The script definitely needed another re-write or 2: The frequent flashbacks and flash forwards were unnecessary and the political storyline didn't make me care at all. This is a big problem
2) Some of the film definitely feels more like it's trying to make funny references to the era rather than just tell its story.3) There's a lot of scenes that feel like they could be cut out and make the runtime shorter and more streamlined."
MANK,12 February 2021,3/10,"Full disclosure I haven't finished watching this yet, because I started about a month ago and have gone back a few times. But I'm still only about 30 minutes in because it seems like 3 hours I'm so board. It is so draggy, I usually love Hollywood stories especially set in this period, I was excited. But it's so slow moving that I don't quite understand 1.How so many people think it's great and how it earned so many award nominations and 2. Why did they bother? I'm not sure I want to bother finishing it."
MANK,16 November 2020,7/10,"David Fincher has made a new film about Herman Mankiewicz, the storied screenwriter behind the writing of Citizen Kane, one which is a gripping, insightful portrayal of Hollywood's golden age but also slightly lumbering on account of the film's use of flashback sequences and footnotes. It's possible this film would have benefited from a more linear narrative. The film flirts with greatness at several different points.From the outset, there is a recurring theme of Mankiewicz's tenuous relationship with the Hollywood executives, including Louis Mayer and Irving Thalberg. The film is at its most compelling when it touches on Mankiewicz's doomed friendship with William Randolph Hearst. As portrayed here, the two men shared an initial rapport, one which gradually gave way to staunch political differences which over time became such a gulf that it served as the strongest impetus for Mankiewicz to take on this radical project. The theme of bitter political rivalries within Hollywood is well-presented here.There is ample period detail here, including every effort to make this look like a 1940s film. And the performances are quite good. Gary Oldman shines in this role as the alcoholic but doggedly principled Mankiewicz, a man beaten down by own flaws but also quietly determined not to bend to those in power especially in his own creativity. Lily Collins makes a nice supporting turn as his assistant. Tom Burke is uncanny as the young Orson Welles before he was known for anything beyond radio. And Amanda Seyfried is a joy to watch as Marion Davies, a famous actress and a rare Mankiewicz friend within Hearst's inner circle. My only major criticism would be that this could have also spent more time in the editing room. And the dialogue is occasionally so frenetic that it is difficult to follow, almost to the point of being gibberish. But these are minor flaws in an overall workmanlike effort.Fincher has been quiet for some time now and it's great to finally see another feature film from him. Although this is not his best, it certainly ends up as the most uncharacteristic film out of his repertoire and therefore a testament to his versatility as a director. It will make for a fascinating film experience even to those unfamiliar with the story being told here. Recommended to cinephiles and casual viewers alike."
MANK,5 December 2020,4/10,Over Dramatization and double entendres haunt this movie from beginning to end. No highs or lows for actors timing. This movie tried to give 100% paying homage to Citizen Kane But the final results from poor direction and editing leaves viewers exhausted after 2hrs plus of alcoholic rants and sarcastic references!
MANK,8 December 2020,9/10,"Mank is a 2020 David Fincher biopic about the writer of the film Citizen Kane. His name is Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman). He was assigned to write a film by Orson Wells (Tom Burke) in sixty days. Herman Mankiewicz crafts a story from his many life experiences from where he has been and what he has done.Mank was a film a bunch of people were eager to see. I have never found Citizen Kane as breath taking as many people do but I always have enjoyed the film. I also don't watch many David Fincher films but I have seen the Social Network and a few others. I really wanted to see this film because of how good it looked. The film seemed different from what we normally get today. When the film came out I watched it a day later. I got what I wanted from the film and nothing more. I thought it was going to be a good film. I didn't think the story was going to be bland though. The story wasn't all bad. The thing that held the film back was a bunch of the middle act. There were some good bits in the middle act but majority of the middle was dragging. The rest of the story was really lively though. The start really got you wondering how he got on the bed and how he got the job. The end was a good bow on the present that told you what you wanted to know. David Fincher didn't write this film. In fact his dad, Jack Fincher wrote the film. He doesn't have any other writing credit besides this film. You probably won't find a lot of this film interesting unless you can't go by a day were you don't think of Citizen Kane. I am not that much into Citizen Kane so that might be why I found this film boring. The story was just bland and wasn't what I wanted from this film.The acting was the best part of the film by far. Gary Oldman gave a marvelous performance. He was funny but also really good at delivering tough lines in many scenes. There is a really good chance he will take home an Oscar after the award show because of this film. Amanda Seyfried played Marion Davies an actress from the thirties. She did a solid job but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Lilly Collins who is actually Phil Collins daughter did really well in this film. She has been in Emily In Paris and Okja. The acting was just amazing in the film mainly because of Gary Oldman.Another stand out part of the movie was how it felt. They nailed the feel of a thirties film. The score in particularly perfected the tone of the picture. It was always really cool to hear the drum beating in the background was they go into a flashback scene. Something really cool about the flashback sequences was they would say something on the screen about where they were but it was set up like a script. Also how the film looked was fantastic. Obviously it was black and white but they also added the blotches on the screen you see in the corner every once in a while. There were also sometimes hairs that ended up on screen. Those were some small things that really added to the experience of watching the film.Mank looked like something from the thirties and the acting was some of the best of the year but the story just fell short of what it needed to be. I would recommend Mank to anybody who likes Citizen Kane or just anyone who is looking for a film to watch."
MANK,6 December 2020,5/10,"I am more and more suspicious of these ""written and directed by"" films. Mank is no exception. I feel, in particular with the ending, the one area where ""Hollywood"" consistently fails. While the fiml claims to explore the writing of Citizen Kane"", it leaves out so many parts of the story and clearly exxagerates the so-called abscence of Orson Welles in the writing, we have a story told in fragments that do not connect. There is a kind of childish imitation of the Welles filming method, but Fincer is not on the ame plane at all with Mr Welles, not at all. There is some fine acting by the fine cast. The photography is pretty good, but not great. The biigest problems here are the writing and the directing. Adequate, bt not great. Promising as the story develops then falling apart at the end. It is kind of silly really. Fincher has come up short, way short. Gary Oldman is really fine in this work but also choked off and limited by Fincher. My conclusion is that the Director had great intentions but was really way in over his head. Disappointing all around."
MANK,21 November 2020,7/10,"I'm a huge fan of both ""Citizen Kane"" as well as David Fincher's films, so I was extremely excited to see this. Because of how much I enjoy Fincher's films as well as how good the trailers looked, I wanted to (safely) see it on a big screen rather than wait until Netflix. Needless to say, this is a good movie, but not a great one--and it does not quite live up to the quality one would expect from a Fincher film.The story focuses on Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman,) the screenwriter who worked--often tempestuously--with Orson Welles to write ""Citizen Kane."" However, the amount of time the film spends on material related to ""Citizen Kane"" is relatively little. Instead, the film tends to focus more on Mank's political activity, personal life, ascent into the movie business, and alcoholism throughout the 1930s. Oldman does a good job playing Mank, and is completely believable in the role. As one can expect from a Fincher film, the editing and cinematography are top-notch. The stylish, black-and-white aesthetic that feels both slightly understated (in the best way possible) and posh is beautifully complemented by a relatively steady camera and editing techniques common to films of the 1930s and 40s. The screenplay is generally well-written as well, although it doesn't feel as taut as you would expect in a Fincher picture, and the leisurely pacing is very well done.Despite these strong qualities, ""Mank"" unfortunately is not quite great. The film develops Mank as a character, but he is portrayed in too static of a manner to really make for an engaging protagonist, or even one that can simply have clear ripple effects on the rest of the film's narrative and the characters around him. His characterization is not especially interesting. Fincher probably uses flashbacks a bit too much in the story, as many of the flashbacks to the early 1930s don't do too much to provide additional context to Mank as a character or the time period as a whole. Also, the supporting characters (such as the roles played by Amanda Seyfried and Lilly Collins) are not especially well-developed. As a result, the film doesn't completely work as a character study. However, it is still a generally well-acted and well-shot depiction of early film history that is worth seeing for viewers interested in the subject matter. 7/10"
MANK,12 April 2021,7/10,"Mank (2020, David Fincher)
David Fincher has proven himself to be one of the finest Hollywood directors over the past 25 years or so. He has been one of my personal favorites since 'Seven'. He has tackled all sorts of projects and in his latest endeavor, from a script written by his father, Fincher crafts a story of old Hollywood chronicling the larger than life Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and the writing of 'Citizen Kane' widely considered the greatest American movie ever. This is one of those films clearly paying homage to that classic era of the Hollywood studio system film making and features names that are iconic in the industry such as Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg and William Randolph Hearst. Filmed in glorious black and white Gary Oldman stars in yet another heavyweight performance where he is pretty much the focal point of every scene. The entire film rests on his performance and the quick witted, fast paced script by the elder Fincher. There are great supporting performances here as well by Amanda Seyfried, Arliss Howard and Charles Dance among others. While this project sounds great in theory and looks good on screen the totality of the enterprise felt a bit overblown and overburdened which actually kind of lines up with the larger than life personae that the story is dealing with, but causes the story to fall a bit flat.The film is told in generally two timelines. In one the plot works from the early 1930's laying the groundwork as Mank encounters these Hollywood people and the idea percolates for a story that would become 'Citizen Kane'. He is a studio screenwriter, and he has a friendship with Marion Davies, Seyfried, who is paramour to Hearst played by Charles Dance. There is also a subplot that runs through these scenes regarding the California gubernatorial race featuring Upton Sinclair vs. Frank Merriam. Those scenes got kind of lost on me other than to underscore a philosophical difference between the Hollywood fat cats such as Mayer and Hearst and the little guys embodied by Mankiewicz and how they ostensibly fix the election to get the best result for them. It is some of these encounters that really lay the seeds for his ultimate story and thinly veiled lambasting of Hearst specifically.In the second timeline it is 1940 and an ailing Mank is recovering from a broken leg in the desert and he is commissioned by boy wonder Orson Welles, who has unprecedented freedom to make his next film, to tackle the writing of 'Citizen Kane'. Mankiewicz signs a deal that stipulates he would get no screen credit for the project. Mank goes through bouts of alcoholic benders, but ultimately churns out a dense script to the delight of Welles and the horror of just about everyone else. Despite being warned that powerful people in Hollywood will easily see who and what this story is about Mank refuses to change anything realizing it is the best thing he has ever written and in the end he pushes Welles to give him screen credit which is the only thing he really wants. It permanently damages his relationship with Welles but winds up landing them both Academy Awards for the screenplay.This script is dense and fast paced, quick tongued. It is well acted but a lot of the banter is so quick and archaic to my modern ears that there is a lot that flies over my head. I liked the look and feel of the film, but would have appreciated a little less of the Mank backstory and a little more of the creative process of developing the 'Citizen Kane' screenplay. I never really felt like I got a good understanding of Herman as a person and what he stood for outside of sticking it to these uber elites that he was actually tangentially a part of. This might be a bit more fascinating with some initial insight into the real life drama that took place surrounding all these events. The whole story lacked something. It felt cool and distant and not messy or personal enough. I think it is a valiant effort of a worthwhile story that looked great and had wonderful performances. The narrative as a whole felt a tad blasé and a bit too disconnected for its own good although I would encourage you to give it a try if you at all have an affinity for that era of Hollywood.Eric's Grade: B-"
MANK,21 December 2020,8/10,"An excellent return from Director David Fincher. With everything getting postponed till next year, this easily shot up to the top of my most anticipated for winter. It's a little confusing for the first 25 minutes of the film but you soon start to get the grasp of it once the film starts moving along at a quicker pace. Gary Oldman's performance is easily one of my favorite performances of the year although it's not my personal favorite. His portrayal of screenwriter of Herman Mankiewicz is incredibly accurate and mesmerizing. He absolutely steals every scene he is in and he is incredible at showing this drunken genius. In fact, there isn't a single bad performance. Everyone does a great job although they aren't as fantastic as Gary Oldman. Speaking of screenwriting, the writing is great. Fincher has always done a good job at subtlety showing his characters and their changes and there isn't any difference here. The film looks great too. Fincher made the smart decision to make the film look like it came out of the 1940s meaning that audio and quality looks like the 40s which works very well for the tone the film is going for. I thought the story of Mankiewicz life mixed in with his inspiration and writing of the critically acclaimed Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane is obviously the better movie but it was great to see the inspiration Mankiewicz had for the film. There is a lot of political talk in the film relating to socialism vs capitalism which could turn some off but I enjoyed how the incorporated it by showing how different Mankiewicz was from his rich friends. I would definitely recommend it to fans of Fincher or want a film with good performances and potential Oscar talk."
MANK,20 May 2021,3/10,"The writing and directing are a mess from Messr's Fincher. Gary Oldman, as always, is terrific. Pass it by, Rosebud."
MANK,22 March 2021,9/10,"A brilliant film. What I loved most about is how they actually captured the feel of the era with the mono sound and black and white. You actually felt as though you were watching a film from the 30s and 40s. You have to pay attention to the dialogue. It is one of those movies where you can't half-heartedly pay attention. My wife actually stated it was ""too talkie."" That's ok, I loved it."
MANK,6 December 2020,9/10,"Where do I start with this movie? I really don't know. First of all you need to watch/rewatch Citizen Kane before watching Mank, they just fit perfectly. Citizen Kane makes Mank better, Mank makes Citizen Kane better. At first(for about 30 minutes), I didn't know where the movie was going, it was unclear and some might get bored by that but as you continue you will see why that 30 minutes is very important for setting the story. I thought it was going to focus on how Citizen Kane was written but it was actually more like a character study of Mankowics(which was a pleasant surprise).The timeline in the movie is also very similar to Citizen Kane, the story is told in present but is more about the past. The film is about 2 hours long but it felt a lot longer. Some might consider this a bad thing but I loved it because I wasn't bored. Gary Oldman is, again, fantastic and the cast is also pretty good. This movie is going to be divisive, for sure. It won't work for the general audience(especially Netflix audience), because this is not a movie to watch on a Sunday night. The movie wants you to focus, it wants you to draw parallels between Mank and Citizen Kane as you watch it. If you want to have fun or relax by watching a movie, Mank is not for you. Mank is nothing like Fincher did before, it isn't trying to catch the focus of the audience like Gone Girl or Fight Club. It presents its story and asks you, ""Do you want to study the movie as you watch?"" rather than asking, ""Do you want to see where the movie is going?"""
MANK,19 January 2021,8/10,"This was a challenge to watch as unless one was familiar with the Citizen Kane film the references were obscure although sometimes brilliant. Having studied the CK movie in Film studies I was able to follow somewhat but wondered at general audiences being able to appreciate the subtilties. Famous film stars (Clarke Gable, Carol Lombard etc) were portrayed without identification. Although i recognized the Gable character the others I missed. The use of projectionist cue blips in the upper right corner was an interesting touch but who but a projectionist would appreciate this inclusion?"
MANK,1 April 2021,7/10,"The writing was witty, the cinematography was excellent, and the acting was superb! However, the movie is a challenge to follow at times, but I believe that was an artistic choice. I do think it would have been better for me to have seen Citizen Kane first - I have a hunch that watching it would have made me appreciate this movie more."
MANK,12 December 2020,7/10,"A bit meandering but lovely, especially Lilly Collins, yeeow.I had a hard time following some of the discussions that didn't seem to relate to the story at hand but I found this to be fairly engaging. The cinematography is amazing, at times a little too amazing, and the performances are perfect. Not sure why they felt the need to devote so much of the story to the political stuff. It seemed a little indulgent to be honest."
MANK,14 December 2020,6/10,"It's not about the contradiction with the actual screenplay writers behind the movie Citizen Kane, it's about the amount of contribution from Herman Mankiewicz. We are all unaware of the screenwriting partner of Welles for this epic film but Mank made his brilliance out through in this film. Fincher not only talks about Mank's attitude towards the Hollywood gigantic production companies, especially MGM but also he pointed out the social as well as the political opinions. Through the film, it's clear that Mank is liberal and democrat. He doesn't like the attitude of MGM corporation's filmmaking process. They consider directors are some kind of a null element in the process of film making and given more priorities to writers more than directors. Anyway, these kinds of production companies gave more intention to make money than creative content. Mank always shows his discomfort around those people and that's all are the matters that came into his writing through the first draft of his screenplay, Citizen Kane."
MANK,9 December 2020,8/10,"One of the most anticipated films of 2020 and most awaited by David Fincher, turns out to be not only a success in the structural sense, but also from the point of view of history, script, dialogues and interpretation. Film with noir tones, which pays homage and praise to the old fathers of cinema, those who have made the art week an indisputable means of venting for fantasies and ideas. Impeccable direction which leads to an impeccable technical sector, with one of the best cinematography to bring out the best of the narration and with a perfect sound compartment. Superb, great and majestic interpretation of Gary Oldman in the role of Herman J Mankiewicz, which makes us touch the talent and dedication he puts into his characters and here is not even remotely far behind. Superb and fascinating film, bright and elegant, one of Fincher's best."
MANK,8 January 2021,8/10,"Mank, the latest David Fincher directorial effort is likely to be a polarizing film. Made and distributed as an original Netflix production and surrounded with big names such as Fincher himself, Oldman, Seyfried, Collins etc, the title will attract a lot of viewers only to disappoint them considering its subject and style. Not only that, but the film is going to be a letdown to Orson Welles fans and fanatics, as the film was advertised to be the story of making Citizen Kane, but that is not the case.The film is the story of writing the script of Kane by the hands of a Herman Mankiewicz, slanged Mank (played by Gary Oldman) in late 30s Hollywood. The film includes some of most prominent Cinema and media figures like L.B Mayer, Irving thalberg and William Hearst (which Kane is based upon) and likewise features important and eminent social and political events in that epoch.The film has a lot to offer to the classic cinema lovers and enthusiasts. It is shot completely in black and white as it should have, it depicts an era when actors, writers and directors had such exhausting professions, lots of them aged horribly, there were alcoholics, depressions and suicides, and ultimately you would be able to recognize a 20 years old Tom cruise form a 60 years old Tom Cruise.At its center, Mank is a film about artists, whether they are film-writers or performers, and their attitudes towrads cultural and social affairs and their professional identities and responsibilities. It's a charcater study of a sort, played masterfully by Oldman and directed passionately by Fincher."
MANK,23 January 2021,8/10,"Beautifully crafted, brilliantly stylized, with a masterful script, and phenomenal acting across the board!"
MANK,7 February 2021,5/10,This felt like Oscar-bait. A lot of high quality ingredients but ultimately something not that enjoyable to watch. The story was an indulgent meander through the main character's life seemingly without any stakes being played for. No question that Gary Oldman was excellent but aside from a couple of memorable scenes it was a forgettable film.
MANK,22 March 2021,7/10,"I guess all I have to say is that I appreciate the movie, and even did somewhat enjoy the wit in which it composed itself, but I don't think it is one I will revisit for any other reason but study.Also, Gary Oldman's performance is by all standards a masterpiece."
MANK,8 December 2020,6/10,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On the one hand, the cinematography, the sound editing, the performances, as well as the script were great; on the other, mysteriously, watching it was not as pleasurable an experience as it should have been. I guess reading the screenplay in the book format would have been much more enjoyable and much less pompous."
MANK,27 March 2021,6/10,"I had a good time with this movie, I really liked the performances and all the effort that went into making the film feel like it was straight from the twenties, but what made this movie for me was the cinematography, I mean wow, some of the different shots were just stunning, but as good as the cinematography was, it couldn't help the film with my main problem. The story.I feel like my problem is really that Herman J. Mankiewicz, didn't have a very interesting life, not that I'm insulting Gary Oldman's acting, he really brought his A game to the part and I don't think he could have done much better with what he was supplied with. Herman just wasn't a very interesting guy, he just talked to not very interesting people and walked around Hollywood, but back to the pros of the film. Great costumes, amazing music and some great sets, I think people should watch this film but I don't think Mank was the kind of guy who deserved a film about him if you get what I mean. This is a bit of a all other the place review but I feel like this is a film that is really difficult to boil down and talk about, just go watch it and make up your own mind :)"
MANK,4 December 2020,8/10,"As soon as I saw the first poster and heard what this film was about, I couldn't wait to see it. I became filled with inexplicable anticipation, and I'm still unsure as to what caused it. Perhaps it was the fact that it was directed by Fincher (one of my favourites) or perhaps it was the topic, it might've even been due to Gary Oldman being in the lead. Whatever the case may have been, I was very excited to see this film. While Mank didn't disappoint, it left something to be desired.Mank's biggest problem is that it never quite reaches its potential. I kept waiting for it to pick up the pace, or increase the intensity, and while it kept constantly moving towards that direction, it never quite reached the goal. Although something was always happening, I was waiting for something big to happen, and it never did. This could have, probably even should have, been just as great as Fincher's best. And while it felt like one, for the most part, it always lacked something. It didn't have the grand reveal of films like Zodiac or Fight Club, nor did it have the intensity and exhausting pace of The Social Network. Quite frankly, I'm rather frustrated by how close Mank was to being up there with Fincher's others.I would like to now compare this film to The Social Network, my favourite from Fincher and one of my favourites of all time, a film that I would consider a masterpiece. The reason for this comparison is quite a simple one. Both films follow a rather similar structure, relying on flashbacks to tell the story leading up to where we are now, and dealing with a somewhat similar topic. However, while I consider The Social Network to an absolute masterpiece, I can't do the same for Mank.
What made The Social Network so absolutely fantastic, was its deliberate style. A style that I now associate with Fincher. Mank, which could've greatly benefitted from that style, lacks it almost completely. And it saddens me to say that. The story in Mank is far more interesting than the one in The Social Network, yet that film kept me engaged, as well as more interested.Well, now that I've gotten all that off my chest, I would like to say that I still thought that the film was great. Although Mank wasn't as good as I was hoping and expecting it to be, it's still a great film. It captures the era with style and commits fully to its agenda. The agenda that Mankiewicz was the true mastermind behind the film that many consider the best ever made. Whether that's true, is ultimately quite irrelevant for this film. The story it tells, as a result of its agenda, is one filled with excitement and fantastic moments. Oldman, as per usual, is fantastic with his performance of Mank and is the carrying force.
The flashbacks, which become a near-constant occurrence, do end up becoming somewhat tiresome after a while, but they are also what keeps this movie going. And it's not that I don't like them. Indeed, I think that they provide a great way to explore the character of Mank and the journey he took to get where he is now. I suppose I wish they had just been used a little less often.Mank ended up becoming one of my highest anticipated movies of the year. And while it didn't disappoint, it didn't satisfy me completely, either. It is certainly one of the best releases of the year, but I guess I'm just so accustomed to expecting greater things from Fincher that I ended up yearning for more. At the end of the day, though, it is a fantastic story that deserved to be told. And Fincher told it in a way that made it justice."

Directed by David Fincher. Written by Jack Fincher
I should warn whomever is reading this that David Fincher is easily one of my favorite filmmakers. He has not made a feature film in six years since Gone Girl. That one I saw in Las Vegas. I took a walk down the street in the wee hours because it wasn't playing in the movie theater at my casino. It was a unique experience.He's been busy with Mindhunter which was a terrific series. But he is most certainly a filmmaker. Honestly Mindhunter worked as a very long movie too. Not the point. The point is he's back with a new movie that is being dropped on Netflix on my birthday. I must have done something nice to deserve such a gift from the cinema gods.It's one of those few positives in the year 2020. I also for my poorly maintained mental health need to stop reading the comment section of articles about streaming services. Not Christmas is turning out just splendidly. I'm not entirely sure what to do anymore.Back to the movie at hand. Mank is about screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz as he navigates through the script for Citizen Kane. As he pushes through the pain of his accident and his alcoholism rears its head, he flashes back to events that lead to this point. You would understandably be thinking this is an inside Hollywood movie focusing on the mechanics of how Hollywood during that time worked. It is somewhat about that but it is also about bringing an end to a man's life and why he feels the need to bring reckoning to this world hidden away.He gets invited to the inner circle of William Randolph Hearst, newspaper icon and the studio heads. He gets to see the machinations when Upton Sinclair threatens to bring their existence apart. I'm not entirely sure I'm even bringing this up in a good way. Mank is content just feeling superior, making money and spitting out witticisms with reckless abandon. Mank is observant though. He notices how downtrodden the people are during the Depression and how the studio heads and Hearst are fighting against any help for them. It rattles around in him and it reverberates out through the work and his increasing alcoholism.Mank is a beautiful movie shot in black and white where the shadows pop and there is a veneer over the image. From my research on the film, David Fincher used a digital monochrome camera so there is no color version of this. The movie feels like it was made during that era. The story lives in the Hollywood of old and Fincher usually lives in a fluid camera style. He adjusts his style to fit the story. He combines it with the techniques of how movies were made then. Even the score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross creates music that enlivens the scene and helps create dramatic swells.Gary Oldman is terrific in this movie. He imbues this steely wit and his voracious appetite for alcohol and even bombastic drama. You can also tell that the loud, clown like personality is a shield from this world that he lives but doesn't necessarily agree with. Amanda Seyfriend is also excellent at living in the skin of Marion Davies. She has the star shine of a Hollywood actress in the 30s but at the same time she clearly is holding back her intelligence for the benefit of the powerful men. She also has a way with Mank, a back and forth that shows her to be his intellectual equal. Her relationship with Hearst is almost more than just ingenue and benefactor.This is a beautifully sweet film into creation and what the movies can mean. They can mean just mechanical, people preying upon the magic that cinema creates to further their own goals and a writer who didn't realize at the time what he was crafting and what it would cost him. This was a terrific movie. I give it a B."
MANK,4 December 2020,9/10,"Making a movie about the making of a movie isn't a bright idea on paper but Mank excels exactly at that. Most biographies or historical movies are cheesy Oscar baits with over the top acting, something Mank isn't. Ignoring the historical accuracy and over dramatization of alcoholism Mank is one of the finest works by David Fincher. Fincher who is usually known for adapting thrillers and psychological dramas experiments with a satirical biography on screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, a script written by his late father Jack Fincher.Herman (Gary Oldman) is now a past it alcoholic screenwriter who is given an opportunity by the young Orson Welles (Tom Burke) to write the screenplay for his upcoming motion picture. Herman aka Mank takes time away from his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton) to recover from his leg injury and alcoholism living in a farm house accompanied by caretakers Rita (Lily Collins) and Frieda (Monika Gossman). He spends the next few weeks there adapting the screenplay of what we know as ""Citizen Kane"". The movie follows a serious of flashbacks in a non linear narrative where Mank's politics and acquaintances with Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried) and William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) help him write his last script.Given the time period Mank is set in we except to see a lot of popular characters in it but they all have very little screen time including Orson Welles. The three leading actresses are given important roles but its Amanda Seyfried who had the most potential to show her talents. Gary Oldman gives the best performance of the year and in his career, the dinner scene monologue is similar to Daniel Day Lewis's all time great performance in There Will Be Blood. David Fincher does a great job at adapting this script, his choice to shoot it B&W is brilliant. In this way, the authenticity of the time period is maintained.Mank does feel a bit long towards the end, some viewers would find it a bit slow compared to Fincher's previous work. ""You can't say the story of a man in two hours, you can only leave an impression of it""; this is precisely what Fincher does."
MANK,22 April 2021,8/10,"Naturally, Gary Oldman is phenomenal. He always gets into character and does a fantastic job. His acting definitely kept me entertained for the parts where the movie is a bit too slow. Now if you're going into this without being familiar with the story behind the making of Citizen Kane and what was going on in the world at that time, as the ski instructor in South Park said ""you're gonna have a hard time."" I am a fan of Old Hollywood and reading about stories from the past so I was already familiar with the story this film was telling, however I realize if I wasn't familiarized with the story I would be lost the entire film. When it starts it gives you a few opening sentences to let you know it's about the making of Citizen Kane, but even that won't be enough for a typical moviegoer to keep up with the plot. The movie goes all over the place to help you understand the events that are being recreated for the Citizen Kane script and it's done in very Old Hollywood fashion. I, personally, appreciated that aspect. It is a good homage to the film at the center of the plot as well. However, again, this won't go well for a viewer who does not watch old films and, especially, one who hasn't seen Citizen Kane before. Granted, you really don't have to have seen Citizen Kane to watch this film - it's more important that you know the backstory to Citizen Kane. Still, little Easter eggs the director has put here will go over your head.Cinematography for this film is stunning. Again, truly channeling that Old Hollywood greatness. So many shots were aesthetically pleasing and could truly pass for a photo from the golden age of cinema. However the movie is dragged on. There wasn't really any reason for it to be 2 hours long. Maybe that was another nod to Old Hollywood, but just like for a lot of of the films then, that time mark is brutal and unnecessary. I nodded off for a couple of scenes because it was straightforward info that was getting dragged and dragged on. This film could've easily been 1 hour and 45 minutes and told the story it's meant to.As others have mentioned, this film has been made for The Oscar. It's definitely Oscar bait but unlike Nomadland, it's easy to see why it's Oscar worthy. It's deserving of its nominations but as my review's title says, it's not for everyone. If you're a fan of the golden age of Hollywood, this is a must watch and you'll love it."
MANK,15 March 2021,7/10,"The setting is Hollywood around 1936. Talented screen writer Mank ( Herman Mankiewicz), a full blown alcoholic has been assigned by noted director Orson Welles to write the script of ""Citizen Kane."" Mank has injured his foot in a car accident and is confined to bed. He has a physiotherapist for help and an assistant to type the script. Director David Fincher depicts the ways of Hollywood of those times showing the professional rivalry among the heads of the major studios like MGM, RKO, Universal, Warner Brothers etc. Some interesting scenes are the MGM boss speaking to his staff regarding 50% salary roll back, his birthday party, Mank's longish drunken rant ending in his throwing up, Mank's confrontation with MGM boss, and his showdown with Orson Welles. There is an elaborate scene of election results of Merriam and Sinclair, a hot development of those times.. All well designed and impressive scenes with heavy dialogue though one wishes the director could have focussed more on film and film making .The black and white format succeeds in giving the film a retro feel and we are indeed transported back to Hollywood studios of those times. Actor Gary Oldman plays the heavy smoking and drinking screen writer with great conviction. He has many scenes where he is drunk. Many would consider it an award winning performance ."
MANK,16 December 2020,7/10,"Pros:Beautiful cinematographyGary Oldman's performance as Mank was greatTom Pelphrey - I'm a massive Ozark fanCons:Story didn't capture my emotions as much as I thoughtScreenplay was a strange for me (that may just be me)I wanted more...Overall, I think Mank is brilliantly shot film and as a huge fan of film history, this certainly spoke to me in large portions and I really enjoyed that. However, I thought I was going to be much more invested in a film about the making of one of the greatest films ever made, Citizen Kane, but I finished feeling otherwise. David Fincher's use of the camera is to be admired, while Gary Oldman's performance as Mank is sure to be rewarded come awards season, but whether another viewing of Mank will capture my attention more is a question I will sure revisit. A beautiful film, but just lacked the emotive energy for me.Quote - ""You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one"". - Herman J. MankiewiczRating - 3/5"
MANK,4 January 2021,8/10,"The dearth of imagination in Hollywood and indeed in contemporary global pop culture as a whole is attested by the number of bland sequels, woke remakes and eye-burning superhero sagas the film industry is churning out. Occasionally a period piece is attempted but the bimbos (male or female) of Tinseltown rarely understand or empathize with such subjects enough to present an engaging product. When it turns to its own history, however, Hollywood is writing what it knows, and so it is with 'Mank,' a diary of the genesis of the script to 'Citizen Kane.'Even so, the script is a bit awkward. The plot meanders about, obviously imitating the chronology of the product to which it pays tribute and attempting to draw parallels to the personality of the author. The problem is that the metastory here is nowhere near as thematically rich of coherent, and so the technique doesn't really pass as well. Attempting to recapture ""the spirit of the product"" in black and white in the vein of 'Goodnight and Good Luck' similarly fails: this is a story first and foremost not about a (semi-)fictional work about real humans and it really needed to be in color to be fully draw us into their world.The political subtext of idiot reactionaries against ""misunderstood"" soft-socialist allies of F.D.R. is a bit heavy-handed but it isn't nearly as whiny about its own faction's failings as, say, 'The Big Short.' 'Citizen Kane' was a thinly-veiled satire of William Randolph Hearst and the movie certainly lays into the style of reporting his press line cultivated but not as much into his person as one might expect.To their credit, the writers do portray among Hearst's allies Marion Davies as a woman of sharp intelligence and not unsubstantial compassion, contrary to common assumptions. I suspect this has more to do with prophylaxis against feminist rage in the post-""Me Too"" era than a desire to be accurate or ""balanced"" but it works very well. Tom Burke plays Orson Wells as a fresh wunderkid one could easily imagine fresh out of film school today, and with just enough ""creepy need pervert"" undertone to make one wonder whether the choice not to accord him more screen time was deliberate, lest the writers either call undue attention to an unpleasant snob or steer too far from historical accuracy.Lastly, in the world of post-Obama, Trump and ""Black Lives Matter"" where accusations of ""cultural appropriation"" fly left and right one cannot help noticing the preponderance of Gentile actors for the Jewish characters in this one. I have my theories as to why this was done, none of which are politically correct.All in all, though, the story is more than sufficiently engaging, the characters more than sufficiently interesting and the technicals more than sufficiently competent to engross, thrill and entertain us. In the end, this is all that matters so far as a film is concerned. 'Mank' even refers to this, set as it is during the Great Depression, depicting the worry that financial pressure would separate Americans from their movie houses, the one pleasurable escape which remains. That speaks volumes to a similarly dark period in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cinemas closed or restricted in many districts and Hollywood itself in the thick of a creative dark age. A truly entertaining picture such as 'Mank' stands out all the more in a time such as this, and if I've been frank in pointing out its flaws that is only because such an important product naturally draws such close analysis and scrutiny.In any event, the filmmakers certainly succeeded in brightening up my evening as well as my screen last night, and I've no doubt the evenings of so many other spectators as well. For that I salute them."
MANK,18 December 2020,7/10,"It is a good movie, good but normal, sorry for me it is not big deal, just normal, now, it well done about the time adaptation and Oldman performance, but I waited more, I guess it is gonna be on Oscars nominations, ok we will see"
MANK,20 December 2020,4/10,"'Mank' is a film that requires a good deal of knowledge on the part of the viewer. He / she should be well acquainted with Orson Wells and his rivalry with William Randolph Hearst. You'd better know about Louis B. Mayer. Also Irving Thalberg. Also the 'war' going on between Lefties and Righties in the film industry of The Thirties. Also MGM's history versus that of R.K.O. Also the Mankiewicz Family. And most important, the viewer has got to care about these things. And frankly, the movie does little or nothing to foster such caring.It is a film with no heart. We hear that a character has died; no one seems especially saddened. We learn that a character has been found alive; pretty run-of-the-mill. Characters drink to excess; we'd be saddened if we were invested in them, but we're not. There is no dramatic arc to the film. No build. Characters do not grow; not even change. There is about 'Mank' no sense of humanity. The film is as cold as the white that offsets the black of every frame.On the plus side, the film is a marvel to watch. The absolute clarity of the black and white images is startling in the best of ways. The set pieces at railroad stations, mansions, and on the California High Desert are breathtaking.If I were to recommend the film with the sound turned off you'd think me insane. So I won't."
MANK,21 November 2020,9/10,Not bad but based on a lie... Mank did not write citizen kane but only portions of it... Welles wrote most of the screenplay and then a movie critic said he didnt... Cant stand famous filmmakers names being dragged in the mud for fake reality... Sort of like errol flynn and his supposed ties to nazi germany.
MANK,5 October 2021,8/10,"I will admit that I never really got Citizen Kane. I never understood its brilliance. I could see the technical artistry or grasp the significance of the innovations it presents, but I never understood it as a film, as a story. Citizen Kane never did it for me. I did not get the point of it. What was so special about this Kane guy? Why is everyone so fascinated by this despicable man? Sure, it might be a satire of Hearst, but what is so clever about that? After seeing Mank, I got it. I finally got the whole picture.This film's strength is that it is finely written. And it is a good story. There may be some references that are pretty obscure, but overall it lays out these real world characters clearly and distinctly. And that is why it works; it builds the characters in recognizable stereotypes. There is an argument that this film is not historically accurate and that it relies on the views of Pauline Kael that have been since debunked. Yet, I found this interpretation, that Orson Wells was not the sole author of Kane more impactful and frankly better drama.The whole movie rests on the idea that Mank and Hearst were actual friends, or at least social acquaintances. Even if we accept that Wells wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane, which he actually did, it does not satisfyingly explain why. I think that is the genius of this movie. By showing the personal relationship between Mank and Hearst, and all that background Hollywood gossip street legends, it gives more credence and more legitimacy for Citizen Kane.It gives more power to Citizen Kane because it makes it a personal story. For all his wunderking genius, Wells was an outsider to this world. He was an East-coast theater guy, he did not know this world nor frequent it. Putting Mank in the authorship position makes it a film about friendship, or at least Hollywood friendship, broken friendship even. It transforms the film from a pamphlet from an artist to a tyrant, to a story about social circles and social ladders. It becomes a story about the rich and powerful creating their own stories, myths and legends. And the guy on the inside who fought against."
MANK,7 December 2020,6/10,The settings and filmography is beautiful. But the story is dull and a little jumbled with the constant flashbacks.Thank god for streaming because I can only watch this 20 minutes at a time. If I watched this in the theaters I'd be napping.
MANK,19 March 2021,6/10,"Citizen Kane is perhaps the essential movie, considered by many to be the greatest ever made. Orson Welles was not only director, actor, and producer, but also writer, alongside Herman J. Mankiewicz. This movie is the story of how Mankiewicz (Mank) managed to write the script to Citizen Kane while effectively bedridden by a leg injury and ailed with alcoholism. It tells of the events that led to the inspiration for the film, most famous being the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.Gary Oldman stars as Mank. While he gives a great performance, it is not his best, although that is a very high bar, given the heights of Oldman's career. If there's one person on the cast who stands out, it's Amanda Sayfried as Marion Davies, Hearst's much younger mistress. She captures the feel of the 30s actress very well. The rest of the star-studded cast is good, but nothing much to write home about.The best thing about this movie is how it manages to capture the feel of classic Hollywood and also show the tumult of the Great Depression's impact on the studios. It's filmed in black and white, which is a good start. The costume design is good and really shows the era. The score is also excellent, delivering a jazz inspired soundtrack. No movie in this era has captured the sound perfectly well, but this is as close as it gets. These elements bring the viewer to the past, making it feel like the era its set in, not just looking like it.There are a few scenes in the movie that parallel those in Citizen Kane that are welcome references. For instance, there is a scene where Mank drops a glass that is framed the same way as Kane dropping the snow globe as he dies at the beginning of Citizen Kane. The entire story structure is similar, with flashbacks being used to tell the story as the protagonist moves toward his goal.There is one massive fatal flaw with this movie, and that is that it loses focus mid-way through and does not pick up. It ends up focusing on the 1934 California governor election and Hollywood's role in supporting the candidates, which contributes little to the Citizen Kane story. While it does put Mank and Hearst at odds, it spends way too much time on the election at the expense of the whole movie. It also makes it seem like Mank is a side character in all this, and that Louis B. Mayer and Upton Sinclair are the main characters. Hearst is not in it enough. Hearst should be more important than Mayer. He is the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane after all. Davies could have more screen time too. This movie bills itself as the story behind Citizen Kane, which it honestly isn't. There's at least as much about this election as there is about Citizen Kane. This also bloats the movie's runtime, which makes it feel too long, even though a more focused movie could easily have been this long.With this movie, it's hard to forget that it was written by Jack Fincher, father of director David Fincher. What David Fincher did with this movie is unquestionably admirable, taking his deceased father's dream project and making it come true. There is a great deal of respect for a move like that. It just makes you wish the product itself was better. If you're interested in Citizen Kane and its history, the 1996 documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane is where it's at. It's much more focused on Citizen Kane itself, and keeps its focus all the way through."
MANK,18 February 2021,1/10,"I've liked David Fincher since his first films. His aesthetics, his sense of story timing, nothing should have gone wrong, but, oh man, what a flop ""Mank"" is. I didn't like this film after just a few minutes. What's the reason for that? Well, when dialogues are only used to play up the mental superiority of characters to the audience, I switch off, because I see through the trick. ""Mank"" is a talky film. However, the dialogues are not razor sharp, they are boring. It revolves around names that you either know or don't know, which makes no difference. In addition, cool music blares all the time, which is supposed to give us the impression that this was all made with a loose hand, but thus seems all the more tense, because one thing Fincher is not - a second Scorsese. Of course Gary Oldman is a great actor, of course the film's design in black and white is also a tribute to the time it illuminates. But just as you don't have to like ""Citizen Kane"", which, by the way, some consider absolutely boring, you don't have to like ""Mank"". Hollywood will celebrate it because it likes to celebrate itself. I warn everyone against this dull 130 minutes that go absolutely nowhere."
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"This film is a Critic's film, I think. Critics love films about the movie world, and when one thinks about it there are plenty of examples - Hollywood, being a typical one for instance. But Hollywood, for all its flaws, appealed to the masses with its galaxy of stars still not forgotten and the way it displayed what it takes to get to the top in the cutthroat town of Hollywood. But this is a film about a Scriptwriter, the man who wrote the famous movie 'Citizen Kane'. Scriptwriters rarely excite people the way movie stars do, usually are underrated and as fairly recent events shown not long ago, underpaid as well. Mankewicz or 'Mank' as he was usually referred to, seemed to have been an exception, having worked on some fairly prestigious movies. He also had a drink problem, and this became a problem for me as a viewer because he seemed to spend half the movie lying on his bed, too drunk to write or even speak. And when he was on his feet, he was like most drunks, loud and uncouth. Oldman is a great actor, he had a firm grip on the part he was asked to play. The trouble was, the story was plodding and boring, with much name dropping and back slapping, and talk about politics. And I am sure this is all riveting stuff for professional critics, but for me it was downright boring. And I suspect a lot of other viewers will feel the same way. We have seen too many films about men and women who live their lives staring into a bottle, and perhaps Mank was lucky, he got his oscar in the end. As for me, I felt like I deserved an oscar for watching it to the end, gorgeous though the whole production looked. You have to have a good story, and this was not a good story, it played out like some upmarket soap opera."
MANK,13 January 2021,6/10,"Mank's premise stems from a theory popularized by a New Yorker article penned by film critic Pauline Kael, Raising Kane, that claims Herman J. Mankiewicz was the true and only author of Citizen Kane and that Orson Welles does not deserve a writer's credit. This claim has since been debunked by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich and other film scholars over the years who have examined the drafts of the screenplay.David Fincher's new film, written by his late father Jack Fincher, entertains that claim and runs with it. In his own words, David Fincher stated that he was not interested in choosing a side but was interested in telling a story about a writer who agreed to be uncredited and ended up changing his mind.On a technical level, the craftsmanship and level of detail in Mank is a marvel. The film takes on the cinematic style of the 1940s. There are halos of light hovering over the actor's heads. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score, who commonly are known for their synth-heavy scores, is orchestral accurate to the era. There are even cigarette burns on the corner of the frame-you know, the same ones Tyler Durden taught us about in Fight Club.Erik Messerschmidt's black and white cinematography, lit within every inch of its life, is sultry and gorgeous. At times, the monochrome digital image is so contrasting, the visuals resemble a dramatic scene from Robert Rodriguez's Sin City series, especially in scenes where window blinds are involved. For those film aficionados or film professors who ever struggled to get people to sit down to enjoy a black and white film, Mank may be your ticket.Narrative wise, Mank does not really explain its niché story to the mainstream audience. The context is given at a bare minimum through a few title cards but most of it goes unexplained. I would advise seeing Citizen Kane first before Mank. If you haven't, just forget it. And even then, it might be informative to read Raising Kane. There is no emotional throughline for any casual viewer to invest their emotions into Mank or what's happening, which reduces the entire experience as purely procedural.Due to how distant the script felt, it's hard to say anything about the cast other than they do a good job with the material they're given. Gary Oldman can do very little wrong in my eyes. The Mank role pales in comparison to Oldman's lifelong pantheon of characters over the years.The dialogue is highly stylized, some may think it's overwritten. The words have a life of their own. You can enjoy listening to the dialogue akin to watching a ping pong ball fire back and forth at the Olympic Finals. Every line is the perfect comeback exclusively designed by Ferrari; in real life, it would take days of racking your brain for the ideal reply.That is the idea though. Mank is perfectly aware it's a dream. The story is a what-if that takes place in a time long gone about the little guy sticking it to the rich and powerful. The viewer will need to decide how much they want to dream along with it.I found Mank a hard watch, finishing it over four sittings in a week, but the experience was never unpleasant. The whole time I was enamored by the passion that went into it and wished that I too, cared so much about an alcoholic screenwriter wanting to be credited for a great film from the forties. In the end, I didn't care, but that's okay. I compare the experience of watching people play Warhammer 40K.I ultimately admired Mank more than I enjoyed it. It is great to see a director make a film about a niché subject as a labor of love. After seeing Mank, that love rubbed off and I have since been reading up on Citizen Kane's production, the infamous Pauline Kael article, and the rebuttal. That said, I am unlikely to revisit Mank any time soon."
MANK,10 February 2021,8/10,"Great film, Garry pulls it off yet again. His performance is great and the story is excellent. Solid film I hope it wins many awards."
MANK,17 December 2020,3/10,"Gorgeously crafted, well acted but utterly boring, uninteresting and slow. I thought The Case of Benjamin was Fincher's worse...but this one deserves such title."
MANK,17 April 2021,6/10,"Let's start off by saying I watched it few nights ago.. and have to stop the movie about 30 minutes later because I can't seems to cope with it due to the case I haven't seen Citizen Kane before so in order to finished this film I went to watch Citizen Kane and just finished the movie hours later today.After watching Citizen Kane And having a better understanding I can appreciate the movie references to CK and how Mank can relate to it.. for example the parasol and the puzzle.I can relate but fincher father writing is not that good and David himself I believe will try to stay faithful to the writing, all of the character in the movie performs astoundingly no doubt about that but just afraid the supporting and best actor and actress nominee is way too strong this year.All I can say this movie is a homage fincher had for his father Citizen Kane the movie and Mank himself. All I can say if you did not watch CK don't bother watching this movie at all you would totally despise the movie.But as the movie as a whole it lacks the intense and some of the conversations is just boring.I really wanted to rate it higher due to the fact I really loves Citizen Kane but is just not possible.Orson Welles > Herman Mankiewicz."
MANK,12 April 2021,7/10,"Mank is a film that starts with a heavy presentation that gives us the feel of the 40's era. Director David Fincher does a really good job presenting the whole era in front of us with complete satisfaction. The screenplay and editing doesn't let you get off your seat and let's you think that what's this move has to offer more. Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried and every other actor's acting is on point and gives you the feeling of the old times. The cinematography puts in extra spices into the elements to make you feel the old times even more. In terms of acts the film is in good pace in the beginning and at the end, while in the middle the film gets a little slow. For some people it's ok while for some it will make them check their phones. Overall Mank is a film everyone should check out for once on weekends and flow with its elements."
MANK,3 April 2021,10/10,Mank was a wonderful story about a courageous and flawed individual who at times thought and operated on a genius level.
MANK,6 December 2020,5/10,"First, I have to say that I love the look (B&W), it really has the look of 1940's Hollywood. The costumes, sets and decor are excellent, especially San Simeon's interior and exterior grounds. The acting is an A. The casting all around is good. My personal favorite is Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies. I also was impressed that the make up department got the handsome Charles Dance to look like William Randolph Hearst. Gary Oldman is always excellent and Tom Burke nailed Orson Welles. However, the script - meh. I'm not sure that I am going to continue watching the full movie. It's so hard to follow. I know it's mostly old time studio politics and the writing of ""Citizen Kane"", but it should be more clear as to what was happening. Neither Orson Welles or ""Citizen Kane"" were favorites of mine to begin with. I wanted to see it when I saw who was in it. They are good, the script is not."
MANK,13 December 2020,,"The political subtext here is fascinating and relevant.""Fake News"" wasn't invented by the Orange Clown and it's shocking to see how it was wielded in the 30's.This movie may not be your cuppa, but it is well acted and amazing to look at. Oldman is fantastic (when isn't he?) and Seyfried just crushes it here. The two hours fly by and if nothing else, you never have time to get bored.I am unfamiliar with the debate concerning the writing behind Citizen Kane. I am a fan of old movies and along with everything else, it's just pretty fun to watch Fincher do a 40's B&W film a la Kane.There is a heavy use of flashbacks which while maybe a little irritating serve a really useful purpose for those of us totally unfamiliar with the history (yes, I'm one of those), so it provides context to what is taking place in the film's ""present"" time.I suspect this is not a biopic and some watchers will be annoyed by the need to suspend disbelief. Oh well.Recommended."
MANK,20 April 2021,8/10,"David Fincher directs this unapologetically bold classic Hollywood period piece. The cast is engaging and the dialogue is persistently witty. I didn't care for the black and white aesthetic personally, but overall, it adds tremendous context and works in the film's favor."
MANK,29 November 2020,9/10,"Initial Thoughts:
In some ways this film ranges from a 4/10 to a 9/10 style film. Why is it a 4? Because the beginning feels like a mess. As if the producer and director weren't sure on what direction they wanted to go. In addition, I thought this film would include how the filming was done for ""Citizen Kane"", and not just how the film was written. Why is it a 9? The main body of the film shows how Mank had lots of time to write a screenplay to very little time all the while going through the motions of Hollywood drama.Pros:
For me the film depicted the tumultuous lifestyle of Hermann J. Mankiewicz very well. Through all the years of his drinking, gambling, and fighting for his name to be credited on the films he wrote. The black and white filming also brings the emotions of the day into a better perspective although it made it dreary at times and hard to focus. However, the style of film was well enjoyed as compared to modern day films, night scenes were hard to see. I also enjoyed the numerous ""flashbacks"" as they are the main part of the film that brings the back and forth between how Mank lived and how he was living by the end almost simultaneously.Cons:
Going back to the black and white filming being dreary and hard to focus. At times I would zone out due to the fact that a lot was happening and I couldn't focus so I listened to what was going on for a minute. More of my con than a movie con is the fact that I also felt out of element, as I was not fancy enough to understand such marvelous mind(s). I digress, however, as to me, there were not many cons to go on.Overall:
A long bio-drama that should be enjoyed, especially if you enjoy early style movies. I wouldn't recommend watching in theatres, but if you have an inkling to watch it, wait for the Netflix release on Friday, December 6th.Enjoy the show!"
MANK,16 November 2020,4/10,"I'm a big fan of Citizen Kane and always heard how witty and interesting Herman Mankiewicz was. I was well into the movie, waiting to see this wit emerge, and it never did. I just saw an irritating man who wasn't particularly interesting. He was insulting, boring, not likeable. That has to be Fincher's fault. I was hoping Orson Welles would be in this, as part of the mystique of 'Who wrote Citizen Kane?', but he was only in the movie about 5 minutes. That actor who played him was very good. He had the voice and attitude, and Fincher shot him in an interesting way. So why don't we see more of him?
Some of the dialogue was spoken in a stilted way, as if the actors were reciting lines they just learned.
Charles Dance was good as William Randolph Hearst, as was Arlis Howard as Louis B Mayer---that's why I'm giving this a 4.
Three quarters of the way into the movie, I was pretty much tired of the Mankiewicz portrayal, but that's when Fincher decides to show Mank's drunken rant against Hearst at San Simeon. The rant was a bore, with no punch, just abrasive. No one told him to shut up. I wanted to.
The movie also spends way too much time on the 1934 election for governor of California. Who could possibly care?
This was a terribly made mess of a movie, and shouldn't get praise solely for being a biography in black and white."
MANK,20 April 2021,6/10,"There isn't much to add to what was already mentioned here in most reviews, all artists are free to create whatever piece of work they intend to and it seems this one is very personal to David Fincher, since his father tried to direct this movie and wanted to tell this story, but he passed before having the chance to do so.With that being said, and again respecting the will of the artist, this is sort of a metaphorical middle finger to the audience, in the sense that it has great actors, great cinematography, great potential but it seems to have been made for personal reasons only and if you are not aware of the background that surrounds this movie, historically speaking, most likely you will be 100% left out and wondering what were you actually seeing.I've seen Citizen Kane and I enjoyed it very much, it was innovative, original, bold and set the tone for the future of cinema, however I had only some grasp of the real life events in which it was based, I did some research before getting into Mank, and even with all of that the story is too self absorbed and doesn't care about the audience, David wanted to do this he did it and it seems he didn't consider what the spectators would think, and I guess most ratings here speak for themselves.Don't get me wrong, the movie does have its moments and it's always a pleasure watching Gary Oldman doing his magic, I also really appreciated the environment, the atmosphere the sound and the directing overall paying homage to Orson Well work, it just seems a very specific and if I must say not that interesting story, considering the characters and the overall message of oppression and what powerful man can achieve simply because they have power, the movie could benefit a lot from a more thoughtful approach to the public, but then again it didn't seem to be Fincher's goal."
MANK,6 April 2021,7/10,"The story of the making of the classic Citizen Kane has always been David Fincher's heart's project. His now deceased Jack Fincher wrote the screenplay in the 1990s and it eventually took him until 2019 to realise the project. It's about screenwriter Hermann J. Mankiewicz (""Mank""), who is fighting a battle against alcoholism and has image problems in the old Hollywood of the 1930s. When Orson Welles suddenly contacts him and asks to write the script for his new film, Mank works meticulously on it and remembers his role as an outsider in the industry.The fact that Gary Oldman was also a heavy alcoholic in his early years is somewhat reflected in his acting of the protagonist. He sinks into this role and represents Mankiewicz's outsider status authentically and multifaceted. Oldman is always on screen and always relates to the broad ensemble of supporting characters in some way. There is Lily Collins, who looks after the recidivist Mank in an institution and grows increasingly fond of him. They both see themselves as discontinued products who are not properly accepted by society. This strengthens their chemistry, which always seems very amical and genuine. But this is true for Mank in almost all his interpersonal relationships. Be it with his wife Sara (Tuppence Middleton), his political counterparts Arliss Howard (Louis B. Mayer) and William Hearst (Charles Dance) or Hearst's significantly younger girlfriend Marion Davis, played by Amanda Seyfried. The latter plays perhaps more multi-dimensionally than ever before and, together with Mank, is probably the most interesting character. She is sassy and confident, but is trapped in a male-dominated world where Seyfried is only free to really deliver in her moments with Oldman. These scenes unfortunately occur too infrequently, making her seem somewhat underused. Also sharing few but memorable moments is Tom Pelphrey as Mank's brother Joseph, who unlike his brother has a good standing in Hollywood and despite his best efforts is always let down by Mank. Tom Burke looks like the real Orson Welles, but we don't get much more than frustration and self-pity from this character.Excellent acting, top-class camera work and a virtuoso score. In addition, nostalgic impressions of glamorous Hollywood and a black-and-white flair reminiscent of old film classics. Technically, Mank has it all and is certainly one of the most aesthetically pleasing films of recent years. The many flashbacks to Mank's past are also extremely appealing and well done. But emotionally, the film fails to touch you at any point. It seems as if Fincher only concentrated on the script and the setting and forgot about the added value. This is hardly present in Mank. Even Oldman's sympathetic portrayal of a relatable character can't change that. A dialogue firework that can't decide whether it wants to celebrate Hollywood or drag it into the abyss of the indefensible. Mank is well worth seeing, but rather indifferent and forgettable in terms of its story."
MANK,3 December 2020,9/10,"This film is sincerely telling a story about a man behind so many of our movie memories and making a new one in the process. It has a structural approach reminiscent of Citizen Kane, used to build a portrait of Mankiewicz and his time similar to how Kane explored its titular character. However Mank is truly made perfect by its intoxicating style. It completely feels like a facsimile of a 1930s film, yet it plays itself more dynamically.
Fincher's attention to detail behind the camera and the sharp dialogue written by his late father Jack Fincher made this an ambitious and intoxicating watch that will no doubt go down a storm this award season.
This is a talky film, with Mank giving speeches about everything from the Germans' war strategies (it's 1940) to the many ways he hates Louis B. Mayer to the reasons he detests the ways moguls use and abuse everyone for their selfish purposes. Oldman shines best when he's going toe to toe with Dance, a formidable actor who was born to play powerful men. Visually, the film is stunning, with striking, relevant use of black and white and acting was at its best. Fincher is a world class filmmaker and he employs his signature wide shots effectively and composes the scenes to stress Mank's state of mind.
I've to say, every second of this film is immersive and hypnotic."
MANK,18 December 2020,6/10,It tried to include every single information possible and that resulted in an obnoxious story to follow while at the same time it was begging to be taken seriously. It also ended up taking things only as black or white especially towards the end which was both historically unclear but also kinda lazy.
MANK,20 March 2021,5/10,"If you are familiar with historical Hollywood stars and producers of the time then this movie will make much sense. It shows how much Hollywood was involved in the political games of the Depression era. Other than that, it's kind of boring story."
MANK,7 December 2020,3/10,"Excruciatingly hard plot to follow. Love Gary Oldman, but this movie... stinks. He's as bad in this as Helen Mirren was in ""Catherine the Great"". Little sparks of... something in the dialogue, but nothing that can carry this schlock."
MANK,7 December 2020,2/10,"They call it nepotism for a reason, Fincher: you're not likely to edit your old man, even when he needs it. This is an entirely predictable, shallow version of a complex story, one that really has no hero or villain: everyone is awful, as they were in life.
Strange waste of a good cast."
MANK,10 December 2020,6/10,"This film looks beautiful, has a tremendous score, amazing cast, and is technically sound, but it's just not very compelling. The film relies far too much on Gary Oldman (who come on is not in his early 40's!), as large stretches of time go by without anything interesting going on in the film. This is not the dark, brooding psychological film I had hoped for, given the material. It's, instead, a slow moving black comedy without much to say. This film doesn't benefit from coming out only a few years after Trumbo- another film about an eccentric writer and the intersections of film and politics- which was completely engaging and full of soul and emotion."
MANK,2 May 2021,8/10,"No, I don't mean the lead character, genius screenwriter Herman Jacob ""Mank"" Mankiewicz--although it fits him the same--but Fincher's very movie. This film throws its English degree in your face and if you can't handle its rainfall then you shall be doomed to frustration.In any case, though, frustration arises. Depicting the arduous and chaotic process that is the writing of the script for ""Citizen Kane"" made Fincher rub off the movie's attitude by slicing ""Mank"" into various pieces not necessarily in chronological order. It feels pretentious and exaggerated. Herman J. Mankiewicz is no Charles Foster Kane and, respectfully, Gary Oldman is no Orson Welles (although his performance arises to the man's depiction of Kane). This ambitious undertaking is still the movie throwing its smarts around, the only problem is that here it fails.But everything is not chaos, not even close. The movie's main plot line involves Mank isolated at North Verde Ranch in Victorville, California recovering from a broken leg sustained in a car crash. There, Welles has removed any distractions including Mank's favorite poison, alcohol so that he may create arguably the greatest scrip ever written. Over arguments with his secretary, Rita Alexander to which he dictates the script, we also see clips of his past life, slowly, methodically and surely understanding how he became to be in that position.Between alcohol and his platonic relationships, Mank rubs shoulders with Hollywood made men of the golden age like Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg and William Randolph Hearst. Fincher is well aware of the moment in Hollywood he is capturing. The movie has a Hitchcockian feel to it, its jazz-inspired style, cabaret-paced bebop speed encapsulates the business model of Hollywood and the importance of literary men to make it work. A particular scene in which the likes of David O. Selznick and Ben Hecht all introduce themselves to the screen a-la Scorsese carries quite the gravitas.""Mank"" contains multitudes, so many in fact that they disrupt the main story of the ramshackle genius that is its title character. Yet by the end, it all comes together. Especially Mank's heartbreaking yet beautiful confession on his obsession with alcohol which also brought him his end: ""I seem to become more and more of a rat in a trap of my own construction, a trap that I regularly repair whenever there seems to be danger of some opening that will enable me to escape. I haven't decided yet about making it bomb proof. It would seem to involve a lot of unnecessary labor and expense""."
MANK,18 August 2021,9/10,"Mank is a technical symphony and a bit navel-gazey, making it an ideal film for film buffs. Set in the heart of Hollywood's golden age, Mank tells the origin story of the iconic film, Citizen Kane. For a cinephile, that is already cause of intrigue, but director darling David Fincher at the helm makes it a perfect storm. Fincher pulls out every 1930s trick in the book to immerse his audience in the time period. The elegant score, classic fades and stark lighting all contribute to this expert homage. On top of that, Fincher's trademark methodical camera movement is artful and precise without calling attention to itself.Only Fincher could tell such an understated story in such an intentionally dry way and have it land with absolute poise. Throw in Gary Oldman's razor-sharp performance to build around and we have ourselves a rock solid production. In general, Mank may not be a blockbuster that will have the masses raving; it is, however, a sophisticated commemoration that will fascinate experienced viewers.Writing: 9/10

MANK,26 December 2020,4/10,"Well, this is NOT Fincher and it's his only movie I rate below 6.Very niche movie for a very small audience. Not his traditional style. Expected a lot more."
MANK,13 December 2020,5/10,"Apparently, David Fincher did not have time to do both Mindhunter and his passion project Mank. So now I'm left with an unfinished Netflix series, right when the story starts to unfold, and a movie that couldn't hold my attention."
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"Here's my review of Mank. So Mank is the new straight to Netflix movie directed by David Fincher from a script written by his late father Jack Fincher . The movie is a biopic about the late Herman J Mankiewicz who is best known for writing the movie , Citizen Kane , which is considered one of the greatest movies ever made. Herman or "" Mank "" as he's referred to in the movie is played masterfully by Gary Oldman who's performance is aided to from the cinematography of the movie being all film strip esque and 1930s ish and will no doubt be a serious contender at the Oscars. Amanda Seyfried was also great in this movie. Despite the top notch production and great talent though , I felt this movie was boring and I'm someone who actually enjoys arthouse movies. Now the story is set in 1930s Hollywood where Herman is in isolation writing the script for citizen kane for Orson Welles aided by someone to dictate to and a german nurse . Then there are flashbacks to before his isolation where he meets producers , Gambles , drinks and all Hollywood - ish stuff. But its very hard to keep up with the characters cause you don't know anything about them other than that they are either studio heads , politicians or both . And since you're not familiar with any of them , it just doesn't work . If you've seen the popular HBO show Entourage or even the netflix show Bojack Horseman , you know how great shows set in Hollywood are . There's agents , writers , directors , scandals , crisis management , PR teams and so much more things there to set up drama , and the one other thing common to both shows is how they use current politicians , current actors with cameos , pop culture references and a whole lot of stuff we could relate to . This movie is pretty much Entourage in the 30s without an Entourage for Mank . Mank meets people , has smart stuff to say , brokers deals with production houses and that's just about it. Mostly it has to do with the fact like I said before that we dont know this world , in Entourage someone says "" James Cameron's directing Aquaman "" and we didn't need the show telling us who he was and in Bojack Horseman when someone says "" this movie is going to cannes "" we didn't need the show explaining what it was , cause we just know things from pop culture. This movie on the other hand needed to tell us that for us to know the world , what's at stake and who the characters are , instead it just doesn't and I think Jack Fincher didn't feel the need to do that since he wrote this script at a time when 30s pop culture was common knowledge , atleast among film critics. Now David Fincher is one of my favorite directors working today and I'm a huge fan of his movies for the different themes in them and how perfectly crafted the movies look and are acted . Speaking of themes , Fight club was about anti consumerism , Gone girl was about pretending to be someone else and all that . Now this movie doesn't really have a theme , or maybe it does and I didn't notice said theme , which only means its subtle. Now David Fincher has made few masterclass movies in his long career as a director and that's cause he's worked with different writers such as Gyllian Flynn , Steve Zailian , Andrew Kevin Walker and Aaron Sorkin , despite working with different writers , he's made his movies with his own vision in mind and you'd distinctly know each one of them as his own movie , but his father I don't think is someone who Fincher would collaborate with if he was not his father , cause I wouldn't have guessed this movie to be directed by him had I not known about it previously . In the end , Mank definitely doesn't look like something Fincher would've made unless he was paying homage to his late father , nevertheless the movie doesn't dissapoint you completely cause of its great acting and quality of production ."
MANK,5 December 2020,1/10,Probably well made and will appeal to some people with esoteric tastes. It reminds me of a worse version of Ed Wood. Trying to show the golden age of Hollywood and shot in black and white. But to me this movie is worse than staring at a blank screen. The whole vibe propels me to rage. Something about the coy yesteryear thing just made me bored and aggravated.
MANK,7 December 2020,1/10,"A few years ago, one of the first dents in what seemed to be a developing friendship with a colleague (which was eventually mutually called off) came when I asked him if he had a favourite director. ""David Fincher,"" he said. I stumbled.Fincher has done some wondrous work, and some perfectly hideous work. I was so looking forward to what I thought was going to be a biopic of the brilliant director Joseph L. Mankiewicz.It turns out ""Mank"" is about his older brother, Herman Mankiewicz.And it is almost unwatchable.It works on a utterly-contrived visual level. It is shot in black-and-white and passes sometimes for a product of the years it allegedly catalogues, complete with the ""cigarette burns"" at the end of each reel.While it has some snappy lines, the screen play (the sole output penned by Fincher's father, who died in 2003 - ?!?) works so hard at being droll it's a wonder it doesn't just keel over. Clever! We've got to be clever! Clever, clever, clever!The performances are, for the most part, shadows of cartoons.There is, basically, no plot, no character development, and the score - by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross who deservedly won an Oscar for ""The Social Network,"" which shows how good Fincher can be - is so utterly wrong in every aspect. Boys: this is the decade between 1930 and 1940, not the 1950s.It looks nice. There is good detail to the recreations of MGM's back lot in the 1930s and San Simeon (which I have visited twice). Too bad none of the people who populate these well-thought-out and over-busy locations can hold your interest.A total disaster. And to think: critics are calling it a masterpiece and a certain Oscar-winner.I am now going to cue up ""Nomadland."" Frances McDormand has never given an even mediocre performance, has she? I'm hoping that will alleviate some of the numbness of the past two-and-a-half wasted hours.If you are at all curious about these sorts of literary sects, by all means watch the vastly underappreciated ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"" which is so alive and present you can smell the cigar smoke in the Algonquin dining room. I wish someone would do a film about the Bloomsbury Group... Who do we cast as Vita Sackville-West?"
MANK,4 April 2021,4/10,"Best Pic Nominee? Well this strange film qualifies as it has the requisite qualifications:👍 Sympathetic, idealist, loveable, alcoholic lead
👍 Glamorous Clothes
👍. Socialism Good, Capitalism Bad
👍. Glamorous period locationAdmittedly, I barely knew what was happening until about 1/2 way through. The last 1/2 of the film exposes it to be what it is, of course, pure propaganda. A telling scene in the movie dramatises voter interviews ( an election is a main partnof the film) and surprise surprise all the sympathetically portrayed characters are democrats. It gets worse from there. The protaganists are aghast at any arguments against socialism- which are as valid today as they were back then. Republican is a dirty word- all the ""republicans"" are scumbags.Socialists are the heros. Socialists are the good guys! They're the kind ones, the funny ones, the ones with the fun and goofy soundtrack behind them... Its a barely concealed - no subtlety here- socialist propaganda film from beginning to end.I'm getting tired of every single movie, tv show, even commercial ads- what in the sam hel is happening... This is ""just a movie"", but there are enough dumb people out there to believe what it's selling. And p.s. Sinclair was proven to have sold fiction as truth... he was no hero."
MANK,22 November 2020,3/10,"If you took a group of random movie fans, all familiar with David Fincher's work, sat them in a theater, showed them this film sans-credits, and then asked them at the end ""who directed it?"" not one of them would say ""David Fincher."" This film is missing every single aspect that people loved about all his previous work.There is no mystery here. There is little drama. It's a film about the writing of a film, and it comes across about as boring as that sounds. To be fair, ""Mank"" never really sells itself as anything different, but seeing the Fincher name and the (ridiculously inflated) IMDB score was enough to make me think there must be something more here. Or maybe I just didn't understand it, because I certainly felt like much of the film was flying over my head, with all of the time jumps, characters appearing with little explanation like we were supposed to know who they were, and the constant 'name drops' in the dialogue of prominent people from the 1930s hollywood and political scene. For me this last one was the fatal flaw. The film takes for granted that the viewer will know all these names and backstories of people that are now obscure and long forgotten. So the entire film from start to finish has these references to contemporary people and politics flying over our heads, leaving us bewildered in their wake. If one hasn't actually seen Citizen Kane a couple times and doesn't have some rudimentary knowledge of Orson Welles, then this experience would only quadruple, as the film constantly references Citizen Kane without mentioning it by name. This film essentially has a pre-requisite: you must watch Citizen Kane first, or it will make absolutely no sense to you.But the most glaring thing missing from ""Mank"" is the distinctive dark and brooding style that Fincher has cultivated over the course of his career and that is entirely absent here. Going in, I was excited to see how Fincher would translate his style over to black and white. The answer is that he doesn't. It's just a standard black and white film. And while it looks good, I was left underwhelmed by the cinematography all the same. Something about it made me feel like it was 'made for Netflix.' In fact, the first jarring realization I had in the theater is that I was watching something in standard 16:9 wide televesion aspect ratio. Not cinemascope or widescreen. Digital, not film. It felt like watching a crummy made for Netflix movie in a theater. And I quickly realized that's exactly what I was doing."
MANK,26 April 2021,3/10,"'Mank' sets up as all the things Hollywood loves: a period piece, a hot director, a lead actor who can really act, 30's B&W cinematography, lots and lots of British actors (?!), and of course Hollywood itself. And as might be expected, falls flat.The movie is about the writing of another movie: Citizen Kaine. If you don't know (or care) about that film, you're probably going to be lost or worse. Mank is the alcoholic writer and witticist whom boy wonder Orson Welles plucked to write his masterpiece. However, only really hard core film buffs will get into it. Mank is holed up in the desert with broken leg forced to write while the rest of the story is presented in series of often confusing flashbacks. 'Kaine' was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst the publishing magnate, who was good friends with Mank until apparently some political issues around the 1934 CA gubernatorial election and perhaps how Hearst treated his mistress. Her portrayal by Seyfried is one of the few high points in the film.Meanwhile Oldman - who at 62 is an old man, too old to play Mankewicz who was 20 years younger - acts his heart out , dropping all sorts of clever lines and getting a Oscar-targeted tirade speech to Hearst and his dinner party. The problem is we really don't care about Mank or why he's doing what he's doing - or much else in the film. It's overlong and indulgent, requiring far too much knowledge of 1930s Hollywood and its characters.One point: the title parable - where the monkey thinks it's all about him when in fact he's just the entertainment - is as applicable to Hollywood itself today as it is to Mank. In that sense, Mank nails it."
MANK,9 June 2021,4/10,I honestly can't say for sure... I gave up after 28. Boring! Maybe it gets better if you persevere.
MANK,21 December 2020,5/10,"Those that watched Mank have no doubt seen Citizen Kane. Like many, I had high expectations, but I felt let down within moments of the Mank starting. The simple reason being was that I was hoping it had been shot on film, or at least have that slightly warm soft edge that movies in the forties have. Instead, I couldn't help but notice the digital black and white was a bit too harsh and clean. My next issue was also about the reference to Citizen Kane. If you are going to have it as your backdrop it would have been nice to put in camera tricks such deep focus shots. And if you haven't seen the original, this film may have left you wondering what the story was about. Perhaps I would have started off as Mank was dying; then someone mentioning he wrote Citizen Kane; another person saying he did not, and then the story is abut two men writing a script, and why Mank does not get the credit he deserves. That should have been how to sum up the life of a man in two hours."
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"In case you don't know, Mank is based on a screenwriter named Herman J. Mankiewicz when he was writing the screenplay of the movie ""Citizen Kane"" which was released in 1941 and won the Oscar for best original screenplay which is the only award that the movie received.Firstly, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't know or have much information or background about ""Citizen Kane"" you won't get it and you will miss much stuff especially that ""Mank"" had many references to ""Citizen Kane"" because it is literally talking about how ""Citizen Kane"" was made. Which brings me to the first thing that I didn't like about ""Mank"". Now I personally didn't watch ""Citizen Kane"" and therefore I couldn't be able to understand some details, ""Mank"" did not explain these little details, felt like the movie expects the audience to know this information and background about ""Citizen Kane"" that's why it wasn't explaining any of them which is a mistake that many films that are based on true events do.The directing and cinematography were fascinating. There were some shots and frames that were showing the whole set design around in a pretty and visually stunning way. Loved how the movie is in black & white and kind of shot like one of these old black & white films. This part might be why I liked the film a lot because I haven't seen anything like that in a long time. Set design and custom design were also great.The screenplay was a bit of a problem because, after the first half, the film was repeating itself, same way of storytelling but different events, there weren't many events that would excite you or grab your attention and make you want to continue watching the film. The movie jumps backward and forwards through time to chronicle the key aspects of Herman J. Mankiewicz so we can better understand him which was a good thing and a bad thing. A good thing because it was well made, what I mean is that it wasn't causing any confusion. A bad thing because It was going backward and forwards through time, so many times like over the limit and at a very fast pace, the film could go backward and forwards through time in just 5 minutes or less. The pace of the film was like chaos, it was trying to tell and be many things at the same time which caused all of that chaos.The casting was great, especially Gary Oldman who played Herman J. Mankiewicz, wouldn't be surprised if he gets a Golden Globe or an Oscar nomination. Lilly Collins' performance really grabbed my attention, she is a real talent and I wish to see her in big films in the future like ""Mank"". Although Amanda Seyfried's performance was great, I still feel like she wasn't putting much effort in that role or she was trying so hard to be great but couldn't be able to be so, didn't feel anything towards her character.There is something that I noticed about the sound mixing and sound editing and that's whenever a character is speaking, it is like an echo that's coming out. It is like they are sitting in an empty room and speaking in it which was great, also loved how in some scenes you can hear different voices in the background while the characters are speaking which was not a problem at all, it actually gave the film its own style and taste.In addition, the music score was brilliant, it is giving the film that old and classic taste of these old black & white films.To sum up, I really expected more from the film, especially that 2020 is not a good year for cinema and I said perhaps this film will save everything and because it's also directed by David Fincher. Not saying that I didn't enjoy the film, I was just expecting more. A great film that has a great story and great directing & cinematography that could be nominated for directing, cinematography, production design, and Gary Oldman's performance in the Oscars and Golden Globes. But, the film is not for everyone because many will get bored and won't continue watching it.My rating is 7/10."
MANK,3 July 2021,4/10,Oldman was tremendous .... Movie was not. Horribly long and painful.
MANK,5 December 2020,4/10,"Th movie is a mess. Every single review I have read says it is a masterpiece or the best Fincher movie ever. There's no element that point to the director signature. It is a bland, predictable, boring and poorly acted film. The B&W only exacerbates how bland this film is. The constant flashback gimmick is tiresome. The extreme manerism and vintage vocalizations from actors is distracting and take performances from fully develope. It is not historically accurate, but Oliver Stone's JFK proved a film can create it's own aspect of reality by giving a tour de force, Mank is just it's own aspect of reality in a wheelchair, overweight and on sleeping pills. Where is the Social Network fast violent pace? Where is Gone Girl political incorrection? Where is Seven drama and surprise? Nowhere. This felt like a documentary with situation re-enactments."
MANK,19 March 2021,6/10,"Engaging at times, but too fragmented. You get the fact that it's about the titular character, but the pieces don't become a meaningful coherent story. Poor development of characters and a coherent theme."
MANK,17 April 2021,8/10,"Mank will probably stay as a one-time example of a periodical piece among David Fincher's filmography. Usually, his films are thrillers with skillfully created scripts and dark cinematography. But Mank seems to be progressing in a different section.The choice of black-white is a very good one and set decoration is impressive. Not the same can be said for some of the dialogue, which was too explanative and quite chattering at places. Music -for me- was also strange in some scenes.Regarding storytelling, although a bit far-stretched, Fincher is quite careful and especially the paralel scenes at the end which contain Mank against Welles and Hearst respectively were quite impressive.It must also be noted that Fincher does well to underline the period's social and political scene with several nods to unemployment and elections etc.Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is the best actor ever, again becomes somebody else and deserves a special credit as always.Overall, a very enjoyable film if you're into Hollywood history. Not the director's best work but will be remembered as a nice hommage to film history."
MANK,3 January 2021,8/10,"David Fincher takes us deep into movie folklore with Mank, and whether it's your sort of film may depend on how much you know about old Hollywood, Welles, Citizen Kane, Thalberg, Hurst etc, so if you are a movie buff then it might hit the mark. It is beautifully made and acted, with Charles Dance a standout, but I found it absorbing without being particularly gripping. If you aren't knowledgeable about the events and characters concerned, it might end up being confusing, so I suggest you read up before viewing. All considered, Mank is not Finchers best, but it is still impressive."
MANK,19 March 2021,6/10,"I am a fan oh Gary Oldman and he does embody the overweight, over competent smooth talker. The movie is too long with flashbacks that while develops characters, it looses the consistency. I fell asleep in middle and had to rewatch. Acting is great and sets are awesome-but ..,"
MANK,6 December 2020,7/10,"After six years of waiting there is finally a new movie from David Fincher. Since Gone Girl 2014, Fincher mainly worked in series production. I've seen Mindhunter in recent times, in which few episodes were directed by him. There were really good episodes there. Fincher at his best.Nevertheless, series cannot be compared with movies. I´m a big fan of his movies and I was very happy that a new movie of him will be released.Mank.All in all I have to say, very well set in scene and the black and white is well done and looks very good. Unfortunately, in my eyes there were no real tension. The story is based on true events and was definitely interesting and had potential.Nevertheless, there was no real climax and the way there did not pull the viewer along either. The story moved near the border to insignificance. In Finchers previous movies he has realized this much better. I would most likely compare The Social Network here, since it is also based on a true event.The story always jumped between the now and past narrative strands. I found this very confusing. Although these actions had their purpose, they appeared to be randomly and arbitrarily placed.Gary Oldman played great, otherwise nobody else stood out in my eyes.You can definitely watch the movie, but I had hoped for more. But the bar is also set high."
MANK,7 December 2020,8/10,"Se esse vai ser o indicado ao Oscar realmente a Academia virou um clubinho elitista... quem não viu Cidadão Kane não vai entender absolutamente nada e achei uma tremenda ingratidão com um cara brilhante como Orson Welles. Bela direção de arte. If this is going to be the Oscar nominee, the Academy has really become an elitist club ... those who have not seen Citizen Kane will not understand anything and I found tremendous ingratitude with a brilliant guy like Orson Welles. Beautiful art direction.#netflix #movieslover"
MANK,6 December 2020,,"Orson Welles had such a distinctive voice and although he could do accents his natural speaking voice was American. As soon as Tom Burke spoke - in a very English accent - I knew I couldn't watch anymore. It's not a tenor role, which is Burke's pitch, and if an actor can't do an approximation of Welles voice then it won't work. And it doesn't."
MANK,6 December 2020,1/10,"At first with the list of actors it looked promising however the horrible echo chamber audio masked this totally unwatchable. We thought we were going mad as it wasn't followable!We tried sound bar, tv audio, flipping onto our surround sound, all with the same result = dumped it at <10mins."
MANK,7 March 2021,10/10,"David Fincher's Mank is one of the best character studies to come out of Hollywood these last few years. It is a true character study. Fincher's incredible script, authored by his father, coupled with the magical powers of Gary Oldman to totally submerge himself into the mind of Herman Mankewicz, create both an informative page of Hollywood history and an examination of what made the mind of Mank tick. Citizen Kane was all about the newspaper mogul William Randolf Hearst and the entourage around him. Mankewicz was part of that entourage, in fact, enjoyed a good relationship with Hearst's mistress, the actress Marion Davies. Yet, deep in his psyche he harbored a visceral disgust for that crowd and their values. Outwardly, that resentment showed itself with the occasional soft jab, but mainly was reflected in his wit, sardonic humor, and engaging repartee, much to the amusement of the guests. It also fueled his losing battle with alcoholism, which led to his premature death. It also provided the catalyst for his outrageously self-destructive behavior, presenting Mankewicz as the poster boy of why you should never bite the hand that feeds you.All this is brilliantly presented by Gary Oldman in the title role. One can quibble about Fincher's use of flashbacks (there are far too many), and, yes, maybe question why the movie is in black and white. Oldman's performance of Herman Mankewicz is unraveled. One could say that Oldman had the raw material for his presentation of Mank from his own battles with the bottle, about which he opened up after the show premiered. But his performance is different. Understanding the demons that tormented Mank in real life Oldman goes beyond to become Herman Mankewicz. In my opinion he plays Mankewicz better than he played Winston Churchill.That aside, the supporting roles were handled just as well, and the black and white cinematography creates the right setting for a very watchable film that is not to be missed."
MANK,29 April 2021,7/10,"The movie definitely deserves a watch, more so if you enjoyed Citizen Kane as it delivers numerous homages and easter eggs.IF you are someone who just wants to watch Mank for what it is, there are numerous elements captured well in the narrative - the great depression, worker unions, candid reflections on production studios, and most importantly character sketches which represent the period.Some areas I felt which could have been written better is Mank's character itself - he is either glorified or always paid attention to - which made it difficult for me to accept the characterisation in its full sense of a writer behind Citizen Kane.Garry Oldman fits in the role effortlessly but his characterisation left more to be desired.I also wished the movie was shot in letterbox 4:3 as Citizen Kane instead of widescreen...somehow dint fit in well atleast for me!"
MANK,23 June 2021,1/10,"Gary Oldman's performance of Herman Mankowitz was amazing.However, the scripts portrayal of ""Mank"" was 100% wrong. While the movie does show he was an alcoholic, gambler and womanizer - they showed him being a functional alcoholic, womanizing gambler. It was the Hollywood system propping his ego and his flaws up because he could write. That was his only aspect of his life he could ""function"" on.Meanwhile, the rest of the script has every single character that is not Herman Mankowitz is written and directed as cardboard cutouts. They had dialogue that served as mostly dramatic foils and/or cheap exposition.. of which served mostly to make ""Mank"" look like a fully functional and decent human being to be around. There was zero depth, soul or even a spark of a real character in anyone else in the movie.The ONLY thing the film had going for it is Fincher and the script banking on most people knowing who William Randolph Hearst (""Pops"") Irving Thalberg (beloved MGM producer) Marrion Davies (Hearsts mistress) and Louis B Mayer (the 3rd M of MGM) Hearsts portrayal was stiff ..but somewhat accurate as to who he really was. Marion Davies however, was a staunch conservative.. in the movie she was almost siding with this socialism movement that tried be subtlety in the background.. Thalberg's portrayal was the worst however, he served as a mostly the main foil for ""Mank"" when Mankowitz himself was ruining his own life."
MANK,14 December 2020,6/10,"I'm not sure whose fault it is 'mank' is ultimately disappointing-is it because it was marketed As the writing of 'citizen Kane' and not a biopic of mank's life? I think so because that's what I was expecting when I saw it. I finished it so that's saying something but I did turn it off halfway through to eat and walk my dog. It is not a compelling movie, nor a particularly interesting one. Waste of a great cast, the only reason my rating is as high as it is. Sadly those great actors were not given much to work with. The movie didn't know what it wanted to be. If Gary oldman was doing a biopic of Mank, he did a great job. If the movie was about the writing of 'citizen Kane', it seriously faltered. Not a lot to
Say about this movie because it wasn't memorable. Not something I'd expect from Fincher and proof it really is in the writing. Not even a great director can save a crap script."
MANK,10 February 2021,6/10,"The real tragedy of Mank is that David Fincher after a career full of cult classics is finally getting Awards recognition for his work... But it's his least Fincher-like to date. Gorgeous cinematography aside and occasional interesting scenes and acting, the story seems to be one of the least interesting he could've possibly chosen to tell. There is just not enough juice. I fell asleep two times to the original Citizen Kane, this movie I had to play over several days just in order to get through. Much of the duration of the movie, there's nothing to save it from meandering conversations with a ton of old-school name-drops and personal affairs lacking in conflict, lacking in engaging in conflict and lacking in clever dialogue (any Fincher fan knows he likes every aspect of his films to do multiple things at once but, here it barely does one), creating a mostly dull movie I'm being generous with giving 3 stars out of 5 or 6/10.I don't blame Fincher for doing what he has to do to finally get himself some gold. There is a certain irony in this, Mank's topic considered. He has a legacy, it's been overdue. It is disgusting that this is how it has to play out to actually benefit Fincher critically, going for Hollywood's own vanity but as it happens, that's the game. That's what you can take away from this film."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Not my cup of tea but i enjoyed it, Fincher knows how to make a story look really interesting."
MANK,13 December 2020,9/10,"It includes everything you're looking forward to a David Fincher film. Beautiful shots, brilliant musical score, and an amazing performance from Gary Oldman, but somehow I felt something new, something that we don't really see a lot from Fincher's movies, it's the gentleness that made this movie going for me which I'm really glad I got to watch. Credits to David Fincher's father (Jack Fincher) writing the screenplay, which I guess explains a lot on why there's so much heart to this as it is a passion project for David Fincher.I strongly suggest though that before watching Mank, check out Citizen Kane first and some behind-the-scenes stuff about it."
MANK,10 January 2021,9/10,"David Fincher's meticulously crafted motion picture is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It is a fascinating tale based on the true story of a washed up alcoholic screenwriter and Hollywood insider named Herman J. Mankiewicz, sensationally played by Gary Oldman in an tour-de-force Oscar worthy performance, who is hired by the 24 year old genius wunderkind Orson Wells to write the screenplay to his legendary film 'Citizen Kane.' The film shows how ""Mank"" struggles with his serious alcoholism while trying to complete his screenplay with both the studio and Welles pressuring him, and it also focuses on his personal life and political activity. Fincher's masterfully detailed direction is impressive, and the glorious black & white cinematography by Erik Messerschmidt is absolutely stunning. Fabulous supporting performances by Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies, Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst, Lily Collins as Rita Alexander, Tom Pelphrey as Joe Mankiewicz, Tom Burke as Orson Welles, Ferdinand Kingley as Irving Thalberg, Jeff Harms as Ben Hecht, Derek Petropolis as Eddie Cantor, with special kudos to Arliss Howard for his brilliant scene-stealing performances as the conniving studio mogul Louis B. Mayer. One of this year's finest and most rewarding quality adult cinematic entertainments. Note: Now streaming on Netflix."
MANK,25 March 2021,3/10,"This is a great example of how a literate but boring script can ruin a promising film concept. You have a great cast. You have a fascinating time period in a ""happening"" place. You have a beautifully filmed work - the cinematography alone kept me watching the film the second time through. (I fell asleep the first time). Then you have a musical score than knows what it ""needs to do"" (keep the audience awake) - teeth gnawing. You have a screenplay that does what it needs to do (tell a story), but goes noplace -the problem is, this event happened almost 80 years ago and isn't earth shattering to anyone - WHO CARES???? Finally you have film editing and direction that cater to a screenplay that no one, but the author cares about. I will give kudos to the one thing I liked which I haven't seen in years in a motion picture: The old fashioned projection changeover marks on the film every 18-20 minutes that was used to make the end of a reel of film. Problem is, I don't think they occurred that way in this film but were used to highlight an important(?) event."
MANK,22 April 2021,1/10,"The narrative doesn't imply a clear direction you're supposed to follow. I felt little sympathy with any of the characters. If director David Fincher wanted to mimic the classic b&w screenplays then he definitely managed to create a movie that just wanders about. Like some older pictures of that era you could let the movie run in the background and just zone out. This happened to me with ""Mank"". No offense to Gary Oldman, whose performance is strong and interesting, but storywise there was no attempt in connecting with the audience.I can only wonder why the film was nominated for some many Oscar categories. A film like ""The Producers"" or ""The Artist"" deserved their critical acclaim. But here with ""Mank"" even the score is a failed attempt to put the audience back in time. Some cues were simply inappropriate while other cues had the usual Jazz arrangement, but lacked of good songwriting. It's like the makers didn't care to try a little harder."
MANK,20 December 2020,4/10,"Boring + didn't see David Fincher or any trade mark of his, though costumes, lightening, & script (it's good, but not Fincher's good, as Se7en, The Game & Gone Girl), it was shot marvellously in ""RED Monstrochrom 8K"" in native B&W, and there's no coloured version of the movie, and the sound is mixed in mono, as that period's movies, before the invention of stereo in mid of 20th century, And last but not least ""Gary Oldman"", he is a wonder, recalling his previous work, he manage to make audiences forget who he is, and just see the character he's doing (just remember ""the fifth element""), such a selfless act"
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"David Fincher is an excellent director. Gary Oldman also gives a great performance, the black and white cinematography is beautiful, but everything else falls pretty flat. First of all, the opening includes a title card informing the audience that Orson Welles was looking for a collaborator on his next project, implying that this movie will be about Citizen Kane, a relationship between Welles and Mank, and how it was created. This movie is not that. Instead, it decides to focus on his life and everything BESIDES Citizen Kane. It could have been more of a biography without all the Orson Welles stuff.Part of the complexity of the film and the script is how confusing this movie can be. Since it does capture Mank's life there is a lot to be covered, but sometimes there's so much going on you don't know what is happening. There is a blend of politics and Mank's divided opinions, but those mix with his writing and relationship with his wife, it becomes too much. There are some unnecessary characters that do not develop the story very much.Honestly, this movie was a disappointment. Some people will enjoy it, others will be like me, but some might hate it. It's hard to compare this to Fincher's other movies, Social Network Fight Club, Se7en, but it does show the variety of Fincher's talent. I'll be looking out for other Oscar contenders as well as how this movie does."
MANK,27 March 2021,6/10,"I have a feeling that I might have enjoyed Mank more if I had an opportunity to watch it again. I wouldn't be so lost amidst the scatter of characters, some of whom I couldn't even tell apart. And perhaps their beautifully written dialogue wouldn't seem so scattered. The movie uses a clever plot device as it gradually becomes apparent that flashbacks might be a part of the very script Mank (Gary Oldman) is writing. It's pretty ingenious how it's not just black and white, but has the lighting and staging reminiscent of the movies of that era.I suppose I would have also benefited from having seen Citizen Kane, which I unfortunately haven't. Were any of those strikingly similar to modern politics scenes in it? I went between marveling at the resemblance and feeling like it was exploitative. It wouldn't have mattered if the movie did a better job at fleshing out the very person it was supposed to be about. I felt like I never got to know this clearly remarkable human being. In fact, the only character that really came through as alive and three dimensional was Marion Davies, played brilliantly by Amanda Seyfried. I am pretty sure I would like this film better if I could watch it again. But being a busy working mom, I resent that it seems to require it."
MANK,31 May 2021,6/10,"Mank is the newest film directed by David Fincher. I've only seen two films from Fincher's catalog, one of them being The Social Network which is one of my favorites of all time. This film is about Herman Mankiewicz writing Citizen Kane, and the political climate of 1930s Hollywood. This film is very well made on a technical level. The film easily could've just done black and white and called it a good enough reference to Citizen Kane, but of course David Fincher makes sure that this really *feels* like you're watching a film from that time period. The visuals, the image quality, and the sound and score especially really make something interesting. My problem with the film is basically it focuses a lot more on politics than I thought. Basically half of the movie's runtime is dedicated to this election with Upton Sinclair and how Hollywood influenced this. The film doesn't go out of its way to explain who most of these people are so you don't really know what's going on a lot of the time. There were points of the story that I was invested in, but for the most part there wasn't really a lot of emotion behind this. The dialogue *sounds* great, the acting is very well done... but I really didn't know/have a reason to care what the characters were talking about. The protagonist spends half the film drunk and the other half laying in a bed flirting with women despite the fact he seems to be happily married. I was honestly expecting to care a lot more about what's happening considering this is (sort of) about the making of Citizen Kane, a film I really loved. David Fincher's directing really is the strongest aspect of this film, but the screenplay written by his late father just wasn't that great. I get why he would've wanted to make something his dad wrote but it just wasn't that great of a screenplay. It's a very niche film, if you have extensive knowledge of 1930s Hollywood and it's politics along with Citizen Kane you'll probably really enjoy this one, but most people don't have that knowledge (including myself). I'm going to give Mank a 6.5/10."
MANK,3 December 2020,7/10,"Like Oliver Stone's ""JFK a masterfully executed distortion of history
Fine acting and cinematography, but no comparison to those of ""Citizen Kane.""Fincher's villainization in MANK of Welles as a plagiarist runs contrary to the facts. To quote Robert Carringer, the expert on the matter:
""A virtually complete set of script records for Citizen Kane has been pre- served in the archives of RKO General Pictures in Hollywood, and these provide almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting. Once this record is reconstructed and all the available pieces of evidence are matched to it, a reasonably clear picture emerges of who was responsible for what in the final script. The full evidence reveals that Welles' contribution to the Citizen Kane script was not only substantial but definitive (370)... ""Herman Mankiewicz's principal contribution to the Citizen Kane script was made in the early stages at Victorville. The Victorville scripts elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours (398).... The Mankiewicz partisans would have us believe that this is the heart of the matter and that by the end of Victorville the essential part of the scripting was complete. Quite the contrary... Major revisions begin as soon as the script passes into Welles' hands, and several important lines of development can be discerned in sub- sequent phases of the scripting. One of these is the elimination of dramatically questionable material, especially of a large amount of material drawn from Hearst. Another is a fundamental alteration of the nature of many of the scenes; this may be described generally as a shift from scenes played continuously to scenes fragmented according to montage conceptions"" (399). (Here, the evolution of Mankiewicz's rather humdrum scenes involving Kane and Emily into the film's concise, witty, montage is a perfect example.), Yet another is the evolution of Charles Foster Kane as a character. The principal strategy is the replaying of certain key situa tions and moments in his life over and over again as a means of testing and discovering the character (399)...."":Not even the staunchest defenders of Mankiewicz would deny that Welles was principally responsible for the realization of the film. But in light of the evidence, it may be they will also have to grant him principal responsibility for the realization of the script"" (400)."" (See Robert L. Carringer. ""The Scripts of 'Citizen Kane.'"" Critical Inquiry, Vol. 5, No. 2, 1978pp. 369-400; Also cf. The Making of Citizen Kane, 985).
More interpretively. Welles was preponderantly an adapter of others work, whether from Shakespeare, lesser classics or thrillers, whether for radio theater, stage theater or film. ""Citizen Kane"" can be viewed as Welles' adaptation of Mankiewicz's ungainly, 250-page ""American,"" his first ""script"" for ""Kane."""
MANK,6 December 2020,1/10,Seems from the reviews that you either love Mank or don't! Masterpiece v's Boring. I couldn't even last more than an hour! So dreary though mildly interesting and at times a witty script. But not enough to keep me watching.
MANK,15 March 2021,9/10,"The best part of this film in my opinion is the dialog, i have seen this film countess times and i cant get over the intriguing dialog. The black and white took some time for me to adjust, but after i got the hang of it, it actually enhanced my experience. Gary Oldman is brilliant, he continues to blow my mind.."
MANK,30 January 2021,10/10,"Mank is old school Hollywood movie about the screenwriter Herman j mankweicz who co-wrote the script to the very famous 1941 classic Citizen Kane. I loved this film. And hope it gets Oscars galore. In these challenging times the movie Mank is about Hollywood the artistic side of movies and political side of what was going on in America in the 1930's and 1940's. Digs into William Randolph Hurst, Mrs. Davies. Mank is a move you could over and over again and never get bored of it. It's work of cinematic art. Gary Oldman is great. Tom Burke is awesome as Orsen Welles. Charles Dance is mind boggling as William Randolph Hearst. IMHO Mank is going to go all the way to the Oscar stage"
MANK,7 December 2020,8/10,"I understand why this film is very polarizing. Definitely no one I know will appreciate what this film is. But at the end of the day, I found it very entertaining with exceptional utilization of dramatic irony. A film that highlights the flaws of Hollywood and the world in its entirety which is ironically the main cause to the creation of the most well - known film ever made. Simply Brilliant."
MANK,20 March 2021,3/10,"The script has many moments it does not add up. Lacking a lot of the connections between the sceenes. And the acting is ok-ish. Amanda Seyfried and Charles Dance are a disappoinment, while Gary Oldman, Tuppence Middleton and, sometimes, Lily Collins are doing a great job. Filming is nice (the black and white cinematography looks good), but the script is not."
MANK,5 May 2021,6/10,"There is no doubt the cinematography and production design Oscars deservedly went to David Fincher and team for this film. Beautifully shot and stunning settings give 1940s Hollywood a visual reality.Orson Wells is a 24 year old gogetter at RKO studios given the opportunity to direct his first film. He decides to get semi recovering alcoholic screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz to write the masterpiece, to what we now know as Citizens Kane.Unfortunately the story meanders it's way through with a slow way that the late Jack Fincher may not have intended. The acting is fine, Gary Oldman is sensational as ""Mank"" and the standout performance. The film isn't groundbreaking but did deserve the Oscars nod."
MANK,7 December 2020,6/10,"Fincher doesn't disappoint on the formal level of his latest movie, the reevaluation of the 30's and the Hollywood studio system is visually stunning and convincing. Acting is solid throughout. It's clear he shows the business as a morally corrupt system of mutual dependencies and exploitations. Manipulation on social and political levels leading into destructive and self-destructive consequences in almost every shown relation. I think the reason why it left me a bit indifferent, even bored in the end is, that the script often meanders in many aimless directions, when a bit more of focus and concentration could have tightened it up.
Not the masterpiece I was expecting, but maybe I was just expecting too much."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"This movie is exquisitely crafted on every level and it merits a 10/10 on those grounds alone. But it has a problem that is less of a movie problem and more of a ""people"" problem. The problem is, some people are just not all that interesting. Consider this: the only reason ""Mank"" exists is because Orsen Welles made ""Citizen Kane"", and the only reason we are even talking about Herman Mankiewicz is because he co-wrote the film. PERIOD. Prior to ""Kane"" this guy was an undistinguished, on-salary script writer-doctor for a slew of now long-forgotten MGM cornball melodramas in the early days of the talkies. After ""Kane"", ditto - the ""talk"" may have been more sophisticated, but most movies were just as cornball and melodramatic. Someone took a rambling, 250 page first draft called ""American"" and turned it into ""Citizen Kane"". (Gee, I wonder who?) ""Mank"" gives us about 10 minutes of ""Kane"" stuff and two hours of boring, endless chit-chat at San Simeon etc. etc. that has no real subtext and no narrative that ever draws us in. The whole thing just ""flows"" because it's about the drunken, vomiting guy who co-wrote ""Citizen Kane"" so we're supposed to love it - and him. Sorry folks, he's not loveable or even likeable, and his drunken, slurring shtick wears real thin real fast. Simply put, he's an annoying SOB throughout. Now the good news! For those who have seen ""Citizen Kane"" 101 times (like me) and know everything about the cast of characters (like me) and have toured the ""ranch"" at San Simeon several times (yep, like me), you will love it. But for the rest of humanity, you'll start to wonder about 15 minutes in why the movie was ever made and you'll still be wondering when the credits roll. For get-a-life movie geeks only, but what a treat! (I didn't think the filmmakers would have the nerve to do a ""white wine came up with the fish"" scene, but boy was I wrong!) Thanks, Netflix!!"
MANK,7 December 2020,9/10,"I just watched the first Netflix feature that will probably be rewarded with best picture and best leading actor at the next Academy Awards.If Amanda Seyfrieds role was just a little bit bigger, she would be a no-brainer for supporting actress, that will maybe be a close one.Some words of caution; to be fully appreciated, this film demands some knowledge of movie history. In particular some basic understanding of what Citizen Kane meant for modern day cinema. For people not familiar with the era, Orson Welles and US politics, the historical references can be a bit overwhelming."
MANK,24 December 2020,7/10,"Mank finds itself in a middle ground. The story is very complex, filled with so much information and some of it feels very irrelevant to the main plot. The common viewer may quit before the second half, being that it can also feel very slow during the beginning.
In some ways, I like to think that the film tries to be this way in terms of the story on purpose. Citizen Kane (the film Mank was based off of) was also a confusing film, and makes me think that the film was created in such a way to mimic this style of movie-making.
Other than this, the film still somehow continues to keep my attention, even if it feels slow at times. Gary Oldman and his fellow cast do an amazing job with playing their roles in subtle matters and really get invested into their characters. If it wasn't for their performance, I feel this movie could have declined in some ways.
Overall, the film is solid and eventually reveals its purpose but will take a little bit of focusing and brain-power to do so. Especially if you are not familiar with the story or Citizen Kane, this may not be entertaining or come off as very bland of a filming."
MANK,14 March 2021,6/10,"The cinemaphotography is beautiful; done in a very 1940's black and white style. The acting is great. But the storyline is VERY convoluted and difficult to follow. I was familiar with most of people portrayed in the film (Welles, Hearst, Mankaweiz, Thalberg...), but if you're not someone who follows film history and/or gossip, then you will likely be very, very lost.I really wanted to like this. I love David Finhcher's movies. But I found this to be on the boring side. I was waiting for it to be over, I hate to say."
MANK,5 February 2021,7/10,"Although this is another ambitious work by David Fincher, you will probably be at a loss, or even be bored, if you have no prior knowledge of the movie ""Citizen Kane"". If you had appreciated ""Citizen Kane"", you might like ""Mank"" because it not only reveals how the greatest film of all time (as so many think) was made, but it also mimics some of the cinematographic style of Citizen Kane which was considered groundbreaking at the time of its premier. You may enjoy it more if you knew about the historical figures that appear in the movie (I am not only talking about Orson Welles, William Randolph Hearst or Louis B. Mayer who play vital roles in this story, but also about supporting characters like Joseph L. Mankiewicz and John Houseman whom I didn't realize were portrayed in the movie upon my first viewing). Not for everyone, but it can be a fascinating movie experience for others."
MANK,31 December 2020,8/10,"I finally got around to seeing Fincher's latest. It's intoxicating, inventive and deliciously complex; one might argue that its complexity is a pit fall, but I've always said that if something tastes good, I'll chew on it.That's why, I think, that I liked this film more than most people seem to. It's filled with more 30s references and studio in-jokes, incredibly, than it is with alcoholic beverages. I don't pretend to understand all its machinations, but what did stick to me tasted like honey and prevented me from becoming frustrated with what went whizzing by.I watched the film twice back-to-back and liked it better the second time. At first, the script seemed a little unfocused or perhaps too focused on too many things. However, its parts fit quite nicely together the second time around. For instance, the political subplot and the corruption of the American people worked well as a macrocosm for the corruption of the soul, which Mank demonstrates aptly through drinking away his shame and regret.So many scenes hit right to the core of the film's logos. This is a credit to the writing and dialogue. Again, this is where I find the film's complexity to be an attribute, rather than a detriment. Sure, it's self-obsessed and almost intentionally cryptic, but it's all about mannerism and depicting the 1930s Hollywood attitude in a heightened sense, by involving impossibly witty characters in a smoky, dreamlike era.Oldman's performance is incredible, no doubt, and this is most evident in his ability to show the subtle nuances between different stages of intoxication. He has always showcased an incredible ability to control the wildness of his characters. Amanda Seyfried also stands out in a supporting cast full of stellar performances. There's a particular look of embarrassed admiration that she flashes Mank when he stands up for her at Mayer's birthday party (pay attention to her right eyebrow).Mostly, the film is about the creation of identity; how these characters invent and lean on personas, filled with false ideals and aiding vices, until these constructed versions of themselves turn ugly and override them. The film argues that it is a conviction to authenticity and to a personal philosophy that allows for inner peace when all the smoke has cleared, and all the alcohol has been flushed away."
MANK,29 December 2020,6/10,"If not for Gary Oldman, this would have been a slog to get through. I'm not saying this was bad, but it's definitely inaccessible for the average moviegoer. It's a film made by a hardcore cinephile for hardcore cinephiles. In other words, you need to bleed old school cinema to love this movie.There's still a lot to like though! I'm in love with the time period of 1930s Hollywood. The black and white aesthetic actually enhances the movie to feel like an old ""talkie"" from the past. The performances from the star-studded cast were also fantastic. Gary Oldman carries the movie as the alcohol-fueled screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. Honestly, he might be the main (and only) reason I liked this movie.Everything is very well shot, the dialogue is quick and snappy, and it's just cool seeing the behind the scenes of the classic ""Citizen Kane"". Though, I have no idea if this was historically accurate. Also, I've never seen Citizen Kane (but that's our little secret).However, I just had a hard time caring about anything. It uses way too many flashbacks that not only add very little but give the entire film this stop-start feel. As a result, it felt slow, directionless, and sometimes boring. It looks, feels, and sounds like cinema of old, which will definitely turn some people off.Sometimes names and characters get thrown around, and honestly, I had no clue what they were talking about. It's as if the movie doesn't give the viewer the time to learn who people are and what their deal was. You would either need to watch this several times or have been alive in 1930s Hollywood to understand everything.As a fan of cinema/movies, I enjoyed this. But to be honest, I'm never going to watch this again and wouldn't recommend it to casual moviegoers.Score: 6 out of 10
Overall: DecentRecommended for: Fans of David Fincher, fans of old school cinema, or people born in the 1930s and want to see some old friends brought to life.Thanks for reading!"
MANK,10 December 2020,4/10,"#Mank - Mostly, Citizen Kane lands up as the best movie ever made in the ranking charts. So when I read about David Fincher making a movie about its making, starring Gary Oldman, I was delighted.After watching it, I'm still wondering what is the purpose of this movie. I don't dislike the film. It just lacks intrigue or drama to keep one engaged. In my opinion, it's nothing more than an Oscar bait. Wonderful cinematography, locations and performances. But a total waste of time - boring and uninteresting."
MANK,15 December 2020,3/10,"A film about a film,tried hard to like this film as there is some funny bits in it,but its just to long and slow"
MANK,5 January 2021,8/10,"The movie was a way too long to tell a single story, we know as cinemaniacs that sometimes we should tell short things to get straight to the point. Whoever, the movie was not so bad but not such a perfection as David original works."
MANK,6 December 2020,9/10,"At first I was confused and didn't know whether I would keep up. The action goes quite fast and requires you to breath only the movie, and when I realized, I was caught. Everything made sense and I felt complete when it ended. It's certainly not a movie to watch after a long day, if you want something easy, because it will require you to put together the pieces, but it's definitely worthy, if you are willing to."
MANK,26 December 2020,4/10,"Very non-cinematic. The best was that there were many chuckles and wordplay, but overall it was a bore. There was no ""action."" The continual jumping to flashbacks (with the date written so small It could barely be read) was very irritating and made it hard to follow. The contrast with this turkey caused me to raise my opinion of ""Once Upon a TIme in Hollywood."" Read some biographies instead. PS - Marion Davies had a stutter, among many other inaccuricies in the film."
MANK,6 December 2020,6/10,"Yes, it's a great performance by Gary Oldman. But not as Herman J. Mankiewicz. I''m thinking drunk Oxford don from any of a dozen films. I see Peter O'Toole, possibly Alec Guiness pre-David Lean. What's he doing in Hollywood in 1934 (where much of the film is set, if in flashback.) Mank arrives on stage in Pauline Kael's account and in all contemporary reminiscences in three tones: American, New York and Jewish. Oldman is none of these and apparentlly doesn't even try in a film which otherwise goes to great lengths to recreate '30s Hollywood when the New York wisenheimers took it over and changed it forever. We are given pitch perfect visions of Kaufman, Perlman, Joe Mankiewicz and even (Oscar for Arlis Howard?) LB Mayer himself. Way too old, not bald, too veddy veddy Brit, Oldman just destroys the illusion so much money and talent has been spent to create! And not really about CIT K even though Burke is great as Welles, but about the ordeal of ideology (disappointment at Upton Sinclair's failure in 1934) that enabled Mank to write the script, which the movie pretends was the fundamental creative act, not Welles's magic acting, filming and editing. Sad: it makes Mank boring"
MANK,19 November 2020,,"David Fincher finally returns to film with a passion project of his fathers, who write this film. The film follows parts of the life of screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz mostly around the time he was writing Citizen Kane. The film is also shot in the style of how films were made back then and effectively so as it does look like a 1940's film.
I was looking forward to this one quite a bit but was pretty disappointed. Firstly the dialogue is mixed too low and without any sonic breadth, rendering maybe 30% or more o f the spoken word inaudible, The film is also constantly under lit, so whilst I was straining my ears to hear, I was also straining my eyes to see. A few tweaks could have fixed these problems but whilst those points were both annoying, it s the script that does not work as a whole.
The script has some good parts, particularly in the second half but feels very bits and pieces rather than a fleshed out story. The first half of the film is really quite a trudge and I think the subject matter deserved more.
It's not all bad though, the period detail is all as great as expected and the performances are top flight all around. I would not be surprised to see nominations for Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried or Charles Dance.
In the end we are left with smart looking (though too dark) film with a script that does not live up to the promise of the material. The second half was much more enjoyable and I would say that all film history lovers should at least check it out for themselves.4.5/10"
MANK,7 December 2020,5/10,"I'd been looking forward to watching ""Mank"" because I'm a movie buff and a huge fan of ""Citizen Cane"" in particular. The movie disappointed me. The characters all TALKED (and talked) about a great movie, but ""Mank"" has nothing to do with what ""Cane"" puts on the screen. The effect was like the play ""Waiting for Godot"" where the characters talk about Godot but he never arrives."
MANK,14 December 2020,5/10,"Two mistakes they make. First, making the decision to run a constant music track cheapens this production. Second, the dialogue is so flowery and strives for such perfection that it makes the whole story incredibly difficult to follow. A great idea that falls flat on its manky face. Pass."
MANK,27 December 2020,10/10,"David Fincher directs a phenomenal cast in a film worthy of it's subject matter. A must see for fans of Citizen Kane and the history of cinema. Gary Oldman is brilliant and is joined by a stellar cast to bring Jack Fincher's script to life. Shot in black and white using early cinematic techniques, Fincher boldly embraces the poetry of an all but forgotten era to create something unique and beautiful. Three cheers to Netflix for bringing us a masterpiece!"
MANK,6 December 2020,5/10,"The film is pure show and little substance. Entertaining but very dense. I liked the photography. The flash changes and what they refer to. It's not like traditional biopics either. At times it feels disjointed and one wonders where is all this going? I really liked the construction of some characters. And the performances of Marion daves, Amanda seyf. Lily colins. In short, the film works like a love letter to old Hollywood. but it is not a masterpiece. just another movie."
MANK,7 December 2020,10/10,Great performances. The stylish black and white film is very watchable. It's a bit intricate and takes a little focus to take in some of the themes. Relevant for today's political communications. I loved it.
MANK,2 July 2021,4/10,"My wife and I started watching this movie and we both nearly fell asleep and we weren't tired. Just boring, I was hoping someone would throw a pie already. Skipped through most of 2nd half because I have to go food shopping this week and wasn't sure there would be enough time. Gary Oldman is always wonderful and the rest of the cast was spot on... but the writer was missing his entertainment bone when he wrote this."
MANK,6 December 2020,6/10,"Well played, well shot but not much more than a bio of an unknown Hollywood writer. Usually Hollywood is it its best when rewriting its own history (e. g. Sunset Blvd and to a minor extent even Kane) Mank won't be a good example for this."
MANK,6 December 2020,4/10,"It's a strangely lifeless rendering of the period and the people. It was as if Mank was filmed in a museum and the parts played by automatons. Everything thing looked right, the costumes fit, the actors uttered their lines at the correct moments with the appropriate inflections and in the right tone but without eliciting any thrill of discovery or illumination of character to make this film very interesting.
Herman Mankiewicz was a legendary figure in filmmaking. I felt like I gained no insight into this man (or any of the other characters, really) and what made him tick. He deserved better than this puffed up, but empty, rendering."
MANK,13 December 2020,9/10,"""This is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory. What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it. That's the real magic of the movies. And don't let anybody tell you different.""Before I start I should say that- it isn't for everyone, definitely not for the casual moviegoers.
Mank is totally a classic tale of Old Hollywood (30s-40s); a contemplative and scrutinized look at the making of 'Citizen Kane'...focusing on Mankiewicz's struggle to finish his best work- the screenplay of Citizen Kane and later the controversy about the writing credit of the film. This movie is how exhaustively researched I can understand that..including Pauline Kael's theory around this matter. Actually this film demands little bit research from viewers also, those who know more about the old Hollywood or studied about the controversy, naturally gonna enjoy it more...really liked Herman and Joseph L. Mankiewicz scenes, wanted it more. Mank is not just about Mank, it shows the politics that devoured Hollywood that time, then the great depression and its affect on Hollywood. For me, it's an overwhelming experience. Definitely it's an tribute to Hollywood of 30s, but not the kind you're accustomed to seeing...a noxious kind of admiration. Daddy Fincher wrote the screenplay of this movie and it was a dream project for our Fincher, and he succeeded to fulfill it and gave the respect to the man who inspired him.
Let's talk about technical aspects. Cinematography is top-notch, a miraculous presentation of 30s. Specially any frame of this film clearly shows that how remarkable it is..one cannot differentiate whether you are watching a modern masterpiece (yes it is) or an classic film from golden age. Actually it got green signal in all the technical departments.
Performance- Gary Oldman is a genius, possesses all the adroitness needed in acting..even one can watch and enjoy the film only for his performance. Other supporting casts are also good, Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies is great, probably her best performance...really liked Arliss Howard's performance as Louis B Mayer. Tom Burke as Orson Welles is really unrecognisable, not just look, he brought the perfection in attitude also.
So, I'm happy that failed to find any mistake. Now some people complain about it being boring, but I enjoyed it really..Citizen Kane is not an out and out entertaining, same goes for this movie. It needs certain knowlege and patience about the era and the film. This is totally masterful filmmaking..now it's time for Fincher, so hope for the best.A great achievement in filmmaking. A work of formidable artistry. What can I say, one of the most perfect and well-made biopics I've ever seen.""You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.""Facts-
Despite Welles' denial that the film was about Hearst( bcz if it was that, it literally proves that Mank wrote the screenplay..Mankie and Hearst both were well known to each other and Hearst himself was an great admirer of Mank) , few people were convinced-including Hearst. After the release of Citizen Kane, Hearst pursued a longtime vendetta against Mankiewicz and Welles for writing the story. Certain elements in the film were taken from Mankiewicz's own experience: the term 'Rosebud' was based-according to some sources-on a very important bicycle that was stolen from him...even some of Kane's speeches are like copies of Hearst's. Most personally, the word 'rosebud was reportedly Hearst's private nickname for Davies' clitoris. (which fact is also mentioned in the film)Richard Meryman, the biographer of Herman J. mankiewicz described the evening like that-
//On the night of the awards, Herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair. Sara lay on the bed. As the screenplay category approached, he pretended to be hardly listening. Suddenly from the radio, half screamed, came ""Herman J. Mankiewicz."" Welles's name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out, ""Mank! Mank! Where is he?"" And audible above all others was Irene Selznick (daughter of Louis B. Mayer)- ""Where is he?""// (Collected)"
MANK,30 March 2021,7/10,"First just want to comment that it's nice to watch a new film in black & white. It captures the time period correctly and makes it feel like an old movie. Citizen Kane had some of the best cinematography and Mank followed. There were some scenes where the visual effects were too obvious, but I think that has something to do with it being in black & white. I thought Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried played their roles really well.The beginning of the film didn't do a good job to setup the film, I felt like I was in the middle and I had lost my attention. If you haven't watched Kane recently then you will probably get lost in some dialogue. However, once you start to understand who is who and what is going on it's where Mank starts to shine."
MANK,7 December 2020,10/10,"Brilliant acting, clever clear dialogue with no modern style mumbling or hushed talking and a great story. This is a must for all movie buffs."
MANK,4 December 2020,8/10,"Mank is a deep dwell to the movie that we all know, Citizen Kane. It has a powerful cast of characters and one of the best roles by Gary Oldman. Fincher has made again an excellent movie, but it lacks the excitement that will always make me think that David Fincher is one of the great directors living.What makes Gary Oldman one of a kind is this kind of movies, where he has all the inspiration he needs to make a great character. Herman Mankiewicz has made a great movie and his life was difficult and intriguing. What Oldman did with this character was that he took the role and made it intriguingly inspiring for others who will make a career of acting.The way that we all will know Citizen Kane is of course the black and white cinematography. Mank is also made as a black and white film with all of the characters that we need to make a 30s or 40s film. It's absolutely beautiful to watch.I couldn't believe when I heard Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross where the ones who were making the music. But when I looked at the movie and listen to the music, it all makes sense. Reznor and Ross has a mark by doing collaborations with each other and it doesn't betray us in Mank. Their is also the difference in the films music that made me hesitate the movie but Reznor and Ross pulls it of marvelously.Fincher has made yet another movie that will make it to the top 10 movies of this year, but it won't make it to the top. The movie is talking and that may be pouring to most of the viewers. I myself was a little bit pored in the second act. It didn't grip me like all the other movies that Fincher has made. Fincher has made so many different kinds of movies and this is one of them. Some people like it others won't.The script is talking and it does have to have the energy and the intriguiness that makes a movie great. Jack Fincher made the script and unfortunately he passed before David Fincher (his son) could make the film. Their are some elements that will make you yawn, because of the talking, but their is the last act that will make you think about the movies familiar ending to other movies by Fincher.All and all this was a great movie that I will watch again. The ending was beautifully done and the intriguing way that Oldman made the movie live is one of a kind. It's all in the hands of the director and the script writer."
MANK,13 March 2021,,"I was excited to see this since there aren't really (with some minor exceptions) any bad David Fincher movies. You may not have liked one (or more) of his movies, or it wasn't as good as you expected, but the guy is a solid filmmaker. I'm a huge fan of all of Trent Reznor's work as well, who did the score with period accurate instruments, which I found impressive, and I have enjoyed their previous collaborations. So when it seemed like I was missing details, I thought it was me, and I thought ""I'm going to have to watch this again."" Well after this was over, I looked at some reviews from both critics and average viewers, and the consensus was the same. This just wasn't a very entertaining movie. The cast, score, acting, and directing was well done, it just wasn't a fascinating story. If you are going to fall back to the ""well it was true story"" argument, they took liberties. It wasn't entirely accurate. So, a movie about the man that helped write Citizen Kane, has almost nothing to do with writing Citizen Kane. It was a semi-accurate, partial biography of a man that's been dead for almost 70 years. I really wanted to like this, but it was an underwhelming BOSH (Bunch Of Stuff Happens) movie."
MANK,5 August 2021,7/10,It's much better than a lot of the reviews say. This film is shot like an old movie. It's like old cinema if you can't handle an old style of movie you probably won't like it. I really like the old style so I really enjoyed this film. I am a huge fan of film history so that part really interested me I loved a lot of the history in this film. Of course it's about the writer of citizen cane the all time classic film from 1941. The performance by gary oldman was amazing he is one of the best parts about this film. He is so good you don't think he is acting. I don't think the story is as good as it could have been but it's still a good movie that you should watch at least once.
MANK,30 December 2020,,"I go into watching any film with a degree of objectivity. Even a Fincher film. I made an effort to not watch the trailer more than once, nor read reviews after its release or pay attention to my social media friends who wrote about it. I don't want to know. I'll judge it for myself without any preexisting knowledge of how others viewed it good or bad.With that said- this movie was bad. It's well made, acted, all of the technicals are there, the sets and props and costumes and makeup, the camera work the lighting, and the editing and sound- all of that is good. The acting was solid. Oldman is a front runner for best actor, I'm sure. All of the supporting roles- spot on. The historical accuracy I'm sure has taken some hits. But here's where the movie really come up short- the story is not good. Yes, film buffs and other movie fans know that the production of Citizen Kane was rickety. However this presentation, which this movie is, of the writing of the script for that movie isn't interesting or entertaining. I found myself being bored most of the time because there was nothing happening that held my attention. It was just a collection of scenes through many time periods leading up to the writing of the script for CK and the political climate and the inner working of Hollywood. Nothing more. Other than the script being the macguffin for Mank- nothing really interesting happens. Thats what is driving me crazy about not liking this movie, Fincher has a good pokerface with his Storytelling abilities. You're willing to endure everything that happens before with a key scene towards the end that justifies all that happened before. That didn't happen here. It was just one scene after another scene that told us about the circumstances of the screenplay to CK. Nothing more. If you want a better movie about the making of CK I recommend ""RKO 281"".Just give Mank it's best actor and cinematography Oscars and put it out to pasture. Not worth the watch."
MANK,30 December 2020,7/10,"Mank is immersive and very well shot. It successfully recreates the feeling of the 40s and the atmosphere of the movie industry at that time. Some viewers may find it not engaging enough because of it somewhat niche setting. Fans of movie making and screenplay writing specifically will probably enjoy it. It's a story with a lot of political undertones which are relevant to this day.As a character study it focuses more on the person Mankiewitcz was, his work routine and the people surrounding him. The film isn't really trying to tell the story of Kane or how it was made. Welles is just a part of the background.The events happening around the main character serve as plot devices to stimulate a reaction in him and to expose the way he views the world. Consequently i didn't really care about most of them. Their presence gives us more of a picture of this man's reality than actual characters to care about.I don't think Mank is significant enough to be a best picture winner and I'm not sure it's story can be appreciated by most people because it lacks any emotional connection with the majority it's characters. Most of it's secondary story lines like the disappearance of a ww2 soldier at sea or the tragic end of a director don't feel touching at all. Cinematography and direction wise it certainly can be a contestant for the academy award and since it's so self absorbed by it's main character perhaps a best actor nomination as well."
MANK,16 April 2021,8/10,"I have very few words about this.The film is very good almost perfect, it shows the passion of Davin Fincher toward the movie industry but i felt so disconnected. Gary Oldman was amazing and i loved his character and the things he has to say but i couldn´t watch the movie again. Fincher likes his audience to think and it always works out but this time i don´t think it worked that well.It is very well directed, acted, edited and portrayed but meaningless to my life.SORRY."
MANK,6 December 2020,10/10,"I really think that Mank is The best movie in 2020 and I don't really think that it deserves just a 7,6 here.
From The technic aspect I'm fascinated. The mood of The 30's and 40's in this movie is absolutely amazing.
I love Citizen Kane and I knew Mank had some troubles with Welles, but here I realize The troubles were very strong.
The performances are I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E! Gary Oldman as always does an excellent and gorgeous performance.
I don't like Amanda Seyfried in any movie, but here she really does an amazing job.And let's pass to The story. As Citizen Kane does, it travels through The present and The pass in flashbacks. I love how well tell this story is, and I love The fact that in every flashback they put The scene heading From a script.And finally, Shelley's dead scene hurted a lot of you ask me.In conclusion, this is another Fincher's masterpiece!"
MANK,2 May 2021,7/10,"I've seen Citizen Kane and know about the public feud between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst over the film. Mank is based on the screenwriter who wrote Citizen Kane, Herman Mankiewicz. Although it's interesting and was directed by David Fincher, the movie seemed to have gone on a lot longer than necessary."
MANK,7 December 2020,8/10,"The streaming race is getting super competitive. Prestige and originality is Netflix's strategy. I assume Netflix will release an Oscar bait every December from now on.
Orson Welles was a genius, a man with monumentus talent,David Fincher isn't any lesser. David Fincher as
a director has the most modern and provocative style, he is a true artist. Interesting how their paths interconnected in such an unusual way.
David Fincher's movies have always been dark and has had clean cut, beautiful cinematography. This movie is no different. Interestingly enough, the cinematographer
really tried to emmulate the cinematography of Citizen Kane.Personally I think you need to have seen and know the backstory of Citizen Kane to fully understand the movie.
Our protagonist Mank is an alcoholic tasked to write a screenplay, he is aided by a secretary. We see flashbacks of Mank's earlier career, his daliances with Marion Davis, his meetings with film executives, the parties at Hearst Castle.
As outsiders we are invited to see the inner workings of the movies business. You know what they say, there is no business like show business.
This is a boring movie that would only appeal to die hard fans who are interested in old Hollywood.This must be David Fincher's most personal project to date, a tribute to his father and to film as an art form."
MANK,5 December 2020,9/10,Oldman and Seyfried very good. Arliss Howard knocks it out of the park as Meyer. Film for thinking people.
MANK,26 March 2021,8/10,"As a writer, I appreciate this movie as a gesture to honor the hard work (and often hard life) of screenwriters. As a son left with a feeling of gratitude to his father, I appreciate the director David Fincher completed the project he started years ago with his father. And as a friend of Cinema, I love how the film sometimes captures the essence and style of The Citizen Kane."
MANK,11 April 2021,8/10,"Generally speaking, movies are too long these days and this one was too; however, the acting is great by Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried. Like anyone cares what I think, but the we get a little lost in the middle about what this is about (his time writing Citizen Kane??) Mank definitely seems like a character and was undoubtably gifted. Sometimes our gifts are our tortures in real life. I don't know that it needed to be all in black and white. That made me want to take a nap."
MANK,26 April 2021,,"Going into ""Mank"", I was expecting the film to deliver on the promise that it would show the making of ""Citizen Kane"" and the battle that screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (or as he's called in the film Mank) had with Orson Welles about credit on who wrote the screenplay for the movie. Instead the film focuses on events that take over the course of a decade leading up to Mank writing the screenplay. I was not prepared to be given so much information about L. B Meyer, Irving Thalberg, Upton Sinclair, socialism or the 1934 Gubernational Election. I didn't really care for that when I watched it the first time. Some months later, I decided to watch the movie again and this time prepare to focus on some of the more important/complicated parts of the movie that might have gone over my head the first time I watched it. The result was that I admired the movie a whole lot more. Sure, the argument can be made that watching a movie the first time around and enjoying it at first is the universal sign of an instant classic, but in my experience I've often found myself rewatching a lot of movies and noticing things that I didn't pick up on the first time around. I understand that a lot of the cultural references that the characters make are somewhat esoteric to modern audiences, in fact some of the lines that characters speak sound like they're speaking in code as if the only people to understand what they're saying is the writer and director of this movie. But beyond that, I think the movie does well in building up to the feuds that Mank has with William Randolph Hearst and Orson Wells. As well as capturing the culture of 1930s Hollywood like the way different studios hate each other and say bad things about their rival studios. As a fan of film in general, I appreciate the effort that the cast and crew were going for in trying to pay homage to films from about that time. ""Mank"" will certainly not be thought of as one of David Fincher's best movies, but it is a movie that I feel audience members would need to be prepare for before viewing in order to maybe understand it better. Hopefully then people wouldn't be so upset with it. So please, give ""Mank"" a second chance if you don't like it at first."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Ok. First the actors.
Gary Oldman can win te Oscar, I think he deserves it right now, but it can appear a better performance. Amanda Seyfried is going to win, I liked so much her. The film, I don't know, it was good I think, but it won't win the Oscar.
Very good cinematography and good script. If you like the cinema, watch it."
MANK,15 August 2021,5/10,"By far David Fincher's only bad film, and it's really bad. I can't believe it was nominated for Oscars, but that just goes to show how stupid the Oscar voting committee is. I love Gary Oldman, and I am a big fan on Fincher movies but this one just sucks."
MANK,9 December 2020,10/10,Glad Fincher has returned to the feature length medium and to my favourite genre: Hollywood.Directing is meticulous along with great detail in terms of production design.Amanda Seyfried is captivatingly charming as Marion Davies and my favourite part of the whole film.Witty script.The relationship of Mankiewicz & Welles isn't surprising but still interesting to watch the inner workings of the business.Music captures the times to Trent Reznor's credit.Will say the film feels scattered but always comes back to some point.
MANK,13 December 2020,6/10,"I appreciate Fincher changing up his style, even putting homages in the movie to resemble Citizen Kane, The Third Man and other of Welles' films, but what felt like a bloated run time, not enough focus on one subject to feel for anyone long enough to care about anyone and slowly disliking the lead myself. However, the acting by Gary Oldman is, as always, top notch, with amazing cinematography, lighting, everything technical really, I mean it's David Fincher after all.A much better film, I believe, that dabbles in the same lane of ""Scorned writer from his peers because of politics in Hollywood"" is ""Trumbo"" with Bryan Cranston."
MANK,4 December 2020,4/10,"Wow. How the creator of Se7en, Gone Girl, and The Social Network decided to make such a boring film that every second is screaming: ""I'm important and artistic!"" When the audiences are probably like: ""Ok, dude, let me sleep.""
MANK (2020) is not an awful film. It has a lot of great shots and technical achievements. But Damn. This film is overrated. Really, Really, Overrated. and that script? Yikes."
MANK,11 March 2021,4/10,Got half way before giving up. Don't feel for any of the characters and don't care.
MANK,21 March 2021,6/10,"All the elements of a great film are here - Mayer, Hearst, Davies, Thalberg, Houseman, Welles, Mankiewicz, Citizen Kane, Hollywood's Golden era - but it never comes together. Ultimately, it's the story of a self-destructive genius' greatest moment that never quite understands how and why he got there. Ironically for a film that centers around screenwriting, it's the script that fails. Perhaps Director David Fincher was too faithful to his late father's script because it needed a polishing rewrite to make it tighter and more focused.Give credit where it's due. Mankiewicz designed and built the framework that turned into one of the great movies of all time. That story more or less gets told. I wish it had done a better job of telling Mankiewicz's own story."
MANK,8 March 2021,4/10,"I felt ashamed turning this film off after the first 20 mins or so.Reading the reviews here, I feel much better.This should have been a great film, not a dull, boring one."
MANK,22 November 2020,10/10,"What a movie should have
A masterpiece of eye and momment"
MANK,8 December 2020,8/10,"I really really loved this film, in fact I already knew since the trailers that this would be the best film of 2020 and it didn´t dissapointed me not one single bit, however:
I´m a guy who believes in coincidences and in this case this is an odd and unbelieveable tree of references and coincidences that really messed up my mind even now that I stopped watching this film.
In a Biopic (Mank is not a fully-formed Biopic, Mank is a very subjetive and non-linear film) I don´t really care about historic innadequacies (Unless they are too rude like Anastasia or Bohemian Rhapsody) I do care only that the whole story get´s me hooked and excited and Mank isn´t the exception.
But there was a great curiosity to watch the historic fight of Mank Vs Welles about the custody, sorry the credits of Citizen Kane, I personally think that both deserves the credits for making that awesome film, but in this film´s vision, Mank is the main responsible of the success of Citizen Kane´s screenplay, that didn´t affected me as many people did, but it made me reflect in a very serious way about this film in general.I like David Fincher films, but I´m not a fully-time-fan because I just don´t enjoy too much his cinematographic philosopy, It´s too clean and digital that annoys me a little being a ""Film´s better than Digital"" type of guy, but when David Fincher had the opportunity of making a vintage film about 30s-40s film industry, it was a sacrilage to me to watch such cleanest images with bad CGI, high ISO levels, it distracted me, even if he did edit the audio and film grain to make it more antique, David Fincher´s place is digital, and it´s a shame that erased a star out of this film, this truly bothered me.But why this film is my favorite one released in 2020?, like Mank did wrote Citizen Kane the best film of all time, it´s all because of Jack FincherI was about to call this, ""David Fincher´s Magnum Opus"" but the reality is that the wonderful suspense of the movie, the fast paced timing, the funny as hell Mank responses, the smartness, and all of that is part of the original screenplay of Jack Fincher, he is the Mank of our times, a talented screenwriter like Charlie Kauffmann, but with only one big hit in his hand, and gone too soonDavid Fincher does not pays tribute to Citizen Kane, to old Movies or Hollywood, he pays tribute to people like Mank, to people like his father and to the screenwriters in the world in such a forgotted and underrated job, but with a highly important value, because a movie is a whole, there are the beautiful images, the powerful acting, the enchantment of the soundtrack, and the feelings that a movie produces to the public.But above all, cinema is storytelling, we go to the cinema to watch stories that make us believe we are in other worlds, and the screenwriter is the mother of those stories and the director, the narrator of those.So above all the great stuff about the movie that I won´t mention, this truly showed me between the lines the huge love of David Fincher with his dad, and Mank is truly Jack Fincher´s masterpiece and I hope that as Citizen Kane, Mank stays with us for a very long time into our minds"
MANK,12 December 2020,6/10,"We get to delve into the trials and tribulations of Hollywood screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he attempts to finish the screenplay for the 'masterpiece' we know today to be Citizen Kane. However, we also delve into his alcoholism and the chaotic characters of Hollywood.
I've just realised my title saying that Mank isn't a love letter to Hollywood may infer it's miss its mark however that is not what I mean. We don't see the bright lighted charming Hollywood dream you may expect but we instead get quite a dark and unfiltered insight into the inner world of Hollywood. Old movies and old Hollywood do hold a very special place in my heart so even classic black and white shots stir up a sense of magic for me so I found there was still a feeling of grandness and excitement to Mank despite its subject material. You can see Fincher has used the techniques and style of old Hollywood movies and even echoes the film-making in Citizen Kane and despite other people thinking it was a feeble attempt to replicate the old style I loved the fresh take. Mank serves as a brilliant ode to past film-making whilst offering up something fresh and I really enjoyed that aspect of it.
Mank does not feel like a David Fincher film in the slightest. I'm not saying that as a bad thing, if anything it proves Fincher as an even more talented director than he already is as he can vary up the tone and atmosphere of his films and bring his audiences something completely different to what they're used to and that makes me very excited for possible future projects of his (let's hope we don't have to wait 6 years again).
Despite all this, I wasn't as entranced and gripped by this film as I thought I would be. I don't really know why it is, it could be that I wasn't just in the right frame of mind or that the film narrowly missed the mark for it to be the perfect feature that ensured I never took my eyes away. Nonetheless, I think it's a brilliant film that displays Fincher as a brilliant directorial force (oh and how amazing were the performances in this? Oldman and Seyfried were the standouts for me). Definitely worth a watch even if you don't have a connection to Citizen Kane (because I bloody don't), it's for sure one of the top films of 2020."
MANK,12 June 2021,7/10,"I'm only giving it a 7 because of the actors perfomances and the cinematography (so stunning!).I really enjoyed it but I don't feel like it made sense. It's a shame though,I'm a big fan of Fincher!"
MANK,29 March 2021,6/10,"With such big characters, Orson Wells nevertheless, and such a intense period, as well as fine director's and cast, it's a possibility that the movie was made in a bohemian environment, taken away from the movie the power to invest the audience, surely lost themself several time as I was.I couldn't wait to see it, the making of ""Citizen Canes"" wow....pity, an opportunity is gone!"
MANK,4 December 2020,10/10,"Did I wake up at 4 AM to watch this movie? Yes I did. Was it worth waking up for? Absolutely and I do not regret my decision. This movie is simply a masterwork. The movie centers around the writing of the screenplay for Citizen Kane by Herman Mankiewicz.Negatives: My only problem with the movie is I simply wish there was more of it. By this I mean I feel like I could have watched 2 more hours of this movie easily without feeling tired and droopy and that's with me watching this movie on only 5 hours of sleep.Positives: To begin with I want to discuss how perfectly the film is shot. The movie's cinematography is stunningly great. The film's use of black and white, a constant score in the background, the sound quality, and the use of cigarette burns in the right corner of the film give the film the quality of looking like it was filmed at the same time as Citizen Kane. The movie's acting is outstanding, but especially the performance of Gary Oldman who shines in this role as he has shined in many previous roles. Oldman truly captures the feeling of Mank and makes the character sympathetic and feel real. The costumes and sets also give the film the feeling of being made in the late 30s. The writing of the film by Jack Fincher is just top notch and flows so well. This is all aided by David Fincher's brilliant direction for which he should win Best Director. The film engrossed me throughout without ever leaving a feeling of dullness while watching it. The movie was simply stunning to me.This movie is a must watch of the year and one I highly recommend to anyone. The film will not bore you especially if you have seen Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as soon as you get home from work or school."
MANK,5 December 2020,5/10,The film is done in the style of Citizen Kane...so B&W and poor sound...I can't give any special kudos for what seems a gimmick that just gets in the way of the storytelling. It makes the film feel heavy and dated and in that respect it succeeds but all for no benefit. I'm reminded of the '1917' film which gave the illusion of a single shot but just ended up ignoring the benefits of editing etc and became a bit corny.PS: Cant help feeling that Orson Welles would be furious with a modern filmmaker squandering their advantages and making a film seem deliberately old.
MANK,21 December 2020,6/10,"Although the cinematography is nice and the performance by Gary Oldman just makes it good. This is just a forgettable, boring film."
MANK,26 April 2021,4/10,"The movie seemed to consist of Oldam (Mank) ranting on, offending just about everyone around him, and showing no human sensitivity. It was difficult to follow it chronologically despite descriptions between scenes. Maybe it was accurate but it was neither riveting drama nor entertaining. At times it had the oratory of a stage play but never achieved the rich language nor dramatic intensity such a play would have needed. It was more of a one man alcoholic rant than what the story could have achieved, given how brilliant the Citizen Kane script was.Disappointing."
MANK,26 May 2021,7/10,"David Fincher is my favorite director but Mank is not even close to his best works and the main problem is the story. It's about an alcoholic screenwriter writing a movie that's it. It lacks the suspense you'd expect from a Fincher movie. That being said the other aspects of the movie are almost perfect the attention to detail, the soundtrack, camera work, and the cast do a decent job but the best among them is Charles Dance."
MANK,11 December 2020,8/10,"A masterfully crafted script and direction. This was another terrific Fincher movie, but one that will likely be met with mixed reviews by fans of the director. This is really unlike any movie Fincher has done before. Its slower for sure, but not in a negative way. Careful attention must be paid to the dialogue if you want to leave this movie with any understanding of what is going on. More importantly, and to the films detriment, one must at least have some basic historical knowledge of who the many figures in this film were in order for this film to appear to have any purpose. Regardless, I thought this movie was ""Very Good,"" hence the 8/10.Also, you should probably, definitely, maybe watch Citizen Kane prior to viewing this film, since the protagonist is the famous film's writer and understanding that film's plot will give you a better appreciation for why Mank is a great story."
MANK,10 December 2020,4/10,"Don't get me wrong, I like classic Hollywood flicks. But only if the are worth it. I have even watched Citizen Kane a couple of years ago just to understand all this chitchat about the black&white classics. It was okay, not a deep story but quite convincing considering the date it was created.Now, to Mank, that movie was not convincing. They tried to establish some kind of pathos around the persona of the famous script writer but it doesn't sell.
Who exactly does care about the bed room stories among the movie industry pros ALMOST A CENTURY AGO?On top of that, man, Gary Oldman is good but he is just too old, man, about 20 years older than the real Mank when he wrote Citizen Kane. It simply does not fit.And in the end they try to make a point. But I just don't see the punchline. The movie goes on, ends, and the outcome is meh... not even a summary of the fate of the real Mank.
Just pointless."
MANK,24 April 2021,4/10,I don't think it'll win an Oscar.Black & white was to harsh for my eyes.Just hurted.Why no softer b & w?
MANK,24 April 2021,2/10,"It is a mystery that this movie got several Oscar nominations. Someone must have spent a lot of money to bribe the comitee.The movie is boring, without a story, a totalt waste of time. I fully understand why it went direct to a streaming serviceThere are nothing new in the movie, nothing that is unique, and there are nothing that makes me wanting to see this movie again, like ever. It is not a masterpiece."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Why did we have his secretary give the date of the Battle of Hastings and say it was ""10 degrees centigrade""? No English person would have said this at the time as centigrade was pretty much unknown, in England as in the US. A trivial point in itself but it makes me wonder how reliable other, more important, elements of the film are.And while I'm writing anyway...the CGI scenery was often terrible, much worse than in an old-style movie shot on the studio lot and using back projection. Perhaps they were making some point but I don't know what it might have been.For me, these things didn't ruin an enjoyable movie but they did niggle."
MANK,5 December 2020,3/10,"It will be forgotten alongside Benjamin Button and Panic Room.The script discovered what it wanted to be about around 2/3rds into the film. The cinematography was awful. The subject matter was meandering and bland. The acting was awful, specifically on the part of Seyfried (no motivation, just reading lines). Oldman was Oldman without direction. The editing was apologetic. Go and watch Touch of Evil or Citizen Kane; you'll quickly realize those films are as efficient and down to earth as the Die Hard films.Thought about the script: A character who is cynical and disenfranchised cant be the same exact way he is in the present day as he is in the flashbacks. Mank is the same both past and present.Thought about style: Makes it seem like there is a puzzle to solve all the way through. But there is no puzzle to solve. It's a shallow script with no interesting ideas intentionally obscured by t i dont even care everyone who wants to is going to ignore my review anyway.Cinematography: muddled. The characters are constantly in shadows. Either gray, black, small or have bright white light behind them which makes it impossible to see the profile of their face. The human face holds a bounty of interesting information and they're hidden in every shot.Editing: Not only is the cinematography a silly anti-composition exercise, but the editing is completely indiscriminate.My theory about Netlix is that they are like the ""cool"" teacher who says they have no rules in their class. But we all know they clearly do but they want YOU(the director) to accept it on their own so they can save face. ""No producer intervention, the director has all the control"" is what Netlfix is known for. I'm starting to doubt this severely. Curation. Curation. Curation.Go watch 8 1/2. Black and white done right. A deliciously human, beautifully told film about the film industry filled with hilarious observations about men and women. And you can actually see peoples facial expressions!"
MANK,25 December 2020,4/10,"Baby FIncher found an old dead script wirtten by his Dad. One has to wonder how much dust lay on it before it was dusted off, or why Baby Fincher did not properly read it before setting it to film. One does not have to wonder why the script was never used when it was written. It feels like an outline - a collection of lttle vinnettes, that when given the full noir look very good, but many of the scenes are meaningless, and most disjointed. One of the early scenes - lets call it ""the pitch"" where a collection of studio guys pitch a version of Frankenstein to a boss - why? It felt stagey and stilted. SOme of the word smithing is good. Maybe it would have made a book- but this is just self indulgent, and vague. A miss"
MANK,4 December 2020,1/10,Dull story. Dull picture. Pointless use of black and white.
MANK,26 November 2021,6/10,"This was my first visit to the cinema for 9 months and undoubtedly my last for some months to come. So I was doubly disappointed with this film. I have recently read the excellent biography of both brothers,so this made my disappointment all the more acute. It was difficult to understand why they concentrated on the 1934 Governational contest for California rather than leaving bits and pieces for Citizen Kane. There is so much that could be said about that film,which was left out. The black and white photography is excellent and I did appreciate marking the film with the changeover cue dots. Easier to keep track of how long had elapsed. The film,regardless,is a misfire."
MANK,13 December 2020,6/10,"The cinematic elements here are fantastic, but it's hard to follow. The dialogue is poetic and smooth but hard to understand what is really being said. At the end of the day I think this is more of a love letter to the Hollywood screen play writer by using the mystique of what consider to be the greatest movie ever made as the storytelling vehicle."
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"This movie tells about screenwriter named Herman J. Mankiewicz, an Oscar winning writer for original screenplay for Citizen Kane (1941). The collaboration with gifted director, Orson Welles won 9 Oscar nomination and winning the screenplay one.I got vibes like watching Alfred Hitchcock's biopic titled Hitchcock (2012) after watching his magmum-opus Psycho (1960). Basically it shows behind the scene of how a masterpiece was made, but in this case, is with this almost uncredited screenplayer's point of view.Some people say it's boring, yes, David Fincher always come up with his slow paced 2 hours+ duration but it always has its own plus points, eventually. I personally skipped it and got distracted 3 times to finished this movie. I'm glad that i saw Citizen Kane (1940) to relate this movie and you should watch it first too.Gary Oldman's performance is great, good cinematography, well dialogue, etc. Mank is just good enough to be one of David Fincher's filmography and 2nd biopic made by him after The Social Network (2010)."
MANK,2 December 2020,8/10,"From the acting to the production design to even Fincher's direction, most everything about this movie is simply, good. The score and script (both of which are sharp and of the time period) are the true standouts. Could this have been an all-timer given all its parts? Sure. But in a time where we haven't had movie theaters or ""important"" movies in months, it's a more than welcome addition to Fincher's filmography."
MANK,8 December 2020,6/10,"Stylistically impressive but lacking in substance. There's no great secret or 'hidden truth' behind 'Citizen Kane'. Mank wrote the first draft and Welles took it from there, creating a masterpiece after several rewrites. The story told here simply isn't very interesting, although I imagine the Hollywood stiffs will indulge it with a sentimental smile.
Can see it collecting awards for acting, direction, cinematography and score....but not screenplay."
MANK,24 April 2021,4/10,"I'm not sure what it was, but from the very beginning I just had a hard time getting into this movie. I didn't really feel like I learned much about Mank's life or Citizen Kane. It was more about how the studios back political candidates. The scene at the Hearst estate at the end was difficult to sit through. I appreciate that Fincher made this look like it was made at the time of Citizen Kane, but if this is an Oscar contender this truly is a bad year for movies."
MANK,6 December 2020,8/10,"Senhoras e senhores, o mestre está de volta.
David Fincher volta com um filme sobre um dos grandes da história de Hollywood, Mankiewicz e o processo de escrita do argumento de Citizen Kane.
O filme leva-nos a Hollywood dos anos 30/40 ficando na retina a construção de época a todos os níveis, o que foi uma tacada de gênio de Fincher, pois dá a sensação que estamos a ver um filme produzido nessa altura.
A história gira em torno de Mankiewicz, um argumentista com alguns problemas com o álcool e viciado nos jogos de azar, e a sua relação com algumas pessoas influentes da indústria do cinema que leva com pano de fundo a eleição de 1934 do estado da Califórnia.
Mank não é uma boa influência e o filme não esconde isso, mas apesar das suas ações não foi possível em algum momento ficar de certa forma revoltado com as ações de Mankiewicz pois sempre que ele fazia alguma coisa tinha um certo charme que fazia com que ele sobressaísse no meio daquele meio.
Como já referido, o longa trata de explorar a vida deste cineasta em sintonia com o processo de escrita do argumento de um dos filmes mais reconhecidos no cinema,Citizen Kane, fazendo o contraponto de algumas personagens que aparecem no filme com pessoas que Mank se cruzou ao longo da vida.
Gary Oldman está muito bom como Mankiewicz, mas o destaque vai para Amanda Seyfried que tal como Gary Oldman deve ser lembrada na época das premiações. Importante também não deixar de parte Arliss Howard, que interpreta Louis B Mayer fundador da MGM e que trás para a tela uma das melhores performances do filme.
Concluindo, estamos perante um longa que nos conta uma história envolvente, que mesmo quando estamos a sair do filme ela volta a agarrar-nos com alguma controvérsia ou comentário político. É uma clara homenagem a Hollywood e não deixa de ser interessante ver os bastidores da sétima arte dos anos 30.Nota: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (8.4/10)"
MANK,27 March 2021,4/10,"I consider myself a film buff and have seen loads movies from the 30s and 40s so when I heard what this film was about I was anxious to see it.The problem is, that what they chose to make the film about would appeal to a small percentage of people who are familiar with the people involved and the events that occurred during that time; and even then there is nothing really worth making a film about in my opinion. There is nothing really that interesting about anything going on in this movie and on top of that we are never really made to feel much sympathy for the characters either.The acting is pretty good but there is not much of a story there. We are teased by being transported to a place In time were there are a million exciting and fascinating things going on in Hollywood but we are presented with some of the most mundane day to day to day events in the lives of some of the most interesting people during that time. Most interesting aspect of any character in the movie is Mankiewicz's alcoholism.It seems like Fincher's overall intention was to make the film to pay tribute to his father but also make a film that would pay tribute to the era by technically giving it a great nostalgic feel. It's just too bad he didn't have a better story to work with.I always wonder what particularly inspires someone to make a movie about such random real life events when there are so many epic and fascinating stories throughout history that get ignored."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Mank combines a compelling script with an (expected) fantastic performance from Gary Oldman, helped by many other outstanding castings and impressive production design, giving the audience a back and forth drama akin to the film preceding this story, all told excellently under David Fincher's direction."
MANK,11 December 2020,6/10,"Gary Oldman like allways he is astonishing in the way he portraying the character, i have seen Citizen Kane 2 hours before this movie and i can see the connections from the screenplay and how he connected some things from his life in the movie.It s worth a watch, good distribution and goo acting the dialogues are good aswell the music is just feeling like i m watching citizen kane 2.0 but boring citizen kane masterpiece this is just a piece..this could be made in 40s 50s the same is made today not to much trouble.David Fincher should have stayed and make 3rd season of Mindhunter, that i really enjoyed, and every single movie from se7en to Gone Girl but this is just not ehat i expected from him."
MANK,27 April 2021,1/10,"Dems are the good people
Republicans are evil
The core idea of the movie is to serve the Democratic party propaganda that started decades ago through the main stream media and continued through Netflix, HBO, Amazon and other hack outlets.Nothing bio about it, nothing remarkable about it, nothing deserves even an Oscar nomination, it's just politics, it's the political service that got this movie into light.Watch and judge yourselves."
MANK,24 March 2021,8/10,"Cinema for Cinema What I have been waiting for a long time, David Fincher, the number one director, has made a fascinating, glamorous and at the same time revealing film. Everything is in place and I hope he wins the most awards at the 2021 Oscars"
MANK,2 May 2021,7/10,"I may be a loose cannon, but you m friend are an outsider.""I don't have a dog in this fight, but is seems to me that the above might be the truth. There are so many people trying to belittle Mank's contribution on citizen Kane, but his name is on the script credits. If he was that unimportant, that wouldn't happen. That doesn't take away from Welles carrier but it does from people's affinity to built myths. I thought it was a nice movie overall, not special but entertaining."
MANK,12 December 2020,6/10,"I really hate to admit that but watching this movie was kind of a chore to me. Aside from the astonishing technical points, the plot fails to engage its viewers as it drifts from its central points during the movie.To begin with, though being a Fincher's film, the plot is really sluggish and so incoherent that confusion about the events of the story becomes the only visible point. The several names brought up without any forewarning tell us that the movie can be considered as a pure masterpiece only for 30s moviegoers. The confusion we are dealing with make this movie extremely self-absorbed and dull. Personally speaking, having not Fincher's name attached to it, no none would even notice it. With the rapid flashbacks, at points where you are finally about to understand something, the plot drifts along and never finds a center.On the plus side, Mank is a great perfection in technical points. The performances are well executed, the cinematography is phenomenal and the sounds and music could be no better. Aside from his average plot, Fincher has done a skillful job in taking old Hollywood films essences and, unlike many other movies, didn't make a flop out of it. To be honest, at some points I wondered if the movie really belonged to 2020! I definitely think it deserves nominations for sound and cinematography.I expected more of this talented director. I think it just smacks of trying to be different and controversy. To simply put, don't watch it if you don't have an encyclopedia for 30s movies."
MANK,28 March 2021,7/10,"This movie is not so special or a masterpiece, but has a particular impact for the viewer gifted by the visionary images and atmosphere, which carries whoever watches it inside the daily life typical of that historical period. The directing is sought after and Gary Oldman's performance is as always impeccable."
MANK,22 January 2021,6/10,"I may not be the best critic to follow when it comes to MANK, simply because unlike the majority of the artistic community, I am just not a fan of its subject matter: Citizen Kane. This movie plays so much like the plot of its subject that I found myself being as bored as I was merely a few years ago watching the original as a true fan of exceptional media. Like its predecessor, I was bored.I expect many of the cast and likely the film itself to garner much recognition by the Academy in 2021, and well deserved. The performances are the only thing this incredibly slow and boring story have to offer. Look for Oldman, Seyfried as Marion, an irrelevant love interest, Burke and Kingsley to receive proper attention by the Oscar voters. But while I expect the film to garner many award nominations due to the theme of historical drama, I'm not prepared to recommend this film for any reason outside of the masterful performances of its actors in a largely boring tale. I give this film 3/5 stars solely on the strength of its actors."
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"I was swept into this film with hope for a great experience. It is beautifully photographed in luscious B&W, like classic Robert Surtees or James Wong Howe cinematography. The sets look true to period. The costumes, the scenery all looked accurate. But, after 30 minutes, I fell asleep. I woke up, then fell asleep again. The story was laborious and told in mostly ponderous blocks of static dialog. The plot got lost. It was boring to me. After an hour, I didn't care about Mank. Oops! I think the director got caught up in the technical stuff and forgot to tell a compelling story."
MANK,29 January 2021,6/10,Looks great. Clever monologues and dialogue. Structurally incoherent.
MANK,4 December 2020,6/10,"I really wanted to love this and was looking forward to watching it but by the end I thought it was just OK, nothing more. One thing that I didn't like, was that Gary Oldman (fine actor though he is) was just way too old in the role. Marion Davies and Herman Mankiewicz were the same age, both being born in 1897 but the actors portraying them had an age difference of 27 years (Oldman born in 1958 and Amanda Seyfried in 1985). It is such a Hollywood cliché, have a 62 year old man and a 35 year old woman both portraying people who were the same age.On the whole, the acting was excellent but I would have liked to have seen more of Tom Burke who I thought was perfect as Orson Welles."
MANK,28 December 2020,9/10,"My favorite film of the year is one I'm biased to choose.Let me tell you about my bias. If I go to a new film directed by one of my favorite directors, I go in having a great amount of trust. I mean, I feel safe. What I know, given to me by my trust, allows all other expectations to wait for me elsewhere while I truly live in-the-moment for the duration of the experience. I'm not always sitting down for a piece of entertainment, although one can always hope, as this should be the least of expectations. I'm not always hoping to enjoy what I'm about to watch, though. But when I sit down for a David Fincher movie, who is the finest director working today, there is no safety (this is ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" director). Where I trust him...is knowing that nobody else could do it better.My bias here...with ""Mank""...has me very conflicted. Not only is it masterful movie making, but the story elements touch on politics and religion in such a manner that the writing feels like it's speaking just to me (these are, after all, two fascinating topics to the writer you're now reading). And not only that, but he's doing so in a charming classic-styled way that you'd see in movies like ""Sunset Boulevard"" (which is also about ""old Hollywood""), which is to say not only are you being told stories in a lovingly entertaining way, but it's as if an old friend is using his grand dialect that friends of his describe as an art form. Gary Oldman fills this position splendidly as Mank himself surely did.Now...is ""Mank"" that great? Or...am I just biased?Is ""Citizen Kane"" required viewing? Citizen ""Mank"" serves not as a prequel, but more as a spiritual remake to the RKO Pictures classic. Let me offer some brutal honesty, here: I don't care about ""casual audiences."" Movies should be made for movie lovers (music seems made for specific fans as well), and I have little patience for people who choose to ""Netflix n chill"" (okay, I'm guilty here) or, worse, just put a movie on as a preventative measure against feeling lonely without background noise. Gotta say, on that note, ""Mank"" would be a pretty lovely radio show.These times, they are a-changin'. I'm talkin' new Hollywood. I'm talkin' ""old"" Hollywood. ""Mank"" is a fast-talking charmer of the sort you would find commonplace in a good ""classics"" section organized by Netflix IF Netflix ever put such a worthy effort into showing their viewers real movies (Turner Classic Movies does a better job on HBO Max, and it's still pitiful). It's a sad world they've created when a David Fincher movie can't stay in the top 10 list on Netflix (it dropped off after day one) seemingly because of a lack of color.Simply put, David Fincher (no stranger to biopics, he's the director of ""The Social Network,"" and if I may call it a biopic, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") saw the future when he imagined the power of Netflix. The entertainment giant backed him for a political satire called ""House of Cards,"" making content produced by Netflix a force to be reckoned with. Now, they're almost killing themselves with such an overwhelming output that their own movies are easily lost in the shuffle (and is it just me, or does everything, even a 3 1/2 hour Scorsese picture, feel ""made-for-tv?""). David Fincher (who also directed ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"") came back with another show for Netflix that he enjoyed directing called ""Mindhunter,"" which is another brilliant concept, endlessly fascinating, but a Season 3 isn't even promised or guaranteed. Contracts no longer exist for it.Now, with a big middle finger to Hollywood itself, Fincher is using his late father's script (surely a passion project) to show how easily Hollywood was and can be changed with his first-ever straight-to-the-small-screen film, ""Mank."" (His last effort was the anti-love story about two narcissists who get stuck in marriage by politics, ""Gone Girl"") This one, like his Netflix shows, is also centered by politics.Set in the aftermath of the depression, the brutality of the affects is background for this picture. Hollywood writers, however, are making great money for people to spend their very hard-earned nickels and quarters on. The transition to ""talkies"" has been made, after all, so ""anyone who can put three words together"" is being called upon. Our main character, Mank, a screenwriter for the movies (he claims to be washed-up, no longer talented enough to do better than movies), has insight into the propaganda that became a common practice for Hollywood directors (and even more so for foreign film people, especially in Germany where their people would believe anything that was repeated enough, not unlike our red-hat-wearing fellow citizens these past four years). The propaganda of the day is vital to the style of picture ""Citizen Kane"" became, which is the film Orson Welles hired Mank to write about the real-life newspaper tycoon, William Hearst (not exactly a man who would gag on a silver spoon). ""Citizen Kane"" became famous for the multi-perspectives and fancy camera work mixed with quick-cuts and invisible special effects all working together to create some of the greatest story-telling techniques ever that would revolutionize Hollywood...but what also invests people into the world of ""Citizen Kane"" is the believable ""newsreel""-style footage that begins the 1941 picture that is known to be ""perfect,"" a very rare label appropriate for anything on film. Newsreel footage, shown here to be inspired by real ""fake news."" Remember, Orson Welles was no stranger to using realism to sell his product. This is the same man who made headlines for a science-fiction radio play (""War of the Worlds"") that literally frightened listeners into believing aliens had invaded Earth (I'm unclear if this was literally literal, but I have seen the headlines, whether they were ""fake news"" or not).Herman J. Mankiewicz, or ""Mank,"" is the writer behind the show, a credit that also went to the infamous Orson Welles for the sole Academy Award the film won (Academy voters were apparently unaware of the legacy the picture would have). Welles, who directed ""Kane"" and hired Mank to write it. ""Mank,"" as told by Jack Fincher (again, David's father), seeks to deny Welles this credit, rejecting any chance for a ""love letter"" to the film or Hollywood (Welles was decidedly anti-Hollywood anyway, described here as an ""outsider""), but more like a warning not to believe everything we see and hear (always good advice, but be wary of people who tell you not to believe ANYthing you see and hear). In one atmospheric scene of the Fincher film, we're on a beach listening to radio. An interviewee is declaring her stance on exactly why she's voting Republican in the next election, complete with a story of her own victimhood. Our main character and his lovely date then suddenly recognize the voice of said Republican voter (no doubt she could now be considered a method actor as it seems unlikely she would actually be voting for the ""socialist"" on the Democrat ticket). She's an actress, not just a voter, and nothing of the sort she claimed to be. ""I'd recognize that voice anywhere,"" says Mank, listening to the sorry voice of America that is as fake as the character she's playing.Upton Sinclair (surprisingly played by...Bill Nye?) loses the election in 1934, believing the ""phony newsreels"" to be the fatal blows to his campaign. Mank, a fan, blames FDR, reminding us of the ""hero"" that would soon come to the rescue (a man who actually forced corporations and churches into anti-socialist efforts, bringing us to the divided states of America we see today, which is sadly not an irrelevant fact pertaining to this film...especially considering corporations have nearly destroyed today's Hollywood...and thanks to this virus, we're getting an advanced look at what could become of movie theaters).The film is presented in a glorious 4K version, and a color version doesn't even exist. This is meant to not only show the 1930s, but feel like a film from the era, too. The soundtrack is complete with the sounds of film scratches and audio flaws, and the picture itself is marked-up with what characters in ""Fight Club"" (another Fincher picture) called ""cigarette burns."" ""Mank"" will be remembered as one of Fincher's less accessible films (people are avoiding this not only because of a lack of color, but it is quite the ""talkie""), made for writers more than cinephiles (which I wish were given more attention, although ""old Hollywood"" is given screen time even though it feels like less than a cameo). I kept waiting for visual sequences a la David Fincher prior, almost forgetting that the style of the film itself was presenting to me a visual feast. Every frame of a Fincher picture a painting. Each is carefully crafted (he normally certainly pays his dues to the auteur of ""pure cinema,"" Alfred Hitchcock), and yet it's not unusual for his scripts to keep our eyes glued to the screen. It is written for political junkies as well, sure, but ultimately this is a story about story. Story itself is used to tell about story itself. Where do stories come from? That's THE question this flick answers using one of the best movies of all time.Just don't ask about ""Rosebud."""
MANK,1 April 2021,5/10,"I like how this film about the writing of citizen kane was made in the style of citizen kane. It's made well but honestly did grab me until maybe the last 10 minutes. I didn't feel very engaged with the characters, and didn't really understand the point of the story. I'm surprised how many oscar nominations it received, not that its terrible but nothing I'll remember for very long."
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"Shot in Black and White and premiering on Netflix this weekend, ""Mank"" picks up steam once it gets going.
This film captures Old Hollywood of the 1930's and 40's. In fact, the film does this so well, you will forget it is a period piece around halfway through the movie. The story becomes more interesting around this point, especially if you know of ""Citizen Kane"" and Orson Welles, as you can't help but fill in the missing pieces. While ""Citizen Kane"" is about William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies (played excellently by Charles Dance and Amanda Seyfried) ""Mank"" takes us on the journey of the brutally honest writer Herman Mankiewicz played by Gary Oldman. Oldman gives us another brilliant performance. As Herman Mankiewicz spirals out of control mainly due to his alcohol dependency and his unwillingness to compromise, we really understand Oldman's character's inner thoughts and his contempt for the people in power who surround him. This puts him at odds with everyone powerful throughout the movie, even if they try at first to befriend him. The political subplot is a nice added dimension to Oldman's character and the story as we start to believe his convictions are truly warranted.
Oldman emotes and lashes out as ""Mank"" but never overplays his character. And we feel like we are witnessing him in the flesh try to pick up the pieces each time he makes a spectacle of himself. Surrounded with an exception cast, Oldman brings us a very memorable character in ""Mank"", one that we weren't sure at first if we would root for.
David Fincher, who directs, brings his late father's script to life and treats us to a in-depth look of Old Hollywood power and the strings it weaves. Fincher who is known for dark films such as ""Se7en"", ""Zodiac"", ""Gone Girl"" and ""Fight Club"", subtly moves a grown up audience without the use of a character who is a psychopath or sociopath. But rather a powerful narcissists."
MANK,5 December 2020,3/10,"This film starts out very slow. It's shot in a stylistic fashion, reminiscent of Citizen Kane. I would have preferred a straightforward telling of this story. If you're looking for something more to the point, I suggest RKO 281. Liev Scheiber is amazing as Orson Welles and John Malkovich is a fine Mank."
MANK,8 February 2021,5/10,"The problem with this film is that. There is nothing happening, I mean nothing no drama, nothing.Part from story about someone who is to write a script, between being drunk, parties, etc.Do I want to see it again, no I do not."
MANK,5 December 2020,10/10,"Mank has made my top three fincher movies. everything in this movie was done right, from screenplay to cinematography to actings. oh dear lord, the actings. all freaking top class. Fincher is a mastermind in writing characters and he has proven it once again. I also wanna give credit to Tuppence Middleton, an amazing RISING STAR whom I followed since Sense8.but back to the movie, I feel like fincher is showing the bright and dark side of hollywood. a corrupt side which are filled with liars and hypocrites. but fincher wants to show, despite the liars and scumbags, there are people like Herman J. Mankiewicz, who tries and tries. writes well and lives like us, he drinks, he is full of emotions and he is faced with many roadblocks... but the director here wants us to see that in this dark chaotic hollywood, there is a light and glory which Mank reached.Overall, great job, sir.as long as people like you keep writing, us, cinephiles are in for a ride. thank you."
MANK,28 February 2021,4/10,"Great cast, big budget, fantastically lit and filmed, wonderful sets and costumes - not enough. Meandered and crawled along, looking stunning but saying nothing. Oh - and the sound???? They all sounded like they were stood in a (large) biscuit tin - the outdoor segment with Seyfried stood on the wooden pyre talking to Mank - there was ECHO on the dialogue - bizarre. In fact the more I think about it, the more disappointed I realise I was."
MANK,16 December 2020,6/10,"This is an old classic Hollywood movie about making movies.No character has any redeeming qualities except for Marion Davies.Very depressing and sad movie you might need to take a shower afterwards.Unfortunately, the main theme of power and greed consuming our lives perfectly matches our current societyWatching depressing movies during our current economic depression is just a waste of time."
MANK,21 March 2021,10/10,"Ok, the story's just might not for everyone, but everything in this movie is outstanding. The direction, the cinematography, the art direction, the cast, the music, the dialogues. Man, this is how you make a great movie."
MANK,22 May 2021,2/10,"I couldn't finish watching this movie because it's boring and plotless. It features some top tier actors, but they play lazily at best. There's no drive. All there there is to watch is some smalltalk between supposed Hollywood stars of the past. The movie is shot in black and white, which is probably to emphasize the period. But it adds nothing to the movie. It just looks outdated because of that. So, all in all, I see no good reason to watch this movie."
MANK,10 September 2021,4/10,"I get that it was Fincher's father's script and that makes it a very personnal endeavour.I have a lot of respect for the classics, gary oldman's acting, and david fincher's talent.But i call this self indulgence.Just like bjork and radiodhead did before, mr Fincher made a movie for himself and not the audience.Thk god garbage netflix was behind this.That a sure way to alienate a lot of people, choose a very niche film school subject, add an actor that's barely comprehensible throughout the whole flick (he's drunk 30's style), the absence of fincher's trademark visual genius, and bore the tears out of your audience.3 points for quotes from cervantes and 1 point for having a title.A movie few will care about, I'm afraid."
MANK,8 December 2020,9/10,"""You cannot capture a man's entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.""Mank is a cinephiles wet dream, a poignant, incredibly sophisticated look at Herman Mankiewicz's career, social life and relationship with Orson Wells with a career-best performance from Gary Oldman and a screenplay so good it's practically guaranteed to win at this years academy awards.The thing that surprised me most about Mank is it's incredibly dense look at the Hollywood system and chokehold over creative freedom and political bias. What I believe to be the absolute best aspect of Mank is the incredible and fitting use of flashbacks to key elements in Mank's life as he is dealing with new struggles brought to him by Orson Wells. As for the film's depiction of Wells, yes, I do believe he has definitely been vilified a tad, however, neither Wells nor Mankiewicz are alive to defend who really wrote Citizen Kane, so we will never know the validity of the events of the film. As for if the film gave me any new thoughts to the meaning of Citizen Kane, yes, it did give me a whole new potential perspective on what the film is really saying and who Mankiewicz is trying to portray with his characters. I think most fascinating of which is what Mankiewicz says about William Randolph Hearst in the film and there incredibly telling conversation in the third-act.The performances here are top-notch. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Herman Mankiewicz is absolutely unbelievable. I believe he's in every scene of this film and he kept my eyes completely glued to the screen throughout the entire runtime. Oldman's performance here might be a career-best and he should get some serious oscar attention; I honestly think a second oscar might be in Oldman's future and I wouldn't be opposed to that at all. I know that Amanda Seyfried's performance has been getting a lot of discussion, I think with her small screentime she is indeed fantastic. Her charisma and charm here are unmatched with the rest of the cast and she's a definite scene-stealer, however, I do not know if she will be getting the best actress oscar that many people seem to think is a guarantee. However, I must give a huge shout out to Tom Burke who not only sounds freakishly like Orson Wells but has an incredibly similar likeness to him, it was uncanny. As for the rest of the supporting cast, they were all truly great there was no weak link within the cast, everyone should be incredibly proud of what they've done here.No matter your thoughts about the film itself, what everyone will undeniably agree with is that the film looks fantastic, the cinematography here is my favourite so far this year. The black and white and 40's aspect to the feel of the film add so much to the atmosphere of the film and Mankiewicz's mental state. There is a scene in particular on election night were Herman and crew go to a nightclub and Herman goes in and out of an altered state of consciousness, the way it was portrayed was seriously incredible.As for the screenplay written by the late Jack Fincher, (the father of the film's director David Fincher), it was by far the standout element of this entire film. What Fincher is saying here is very interesting stuff, however, if you are not knowledgeable about the film industry or the film Citizen Kane, you will have a really hard time getting the most out of this film. Thankfully, I like to think I'm pretty knowledgeable about both subjects so I really got a lot out of the film. The dialogue here especially is so smooth and sharp, some of the comebacks here are truly hilarious.In finality, Mank did not disappoint. What David Fincher and crew were able to make here is really astounding, I recommend you all go watch Citizen Kane again and have a quick read about the state of the film industry during the great depression, then go watch Mank and get the absolute most out of this incredible film."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"Oh boy, what a film this was. It's been a real long time since a film has managed to ""touch"" or ""capture"" emotions on so many different levels. It is an astonishing, mesmerizing film that has the ability of keeping the audience ""glued"" to the screen. Whether you have the opportunity of seeing ""MANK"" in cinemas or not, it will still get to your heart either way, because that's how good it is. It is an enchanting, thrilling drama that although might not be for the ""average"" viewer, it is still worth the watch. The writing, acting and directing in this film were absolutely soul-touching and (almost) perfect. With such a well written dialogue, ""MANK"" manages to keep the viewer at the edge of their seat, always making them wonder on what's about to come next. It is a puzzle well shot, well directed, but most importantly, it is well told. Although at some point it might get fuzzy and confusing, it all gets clearer as the film gets to its grand finale.
David Fincher is back after 6 years of a totally deserved and well earned break from Hollywood and somehow, despite the circumstances, he finds an absolutely beautiful way of returning to the director's chair. In terms of direction, ""MANK"" is a new and different approach from Fincher that actually worked perfect for the film. There are some amazing shots that only an artist like Fincher could have pulled it off. It is such a privilege to witness him at work, as every single scene in this particular film(and not only) is a pure masterpiece. Each scene is so well directed and shot that you can't help but want more. It truly is one of his finest work yet, a marvellous homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood.
As for the cast, well... what is there left to say? Gary Oldman delivers yet another stunning performance as the alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who desperately tries to finish the screenplay for Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"", an absolute gem. Each and every single that he is in is simply out of this world. His acting skills are brilliant once again and I truly believe that with this latest performance, he proves that he is one of the greatest actors of all time. His accent, his way of speaking, his movement and his personality is nothing but perfect in this particular film. Oldman's portrayal of the infamous screenwriter is one for the ages. The acting he delivered at Hearst's dinner party at the very end of the film was simply outstanding. On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried portrayed the stunning Marion Davies in such a unique and beautiful way that truly deserves some recognition. Her character is very important to the story and she managed to do justice to her character by delivering an amazing performance. Lily Collins, Tom Pelphrey and the other actors also delivered some fine performances, contributing to the brilliance of the final product.
The cinematography in this film was simply out of this world. It was unreal and so, so good and well crafted. With the film being shot in b&w, it feels like a time machine transporting you to a classy cinema back in the '30s, which is something really hard to achieve, but somehow, the crew managed to do so. The scenes are well shaped and there are some particular moments throughout the film that simply take your breath away, that's how astonishing the cinematography was.
On the whole, I personally loved every second of ""MANK"". Fincher proves once more that he is a one of a kind artist and that he can't make a bad film. This is truly a masterpiece that in the years to come will be seen as one of David Fincher's finest work. Oldman and Seyfried have a brilliant on screen chemistry and of course, they bring their share of magic to the film. For a one of a kind experience, I truly enourage you to see ""MANK"" as soon as possible."
MANK,10 December 2020,9/10,....that is obviously a lot smarter than many of the reviewers here.
MANK,6 December 2020,7/10,"Mank was definitely my most anticipated movie of the year. David Fincher is one of favorite directors of all time. Any movie that he makes, I'm gonna be watching. The concept of the film sounded deeply interesting too. A David Fincher movie about the creation of the most influential movie ever made and starring Gary Oldman. It was also made in the style of a 40s movie. Sounds amazing. However, while Mank definitely had some positive qualities, all in all, it was a bit disappointing.Let's start with the good. From a technical standpoint, the movie is phenomenal. The beautiful and creative cinematography, the immaculate editing, the set design, the costumes are all utterly astounding. We should expect no less from Fincher at this point who has consistently proven to be masterful at technical achievements.Gary Oldman also gives a great performance. He completely disappears into the role, and it's not hard to forget that it's Gary Oldman who is playing Mankiewicz.The movie is also very unique, surprising, and ambitious. However, I'm afraid it's one of those movies that you can more appreciate than actually like.The movie feels inconsequential and insignificant a lot of the time. I love dialogue heavy movies (when done right), but some of the scenes in this movie just get downright tedious. The film's pace is, for lack of a better word, a bit meandering. The movie gets more and more repetitive as it goes on.Being a big fan of Citizen Kane, I did enjoy the scenes of him writing the movie. But at the end of the day, did I learn anything THAT interesting about the making of the movie? No. Was I thoroughly invested in everything that was going on. Unfortunately not.Add to that, the film also can get incredibly confusing, as it assumes the audience has knowledge of this era's film industry and politics. A lot of the time, I just didn't care because the film never really communicated to me why I should care. This can make some of the movie feel emotionally shallow.However, I did love the stylistic concept of it all. It was a good love letter to the golden age of Hollywood. Also, the ways in which the movie replicates the structure of Citizen Kane... while talking about the structure of Citizen Kane, is brilliant.This movie is commendable, bold, and utterly impressive in many ways, but it's not enough to save this movie from feeling like a disappointment. At the end of the day, it's a movie I can respect more than actually enjoy.7/10"
MANK,10 December 2020,7/10,"What an interesting choice to display a black and white movie in 2020 on a streaming platform as big as Netflix. The decision certainly shows some bravery from the director and the producers.
The plot was quite thrilling, dealing with a subject that many people are not familiar with. The story is based on some real-life characters and I guees the conflicts are also true. The 30s were a special period in the history of film industry and the film portraites some exciting conflicts and the main characters are somewhat defined.
The acting was on-point, I really loved Gary Oldman's performance, it was the level of acting that fit perfectly in the movie. I was not impressed by Amanda Seyfried's acting.
The images and the scenery were great, there was a lot of effort put in the way the scens looked to match those years and I think that they really managed to send us into that period.
Overall, It was a fine movie, but quite static and not so engaging."
MANK,6 December 2020,10/10,Even those tiny bottles act well in this movie. There's nothing more to say.
MANK,11 January 2021,4/10,"This could have been so much better, quite disappointing."
MANK,9 December 2020,6/10,"I was eager to see this when I read it was in production, and just like that it appeared on Netflix. So immediately I pressed play and let it roll. Immediately I was a bit disheartened. I almost felt like I was eve-dropping on a movie that wasn't made for me(us), as if I wasn't in on the joke. Sure, it's marvelous looking as you'd expect from Fincher, but I prefer him more hard-boiled and hurtful. This was a collage of moments that may be Hollywood mythos, but to me I just didn't care. Apparently his late father wrote it and yes, I get that that's Fincher's agenda here. However, Citizen Kane isn't exactly Spielberg for most, and I'd say this falls into the special interest category. As one reviewer wrote here, we'd much prefer Mindhunters Season 3. Oh well. If only for the photography I liked it. Did I connect to it? No."
MANK,21 November 2020,9/10,"""This is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory. What he bought still belongs to the man he who sold it. That's the real magic of the movies.""David Fincher puts it all on the line in his latest film, Mank. The result is a gorgeous and heartfelt film that takes the viewer back to 1930's-40's Hollywood.Gary Oldman is great as the cynical, alcoholic writer who has no filter and rarely has anything nice to say. He is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast that makes each scene and interaction truly enjoyable. It is obvious that everyone involved in this project, took thier roles seriously.This is a much different film than the gritty, violent, and dark pictures Fincher has become known for. However, the attention to detail, editing, gorgeous cinematography, and use of lighting and sound is still as effective as ever.I expect Mank to be popular when the Academy Award nominations are announced, as it deserves."
MANK,4 December 2020,8/10,A very good film and for those in love with the cinematic arts and why citizen Kane is held in such grand esteem this film will really be for you. David Fincher direction and shot angles in Orson Wells style are genius considering the subject. The acting is superb but it does drag on a bit but maybe that is in homage to citizen Kane . I can hope the only Oscar for this film goes to the screen writer ( Jack Fincher). Just as citizen Kane only went to the title character . Though Gary old man surly deserves a recognition or his stellar Performance . Highly recommend if you respect citizen Kane for the masterpiece it is.
MANK,13 March 2021,3/10,Lacking plot and just plain boring. Even Oldman and Seyfried's brilliant-as-always acting could not save it. Netflix needs to stop making these self-indulgent 2+ hour films.
MANK,27 April 2021,5/10,"This is one of those movies where nothing really happens until the very end but for the rest of this movie, it is just 2 hours of people monologueing.It is interesting monologue for sure, it's a good script but if nothing happens in the story, a good script means nothing. It felt like just a string of scenes which in a vacuum are all well acted with great shots but put together, it is extremely boring and self indulgent.There were many times in this movie where I had to pause because I just got bored. Such a disappointing film."
MANK,15 November 2020,8/10,"Mank is a great movie that not everyone will be able to digest. Everything is so well shot and made in this film. From the cinematography to the acting to the script, everything just blends together perfectly. Mank is one of the best films of 2020 and as of now is in the race for Best Picture. Highly recommend this film to anyone who loves movies, the making of movies, and Citizen Kane.
Is this as good as Citizen Kane?
Not even close, but a great film none the less"
MANK,24 April 2021,5/10,"A little review of tomorrow's Oscar nominee 2021, movie about Orson Welles' 1941 movie ""Citizen Kane"", that will undoubtedly win some awards, because Hollywood traditionally likes to award second-rate films about some other good films, which is in due time failed to reward, with excellent Gary Oldman as Herman Mankiewicz, screenwriter of ""Citizen Kane"".In short, to make a film, how different than of course black & white, because it talks about the period in which only such existed (luckily at that time at least they were tonal, because otherwise, according to such logic, we would probably get a silent one?), with copying each a shot that Welles ever shot (but with occasional insertions of totally inappropriate ones, with a counter-light, because it's so modern nowadays), about a character who was really fantastically played by Oldman, who only gets all the praise for this average achievement . Unfortunately, the character he interprets in some Golden Age movies could at best be only supporting one, if at all interesting enough to be immortalized on the movie screen. But, oh-my-god, those are the times.The lead actor is the only reason why this film is worth watching. In this it bears a resemblance to its competitor ""The Father,"" with Anthony Hopkins, also in the lead role. From an interesting idea, but extremely unsuccessfully realized, we can only admire, or not, the proven actors.Honestly, I regret that such an achievement comes from David Fincher, director of such movies as e.g. Was (with all its flaws) the cult ""Fight Club,"" but apparently the prevailing idea was that the line of least resistance was the shortest shortcut for Hollywood. We'll see soon enough."
MANK,14 December 2020,7/10,"The making of Citizen Kaine -- and William Randolph Hearst's efforts to suppress the film -- are fascinating topics, but somehow all gets lost in a meandering, unfocused script.In addition, Gary Oldman is badly miscast as Mank, who was some twenty years younger at the time of these events than the actor here portraying him. Oldman also lacks charisma in the role.Amanda Seyfried -- as usual, the best thing in a movie in which she appears -- shines as Marion Davis, but again her part here amounts to little.On the positive side, the mise en scene and black-and-white cinematography are superb and more than adequate to the task of transporting contemporary viewers out of the miseries of Trump World and back to the miseries of the Great Depression, Hollywood-style.In sum, classic movie fans will have to consider Mank a swing and a miss..."
MANK,30 October 2021,8/10,"Gary Oldman can make any movie Oscar nominated. BUT! This movie works without the Oldman extras. Every single member of the cast gave their best and made a movie that will be mentioned for a long time.It's hard to make a black and white movie nowadays that can keep the interes of the audience (I'm also one of those members who don't really like them), not to mention the long running time of it but when you start this film, you won't notice and it's already at the end. It also made me forget that theirs no color."
MANK,11 December 2020,7/10,"It's not really about the characters - it's about Hollywood history, Hollywood paying homage to itself, and if you're not a Hollywood history buff, it really isn't about much else.Also, there's a scene with a woman typing topless (except for sequins covering her nipples) in an office full of fully dressed men that was completely unnecessary."
MANK,6 December 2020,2/10,"Dramatically inert, confusing and boring. Too many of the characters pass in and out of the film with only the most cursory introductions. Amanda Seyfried, at least, brought humanity and warmth to a movie infuriatingly deficient in everything but outstanding cinematography. A self-indulgent, pretentious mess."
MANK,7 December 2020,4/10,"I love Black + White films but this wouldn't have been any different if it was in colour. It's one of the most boring films made. So disappointed. How did Gary Oldman get roped into this bland, long winded, flat bore-fest. It must be for an audience 80 years +"
MANK,14 April 2021,8/10,"This film, very particular and not commercial, certainly offers some interesting historical / cultural ideas but above all it highlights some of its characteristics, such as the color in black and white and the style of the 1930s films, which it means straight to the Oscars with his 10 nominations.Appreciated the interpretation of the protagonist, Gary Oldman, possible winner, as well as the costumes, cinematography and direction.These are my bets."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"Mank is a good movie !!
The cinematography was great"
MANK,2 January 2021,9/10,"I didn't know what to expect when I heard about this movie. Citizen Kane makes my top 10 all time films, and David Fincher occupies two slots on that same list, so I had to see this film. On first viewing my expectations and reality collided, but I wasn't disappointed. On second viewing, the film is far more enjoyable. I definitely would give this best picture for this year, but the academy will surely mess that up too."
MANK,15 November 2020,10/10,Fincher does it ! A amazing 2020 movie ! He succeeded in bringing an amazing story to screen.
MANK,5 December 2020,1/10,"This is a dreary, poorly lit, murky drudge of a visual exercise, painful to watch . Each scene is worse than the next, with dark, fake, annoying backlighting...indistinct faces in shadows, people sitting in dark rooms with distracting lamp-lights and false window lighting everywhere. It is tiring just to look at such mud-splash cinematography. And then there's the casting choices. Not one character is believable, likable, or even unlikable to any dramatic effect. In general everyone is a cartoon or a a buffoon. Early on there is an absurd scene with LB Mayer walking and talking to the two Manks about his "" three rules"". The scene is so absurd and out of place you might expect Monty Python to interrupt and stop the sketch. The story is underserved by a script saturated with cliches. It parodies old Hollywood instead of evoking it. But actual parody is too high praise. It bores. Same with the soundtrack - a mish-mash of tired jazz riffs that only intensify the cartoonishness of it all. I feel bad for all the true-to-life folks this movie portrays. They deserve a much better film."
MANK,24 April 2021,8/10,This film is very well made with the cinematography being some of David finchers best. The style and score is interesting and new and really worked with the plot. This brings me onto the plot which I found not very gripping and overall quite slow.the acting from Garry oldmen and Amanda seyfried was phenomenal and very much was worthy of all the praise they have received.but really when this film in my opinion shines is it's amazing editing and purely just from that I would recommend it too anyone to watch.
MANK,11 December 2020,5/10,"A tiring film, without a shred of soul in it. Nothing in it from the troubled times of those years from which a masterpiece like ""Citizen Kane"" was born. Gary Oldman gives the impression that he is reciting on an amateur theater stage, without any trace of credibility, and he looks like a jester lost in the court of an equally embarrassing ""king"" of the press. And too often it seemed to me that I saw Zorg from the ""Fifth Element"" teleported to a caricatured Los Angeles ..."
MANK,4 December 2020,,"Arguably one of the most beautiful bw films oat. It reads as a memoriam to his father, and a love letter to cinema. Mank, is Fincher's Silence*. Fincher's attention to detail has never been more noticeable. So supposedly 50% of the people watching this wouldn't guess that Fincher Directed it? Literally everything (minus the story) screams Fincher... Actors giving their careers best performance.... wallpaper, artwork, hats, pens, lamps (all era specific) extras giving credited* worthy performances.... cinematography. . impossible to improve upon... what ever $300,000 camera Fincher's DP uses... 3 years in post ... no less than 20 takes per scene.. It's all there, and it's awe inspiring. Its something to view, not watch. Take in at face value, rate the making of documentary higher. Its a slice of life film, assembled as a feature. Lacking plot, but not prestige. This is not an art film. What is art?"
MANK,22 December 2020,,"I've written a few things in my life, and I can affirm that writing is a peculiar business. To me (Spartacus Super Bowl), writing something original feels like living underwater for hours at a stretch. Two films I kind of like have tried to represent writers' processes: Capote and Mank. It doesn't really work out in either case.Writing is a peculiar business and not necessarily dramatically intriguing. While you can show how the writer is developing his material (Capote interviewing Perry Smith, and Mankiewicz jestering Hearst), you can't really show where their desire is leading their literary art. What vision of the infinite are the writers pursuing? Neither film really assays that inquiry--that isn't really film art, it's the definition of literature.Mank pushes the actual writing offstage for the most part, and uses a lot of its run time on a political subplot that seems like it was thrown in to make the film relevant to 2020. It doesn't quite figure out the relationship with Marion Davies, either, and that's the most attractive element in the film. It comes across as kind of boring, a long harangue by an angry drunk whose script takes a nasty shot at a woman who didn't deserve the scorn. That's something Mank and Capote share: they are stark and uncomplimentary depictions of the nasty consequences of the drinking life.I'm glad Fincher made Mank because it looks and sounds fantastic, and I suppose it's appropriate that a movie about writing a movie would fail in part because of the writing. Writing is a peculiar business."

Its Definitely Worth Watching
It Gives You The Feeling Of What It's Like Watching A 1930s Film
It's Got A Good Story And
It's Very Extraordinary Not Bad For Director Dave Fincher"
MANK,15 March 2021,8/10,"It's hard not to get your hopes up and not to be disappointed when you wait months to see a David Fincher movie about Citizen Kane, done in perfect Wellsian style and with great performances, and yet... the story just isn't compelling enough, and the attempt to take credit away from Welles seems like a pointless way to end the movie..."
MANK,16 December 2020,1/10,"Being over 80, I am conversant with such personalities as Irving Thalberg, Louis B. Mayer, Mankiewicz himself, David O. Selznick, William Randolph Hearst, Orson Welles etc., and I thought I would be watching a wonderful film about all these personalities. The film, however, was extremely badly planned and assembled, resulting in an almost unwatchable, and totally boring movie. In my book, a good movie is one that I'd be able to watch and enjoy repeatedly. This is not one of them.Emphatically not recommended."
MANK,10 December 2020,5/10,"Mank is David Fincher's new film starring Gary Oldman and is about legendary Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz.I think everyone, including myself, expected a lot from this movie because it's directed by the great David Fincher and the problem is, we expected too much from a movie that is just good but boring.The worst thing about the movie is its story that jumps from one part to another without trilling to delve into any of these stories, then it ends up getting boring because we are not really following any story but parts of Mank's life. I think another flaw in the story is that it shows nothing of Mank and Orson Welles' relationship until the end where they fight.I also think that the best thing about the film is its photography because it pays homage to the cinema of that time and apart from that homage in photography it also makes a critique of the film business of the time.The performances are good but Gary Oldman is by far the best and could win the Oscar.In short it is a good movie but it is disappointing."
MANK,6 December 2020,9/10,"Whenever they try to recreate these... shall I say Hitchcockian type of films, it's always a little disappointing. But not this time. The scores were right on the money, as was the point of view and the editing. The mannerisms, wardrobe and scripting.. the way the story is told.. Everything about it made me feel like this was a legit oldie."
MANK,18 December 2020,9/10,Really enjoyed it. Kept me intrigued throughout. Great characters and shot so well. Felt like you were watching an old classic. Would recommend.
MANK,29 April 2021,3/10,"A grand production, clever dialogue, and great casting cannot overcome a boring script. The screenplay didn't present a leading character we could care about. Mank comes across as yet another spoiled artiste, who got everything he wanted and was still mad about it.The movie came across as disjointed, pretentious, and self-congratulatory."
MANK,20 April 2021,6/10,MASTERPIECE. GOOD PERFORMANCES. NICE COLOURS... not!
MANK,18 December 2020,5/10,"This is a strange one. It's a very well made film, with good performances and some great dialogue, especially in the set piece scenes, but I just found it... flat.I'm very familiar with Citizen Kane. I studied screenwriting. I love Upton Sinclair and find the politics discussed in Mank as fascinating as that particular period in Hollywood. Even the knowledge of these elements, without which the plot could easily be lost on the audience, wasn't enough to bring the story to life.A couple of other reviewers have described it as a chore to watch, and, unfortunately, I have to agree.I'll try again in a couple of months, maybe."
MANK,20 January 2021,8/10,"Found it helped knowing the characters that Mank might have based his on for the screenplay for Citizen Kane.
Great black and white photography and performances throughout."
MANK,2 May 2021,1/10,"""Mank"", is a 2020 film, where the only positive qualities are solely in Gary Oldman's brilliant acting as the writer of the 1941 film, ""Citizen Kane"", Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the ending. It's a good ad of ""Mank"" trying to mention that it's a development of the classic 1941 film, ""Citizen Kane"", to lure the audience where you expect with high anticipation to see a recreation of the elaborate and well publicized story of the making of Citizen Kane including the controversy of the screenwriting credit between Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz and in addition, the problematic release of the film as William Randolph Hearst tried to use everything in his power to avoid the release of ""Citizen Kane"" due to the main character, Charles Foster Kane, being based on the success and scandals of Hearst.Unfortunately, none of that juicier story of the making of Citizen Kane is included as ""Mank"" solely focuses on Herman J. Mankiewicz and his development of his script, Citizen Kane, while including a timeline filled with flashbacks and the present time of where the film takes place. While Gary Oldman plays the character of Mankiewicz with authenticity (which rightfully earned him a nomination at the Oscars 2021), the plot falls flat to boredom with nothing interesting happening. Its even a shame when Mankiewicz is not even a likeable character as most of the time we see him drunk. Orson Welles briefly appears and its only when both Welles and Mankiewicz interact where the movie actually becomes interesting but that is disappointingly near the ending.Now there are films that have being based upon directors along with the crew and the problematic but fascinating stories about the making of a movie where they have been recreated in memorable films such as Ed Wood (1994 film) and The Disaster Artist (2017 film). ""Mank"", unfortunately fails to create an impactful plot and most of the time you are wondering when the film is almost over. A clever story would have been having a plot involving Orson and Mankiewicz and their conflict in making the script and also the challenges in releasing the movie due to Hearst's opposition. In ""Mank"", the whole plot feels like a filler, the characters do not have any impact on the plot nor are they memorable and Marion Davies (played by Amanda Seyfried) does barely in the film other than introducing Mankiewicz to her lover, Hearst. Mamma Mia! The film does introduce Hearst, but its not until near the end where Mankiewicz tells the Citizen Kane story to Hearst which greatly offends him (and where the film actually becomes interesting to watch). But that's it, ""Mank"", then goes to show the outcome of the Citizen Kane film, where both Orson and Mankiewicz win the Oscar for best script but we don't see the juicier story which was Hearst trying to prevent the film from being release.You also can tell that a film like ""Mank"" flops when after the film you nor the audience talk about the film except for its flaws. Unlike, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"", which has a powerful message that leaves the audience to think deeply and to talk about the film's plot and the characters, ""Mank"" just leaves the audience to wonder why are they not watching Citizen Kane, instead.While praise on ""Mank"" can be given to its production design, costume design, cinematography and the directing style of David Fincher, none of the decorations can save the film solely because the script is bad. Like a legendary director, Akira Kurosawa, once said and I quote, ""With a good script, a good director can produce a masterpiece. With the same script, a mediocre director can produce a passable film. But with a bad script even a good director can't possibly make a good film."" And ""Mank"" clearly fits that example in Kurosawa's quote."
MANK,30 January 2021,5/10,I love the movie Citizen Kane and had high hopes for this one. It was just ok. Nothing special or memorable about this movie. Certainly not worth a best picture nominee which there are rumblings of. Course this is the type of movie academy voters like. Artsy fluff. Swing and a miss on this one.
MANK,13 December 2020,8/10,I found it quite fascinating how the cinematography of Old Hollywood was represented in this movie. Fincher does a brilliant job at recreating Citizen Kane's significant film elements as well as the sounds of the 1940s. Fincher's obsession with detail is very apparent from the start. I will admit that my confusiong with som details left me distracted but still I watched it from the start until the end with the utmost attention.
MANK,22 March 2021,2/10,"While I had high hopes for this one, Fincher absolutely disappointed me.Their is no plot. Its all jumbled together, as the screenwriter himself didnt know where to go with this film.
You have to have SO MUCH background information/ knowldege that you just dont understand anything if youre not familiar with Welles/ Mankiewicz etc.All in all, a total underwhelming, absolutely boring and disastrous, but somehow well crafted/ played drama about a story nobody cares about."
MANK,14 December 2020,6/10,"Sharpest dialogue heard on the screen in years, mesmerizing cinematography and certainly Oscar caliber acting especially by Oldman. So why is it so dull and hard to get through? For an equally brilliant and thankfully entertaining portrayal of early Hollywood see Ed Wood or Barton Fink instead."
MANK,5 March 2021,7/10,"Like basiclly everyone else, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and, yes I know I'm a little late, but I really wanted to share my thoughts on it non-the-less( I even rewatched Citizen Kane ). And now I think I'm at a point where I can write a review about it without making it 10 pages long.One of my first thoughts on it was that, the film was somewhere between boring and entertaining, and by this I mean that it had just enough action not to be boring and enough politics not to be interesting. Speaking of witch I was surprised by just how much of the movie was dedicated to politics and also by how well it was recived ( I'm pretty shore I'm not the only one how remembers how much everyone hated the politics in the Star Wars prequals ). Also am I the only one how thinks that Lilly Collins should have goten a Golden Globe nod for this role, rather than Emily in Paris ?All-in-all, it's ok at best, and I'm going to be so mad it it wins best picture , not only because this year had much better films ( Nomadland, The Trial of the Chicago 7 ,Tenet, Promising young woman and many more ), but also because it's at least 10 times inferioer than the movie it's suposed to be about, and as you might know Citizen Kane didn't win best picture ( but wining/ getting nominated more oscars than the movie / actor/ however in the movie making buissnes it's portraing has been a trend recently so IDK what to think will happen )
As I said, I felt a bit underwelmed ."

On the other hand, the dialog dealing with anti-Upton Sinclair propaganda films couldn't have been timed any better. After all, if you repeat a lie often enough, it is still just a repeated lie."

MANK,8 December 2020,4/10,"An overrated movie. You can almost hear David Fincher screaming at each frame ""Give me my Oscar"""
MANK,10 December 2020,9/10,"As I'm reading J. Hoberman's ""An Army of Phantoms"", it's quite fascinating to see persons that are subject in the book be beatured on the big screen. Albeit a bit fictionalized, it takes place before the events in the book. Back in the day, politics shaped movies way more than they do now. (Although there are examples of this happening to appease certain nations in the world.) Propaganda in movies to shape the public's mind is something only Herman J. Mankiewicz frowns upon in Mank.It took me longer to watch because I had to keep consulting Google and IMDB for the period correct mentions of events and persons. I left the movie not only better informed about how Citizen Kane came to be written, the impression I now have of the people involved helps me to humanize them. They're no longer just names on a page for me. The magic of the movies.One has to mention the thorough effort to establish the particular sense of nostalgia for the 80-year old setting. They way it is filmed brings forth the unmitigated sense that this is a passion project. David Fincher did not hold back turning this era-defining story into this skillful product, although I do feel sorry for the actors having to go through multiple takes to reach his defenition of perfection. (Stanley Kubrick-flashbacks anyone?).However, that leaves us with a picture that has accomplished acting, remeniscant of old Hollywood that is neither glamorous nor dismissive. If you love movies, this is a perfect addition to your ""Must Watch""-list."
MANK,19 April 2021,5/10,"Let's be clear, 'Mank' is a film made by cinephiles, for cinephiles. All of the wonderful production design, cinematography and stylistic craftsmanship in the world can't disguise this film's verbosity, its self-indulgence and its almost willful inaccessibility at times.Even as someone who is genuinely interested in many of the issues Fincher delves into - the process of screenwriting, the history of 'Citizen Kane' and Hollywood studios in the 30s/40s, and the political atmosphere surrounding figures like Upton Sinclair - I found this film utterly tedious at times. Being a fan of filmmakers such as Lynch and Carruth, I will never reproach a film for being unconventional, niche or 'difficult', as long as there is a point to such decisions. 'Mank', however, often seems wrapped up in its irreverent witticisms, knowing nods and elaborately constructed conversations to the point of distraction. You can almost feel the self-congratulation at points, and the fact that Oldman occasionally manages to break through the cinematic miasma and produce a laugh (a dinner scene involving white wine and fish leaps to mind), makes the end product all the more frustrating, as it provides a sense of what this film could have been without needless ostentation.The film's snappy final scenes, and indeed its final lines, are emblematic of what I believe Fincher envisioned for 'Mank': an intelligent, witty and at times scathing send up of a dramatic episode in Hollywood's history that has provoked much debate in the long years since. In some aspects it certainly makes steps towards that, with certain interactions and conversations, aside from providing obvious satirical overtones concerning contemporary issues, gifting refreshing takes on characters from the era as well as the struggle for creative recognition when it came to 'Citizen Kane'. These moments however are subsumed by so much that feels superfluous, and despite the solid performances from Oldman, Seyfried, Dance and others, the lush visuals and the accomplished cinematography, it feels, rather ironically, that these problems stem from the script. Much of the interactions between Seyfried's Marion Davis and Oldman's Mankiewicz, its broader attempts to intertwine the latter's life with the politics of the era and flourishes involving the lives of characters such as Rita Alexander are all emblematic of this, ultimately ending up as dead weight.I can't help but think of how much more I enjoyed Tarantino's explorations of Hollywood's past in 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood'. I know, I know, very different films, very different eras of reference, and very different directors, a comparison many might label redundant. However, Tarantino's film balances style, substance and individual flair whilst delving into Hollywood's past, unquestionably deserving its 'Best Picture' nod. Fincher's film on the other hand suffocates under its own weight, and whilst you can't blame him for the Academy's fawning and self-obsession, it is a real shame that a Best Picture contender with 9 other nominations will most likely prove a turn off for the majority of viewers, pushing them away rather than towards this period of history and cinema. The overreaction from the Academy is almost a sad testimony to Mank's stereotypical 'Oscar darling' traits: bloated, self-indulgent and esoteric in its Hollywood interests.I must agree with critics such as Mark Kermode that in many areas 'it's fine', however 'what could have been', was the dominant phrase left floating in my mind at the conclusion of 'Mank', along with a nagging sense of boredom. You get that feeling that in homage to its namesake, the film will find relative obscurity follows it Oscar success..."
MANK,7 December 2020,2/10,"Boring and miscast. Boring and miscast,l. Boring and miscast. Boring and miscast."
MANK,15 December 2020,6/10,"I am very split about this movie. On one hand it is a technical marvel and it is a pleasure to look at. Unfortunately, however, Herman Mankowitz is not that interesting of a character. The best part of the movie was the part where he felt like he was defeated (the GOP party scene), but this part was fleating in the grand scheme of things. I liked this film, but it really has its flaws."
MANK,7 December 2020,,"I'm not hear to talk about the movie because this movie is like a like a living thing; it can defend on it's behalf.
The Cinematography is perfect. Fincher is really a master and I know why every shot and every cut in this movie has it's own purpose. I think the editing is marvelous, the music reminds you of the golden age of Hollywood.
If I'm gonna say anything about this movie in one sentence it is : The closest picture of my human part which I had forgotten it for a little while...
I hope you enjoy it as I did"
MANK,24 March 2021,4/10,"I was looking forward to seeing this piece of Hollywood history that was so well received by the Oscars and so disappointed by a dull, slow moving and uneventful film."
MANK,26 November 2020,10/10,"This is a film about how we want to be seen by people and what legacy we leave behind after we're gone.This is very much unlike any of David Fincher's other films, it's a black & white Hollywood biopic character drama, that's rated PG.
Well reader, I don't quite see this as a David Fincher film, rather A Jack Fincher Film.Mank's screenplay was written sometime in the mid to late 90s by David's Father, Jack Fincher. This is Jack's one and only screenwriting credit, as he died in 2002. This is a story about a man's life slipping away and his one last creative expression which will make a legacy for him, written by a man with one last chance to try and express himself through the screenplay before passing away.David Fincher is one of our greatest living filmmakers, and once again he knocked it out of the park. With the help of Fincher's absolutely maniacal approach to directing actors, he essentially made these 21st century actors into living, breathing people alive in the 1930s and 40s.The cinematography, aside from it being cool to see a black & white film in a theatre, was just gorgeous. The lighting and shot composition were a real treat for the eyes; THE SPLIT DIOPTERS!Along with the pretty pictures and cool techy director stuff the sound mixing & score are absolutely top notch. It's incredibly hard to overstate how much this feels like being transported to the 40s and the sound and score are largely responsible for those feelings.Gary Oldman is good, I think he's too old for the part, but he's still a great actor, just nothing to write home about. The supporting players from Lily Collins, Tom Pelphrey, Charles Dance, Arliss Howard, to Tuppence Middleton and Jamie McShane; all suit their roles perfectly. A special shoutout to my boy Tom Burke, I love to see an astonishingly talented actor like him succeed in this way.
Personally, I think this films real standout, acting wise, is Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies. I've loved her as Karen from Meangirls since junior high, but I think this proved to every casting director in the biz that she is beyond talented.Without dragging this on for too long, I just wanted to say that this is a very special movie that I was beyond pleased to see in a theatre. As my mother talked about when I came home from the film; I wish my grandfather, Bill Thompson, who was a filmmaker in his own right, had been alive today to see this with me. Citizen Kane was among his favourite films and I wish I could have shared this with him.""You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.""
Herman J. Mankiewicz"
MANK,3 April 2021,3/10,"This whole film can be summarized as blah blah blah.... Citizen Kane... blah blah blah... Louis B Mayer... blah blah blah.... Upton Sinclair.... blah blah blah.... socialism... blah blah blah...William Randolph Hearst....blah blah blah. If you don't care about any of this history going in, there is nothing in this film that will make you care. Gary Oldman's acting was fine, as you'd expect and this is the only redeeming quality. Everyone else played their roles but nothing special. The only reason this is nominated for an Oscar is that Hollywood is full of vain people who love movies about themselves."
MANK,31 January 2021,6/10,What's good about this movie? Gary Oldman. That's it. Other than that it's boring and quite poor.
MANK,10 December 2020,8/10,"When watching a movie, there are many things to consider. The acting, the writing, the direction, cinematography, and what you take away from it. David Fincher's black and white masterpiece as told through his Father Jacks eyes is one of those movies. Some will find that none of those factors involve this movie , others will most certainly think they do. I knew this was going to be a subject where many people would beat it up, no one touches the great white whale and expect nobody to hate on it. I think he did an exceptional job with the cinematography on this movie, capturing the time in the movies essence at that time. Gary continues to be one of my favorite actors ever! There is also a great supporting cast. David continues to be one of my greatest Filmmakers, and I will continue to appreciate his work. We all have a right to our opinions, but sometimes you need to sit back enjoy the work. Reading a lot of these reviews, it's amazing how some people bash somebody over what their views are. When you can't step in to the head of the actual maker of the project, and enjoy it for what it is. Some will find it boring, and not as exceptional as his other work, I think he definitely stepped into an area that I can't wait to see what he does in the future."

MANK,18 March 2021,5/10,"Sure, the cinematography and production design are pretty cool in this, but beyond that there's nothing noteworthy about this movie."
MANK,5 December 2020,9/10,"At first I thought this was going to be a pretentious movie made for pretentious movie makers. Artsy black and white and obscure self referential references. There is that, but the movie does evolve into something deeper and more complex. As someone who has read all the Lanny Budd novels, any movie that brings Upton Sinclair back to the attention of Americans is worth watching. Reading the Lanny Budd novels will educate American more about the first half of the 20th Century than watching Fox News for a millennium. All the actors seem to relish their roles as real people who really existed and for better or worse impacted the world they lived in. Netflix makes a lot of trash, but there is the occasional gems such as this or Highwaymen. Like the old movies studios featured in Mank, if you make a 100 profitable trash movies/series a year you can afford to make the occasional semi-intellectual vanity product."
MANK,30 January 2021,9/10,"It's a complex and long movie but if you know the story behind and the characters story you appreciate it much more .
Really really good!"
MANK,5 December 2020,5/10,"Sorry, I don't see the compelling story here. The cinematography is very good and the acting is fine but the self indulgent thumb of the nose to narrative pacing really bothered me. I'm writing this at an hour eleven into this and I can barely keep it on. I love Gary Oldman, one of my favorites. Without him, we get a lot of ""sunlight through blinds artistically lighting me in suspenders speaking quick banter."
MANK,15 March 2021,1/10,Incoherent.Meaningless. Don't waste your time. I got nothing out of this film.
MANK,31 January 2021,8/10,"1930's Hollywood from the eyes of witty and alcoholic screenwriter of the controversial movie ""Citizine Kane"" Herman J. Mankiewicz. The struggles and the urge to race down the promised script for his livelihood. Funny, hilarious and pompous with a great sense of humor is what this movie is all about. The lazy and the a true alcoholic artist who just cannot stop himself from being himself is the true reflection of this movie. From the downfall of his career when he gets on with the owners of production houses to his calm but windy marital life. 'A true artist is he who always surrounds himself with his true elements and into his best circumstance' and Mank's best circumstance is always controversy."
MANK,12 December 2020,5/10,"David Fincher has made a name for himself with his orange-green hues and decent direction. However, this foray into B&W, despite the considerable acting talents, falls flat. It's boring. How can a film about witty, erudite Herman Mankowitz be boring? That might be because the script, despite some witticisms sprinkled throughout, becomes ponderous and the direction of the words limps instead of sings. A disappointment from modern self-absorbed Hollywood types trying in vain to duplicate the masters of past Hollywood. Sad and dull."
MANK,6 December 2020,3/10,"This movie gives Manks way too much credit when in reality, as confirmed by uncovered scripts, Orsen Wells rewrote most of Manks script for Citizen Kane. While this movie portrays Wells in the end as somewhat of a villain, in reality he was just a more talented screenwriter than Manks. The movie itself isn't bad but I cannot forgive the historical inaccuracy's."
MANK,30 December 2020,5/10,"Why would we need to understand now how citikane was written? This will never happen again, but tiktok, etc
Nice effort, but out of touch, including parables and all intelligent fencing."
MANK,8 December 2020,2/10,"I had high hopes for this movie, based on its favorable reviews, but found it slow, overly long and boring. Basically it's a character study of a boorish alcoholic who associates with an array of equally unlikeable pompous jerks. The resemblance of some of the actors to the real people is interesting but the main ""conflict"" in the movie (i.e. who really wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane) becomes a ""so what?"" issue after nearly 2 1/2 hrs. The brightest spot in this movie is Amanda Seyfried, who does a fine job portraying Marion Davies (and here again, the physical resemblance is uncanny) and an Oscar nomination for her in this role would not be undeserved. Overall though, a disappointment."
MANK,5 December 2020,1/10,"There is no story. No compelling struggles of character. No connection to today's media (Hearts to Murdoch); what a lost opportunity! Fincher is visual cartoonist. He has nothing to say. When he puts images to the script of people who do, magic happens (Social Network). When he's in charge I marvel at how tone-deaf he is to what is, and what is not, story and character.There's more creative cinematography in today's YouTube filmmakers. I could only watch 30 minutes. So take this review only as a warning to check your critical faculties at the door if you're a literate film buff. I'd rather keep my memory of the people in the film as serious filmmakers, deeply insecure all, not cardboard cutouts walking the world in complete confidence with no real-world problems."
MANK,6 February 2021,5/10,"I rarely stop watching in the middle of the movie because I figure something is going to change and the story will start being interesting. Well, after 1 full hour and nearly falling asleep I gave up. I love cinema, there were many homages etc. but overall the movie is just plain boring."
MANK,14 December 2020,5/10,"I really tried to get into this film, having seen the critical adulation heaped upon it and what with it being by David Fincher, a Director who's work is generally of a very high standard.The film does look good, and the makers have clearly put a lot of effort into aping the sound and look of Citizen Kane. At least that's what I assume is going on (it's been a few decades since I saw CK) as the aesthetic choice would be quite baffling otherwise.I personally found the look and sound quite distracting. It didn't add anything to the storytelling and instead came across as an overly self-conscious exercise. ""It's a film about the writing of Citizen Kane - and you'll never guess what we've done - we've made it look like Citizen Kane too! Aren't we clever!"". Well okay, I get it ... but ... so what?There were several moments when I found myself pondering how they'd got a particular retro effect to the imagery, rather than listening to the dialogue. Fincher's films always look good but usually it's not to the cost of the story. I didn't feel that was the case here.And when it comes to the story it's self, the characters, the plot... I don't see that there is anything of interest unless you're particularly interested in the making of Citizen Kane.Otherwise this is just a film with a bunch of characters talking about stuff that are and nothing much actually happening.Okay, so that person there is a Mayer of MGM fame. And that's the guy who wrote the greatest film of all time. And that's the guy who's meant to be the main character in the greatest film of all time. Fine. But none of that makes Mank any more interesting or engaging as a film.It's definitely a well crafted film but unless you're into Citizen Kane and interested in it's background, I doubt you'll find much of interest here."
MANK,26 January 2021,2/10,"We were excited to see this Oscar buzz film...but oh my did it lose us right off the bat! All style, no substance. We could hardly understand what the actors were saying. Some sort of foreign language or clever elitist jargon? We gave the film 10 minutes, looked at each other, and switched to something less pretentious."
MANK,21 February 2021,3/10,"Some movies aim to confuse some to wow. This one aims to be unique by using tricks that have been used before, couldn't find anything new. It's a beautiful movie but the story is only know by those that with a knowledge of the movie world otherwise it's it's quit a drag if it wasn't in black and white it would even lose its one nice touch"
MANK,6 April 2021,1/10,"THIS IS WHY VIEWERSHIP OF MOVIES IS DOWN AND SINKING RAPIDLY. THE ACADEMY AWARDS WILL SOON BE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS IF FILMS THAT ARE THIS BORING KEEP GETTING NOMINATING AND WINNING BEST PICTURE HONORS. I AM OVER EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND LOVE THE ""FLICKERS"", ESPECIALLY THE BLACK AND WHITE MASTERPIECES LIKE SUNSET BOULEVARD, HIGH NOON, WHITE HEAT, ETC. ""MANK"" DOESN'T RANK AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. EVEN AT MY AGE I STILL ENJOY GOING TO THE MOVIES BUT NOW I FIND MYSELF VISITING NETFLIX, PRIME VIDEO, HULU AND OTHER TV CHANNELS IN ORDER TO WATCH GOOD FILMS. PRESENT-DAY FARE AT MOVIE HOUSES ARE OVERPRICED JUNK, FOR THE MOST PART. YOU KNOW, I MISS WATCHING THE OSCARS ON TV BUT NOW I FEEL THAT IT IS JUST A WASTE OF FOUR OR FIVE HOURS OF MY TIME.""MANK"" FOR BEST PICTURE OF 2020? WHY NOT? SEEMS APPROPRIATE."
MANK,7 December 2020,2/10,"Who approved release of this movie? What were they thinking?The goal of Mank seems to be for talented actors like Gary Oldman to race across the stage spitting out inside Hollywood references as quickly as possible. The dialogue is strangely disconnected from the script, inflections and pacing are either missing or wrong for the content. Names of 1940's Hollywood players are pulled out of the air for a one-time impact, ie: I had dinner with ?F. Scott Fitzgerald and he said you were a drunk.
Sadly, the visuals were equally bad, like Gary Oldman stumbling and falling in a drunken stupor.
Shrill, hectic, lacking cohernce, a mess. And a waste of a lot of talent. Save yourself some grief and re-watch Once upon a Time in Hollywood."
MANK,14 December 2020,6/10,"2020 has been a dull year in cinema with very few anticipated films to release this year. However, the movies that are anticipated have been... well... disappointing such as Tenet and unfortunately -- Mank.David Fincher is one of the best working directors with fantastic films such as Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera and luckily enough, he once again went above and beyond and made this movie all the more watchable. When it was announced that David Fincher would be directing another biopic (after the hugely successful Social Network) I -- like many others -- was ecstatic. In preparation for the ""New David Fincher Film"" I went back and watched his entire catalog of films. Each of his films (with the exception of Alien 3) is HIS film -- it belongs to him. With the notable yellow/blues, wide shots, static camera and the especially intriguing material, his movies are masterpieces. Then I grew worried. Mank was sounding less and less like David Fincher's other movies. It is okay to make something new and different but I wanted more dark and suspense-filled cinema. Mank was not that -- which was not a bad thing and in fact, he pulled it off! Stylistically the movie is a masterpiece but the material felt empty and that became Mank's downfall.With a David Fincher movie it is unlikely to be disengaged yet during Mank I found myself getting distracted, antsy, and even checking the time! I was confused and disappointed. The acting was great, the directing was once again great, I did not know what it was that was causing me to be so bored, then it hit me: nothing happened. ""You cannot capture a man's life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one."" The movie was called ""Mank,"" I was expecting a thorough analysis on Mank -- but I was not even left ""the impression"" of Mank. He was an alcoholic and wrote Citizen Kane... that was really it.The directing and acting make this movie worth a 7/10. The story had potential but did not fulfill expectations. It is stylish, playful, well edited and an homage (not love letter) to 30s Hollywood making it worth a watch -- I continue to look forward to future work from David Fincher and his upcoming remake ""Strangers"".7/10"
MANK,31 May 2021,3/10,"Having heard this film had won many nominations I sat down with an open mind but was desperately disappointed. I had read nothing ahead of my viewing, so had no preconceptions about what to expect but really couldn't work out what this film was trying to do. After twenty minutes I guessed that it was trying to be Citizen Kane and then the next hour just confirmed my suspicions. Some great individual performances, with some good retro (really retro) writing but otherwise this is a total mess. People who enjoy this film will probably regard themselves as higher intellects or connoisseurs, but in reality it is a contrived mess."
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"Will it be feasible for a total genius to get his deserved recognition after finally finding his unexpected love and friendship, which pushes him to write his best script which clandestinely includes his own life, despite struggling and getting humiliated by the ignorant ""elites"" and his addiction to alcohol, 80 years later with a movie that another genius makes?It should always be... like now.This movie will become more and more valuable in your mind each day after you watch it. I am on my 2nd day and it already feels like a masterpiece...Definitely, a must-watch if you are a movie nerd :DGreat work Jack Fincher, David Fincher, and Gary Oldman.
and of course, Hermand J. Mankiewicz."
MANK,16 December 2020,5/10,"A poorly constructed movie about a topic that should have been fascinating. This story is told almost entirely in flashback, thereby breaking the cardinal rule of screenwriting: no flashbacks. Of course, the only exception to this rule is the monumental screenplay ""Citizen Kane,"" written by Mank himself! There was no compelling reason to write this movie that way whatsoever and it could've easily been told in sequence. The classic problem of writing a movie about a writer is that there is no action; the guy just sits there and types. However, in this case, it's worse: the guy actually lies down and doesn't even type- he dictates. His arms barely move. Plus he's drunk. So the screen writer faces the unsolvable problem of writing a story zero action to show on the screen. The usual answer is to say no! The second best answer is to say OK, I need the money, so I'll dig out the ""spine"" of the story by looking at the guys life. But still without the flashbacks. It's a real stumper and this movie, with that classic conundrum going against it, fails as anticipated. What a waste of Gary ""Churchill"" Oldman! I know they tried, but you would need to actually hire Orson Welles to pull this sort of thing off."
MANK,16 November 2020,10/10,"Another awesome movie by David fincher , gary oldman and Amanda Seyfried were amazing too , this movie deserves an Oscar"
MANK,7 December 2020,6/10,"Nearly the entire time I watched it I felt like I was trying my best to play along with a Jeopardy episode that only has one category: 1930s HOLLYWOOD MOVERS AND SHAKERS. You get the idea. Oh, and if you're into California politics of the the same era you're in for another treat.I watched it because I'm a fan of Gary Oldman and Fincher. I think it's a crime that ""State of Grace"" isn't on any of the billion streaming channels (my favorite Oldman role besides the ones in The Professional, True Romance, Dracula, The Fifth Element, oh, wait, I guess they're all great, but you have to check out ""State of Grace"" Maybe it'll be on Tubi Ten some day) So with all the rave reviews of Oldman's performance as Mank I was excited. And then I was bored. And if I hadn't known it already, I would've never guessed Fincher directed it. This is obviously a labor of love. His father wrote it, passed on, and what better gift from a son could you get.A great movie for the right crowd, not so much for the rest of us."
MANK,26 April 2021,8/10,"The story he tells us in Mank tells us about Herman's transition when he lost the credibility that the film industry had for him, because he did not follow political ideas and have problems with alcohol, that is why they look for him to write the script for him. Citizen Kane."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"This is a very enjoyable movie with some great writing, great acting and evocative cinematography. It is, however, difficult to get past a couple of bum notes in the production. Firstly, I'm not sure Fincher was the right director for the stylised homage. I'd love to see what the Coen Brothers would have done with this script, and what Fincher would have done with a straight period piece of the story. Secondly I think the long monologue in the costume party near the end rather spoils the pace. It tries to be whipsmart like Kane the whole way through, and the long speeches by Mank and Hearst slow the movie to a halt. Overall, it's a good film and well worth your time but like (whisper it) Citizen Kane itself, perfect it ain't."
MANK,5 December 2020,4/10,"I adore the story itself.
But how much better could this story have been if a more experienced and nuanced writer than David Fincher's father would have told it?
This movie tries to honor the screenwriters' role in filmmaking and does not include a real screenwriter? ...
Well, the shortcomings of ""Mank"" are proof of its own theme: there is no good movie without a good script. And ""Mank"" is based on on a very week script in my eyes: unfocused, clumsy, unoriginal.
How could a director, obviously attracted by the forces behind the legendary Orson Welles, make the same mistake as the subject of his inquiry? To not include the best sreenwriters (and other behind-the-camera-talents?) To instead just just rely on their own names and their own talents?... In my eyes David Ficher - a legend himself - deconstructed himself by this movie."
MANK,16 December 2020,4/10,"Actually the film disappointed me. Not interesting at all. Even it is Boring. I think this film has really nothing to say. Despite the fact that I really like classic films, biography genre and even citizen Kane movie, I did not like Mank."
MANK,19 December 2020,1/10,Thank you David Fincher for boring the hell out of me ~ Mank running time was not Se7en hours ~ even though it seemed like it ~
MANK,5 December 2020,8/10,"I gotta make a rather obvious note here that 2020 has been a sparse year for the motion picture industry (of course, in many other ways as well) and we are now, perhaps more than ever, desperate for the flickering creations of the mind-bending machinery. Nonetheless, that should not take much away from David Fincher's latest. Mank, from frame one, is pure quality.Paying homage to the dawn of the sound era in movie making by using some wonderfully updated classical techniques, while guiding us deep behind the dark scenes where Hollywood becomes even bigger and more political than what it seems like from the outside and somehow, magically managing to make the black&white picture relevant to today's whirling events. Fincher has his well-established crew on the technical side, with the likes of NIN duo, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, Erik Messerschmidt helming the camera and Kirk Baxter in the editing room. With Netflix behind his back and apparently giving him free rein he is aiming high. And does not fail to deliver.Alongside the regular team we have Gary Oldman as titular character Herman Mankiewicz, (co-) screenwriter of Citizen Kane himself, guiding us on the two-hour long journey and his meandering life moments. It is simply not easy to navigate when one moves around in such echelons blessed with wit and literacy mixed with perhaps a tad bit too much alcoh...khm...khm...confidence. So in comes the beautiful blonde, Marion Davies played by Amanda Seyfried, to aid Mank through those evil circles.Both lead actors shine spectacularly and it is most likely their best performance to date (well, we keep saying that about Oldman like every 3 years so...meh) but it is just as much fun to see familiar faces like Charles Dance, Arliss Howard or Joseph Cross popping up in smaller roles.It is a relief to finally feast our eyes on something worthy just before the end of this year when we nearly forgot there are not only Tv-shows on our home screens. Thanks to Fincher (who also has just popped back from TV) and co. there is hope for the future and after watching Mank that old flame has just been rekindled in many of our longing hearts. The flame that burns for that stinky celluloid.Verdict: 8/10
Mank is definitely one of the best pictures of the year and surely will go down as a classic in cinema history. It is the director's most mature, peerlessly painstaking and sincerely personal creation. Truly Fincher-esque."
MANK,14 February 2021,9/10,"If you find the history of Hollywood's studio era, Citizen Kane, and the Hearst Castle/media empire fascinate you as they do me, you will likely find a lot to appreciate about this film.The writing is sharp, observant, witty...a worthy homage to the snappiest scripts of the 30s and 40s. Stunning, lush black and white cinematography and an evocative orchestral score accent fantastic performances by Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried, among others. Underneath it all, a probing exploration of the socialist movement fueled by the Great Depression and the backlash from the power brokers in California lends context that is strikingly relevant today."
MANK,20 December 2020,9/10,I loved all the attention to details right down the the changeover cues.
MANK,26 April 2021,4/10,"Just because it's filmed in black and white doesn't make it arty, or thoughtful. Subplots zigzagging with little relevance to a main plot that never materialized. Zodiac was twice the movie."
MANK,5 December 2020,7/10,"Am I the only one who hard a hard time telling the male characters apart? I finally could recognize the Thalberg character and the Mayer character by the end. I generally don't mind black and white but color would have helped to be able to differentiate them, imo.I enjoyed it throughly and Gary Oldman was wonderful. The cast was first rate and Amanda Seyfried used Madonna's voice from A League of their Own and Desperately Seeking Susan"
MANK,9 December 2020,10/10,"This movie was clearly made for the Academy and not so much for the audiences. I loved the acting, I got lost in the story but still liked it a lot. I would love to see Gary Oldman and Charles Dance get Oscar nominations for that movie."
MANK,27 December 2020,3/10,I could not believe anyone is praising this boring movie.
MANK,16 December 2020,4/10,"All style and no soul. A vacuous vessel. Eminently unwatchable. Coppola discussed the pitfalls of making a pretentious film in the Doc, Hearts of Darkness, when deriding his own struggles with Apocalypse Now. A snail's pace requiring a 20 minute catnap for miraculous completion. This coming from someone quite comfortable with Kubrick's pacing; the only Director worth mention. My how the mighty have fallen; this and the Laundromat. I am not sure what Oldman is thinking these days. That movie offered gratuitous, gruesome violence out of left field not worthy of completion. Filth masquerading as art. Back to Mank. What Hollywood movie would be complete without the requisite recycled Socialist sympathies and propaganda. Nothing could be more appropriate for 2020. I will never get those 2 hour and 11 minutes of my life back. Do yourself a favor and leave it out."
MANK,4 December 2020,7/10,"After Roma and Irishman, I couldn't help it: I found Mank absolutely boring. Formally brilliant but awfully boring. Am I the only one on this planet to think this way? If it's the case, I won't write any review again, promised!"
MANK,14 February 2021,8/10,"Mank is a movie which i looked forward to watch for many reasons...To begin with the amazing cast of the movie Gary Oldman(an actor that I consider as one of the best of our era and one of my personal favourites), Amanda Seyfried, Charles Dance who are absolutely amazing and whose performances in this movie are truly special. I must admit that the performance of the talented actress Lily Collins did not satisfy me so much because of her coldness in this specific movie but I guess this role is kind of distant. I loved the fact that the movie is black and white and the combination with the great costumes made the movie realistic and gave us a taste of the 30s ambiance.The cinematography in this movie was strong since there were shots that were really beautiful and of course i must mention the extremely good direction by the very talented and famous director David Fincher. The good direction with the good-written script leads to an absolute success like Mank a movie that is predicted to earn a lot of cretid because of the strong messages it gives with an indirect way which makes the lines and the dialogues really smart."
MANK,20 November 2020,7/10,"This film is beautiful. It stands high from absolutely every stand-point. It's a masterpiece of cinematography, score and acting. Thank You Mr. Fincher and get that Oscar."
MANK,30 March 2021,9/10,If you like black and white Hollywood films you will like this. A real homage to the past. Probably slightly too long but I did watch the whole 2 hours in one go which says a lot.
MANK,29 December 2020,3/10,"Fincher prides himself as a cold, calculating director never romanticizing his protagonists at the cost of his plot. Here, he fumbles with a script by his father that constantly defends its hero with a virtuous turn everytime we are close to see his flaws for what they are. Prufrock-like Forrest Gump protagonist is kicked around old Hollywood meeting big names and talking big game. Marion and Mank have a lot of interesting similarities and differences that were worth exploring. She is the saving grace."
MANK,27 December 2020,5/10,"Only people who lived in the 1930s and worked in the film industry at that time are sure to have fun with this well-made film. That should be a very, very small group. For the rest it is probably a almost not-entertaining film with often exhausting dialogues. It's hard to build sympathy for anyone. It only works on a very intellectual level. Thats maybe why some of the critics like it. It revolves around one of the most important films of all time. Without this the movie would be nothing."
MANK,13 February 2021,6/10,"It's a beautifully visual film, no question.The problem is the lack of engagement in the main character Mank. Why don't I care about him? What's he got at stake? I have a vague idea, but he spends so much time drunk, I'm not convinced he himself cares much about anything. He seems annoyed about Sinclair losing the election. Supposedly, the crux of it is that he wants credit for his work. That seemed to come up only in the very last moments of the film. What gives?The dialog is also surprisingly flat. For someone who's as sharp as Mankiewicz was there's nothing sparkling about the dialog. This is quite a letdown.P.s. At 18:37 there is strangely what seems to be a sloppy edit.
It's the scene where Mank is going to meet his friend. They arrange to meet at the station. There's a cut to the young man, but the music on the soundtrack keeps going. You think for a moment that this is a continuation of the scene, but it's not! We're flashing forward to the rendezvous at the station."
MANK,5 December 2020,4/10,The characters and the subject matter made this a film I was looking forward to seeing. I watched for the first 40 minutes and then gave up as I sensed it wasn't going to get any better. Gary Oldman mumbled incoherently and just wasn't sufficiently engaging for me to care what happened to him. An opportunity missed. Manky.
MANK,7 December 2020,5/10,"Technically spoken Mank is a well made movie. Excellently shot in b/w, good production values, well directed. As someone who loves movies of that particular Hollywood era I was truly looking forward to Mank. But to my great disappointment the story never got a grip on me. The flashbacks didn't help either as there was no relation to the main story IMO. The main story in itself, Mank's co-writing for Welles' Citizen Kane, was also not very well developed. We see and hear Welles a couple of times but never became clear what he expected of Mank and/or what Welles share in constructing the script was. Another problem with Mank is that if you're not familiar with the Hollywood and the studio system of that day and age you'll never get an idea what the story is all about. I expected a movie maybe similarly told as Sunset Boulevard. I saw 2 hours of loose events glued together around a binge drinking script writer who happens to be partly responsible for writing the script of one of the greatest movies. Citizen Kane deserved better..."
MANK,8 February 2021,7/10,"Before watching Mank, you must be aware that this is like no other movie David Fincher has ever made. Of course the score, overall meticulousness in his research and his nailing of the 40s vibe is more than brilliant. However, at least I believe that, this is not a film for the enjoyment of the audience, but rather to show his admiration for filmmaking. Maybe the phrase ""Not for enjoyment of the audience"" isn't entirely clear. Allow me to explain:
We've known and loved Fincher for his movies like Gone Girl, Fight Club and Se7en. These are movies where the audience is hooked from the beginning to the genius plot and directing. The audience gets dragged into the movie and goes with the flow of it 'till the remarkable, at most times mind blowing ending. These movies are for the entertainment of the audience, where the only thing expected from the audience is to pay good attention to what's going on.
However with Mank it is different. It is not enough that you observe what is going on, it also requires you to know some information beforehand. So, in order to understand it fully or maybe even truly enjoy Mank you must have of course watched Citizen Kane thoroughly, have a little knowledge about 30s Hollywood and U.S. Politics and be a bit of a film history enthusiast. Even than describing the feelings one felt would probably not be enjoyment, but rather a great appreciation for the movie.I personally cannot say that I enjoyed the movie as much as I had hoped to, but as I stated, in my believe that wasn't the aim. At the end of the day I'm just glad that we got to watch another Fincher movie even though it wasn't one like we were used to."
MANK,7 December 2020,4/10,"Because I was so looking forward to it, I'm sorry to say MANK is a beautiful, tedious disappointment. It rattles on like a non-stop spoof of the Algonquin Round Table, with no breathing room for a hint of emotion, and seems to be competing for the world's record number of unnecessary cuts per scene.To be sure, none of the responsibility for failure falls to the technicians or the actors. It is unquestionably beautiful (though there is a very odd quality to the dialogue soundtrack, a strangely persistent reverb, even outdoors). Gary Oldman is wonderful, but like his accompanying cast, can't catch a sustained moment of screen time to reach the soul or touch your heart.I'm quite sure many will be overcome by the Fincher pedigree. With references that are likely to go over most of their heads, viewers will be left furtively glancing side to side as they slowly applaud what they mistakenly believe is a ponderous success."
MANK,7 December 2020,8/10,"I don't understand the negative reviews stating this movie is niche, jumbled, or that it alienates its audience. This film, above all else, is a treatise on the power of film and media to change the perceptions of the general public. At a time when ""fake news"" and the outright denial of reality are embraced by 70+ million Americans, this film shines a light on the history of misinformation in this country, and how a few hats in a smoke-filled room are the ones calling the shots for an entire country.I think viewers need to stop expecting this film to be what they want, and start accepting it for what it is: an allegory. Why do you think the parable of the organ grinder's monkey is brought up twice? This is a political film disguised as a love letter to old Hollywood. If you didn't get that in your first viewing, I suggest you rewatch it.I believe this is David Fincher in peak form. I love how carefully selected the shots in each scene are, all leading to a claustrophobic climax.One gripe I have is that there are two instances where flashbacks are intercut with the present, and I didn't find any payoff in editing those scenes as such.This is a film for people who love films. In an era of bang-bang-boom tentpole films, it's incredibly refreshing to hear strong dialogue and watch even stronger acting combine with some of the strongest direction I've seen this year. I personally believe that this film surpasses The Social Network, but that's just my personal opinion. I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell for saying that, but Mank is a prime example of why I fell in love with cinema in the first place.I would give it 10 stars, but I do agree that the writing needs to be buttoned up. For instance, the running gag of L.B. Mayer fake crying is finally punctuated by him throwing a kerchief out the window at Thalberg's funeral, indicating that the strong display of emotion he was showing was all an act. I got it, but I don't feel that important bits like this were given the service they deserved.Further, the verbose Quixote speech was all too on-the-nose and could've just as easily been cut to make way for more screen time between Welles and Mank, the central conflict in the story.All in all, this movie made me smile and I clapped once the credits rolled--even all alone in my room in quarantine. I can't tell you the last time in the past four years a film made me feel so in love with cinema. To give this film 3 and 4 stars because it's ""boring"" or ""niche"" is to completely miss the point of cinema altogether. Thank you for this entry to the American zeitgeist, Mr. Fincher."
MANK,8 December 2020,10/10,All the bad reviews I see are from people who don't understand cinema as an art and watch movies purely for entertainment. If that's you this might not be your thing. If you enjoy the art of cinema however you will love this film.
MANK,7 February 2021,5/10,Gary Oldman is a brilliant actor but he is not right to play someone half of his age
MANK,6 December 2020,8/10,"Listen this movie is good but sometimes is a little boring and confusing.
Gary Oldman is great Maybe his gonna be nominated to another Oscar for this movie.
The cinematography is great and beautiful.
If the movie was shorter could be way better"
MANK,17 December 2020,5/10,"Cinephiles will be in ecstasy and, yes, the film does look and sound gorgeous. Unfortunately despite some excellent performances (including TVs Cormoran Strike as the young Orsen Welles) the film is tedious to the extreme. Prepare to be bored rigid!"
MANK,7 December 2020,8/10,"I respect Fincher very much and wouldn't say this film disappointed me. Cinematography, acting, plot - all were great, in my opinion. However, I can't ignore the notable lack of empathy I felt for the characters. That doesn't bother me personally, because since the visuals are more than satisfactory, in a way they compensate for the lack of relatability in the characters. It's not one of his best movies, but it's still much better than many of the Hollywood productions today."
MANK,6 January 2021,6/10,"While showcasing a very good performance by the great Gary Oldman along with stylish directing (it's David Fincher) overall the experience of watching this film was shallow and a bit of a slog. While the story on paper is interesting, as anyone who's remotely interested in filmmaking would like to know the behind-the-scenes of arguably the most influential and acclaimed film of all time, unfortunately it suffers majorly from lack of structural cohesion and uninteresting characters.I just couldn't find myself all that invested in the characters, other than Mank, not even knowing who was being referred to or what exactly was happening in quite a few scenes. The film tends to jump around very erratically between locations and dialogues between characters and feels way too long with a very stretched-out plot. Ironically, a dilemma in the film is of people complaining to Mank that his screenplay leaps back and forth in time very messily and is hard to follow. Citizen Kane's time jumping was necessary and interesting throughout, unlike this.Still there was enjoyment to be had, but coming from Fincher, I had a surprising lack of investment in what was happening and found myself pretty bored at times."
MANK,19 February 2021,4/10,"Somehow a film with a good cast, director and premise ends up being incredibly dull. Many references to cinematic greats names has, I'm sure, in part, contributed to the critics raving reviews.
I'm a fan of classic cinema but too much style over any substance"
MANK,11 December 2020,3/10,"Inaccurate, uneven, and a rushed biased ending I'm still trying to get over.I'm very familiar with old hollywood, in particular with the present time this film is projecting. I appreciated the filmmakers had an affinity for this era as well. I found, personally, where they would introduce a plethora (""do you know what a plethora is?"") of the persons of old Hollywood to be overhanded and distracting. Full name to full name to full name at a fast paced editing was dizzying. I could barely keep up and I'm pretty well versed. I can only imagine those unfamiliar trying to keep up.The story should be simple, but it was hard to find in this bogged down drivel of the first half. It was mostly told in flashbacks during this time instead of centering us with where we're supposed to currently be at and with whom, being Mank, so once we care we can then properly go with him to discover more to the ""why"" and ""how"" he came to this point in his life.Structure aside. The second half is where I woke up. There were some brilliant moments with corrected pacing that allows the scenes and actors of Oldman's caliber to breathe. I really enjoyed his performance. Amanda Seyfried, as Marion Davies, was the breath of fresh air for the film. She had that rare glow where she was truly the living/breathing character she was embodying and not just putting on a performance.I have a confession: I've been a huge fan of Trent Reznor since 1990. His scores with Atticus for Dragon Tattoo, Social Network, and Gone Girl were some of the best of the 21st, so I was expecting nothing less here. I read where they only used instruments of the era (that might be a grapevine thing). I think that's very commendable but truthfully didn't feel it translated well here. It was largely forgettable, which pains me to say. This is just from the first viewing.I really enjoyed the cinematogaphy and the choice for the black and white film (I assume it was film). Loved the reel change marks throughout. There was a shot near the opening that did a slow fade to all but a lighted room, which I thought was a nice touch. The film had a lot of promise. The weight of it for me was in the last quarter. The film was a comedy for awhile there, then somehow a touch of a political thriller, before finally getting to where it wanted to be, which was a story about a man's life.I've read where it was actually Mank's brother that was tied into the political drama about Upton. I understand creative licensing and the need for suspension for disbelief, but it's a hard turn off for me when I begin to think that there's crucial parts of the story here that people will take down as fact. Stripping the writer from the birthplace (if you will) of the ""Rosebud"" construct seemed completely unnecessary. It's been well documented where that came from and his use of it in Kane is utter brilliance. Don't know what the creative choice was there to ruin it.What it all came down to for me and my rating of a 3 out of 10 had nothing to do with the technical side or the performances, which were quite captivating (I was amazed at the voice of Orson); it was a disagreement with some of the choices that were made in the script. The very uneven first half that mostly consisted of flashbacks, keeping us from anchoring, and the choices in the last 20 minutes.The dialogue was sheer brilliance in areas and seemed too overhanded and self aware in others. My problem was that I've seen interviews and read many articles about Orson to know he's the one to make sure Herman got his credit; so much so his name was listed above his own. He also gave Gregg Toland his due in the credits although Orson had his fingers in everything.Orson Welles didn't even need the film to cement his name. He had the 1938 broadcast of War of the Worlds that stirred the nation, the all-black play if Macbeth he oversaw in Harlem that overhauled Shakespeare's witchcraft with voodoo and had lines around the block. Everything he touched turned to gold, especially when there was source material. Mank provided the story and Orson did what he's always done and rewrote it into oblivion until it was ready. It was a team effort, and they created the draft for the ""great American motion picture"". If he didn't get the writing credit, it would make more sense to the story and create an empathy that would carry more weight.""It's pretty, but is it art?"""
MANK,4 December 2020,8/10,"All you have to know is that it is a ""that streaming service"" film so be ready to see not the best movie of one of greatest director. Enjoy!"
MANK,8 December 2020,2/10,"I struggled to stay awake to the end of Mank directed by David Fincher on Netflix. It's an unmitigated disaster, confused and turgid from beginning to end. For example, in one part, a guy, Shelly Metcalf--who?--commits suicide, but the next scene shows the funeral of another guy, Irving Thalberg! Duh? Wha? Half the time you can't figure out which woman is Mank's wife, Sara, and which is his British amanuensis, Rita.The only good thing you can say about it is that Gary Oldman, an actor I've never heard of, will probably get at least an Oscar nomination for best actor because he's in every scene, most of the time playing a tousle-haired drunk. As if playing a tousle-haired drunk is original! Duh? Wha?The best acting in the film was by Amanda Seyfried, who plays William Randolph Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies. But even she gets short shrift and lost in the shuffle. Orson Wells--Tom Burke--doesn't even show up in person until 14 minutes from the end. This is not a spoiler.Bottom line: you are led to believe by the hype and publicity that this film is going to be about how the greatest American film ever made, Citizen Kane, was made. You would be wrong. Citizen Kane is not even mentioned once and there are only fleeting references to it.Mank is, essentially, the biopic of a drunk who died of alcoholism at the age of 55.Di-sas-ter!"
MANK,8 December 2020,2/10,"Wow what a pretentious piece of dribble. The dialogue was straight out of a Hollywood Golden Age movie where every one speaks in a rat-ta-tat manner, that no one ever really did in real life. Mank is not likable or interesting even though Oldman does a great job with what he has been giving. The art direction and costumes are top notch and Amanda Siegfried is stunning as Hearst's lover Marion Davies. That's the best i can say about this snoozer of a movie."
MANK,23 March 2021,4/10,"I enjoyed the movie until Mank got out of bad.
I didn't find the Sinclair for Governor stuff at all believable. The film provided no reason that Mankiewicz would go all crazy over the defeat or the way that politics was played in 1934.
I did enjoy the Marion Davies parts. A true story movie based on her and Hearst and would have been far more interesting."
MANK,19 April 2021,3/10,"'Mank' is a dull, uninspiring movie that says ""William Randolph Hearst was wrong"" on paper, yet validates his cynical 'organ grinder monkey' parable in practice. A bloated, self-important, inoffensive product brought to you by the same Hollywood corporate class Herman Mankiewicz hated. It's as phony as computer-generated scratches on digital black and white photography.Director David Fincher says he has ""complicated"" feelings about Hollywood, but judging by this movie, his approach to the industry is not really that complicated. He wants to play with big, shiny toys while making stuff that's smarter and riskier than your average superhero flick, but he has no real problem with the industry status quo. Sure, he's aware of how condescending and two-faced people in the industry can be, how unethical and corrupt the business is, how rotten the politics are. Here, let him show you how aware he is in this multi-million dollar Netflix-produced movie starring A-list actors. Make no mistake: Fincher is a ride-or-die Hollywood director. Like most pop stylists who came up in the 90's, irony and contempt is simply part of his love language. That's probably why the 'heartfelt' moments in this movie - Sara's scenes with Mank, the conclusion of Rita's storyline - come off as disingenuous and flat.I would say Fincher doesn't have the guts to be Mankiewicz, but I'm not so sure Mank had much courage anyway. He wasn't a real socialist, and his decision to blacklist himself reads more like a petty middle finger than a redemptive act of selflessness. That's to say nothing of his misogynistic revenge on Marion Davies - a betrayal this movie claims she was okay with. (Sidenote: All the women in this movie are underwritten and have an inexplicably high tolerance for Mank's B. S.)No, the person whose guts I measure Fincher's against is the person 'Mank' wants you to think about the least. It's telling how the story of a sad, bored Hollywood insider appeals to Fincher, but he can't get near the story of Orson Welles, an earnest outsider artist who outclassed (and was subsequently buried by) Hollywood. That's because Fincher is not an outsider, he's not a 'punk auteur,' nor is he an 'anarchist' as some film bros like to describe him. When Levi's, Nike, Coca-Cola, and Chanel trust you with tens of millions of dollars, when Netflix gives you an exclusive four-year deal, how much of a threat to the system can you be?Watching 'Mank,' two things have never been more clear:1) Hollywood still has not forgiven Orson Welles, and 2) Fincher is quite comfortable being the organ grinder's smug, self-effacing, jaded monkey.At what point does a cranky, bitter takedown of Hollywood hypocrisy become a cowardice compensator?"
MANK,6 December 2020,3/10,"What did I just watch? Fell asleep in ten minutes the first two times I tried to watch it. The third time I was able to stay awake throughout, only to realize I had lost two hours of my life that I can never get back. What a snooze fest of a movie. Then again, Fincher is one the most overrated directors of modern cinema so I'm not surprised."
MANK,18 January 2021,9/10,"The writing reflects the talent and verbal aesthetics of the featured historical character accurately, charged by witty literacy as you would wish. Gary Oldman masterfully sustains the character he inhabits. Slowly, surely you are experiencing Herman Mankiiewicz as the featured actor becomes the featured character in fullness. This is art. Additionally, the emphasis placed on W. H. Hearst is necessary because of plot demands and ""through-line"" purposes, but featuring Upton Sinclair's socialist presence in California's political culture through his influence on Mankiewicz displays Mank, the ""court jester"" as a man with a serious political conscience dwelling in a space unfriendly to his deeply felt principles. ""Mank"" proves a theatrical gift by David Fincher, Ben Mankiewicz, the writer, Oldman's co star Amanda Seafried, and supporting cast, and the production crew who left us with a an accurate feel for 1930's back lots, sound stages, and the Mojave Desert where a cinematic masterpiece was written."
MANK,5 December 2020,5/10,"Dull, pretentious, self-important biopic that lacks the energy and wit that were Mankiewicz's trademarks. The real Mank wouldn't allow his name on the credits of this one."
MANK,12 December 2020,10/10,I was so surprised by this movie. It was like being transported into the 1930s/40s. Everything from the dialogue to the way people moved and how it was shot was so 1930s. Probably the most surprising part of the movie is its nod to the current situation in the US - including fake news...To my mind this is a masterpiece. It should definitely feature in the Oscars. And Gary Oldman must be nominated for best actor.
MANK,4 February 2021,3/10,"I'm sorry. This movie is nominated for a Golden Globe? Really? I tried to watch this on two separate nights and fell asleep both times. I am a movie buff and a fan of Citizen Kane, so I was looking forward to it."
MANK,11 March 2021,3/10,"Such a boring movie. If the name Fincher weren't tagged in this film, no one would care watching it. Screenplay wise, this doesn't deserve to be in Oscars."
MANK,4 December 2020,7/10,"This year we lacked quality movies or the experience of a good picture at the minimum, but this film did great at impressing me, giving a very great noir nostalgia.All round it was good at the least very good at the best, Gary did an amazing job at performing Mank's unique character, picking Marion Davies for Orson is perfect! his sound was very on point that if you close your eyes you'll think it's Welles himself.The best part in the movie is FINCHER, astonishing, shooting the movie the same way as Orson shot Citizen Kane impressed me and was the best part of the movie loved every part of the flashbacks even though some was extended that made it boring, but still the finchers did a great job and a movie that we really needed this weak cinematic year (but was good in real life)."
MANK,7 December 2020,1/10,"It was an interesting set up to begin with and certain scenes were amusing but unfortunately the political debate scene made me cringe.""Socialism is spreading the wealth and communism is spreading the poverty"" with the other characters clearly being framed to be pro capitalism, they are all presented as ""greedy"" while mank is the righteous one.I love films that challenge you and make you re-think you assumptions and thoughts but this is just getting tiresome and clearly not needed but was introduced for political purposes. No thought out explanation, just nonsense."
MANK,4 December 2020,10/10,"The performances were great. Especially Seyfried's and Oldman's. The references are simply phenomenal when it comes to real life and when it comes to Citizen Kane itself.
Fincher did a b&w movie that it really seems like it was made 80 years ago, and it's actually very fun to watch.
For me, the great point of the performances it's definitely Amanda Seyfried. She doesn't have much time on screen, and when she's not, you wish she was, and I think that's the foundation of a great performance in a supporting role."
MANK,27 February 2021,6/10,"I'm no expert on 1930s cinema by all means. If you aren't either, I wouldn't recommend this flick. Has it's great moments, starts pretty good, but in my opinion, looses it self by desperately trying to appeal to critics and media. I enjoyed myself sometimes, but 80% of the movie I was completely lost, not understanding a word characters were saying... But if you know cinema's history like you know your house, you're not going to regret it."
MANK,30 March 2021,10/10,I thoroughly enjoyed this film - while probably some things inaccurate - it was a great watch with some outstanding acting. I felt it really caught the period well with a modern twist.The dining room scene was a masterpeiece of cinema.
MANK,9 December 2020,7/10,"""This is a business where the buyer gets nothing but a memory for his money,what he bought still belongs to the man that sold it"" says Mayer,co-founder of MGM studios which runs as one of the glaring themes of this technical juggernaut from the legendary David Fincher and serves as a reminder that a film will always been known by the person who made it.Herman J. Mankiewicz,a gifted but rather brazen screenwriter with an exquisite way with words, battles his demons of alcoholism and compulsive gambling to finish the screenplay for the film 'Citizen Cane' within the stipulated time span which is to be helmed by Orsen Wells. However,David Fincher doesn't limit his narrative to Mank's involvement with the film which proved to be revolutionary in terms of writing and making,he proliferates into his personal turmoil and exposes the hypocrisy of the major Hollywood production houses in the run.
Gary Oldman who is 60 years of age in real life, nonchalantly reprises the bloated alcoholic lead who is nearly half his actual age to near perfection. The tenacity of the plot coupled with impeccable cinematography augments the narrative a notch higher making up for the rather tardy start to the movie. 'Mank' may not be one of Fincher's best, it appears rather like a loving son's respectable homage to his father's most ambitious project. The technical and narrative proficiency of David Fincher which the audience is accustomed to is far from seen in this flick.That being said,the film cannot be written off as bad,from a director known for his meticulously structured psychological sequences and exemplary technical skills,Mank have have fallen short of the high expectations. However, the ominous performances from the lead actors and some good writing makes this film a good watch. Keeping in mind the fewer releases the year had,Mank may even land David Fincher his long overdue Academy award (fingers crossed)."
MANK,5 January 2021,1/10,"This movie showed us that although the shell is the most beautiful thing in the world that you see, it's content and purpose is more disposable than a bad apple."
MANK,4 January 2021,6/10,"Mank is a movie for Hollywood insiders. That's not to say others will not like this but if you are not familiar with the real life people portrayed in this film you may lose interest.It was very well done and the style really transported you into 1930's Hollywood. Be aware this movie is shot entirely in black and white, and our critics were split, with some loving that and some not so much. So this may be a turn off for certain viewers. The music and score of this was incredible and our favorite part was they way they portrayed the movie making process of that time period.We recommend you check this movie out but before you do you may want to watch ""Citizen Kane."" If you already saw it, maybe at least read up about the people and series of events that took place to be more aware of the name dropping throughout the movie. It will help you enjoy this movie on the same level we think the filmmakers intended.This review was a combination and average of our 4 critics.

MANK,19 January 2021,7/10,"The movie is well made with good performances scattered throughout, but the issue with Mank is that it feels underwhelming. During the movie we are told the story of Herman Mankiewicz, a Hollywood screenwriter, and his inspiration for his magnum opus Citizen Kane. The movie honestly feels empty, without a true purpose or reason for being made. I understand that it's a passion project for Fincher, but that's not enough to forgive its flaws."
MANK,14 April 2021,10/10,"A reviewer here said ""a self-absorbed film that doesn't care about it's audience"". I agree but not for negative reasons. This is exceptional work from Fincher. An excellent film about Hollywood of the past and one of its most genius and flawed individuals Herman J. Mankiewicz, played sensationally by Gary Oldman.Oldman is at his true best here. Playing the drunken writer he was born to play. An intelectual, gambler, drunk and witty gentleman that wrote Citizen Kane. Oldman (with his own troubled past) is perfectly cast in the role.Set design, support cast, cinematography and just about everything in this film is perfect. I watched it on Netflix and as soon as it was over, I watched it again. Sure it divides audiences. But I think that's what makes it so good.Pure cinema at its best!"
MANK,14 April 2021,10/10,"Having worked with David Fincher on ""Zodiac"" & having interviewed Amanda Seyfried for ""In Time"" and Lily Collins in ""Rules Don't Apply"", I was very curious.I do love Gary Oldman's work ever since ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".Oldman becomes Herman J. Mankiewicz & delivers an outstanding performance. Thinking about his wit, speeches and his behavior makes me still crack up.Arliss Howard makes an excellent Louis B. Mayer and I adore Tom Burke as Americas beloved Artist Orson Welles.The whole Cast and Crew does not spare with Sparks during this #2020 Netflix production, like Magnum P. I. revving hup his Ferrari 308 GTS.Being one of the German speaking Actors not having made it into ""Beerfest"", I was jealous of missing out on this Hollywood extravaganza.In my opinion my SAGAFTRA sisters and brothers as well as Union and Non Union Crew and Cast have created a unique master piece.Hollywood pulls out all the stops before during the VOD streaming, pandemic afterglow.Chapeau, Congratulations & Namaste.Enjoy the movie with a hot and glamorous date, decked out in a dress à la Marion Davies by Trish Summerville; cigar, some Cognac and Popcorn.Once time travel is properly established, get into your DeLorean in order to get cast in ""Touch of Evil"". You already bought your ticket - enjoy the ride!"
MANK,10 January 2021,,"There are great elements. Great acting, well written dialogue, cinematography. But there was really no point and it was dull. Making movies about movies is favourite subject of every movie maker. Please stop"
MANK,6 February 2021,4/10,Kept waiting for something noteworthy to happen...with about 30 minutes remaining turned it off to resume later....still trying to generate enough interest to finish it. Folks in Hollywood who make movies and film students will probably appreciate it...I'm neither.
MANK,26 April 2021,7/10,If you are a lover of old movies and interested in the studio era and Hollywood era then this film is for you! It's beautifully filmed in the style of an old movie using all the old film style techniques and music to add suspense. Fabulous acting! I can understand the bad reviews because if you watch this film not having any knowledge of the industry or time period then it may not hold your interest! As a lover of films I found I had to really concentrate at times but I kept going and I'm glad I did as it gave me more insight into the truth behind the power struggle for writers during this time period and how Citizen Kane was not just all about Orson Welles!! Definitely worth a watch!
MANK,17 December 2020,3/10,"One hour and twenty minutes were enough to say I don't understand what's going on, who are they talking about or what are they thinking. It looks like this movie was written for the guys involved in this old film studios and productions, who by the way, are probably dead. I wasn't there because I'm 40 and I wanted to know and understand how Citizen Kane was done but confusion was the only thing I've got by watching this one. I'm still trying to understand what was the whole point of this movie. Too many names, to much information and nothing clear to the common audience. I was so lost that I needed to stop watching this movie with more than 40 minutes left. Would be surprised if it gets an Oscar."
MANK,8 May 2021,2/10,"Absolutely seething having sat through 2+ hours of that - both wrapped in its own Hollywood self importance plus nowhere near as intelligent as it thinks it is. Don't get me wrong, there is an interesting story in there, but frankly it's worthy of a 30 minute documentary, not a 2 hour 12 minute rambling motion picture. While director David Fincher may have loved working on his Dad's unfinished screen play that was never published while he was alive, I think we now know why - it's awful, difficult to follow and hideously over long. At least we have Gary Oldman to watch while we try and get through it, basically the films only redeeming feature. It even looks cheap!! Avoid."
MANK,17 January 2021,6/10,"For me as a cinema fan, but not having studied hollywoods history too much in depth, this film was really hard to follow. Without a doubt it is very well directed and well played, but it never really get's emotional or interesting on other levels then film politics."
MANK,22 December 2020,9/10,"David Fincher has more than enough A-Level experience to deliver this Hollywood insider powerhouse. Political commentary of the 1930's comes to full-circle-relevance for our current time, against the joyously-romantic visuals of cinema's golden age. Oldman is delightful; the sharp-tongued dialogue elevates the piece. Technique delivers everything you'd expect from Fincher.
A captivating time-capsule romantic period study. My 2020 best picture pick bar none."
MANK,12 December 2020,5/10,"The fact that Upton Sinclair is portrayed as merely the victim of political propaganda and not THE pioneer of modern socialist propaganda, betrays the film's lack of any historical context and lack of any sense of irony."
MANK,21 September 2021,6/10,"The material is good, the production design superb, the acting abs directing flawless.But the writing, god the writing... it's excruciatingly slow-paced, the flashbacks don't help (you'd expect they might), nothing helps. It's a terrible bore. And it's not because it's long: it started and ended boring: boring after 20 minutes and it doesn't get better.I though of Psycho actually: that it only became a classic because it was so heavily edited. Maybe that's what'd do it for Mank: a heavy handed editor.Try it if you're a die hard Citizen Kane fan. Or a Gary Oldman fan. Or have nothing better to do."
MANK,15 April 2021,5/10,"Every shot is beautiful. The sound design is excellent, it sounds better than 180gr vinyl. As a conservative who loves movies and history I was very disappointed at how inaccurate it was. Several prominent plot points are made up or misrepresented. Pretty ballsy to make a movie about how politicized media can purposely mislead the public that is politicized media purposely misleading the public. I was very excited for this movie and ended up annoyed and disappointed. A waste of top notch cinematography and sound talent."
MANK,4 December 2020,,"This movie is so boring, it will cure anyone's insomnia. Even the few examples of decent acting won't keep you awake. Sorry."
MANK,14 December 2020,3/10,"As someone else wrote here, this was a chore to watch. Gorgeous opening shots setting a visual tone that continued throughout. But endless speeches directed at no one in particular... nonlinear story for no apparent reason... really oddball, echoey sound that made one think they were sitting in a 40s movie theater, with none of the charm... Off-putting and annoying. Kane and Mankiewicz deserved far better."
MANK,9 December 2020,8/10,"So, let's start with the assumption that Mank is a great movie.
The soundtrack is fantastic, the sets, costumes, and makeup as well.
Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography is exceptional (the film manages to be a film of the 40s and at the same time a film of 2000).
Even the editing, as in every Fincher film, is excellent and manages to find a way to merge with the fictional sound of the 30s on several occasions.
That said, what's wrong with Mank?
In my opinion, the weak link in a film that had the possibility of being a masterpiece, exactly like the film from which it is inspired, is undoubtedly the script. Obviously, I am not referring to the perfectly written dialogues or the numerous insightful lines in the film, I am referring precisely to the structure of the story and the different elements that are treated in it: in fact, what seems to want to be a story about the screenwriter of Citizen Kane, ends up by transform into a glimpse of the Hollywood of the 30s / 40s.
Nothing strange up to here,
except that the script to implement this maneuver goes against its own nature, showing more than it should, but less than it really should (especially from a political point of view).
In fact, a boundless number of characters from the American political and social history of the time are mentioned, who, however, are introduced in a hasty and almost fast way.
The consequence of this oversight is the inevitable presence of a huge number of characters who are deepened in an incredibly superficial way.
So the film, especially in the first part, gets ""lost"" and easily disoriented, leading to a not too satisfying ending.
Despite everything, Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman are fantastic in their roles and Fincher's directing is perhaps the most flawless of his career."
MANK,21 December 2020,4/10,"Following a couple of good reviews in the paper, we decided to put it on the must watch list.I'm a bit of a movie buff but after about an hour I was hoping it would pick up and be more interesting.
But this is really an Arthouse / indie style movie targeted at film historians and about 45 min too long.
Unlike Trumbo it doesn't really grip the average joe. The unfolding of the true meaning of the parable of the monkey and organ grinder mentioned early in the movie is interesting but to build an entire movie around it is hard to justify.Sorry , was hoping for more."
MANK,5 December 2020,5/10,What a disappointment. Was really hoping for quality. Yet only to find a overly wordy script poorly delivered. Also general audio was low compared to most other films. Cinematography was top though.
MANK,3 February 2021,1/10,One of the most boring movie that I have ever seen
MANK,15 February 2021,6/10,"Mank ~ 6/10
I hate to watch something and I do not know its content.
Perhaps because of my lack of knowledge of the period the film is speaking,
But despite that, the anecdotal film is below average,
Transitions between the present and the past become troublesome over time.
The two enhancements to the film were the direction by David and the acting by Charles and Gary."
MANK,20 December 2020,10/10,"I thought this movie was wonderful, either because of the great way the story is told or because of how Fincher makes it possible for us to link the content and relate each part of the film to the Citizen Kane script and still enjoy the story.
Mank's staging fascinated me, but I was even more fascinated by Gary Oldman's brilliant performance, this man joins the film, he is the film. Thanks to his brilliant performance I think he deserves the Best Actor Oscar this year (competing with Chadwick Boseman for his great performance in Ma Rainey's black bottom).
Mank is a masterpiece, maybe not David Fincher's best film, but it's still a majestic film. Maybe a lot of people are upset that the film has factors that aren't very Fincher-like, but personally it doesn't bother me at all.
Thanks for the movie David Fincher, a total wonder."
MANK,2 January 2021,8/10,"I like this movie
It's wonderful in every thing.. Acting, cinematography, production design, music, diricting..
But the screenplay is slow, it make me boring sometimes"
MANK,7 December 2020,10/10,"I love David Fincher, he is my favorite director for me, and this movie was not in the usual David Fincher style, but the film was acceptable, and the acting was also impressive. I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I hope this movie will get many awardsEspecially the Academy Award for Best Director by David Fincher"
MANK,31 December 2020,7/10,"Gary Oldman does an excellent performance, David Fincher does a great job as a director, the photography is great, but the plot lacked a bit of movement."
MANK,6 December 2020,9/10,At first the movie started slow but the the second act sucked you in. This at a critical time of our present elections. Couldn't tell but either way the connection was established. This movie yes on the surface is about Mank and the studio operations but even more so a tale of a few powerful White men giving birth to the idea of lording over the many so much so that even today we see the fruits of that philosophy with the 75 million followers of Trump. Have to see it again. So much underneath.
MANK,18 January 2021,10/10,"Caught this film this past weekend and really enjoyed Oldman's portrayal of the screenwriter. I also enjoyed learning some of the backstory behind the making of Cane, which is one of my all time favorite films. Really recommend to fans of filmmaking history."
MANK,21 January 2021,5/10,"Aside for the amazing aesthetics and the overall nostalgia for 30's and 40's Hollywood, Fincher got lost on this one.
It's almost unwatchable for anyone who hasn't watched Citizen Kane and isn't informed on Hollywood from this era. A good movie is supposed to include you even if you're not aware on the historics of the movie or an Hollywood worker, and that's the biggest failure of Mank.
Still well done as a Fincher movie, but not as exciting as any of his other works. Not a misstep, but more of an underline in an amazing line of movies.Nostalgia and insider references will only get you so far. Concentrating on Hearst and how it transpires on the script would have made for a much more dramatically successful movie."
MANK,19 March 2021,1/10,"This is a very good-looking piece of garbage.! Sorry, your review is too short.(Not anymore it isn't)"

MANK,21 November 2020,1/10,"I lost 2.5 hours of my life. For the first time in a long time I wanted to leave, but I wasn't alone so I stayed, it was very painful."
MANK,8 December 2020,4/10,"It had such potential. With the likes of George S Kaufman, Charlie Lederer, SJ Perlman, Ben Hecht, and the like we had none of their wit or humor. We were stuck with a miserable washed up Herman J Mankiwiecz, an egomaniacle Orson Welles, and a power hungry Louis B Mayer. I'm assuming that was the point of the film. But it was sad and pathetic and didn't engage me. Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst were the highlights of the film, but were too little to carry the film. I get that Gary Oldman was playing an old sloppy drunk. But it came across as boring and lazy. And in the end I'm not even sure what the theme of the film was supposed to be. I guess I just wish the film had focused on someone else and maybe call it Hearst vs Kane or something."
MANK,21 March 2021,7/10,"Nothing about this movie deserves awards or massive praise, but it's enjoyable and interesting.
The first 30 minutes are a bit confused and uninteresting but the last 60 minutes are a good ride with some fun moments. The whole movie is full of great one liners, but it suffers from a feeling that the movie written about the past was created with morality and sensibilities of 2020."
MANK,4 January 2021,9/10,"The screenplay, the environment, the detail of that time, the cinematography, the actors, the direction...this is David Finchers best movie so far.
And i do understand that there are also a lot of people who disliked this film. I think thats mainly because of the witty dialogues and names that are thrown at the viewer.This movie doenst explain certain characters or situations. This movie demands that the viewer did his homework or at least knows something about hollywood in the 40's."
MANK,3 January 2021,8/10,"I completely ""got"" what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish. His technique mirrors the original Kane movie. Short scenes, fades and flashbacks.
It was enjoyable enough on my own screen. However I predict that this film, and many others that were released in 2020, will have a second life in theaters. People will be anxious to get back into theater seats and see these films on a big screen.
I would suggest a program handout at the door explaining who all the various characters are that are played in the film."
MANK,6 December 2020,2/10,They should have shot it on 35mm film. It says mono mix
MANK,2 April 2021,9/10,"A movie for cinephiles. It looks and feels like a mid-century film so if you are not familiar with old movies, you may not like the pacing, plot development, appearance or cinematography. And the reel change marks (""cigarette burns"" at top right) are a wonderful touch. The start of the next reel is often a scene change, as it would be in a movie from the 1940s. Oldman is fantastic as always."
MANK,4 December 2020,1/10,"I don't know if I'm alone here but i was just very confused by the plot. I didn't understand any of it from start to finish. The cinematography and Amanda Seyfried's performance were fantastic but otherwise, bland"
MANK,11 December 2020,7/10,"I'll keep it concise. For one, the cinematography is gorgeous, it truly takes you back in time to the 1930s. Nice acting although Welles' portrayal seemed a bit too unremarkable. No real conflict and you would have to be somewhat well versed in the names and context the movie takes place in to get invested with the story. Oldman is magnificent as usual. As an homage this movie is okay. Give it a try and make your own conclusions. 74/100"
MANK,22 November 2020,9/10,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is not going to be for everyone, and I fully understand if anyone ends up feeling bored or dislikes the movie. It's wordy, complicated and doesn't try to push the audience in any particular direction. I however loved it.There are very few things Mank doesn't achieve in an almost perfect fashion, this is a passion project and a love letter of the highest caliber. The acting is superb all around, Gary Oldman delivers one of his absolute best roles ever perfectly embodying the tormented but talented Mank, Seyfried shines as a cleverer than you think movie star and everyone else helps you forget you're not watching the real persons themselves.The biggest highlight of this movie however is the incredible visuals, the best cinematography Oscar is practically in the bag already. Very seldom do you watch something that so perfectly captures a different era, this one being of the old Hollywoodland, with great compositions, lighting and mood this is truly a feast for the eyes in every possible way! I truly felt transported to another world and what i wouldn't do to experience that old Hollywood glamour just for one night, corruption and backstabbing aside!There are many more things to discuss but I'll leave it to you to experience this firsthand, overall this is an excellent return to the big screen for David Fincher and Im beyond excited to see what he can cook up next. Highly recommend!Score: 9/10"
MANK,6 December 2020,8/10,"If you want to watch a thriller/crime movie (like Fincher normally makes) I don't think this is the movie for you, if you have already watched and liked Citizen Kane, interested in cinema history, know the presented persons (if you don't you can google them like I did, probably you're watching on Netflix and can pause it after all) I think you would like Mank.By far Mank is the most comfortable film (for audience) Fincher ever made. Of course he didn't compromise the high quality of the production. You can enjoy clever dialogues, wonderful acting (especially by Gary Oldman), beautiful cinematography... I didn't get bored for a moment (may be the last part could have been a little bit longer, it ends very quickly)Compared to the high quality of the production, the plot is a little bit weak I think. Yeah, the time jumps are nice but I have concerns about depth of the story. Mank more likely deepens Citizen Kane's story rather than its own."
MANK,6 December 2020,6/10,Was expecting more of old Hollywood plus inside background before went into Citizen Kane evolution which turned out to be minimal.
MANK,20 February 2021,5/10,"This felt like a documentary. I found myself looking up historical facts about Citizen Kane screen writing and controversies. Film critics will love this movie, it's made for them."
MANK,22 November 2021,7/10,Superb acting from Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman. Mediocre storytelling and lots of references to 1930s and 1940s Hollywood. The film also depicts the California Gubernatorial Election of 1937 in the sidelines.
MANK,22 November 2021,7/10,"Superb acting from Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman. However, mediocre storytelling and lots of references to 1930s and 1940s Hollywood. The film also depicts the 1934 California Gubernatorial Election in the sidelines."
MANK,9 December 2020,4/10,"It's certainly beautifully shot in delicious, creamy black and white but I found it to be a self-obsessed piece of film making and as a result it left me feeling uninvolved. The characters are unsympathetic, especially the titular one however well Gary Oldman played him. The screenplay was written by David Fincher's father and that's quite possibly why I found it to be more of a vanity project than the cinematic masterpiece it aspires to be, with more than a whiff of nepotism about it. There's no real drama to this piece and it starts to become wearisome about halfway through. The actual script writing of 'Citizen Kane' (or 'American' as it was originally titled) strangely takes a supporting role to the writer's alcoholic self-loathing and the internal politics and machinations of the Hollywood elite at that time. I found it to be uneven and considering Fincher's previous excellent bodies of work it left me feeling somewhat dispirited.
Obviously this is just my opinion and I'm sure that a lot of people will love it!"
MANK,9 December 2020,2/10,"I wonder how many of the people who marked 8 plus have slated other films for inaccuracies? Here's the truth. Mank did the first two drafts at Victorville, but there were seven drafts in all. plus the revisions as the shooting progressed. It was brave to shoot in b/w, but you get the impression in the end it disappears up its own backside."
MANK,7 December 2020,7/10,"Despite the perfectly tonal black-and-white cinematography, the fictional story about the background and process of screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz' Citizen Kane script gets lost in overly clever word play. Yes, it is a story about writers, but the decision to have the actors deliver their lines in the rhythm of old style films, leaves the viewer annoyed rather than amused. These artistic choices on the part of the director distract from the overall storytelling, rather than contributing to it.The acting was unfortunately uneven. With the exception of Amanda Seyfried's Marion Davis, the female characters are weakly performed and less memorable than the pasties on one of the steno workers in one of the earlier scenes.As for the men, Charles Dance as Hearst is terrific as the kingly mannered king maker who enjoys playing at politics. Gary Oldman, as always, brings a solidity to the film as Mankiewicz that many of the actors cannot muster: I'm looking at you Lily Collins. I'd have like to have seen more Orson Welles, the ambitious dynamic force that got the film to screen, but I suppose that would have detracted from the focus on Mankiewicz.I feel this is picky in a film celebrating the writer of one of cinema's best movies, but it could have used better editing."
MANK,5 December 2020,10/10,"Greatest dialogoues a film had in a while.
A masterpiece of cinematography.
A brilliant cast that could not be arranged better."
MANK,15 November 2020,10/10,"Acting is perfect, directing is outstanding, score is fantastic and very very entertaining...best movie of the year for me"
MANK,18 November 2020,10/10,"With Mank, Fincher is able to capture the essence of Citizen Kane. It is widely regarded that Citizen Kane is one of the greatest movies ever made. Orson Welles managed to create this masterpiece during his first spin in moviemaking: writing, directing, and producing it on his own. What many people don't know, and what Fincher is trying to tell us, is that the screenplay was primarily written by Herman J. Mankiewicz. Starring as the titular Mank is Gary Oldman, in another Oscar worthy role. Tom Burke plays the legendary Orson Welles, portraying him as kind of an annoying show off. Of course, Welles had a right to be prideful, he was making the greatest movie ever made. Fincher's Directing is sublime, I'm hoping with this he can finally win the coveted best director Oscar, which he surprisingly hasn't won yet. Also the cinematography is spot on, perfectly matching the feel of Citizen Kane. Ultimately this is a must watch for movie fans and i would be very surprised if we don't see plenty of this movie during awards season."
MANK,28 April 2021,4/10,Para mi es insufrible. Bien a nivel técnico y en dirección. Pero Gary oldman sobre actúa y la película se hace larga y tediosa.
MANK,10 December 2020,10/10,"It's hard to get me excited for movies these days and even with this one I wasn't sure what to expect. Black and white? Forget about it. However, this movie really delivered. Fincher's got massive balls for doing this film. He took a big risk making it, but it sure did pay off.It's a very talky and literary movie: people who appreciate screenwriting will totally dig it.The only reason I would imagine people disliking it is because of the black and white or because of Mank's political views.Whether you like it or not, this is one of Fincher's best."
MANK,14 December 2020,10/10,"Not a film buff, but a history buff. I've seen Citizen Kane, because you have to see the ""greatest movie ever made"" but not sure I every really understood it all. That was decades ago.But Mank places Citizen Kane in its historical context. You can already see the fault lines that led in later years to the ""Hollywood Ten"", the debates about what Hitler was going to mean to the world, the whole Hollywood scene of the 1930's when all of this was new, was beautifully portrayed. Upton Sinclair's quixotic (an adjective deliberately suggested in Mank) End Poverty In California campaign which did lead to Social Security being passed, even though Sinclair lost the election.Yet I suppose that those who know little or nothing about this period would find the film boring, as many other reviewers have."
MANK,16 November 2020,8/10,"As of now the best movie of 2020 for me, Gary Oldman, and Amanda Seyfried both gave amazing performances. And the directing, cinematography, and score were all amazing. Definitely recommend."
MANK,19 March 2021,1/10,"Both films are too shallow to comment.
Black and white films should not be shot in 2020.
Also life was never in black and white."
MANK,26 December 2020,,"I should start off by saying I'd watch Gary Oldman read the telephone book. He's great even in bad movies. I'm familiar with 30s Hollywood. I love movies from that era and the 40s. I liked this a lot, although I did think it was a little bit too long. I was surprised by Charles Dance; I thought he really captured Hearst. I vaguely remember Upton Sinclair, so that part wasn't very interesting to me. I say, if you like the Hollywood of Irving Thalberg, Louis B. Mayer, et al., give it a go. I was t disappointed. 9 out of 10"
MANK,21 March 2021,1/10,How can a movie with such fascinating characters be such a snooze fest? This movie achieved just that.
MANK,5 December 2020,6/10,"It's a super rated movie. It doesn't deserve. The film was well done, but the story is very warm, leading to a boring ending."
MANK,6 December 2020,2/10,"Even if all this is true, the movie was an obvious bore. Netflix cannot provide original balanced product."
MANK,17 December 2020,2/10,"This is definitely one of Finchers weakest films. One can see what he tried to do with the feel of the. period and all that but somehow it has not all come together. The first forty minutes, despite the amazing visuals, are dull, and the film only picks up far too late to be an engasging watch overall.
It would have been truly interesting to see how Citizen Kane came about but this film with its endless inside quips ends up alienating the viewer more than anything else."
MANK,20 December 2020,1/10,"A neighbor invited me over to watch this and out of politeness I couldn't leave. It was the longest and dullest evening I've ever spent in my life. This film really belongs on the Criterion Channel for people that agonize how old movies were made. Sorry, that's not me."
MANK,16 February 2021,9/10,"To me, the history of Hollywood and the making of motion pictures is as fascinating a story as the films that have been produced. Here Fincher honors that history with Mank. Gary Oldman delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Herman J. Mankiewicz a screenwriter for MGM studios. Brilliantly shot in black and white, we follow out title characters quest through studio heads, directors, producers, actors and even titans of industry to complete his best work yet. Oldman will win an Oscar for this performance."
MANK,20 March 2021,5/10,Tried to watch this but less than 30 minutes in decided to stop. A very stylized film with very stagey dialog. There was no believable interaction between the characters. Individual acting was good especially from Oldman but this would be a better stage play than what went on here. Filming was good but nothing seemed integrated on any real human level. Reminded me of Citizen Kane which was probably the point but I didn't like that movie and didn't like this one either. Seems like another self serving inside story of the Hollywood machine.
MANK,24 March 2021,8/10,"Mank is primarily a biographical drama focused on Herman J. Mankiewicz, the alcoholic screenwriter for Citizen Kane, played by Gary Oldman. David Fincher directs this 1930's homage to the great Citizen Kane, choosing to shoot in black in white to increase the film's authenticity to that late era of Hollywood. The film has a special significance to Fincher, as his late father composed the screenplay decades ago, but sadly the project did not come to fruition in his lifetime. Amanda Seyfried plays Marion Davies, a friend of Mank's and the wife of William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance), whom the character Charles Kane is based upon.Mank copies many of Citizen Kane's stylistic elements, including lighting, costumes, cinematography, and storyboarding. In Mank, we see a charismatic and well-liked man hamstrung by his addiction. The viewer gets a deep look into the duality between the character's excesses and triumphs. As in Citizen Kane, we see a ""Hollywood"" man on top of the world, only to be brought down to Earth by his own misgivings. The difference is that Mank finds redemption while writing his screenplay.The film takes place while Mank is bedridden with a broken leg, scrambling to complete his screenplay that would eventually become Citizen Kane. A series of flashbacks shows how Mank, once riding high as a writer for Paramount, hits rock bottom due to his alcohol induced self-destructive tendencies. Charles Kane shared a similar fate, once on the precipice of winning the gubernational election, but falls short due to the publicity of his extramarital affair, eventually withering away as a recluse in Xanadu.The opening sequences of each respective film are distinctly different, however, Mank begins with a wide shot of the clouds and open road, along with scrolling credits. Kane begins without any credits, besides Orson Welles name. After Orson Welles shows his name to the audience, there is a close-up of the ""No Trespassing"" sign, with an upward tilt across the chain link fence, eventually exposing Xanadu and the adjoining zoo. Fincher immediately distances himself from the character of Orson Welles, as he serves as an adversary in the plot of Mank, depicted as an angry egomaniac to complement Mank's suave charm. To this point, we often see at Mank's eye level in the film, instead of the camera angle tilted up to Orson Welles in Citizen Kane.Despite the few differences made necessary from the change in characters, we commonly see similarities in lighting and set design. In multiple scenes, we in inside of Hearst's mansion, where there are enormous spaces between the guests with flashy costumes and décor. Mank breaks the norms of the household, often choosing to drink and invading the space of those around him with subtle insults. Hearst has a vastly oversized king's chair, similar to the chair in Xanadu in Citizen Kane. Instead of feeling sympathy for Charles Kane when he surrounds himself with his wealthy possessions, we view the extravagance as grossly absurd in Mank.The lighting in Mank is often reflective of the title character's disposition in each sequence. In flashbacks when Mank's life is on the upswing, lighting and costumes are generally lighter. In the present, when Mank is struggling to write the script and moderate his alcohol consumption, he is painted in a darker light. At a particular low point in his process, the lighting goes to black, a fade out transition to another flashback. Both the fadeout transition and the use of flashbacks are commonplace in each film.The famous Rosebud shot with the snow globe is mirrored almost exactly, but alternatively we see Mank's bottle of liquor, empty and falling to the floor after he finished its contents. In Citizen Kane, Rosebud symbolizes the youth and innocence that Kane lost and was irreparably harmed for. In Mank, we instead see the alcohol that has consumed his life and brought him to his lowest point. Both symbols impress the theme of staying honest and having restraint to lead a fulfilling life."
MANK,25 March 2021,2/10,"David Fincher has created some of the great modern films. But this is one of the most slow, boring films I've ever seen. Black and white seems so pointless I don't understand the idea behind that. Doesn't help the film. If you want a film set in this period I'm sure there are a lot better films that were made in this period. Classic Oscar bait and no surprise the academy fell for it as it's all about Hollywood and it fits there agenda."
MANK,27 April 2021,1/10,"I had high hopes about Mank, especially following all the current oscar buzz around it. However, it was one of the most uninspiring and boring films I have watched in recent years. Cinematically well done? Yes. Historically based? Yes. Interesting? Absolutely not. I am a massive film goer and I have watched many bad films over the years like anyone else, but this is one of the only films I have ever fell asleep watching. I could not care less about the characters or the plot. The only reason this film was made is because rich white people in Hollywood love making movies about themselves and their exclusive history. Don't waste your time."
MANK,4 December 2020,1/10,"What a mess of script, it's not even about the writing of Citizen Kane. Horrible storytelling. Horrible cinematography. Save yourself time and skip it."
MANK,30 December 2020,10/10,"As i'm writing this I'm only halfway through this film. A minute ago I glanced through the reviews. Many writers of the reviews don't understand the essence and meaning of the movie. First of all, Gary Oldman is acting superb. The film is made in Citizen Kane style. Camera work is flawless. And yes, you need to watch Citizen Kane first and read about that genius Orson Welles. The dialogue is fantastic. Show some effort to find out why this is a great movie! This film stands out in the enormous debris the movie companies poor out over our innocent heads....."
MANK,16 March 2021,6/10,"""Citizen Kane"" is one of my fave movies of all time, so I was expecting much more from this. But unless you are a connoisseur of the Hollywood history, of who the characters from this film are, you won't understand much from David Fincher's movie.Watching this movie with my wife, who unlike me, didn't go to film school and didn't study film history, you see a lot of characters the are either funny or sad and a lot of dialogue that might not make sense to you.So, unless you, the viewer, don't know much about the 1930s Hollywood, you'd find ""Mank"" to be a little bit boring and not making much sense. And this review is from the point of view of a person that didn't studied Hollywood or didn't even see ""Citizen Kane"".Otherwise, the cinematography is gorgeous. It truly takes you to the 1930s - 1940s movies, the music also, and this, to me, are the only two phases where this movie excels."
MANK,8 December 2020,7/10,"As always, an exceptional Gary Oldman! The movie is relatively hard to follow and does not have cohesion, but thanks to his amazing performance, you stick to it till the end"
MANK,27 December 2020,4/10,So disappointing as such a stellar cast. Fincher wants us to feel like we are in a cinema with the audio echo and grainy b/w film. Soundtrack by Trent Reznor also a massive lure. But none of it stacks up.
MANK,6 December 2020,5/10,Man I love fincher but was bored to tears. Couldn't finish. Sorry I tried. Beautifully shot.
MANK,26 December 2020,6/10,"Interesting look at old Hollywood the first 45 minutes. Wells, MGM, Hearst, fascinating historic figures. A film not to be enjoyed by common folk, but film majors and Hollywood likes. The film then takes a sudden political turn. Why?Screen play writer trying to appease future woke employers. Just tell a story and don't take a side. Pretend it's 2010."
MANK,17 February 2021,8/10,"David Fincher successfully tackles black and white cinematography with an entertaining homage to '30s era Hollywood.At the core is a bedside view of the process (and politics) that went into writing ""the best film of all time"", Citizen Kane, by screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz.Gary Oldman is, of course, insanely good.
The writing leaves plenty of space to allow conversations to feel real.
And every now and then you'll see something familiar from Citizen Kane just on the periphery.Just when you think Fincher will make another OK Computer, he decides it's time to make Kid A."
MANK,10 December 2020,10/10,"Income inequality and blatant disregard for the working class may have prompted Herman J. Mankiewicz (Mank) to write a screenplay in 1940 that Orson Welles crafted into the greatest movie ever made, ""Citizen Kane."" With Hearst's fairy-tale lifestyle and conspicuous consumption exemplified by his monumental San Simeon Castle, Mank had the incentive to craft a compelling screenplay.You don't need to know the back story to appreciate the Netflix movie ""Mank"" where the writer's angst builds around W. R. Hearst's newspapers brutal propaganda against progressive author and gubernatorial candidate Upton Sinclair. Fueling Mank's fire is movie mogul L. B. Mayer, state GOP party chair, who produced phony ""newsreel"" interviews with ""voters"" that further destroy Sinclair's chances. The specter of ""socialism"" is the dog whistle employed then as it is now by the Republicans.Watch ""Mank"" in tandem with ""Citizen Kane"" where in an interview with the reporter ""Jed,"" played by Joseph Cotton, the case against Hearst/Kane is candidly stated. (""He did brutal things."") ""Mank"" connects the dots on the CK puzzle that has entertained many for almost 80 years."
MANK,30 March 2021,4/10,"I saw the film ""mank""from pure curiosity...as to why a black and white film is AGAIN nominated for another oscar. It didn't take me by surprise 😣 that my instinct was right. Except from some good moments of the main characters like Gary Oldman as ""Mank"", the writer of citizen Cane and some nostalgic scenes............"
MANK,9 December 2020,8/10,"It's been a while since I watched Citizen Kane and I love anything Fincher does and I like his little tribute to the man behind what is considered the best movie ever made. Interesting to see the real people that inspired the characters in Orson Well's masterpiece. Like in the title if you've seen citizen Kane it's for you, but if you haven't just give it a skip."
MANK,19 December 2020,4/10,"It was real work to watch this and as mentioned by many, often incoherent. So much really didn't work. I have studied Hollywood in the 30's and recognize many of the references but still I had to really work at seeing it through to the end. I get the conceit but feel too much time in flashback"
MANK,6 December 2020,1/10,"This is the worst movie I have watched in a long time. I could not wait for it to be over. Boring, annoying flashbacks. And terrible music. You have to trudge through 2 hours to get to anything interesting at all"
MANK,30 April 2021,9/10,"Don't waste your time with this if you can't appreciate a good conversation. Based on other reviews I was prepared to be bored. I loved it. Very cleverly written and well done. I mean, a movie about writing Citizen Kane done in the style of Citizen Kane, colored by Mank's character... what's not to love?"
MANK,7 December 2020,10/10,"I soon as saw the film's opening credits, it immediately put a smile on my face Upon finishing the film, I immediately watched it again."
MANK,25 December 2020,5/10,"I'd like to quote Mank saying: ""you can't resume a man's life in a 2 hours picture"" sure u can't, but David & Jack Fincher, could've done a much better job with not portraying Orson and Herman as enemies or rivals, but rather as friends, because that's how they was. We can see that Mank criticized W.R Hearst and blamed him for everything bad that happened in this world, but we can also see Mank as a deeply troubled person, jealous of course, because why would a beautiful woman like Marion love a jerk like Hearst, and why a jerk like Hearst must have all he wants when Mank risk to lose his job, that is half payed by Heast.How do we know that Orson Welles didn't write Citizen Kane's script? How do we know that he was not a close friend to Herman Mankiewitz?, and how do we know that socialism is that good?, and all capitalists are pigs (or crocodiles) ??These are all questions that bumped into my head when i was watching David Fincher's Mank, so i tried to dig up some truth a little.Apparently, Orson saved Herman from his suicidal drinking and also bankruptcy, he didn't want to 'exclude' him from the credits of Citizen Kane, in fact Herman played the unknown newspaper man in the film, i don't know why Netflix is portraying Orson Welles or Louis B. Mayer as monsters. but this is netflix what can we do?The plot so far isn't thrilling, Jack & David Fincher knew that, so they added a whole chapter of Herman's fictious friend Shelly blaming himself for a newsreel he made that caused his favourite candidate to lose the elections, then he killing himself, this has no meaning and makes the plot so loosy, it's obviously made to give an also fictious explanation of why Herman became alcoholic & troubled.Mank is a story about a man who's suffering from being different in a society where all the people are running after money, so he seeks sanctuary in alcohol, and sarcasm, he says when ms. Alexander (Lily Collins who played a character that has ironically, almost the same name as the real Ms. Susan Alexander, in Citizen Kane), asks him why he's never serious ""i can be serious only about something funny"" this is a movie about Citizen Kane, i expected a lot from Gary Oldman, and pretty much from all the cast, actors had so much opportunities to show their potential, and the most remarkable performance is by Amanda Seyfried,she portrays Susan Alexander very well (because Susan is a character made by Herman, it's known that Susan and Kane are Marion and Hearst in real life, so we should expect Susan from Marion, and Kane from Hearst), in the other hand, i expected that W.R Hearst (by Charles Dance) would be much like Foster Kane, but no we see a different person from Kane.what ruined it for me the most is that you feel like it's a movie about capitalism-socialism, not about an alcoholic screenwriter who wrote one of the greatest movies of all time."
MANK,20 April 2021,5/10,"I was boring movie with focusing on a period of time in cinema industry which needs spectators knows about every single relation and details in that specific area. The movie tries to use what is recently interesting ""40's decade-like-cinema"" to attract attentions. Although producing a movie about screenwriter is a new fascinating idea."
MANK,13 December 2020,7/10,"What a complex movie! exquisite acting and direction, the story it's a little fuzzy, but fulfills its goal."
MANK,6 February 2021,6/10,"What happened to Hollywood in 2020 to think that a movie like this might be a golden globe or Oscar favourite??? Really?
Gary Oldman's performance is excellent, just as one of the best actors of the last 30-40 years might be expected, but the plot? a ""we never understand where this is going, let's hope i don't fall asleep"" story.. everything too slow
Not a bad movie, but hard to understand where it goes from and where it goes to
Despite of it all, Gary Oldman definitely deserves an Oscar, but it's deserved from a long time
2020 was a really bad year for the entire planet, we dont need to let it be remembered to us by nominating boring films 🙄"
MANK,5 December 2020,9/10,"I just finished watching this movie. I've been waiting for this movie since the beginning of 2020 . (Mank) by David fincher is a journey into Hollywoods golden age .First of all you have to watch the movie citizen Kane witch was released 1941 , because the movie explains the story of the making of this historical film Citizen Kane.Dir david fincher creates again a great movie but this time he dispensed with all colors and made a black and white film to represent the era more realistically. You may think that the film was filmed in 1940 and was presented with beautiful directorial shots and wonderful cinematic paintings showing the struggle to produce this film. The Era and everything looked like the '40s, the sound effects, light, and directing style that 1940s filmmakers were completely using.The wonderful cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt takes the responsibility of shooting the movie as it was shoot in the 1940s to realistically capture the era and was excellent and identical to the filming of the 40s to make you feel as if you went back 70 years in time to live that period.
The text is more realistic than you think, as it was written by the late Jack Fincher, father of David Fincher, before he passed away in 2003 for health reasons. Why do I say that the text is realistic because it was written by an old man about a true story of an old man writing his last story, wonderful dramatic dialogues and jokes Politics and a drama that seems like the drama of a classic movie released 70 years ago.
Yes, Oldman gave the best performance in the movie calmly, the man who reached the end of his life and excelled in the perfect role to embody the character of ""Mankiewicz"" in a wonderful way. In the period of the Great Depression that destroyed the economy, the staff gave a quiet performance, and the viewer may notice the calmness of actress Lily Collins, who plays the assistant Rita Alexander in a good quiet female role with the performance of actress Amanda Seyfried, who played the role of actress Marion Davies, which the film did not focus on much except that "" Seyfried ""did the role excellently, as actor Tom Burke played the role of director Orson Welles, beautifully and as a real persona.""
The film was not disappointing, and it is definitely one of the most important films of 2020, and i expect it to participate in the Oscar race in a great way."
MANK,10 December 2020,8/10,"Many are giving this film bad reviews. In my opinion it is people that don't understand film noir. A retrospect of the ""so called screen play writer"" of Citizen Kane"". The fact that David Fincher can make this film with the feel of the 1940's with reel change ques and perfect whipes, I really don't understand what anyone has to complain about. Yes maybe we all don't know who the players are in modern times. That's up to you to figure out. ""I like the way you talk""! "" If I could swim, I'd be doing swimmingly"". All people are complaining about no story and it being unable to follow, it doesn't take a genius to understand that this is a film about the struggle of trying to destroy your advisories. DAMN THE MAN!"
MANK,7 December 2020,1/10,"I struggled to get through the first half an hour, let alone the the full movie. This has to be the worst movie I've seen this year. If you enjoyed this movie, then you were obviously strapped to a chair and on something. The movie had no storyline, incredibly hard to follow and wasted a talented actor like Gary Oldman. I find it profoundly disturbing that critics would even consider this for an award. It's reminiscent of the Mr Bean movie when Mr Bean tells David that all he does for a job is sit and look at paintings. David is in ore and admiration at this. The critics are David. Terrible movie. My best advice is to spend the next 2 hours painting walls then watching this movie, you'll find it more entertaining."
MANK,4 December 2020,,"Once upon a time, Steven Soderbergh attempted to make a 40s-esque noir film. The final product was a boring, convoluted missed opportunity that relied too much on quality over quantity. 'Mank' was thankfully not that. It's a modern Federico Fellini film. Certainly not his greatest, but it is one of Fincher's best. It's the writing of the late Jack Fincher that kept my eyes locked on the screen. Wish his script for 'The Aviator' was given a chance. The acting from Gary Oldman is fantastic and Oscar-worthy. The whole film is Oscar-worthy, from the production to the cinematography. Reznor and Ross's score is always an orgasm to the ears. Yes, you read that correctly. Maybe a tad be too long, but it's a film that I'll rewatch all this month.

MANK,10 December 2020,,Mann projected as mid 50s but he was looking as if of 80 years old.... He was presented of charismatic personality but unfortunately the whole his act was convincing infact boring... Perfectly depicted the old era but lacking grip on story and character...
MANK,23 December 2020,9/10,Checks all the boxes and achieves what it set out to do... honor to the master-film Citizen Kane. It's rare that a film is as fine as this. Very well done with all of the subtle layers one would expect of a film this ambitious.
