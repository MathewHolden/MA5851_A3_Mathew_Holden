NOMADLAND,8 January 2021,8/10,"Fern (Frances McDormand) is houseless and living in a van after losing her husband and her home. It's company housing. The town was wiped off the map after losing the company mine. Fern is roaming America, getting odd jobs, befriending fellow travelers, and finding meaning in the meaningless money world.This is a very compelling world. As much as any sci-fi story, this creates an unique world of its own. It is the world of the transient workers, the poor, and the disenfranchised. Frances McDormand creates a very human character. It's a very human story. It's all good and then it gets great. Bob's monologue is really special. ""I will see my son again."" is such a powerful moment. I would suggest a different shot for the ending. I would suggest Fern walking into desert instead of driving away in the van. I get the idea but walking into the sunset would be a poetic and more cinematic ending."
NOMADLAND,24 June 2021,9/10,"When people put themselves in vulnerable positions, bad things can happen. This is a human interaction movie which shows us believable people, meeting and gaining sparks from one another. Francis McDormand has become a premier actress. She's not attractive in a movie star sense, but she has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen in film. Granted, we don't get to see the harsh side of the equation, which would include theft, intimidation, physical harm, and mental illness. Nevertheless, I found myself transfixed. She worked so hard and her spirit was seldom defeated. How can people be giving this a one. It tells me how jaded we have become. I guess there is a faction that feels the need to take down something that is hyped as if they have some power in their shortsightedness. I'm not saying it is a perfect movie but to say it is paint drying? I guess there weren't enough superheroes or aliens in it."
NOMADLAND,2 August 2021,6/10,"""Nomadland"" is a new American movie that premiered back in 2020 already though. Took me until the second half of 2021 to finally watch this because I was surely going for the movie theater experience here. I also see this is a German co-production. Okay, that I did not expect honestly. Luckily, German media did not brand this as one of their own. I still kinda wonder where the German impact is. Anyway, the director is Chlo√© Zhao and she is still under 40 and now only the second woman to win a Best Directing Oscar. At the same time, she also won Best Picture (just like Bigelow back then) and was also nominated for the screenplay and editing. Having seen Zhao's The Rider a few years ago, I am tempted to say I liked that one even more than this one here, even if the gap is not massive. Both are decent movies. Still it feels as if Zhao focuses very much on lifestyle out there in the open with a connection to nature and also to America. Surely not a given as she was born in China herself. But her very first film over a decade ago (but less than 15 years) was in the English language already and like so many other she, in her early 20s then, launched her career through short films. Also nothing entirely new that she worked as a writer and editor on her releases. For this approximately 105-minute movie she adapted Jessica Bruder's novel. I am pretty sure the latter would not have expected her film to become a Best Picture winner at some point at the Academy Awards. Many other awards here. The lead actress is Frances McDormand and she already won her third acting Oscar and took home one in producing as well. More about her later on. Her howling moment at the Oscars was a bit difficult to understand as it is not just the isolation / lone wolf reference to nomads, but a story linked closely to the production of this film. The biggest surprise was maybe that the Oscar for cinematography went to another film because Nomadland really dominated this category all awards season long.So with McDormand she was not a safe pick to win this year in a really close Best Actress category. But in the end she pulled through in a similar scenario maybe like it was with her first Oscar win, even if now with her third (and fourth) there were probably even more potential winners. Her second was as safe as it gets though and also fairly recent, which may be the reason why this one here was so heavily-contested. But Hollywood seems to love her enough. She has as many acting Oscars as Streep now and all in lead even and more Oscars in total. Pretty impressive. Then again, she is probably not worse than Streep, so maybe not undeserving and honestly, she really is this movie here from beginning to end. She is in almost every single scene. Every time supporting players have a bigger impact, it is because her character Fern is nearby. Also pay attention to her character's name here and her real name. Not too different. With every other cast member, they went for the real first name. This includes David Strathairn who is always a welcome presence for me, even if the just called him Dave this time. All the other cast members are unknown. I know that Zhao in the past picked non-actors, locals for the part. People who originate from the area in which her films are set. So it could very well be you see some actual nomads here. They are pulling this off really nicely. I mean they do not have deep material or a really great deal of screen time, but moments like the bird nest speech were nicely handled nonetheless. The consequence is that this movie feels a lot like a documentary for the most part. The only exception are maybe the scenes during which Fern is with her family or at her friend's house in the end. All the scenes out there in the open feel as if you were actually watching nomads.And as good as McDormand may have been (and I said this is her movie), I would still say that some of my favorite moments came from the others. Strathairn of course with my personal preference, but I already mentioned the monologue of the dying woman about the bird nests. The one they compare to Santa is alright too, maybe if him opening up about his son near the end was a bit too much perhaps. I mean he never seemed this close to Fern. The scene when they say goodbye (or ""see you down the road"") to one character is pretty nice too. Or what people have to say at the camp fire. So yeah, a character dying from cancer is as serious as it gets, but at the same time we find out she has lived the life she wanted to life and is happy about it. There is a component of closure and fulfillment there. It's not depressing. There are also no really dangerous moments in here. The biggest drama is when a character accidentally breaks something from another character. No scenes where people are threatened by bears or bitten by snakes or something. In general, animals did not play the most crucial role here the way you could have expected from a film like this. You get her driving next to a buffalo on one occasions. Not a lot more. This makes sense though. It may include a great deal of wilderness and beautiful sceneries and landscapes, but in the end it is a documentary about humans and not about animals, a bit about the environment they thrive in. In general, you could see really many stunning landscapes here.Fern's isolation was also depicted nicely through her choices in life. She went away from her sister. Actually, she is so hesitant to ask her to stay for a while that she goes and asks a friend (or ""friend"") for money and there again it shows why she is simply not good with humans. This also shows when she is supposed to hold a baby during the final stages of a movie and we see she is just not like Dave and does not fit in there. She tried, but also did not fit in with her family earlier. Immediate arguing happens. Or take the scene in which she is asked if she can adopt a dog and says not. She is much more into her car obviously as we find out on several occasions. This is not about cute animal companions. More about finding others out there in the open. But most of all finding yourself. Look how she says goodbye to that dog. I mean she does not despise other creatures. She's just not good with them. Another thing I liked about the movie was the entire sound component. The music, but also how they managed to show the difference between noise (usually at her workplaces like Amazon and also kitchen work) and quietness or relaxation when she is out there living her nomad life. A really soothing experience at times, even if Fern always has to worry about making ends meet. Maybe not a movie you wanna watch when you are a bit tired. Not that it is bad or anything. Absolutely not. But there's good and not so good situations for all movies. In general, the main intention by Zhao here was to come as close to reality as possible and I think she succeeded nicely with that. Also telling that the ending is as simple and unspectacular as it gets. Make it a character study in terms of Fern, but also elaborate from beginning to end on what life mor modern-day nomads looks like. I think the film is set less than a decade ago in the past. Probably same time it was set in the book. Overall, there are tempting aspects of course when it comes to nomads and their lives (most of all, the focus on nature and the lack of big civilizations), but then there's scenes in which we find out she asks for discounts if she does without electricity or, even if included in a playful manner, the elaboration on toilet buckets on one occasion.Okay, that is pretty much it then. It's a decent film all in all, but the gigantic amount of awards recognition seems a bit exaggerated to me, especially Zhao's direction basically dominating awards season from beginning to end. Then again, most of the other contenders did not really blow me away this year. At least those I have seen so far. There is still a lot to go for. I have high hopes for Minari especially. But that is another story. I think this film here deserves a watch, even if I expected and hoped I could like this a lot more with my connection to nature and my liking in the lead actress. But yeah, it's going down a bit as well now, especially with her Oscar acceptance speech a few years ago. This one was better. Or I should say ""these"" in terms of the 2021 Oscars because she won several. I'm still curious what's up for McDormand next in terms of movies. Nomadland gets a positive recommendation and thumbs-up from me without really only very minor hesitation. It's also still far away from a good film I must say unfortunately and I doubt I will add one or even two stars on rewatch here to my imdb rating at some point in the future. It's still a solid enough mix of lightness and seriousness all in all and I especially liked that they did not try too hard to get in really many funny moments arising from conversation. The one thing this film surely does is feel natural. In terms of the setting, but also in terms of the characters and that is maybe the biggest achievement. So yeah, go check it out, preferrably on a big screen. I guess at home on a laptop or something and also if you are not that much into McDormand, it will maybe even be a tougher call if it deserves a thumbs-up. But then again, she rightfully said at the Oscars to watch this and others on the biggest screen possible and I agree with that, even if it's maybe not a film that will turn you into a McDormand fan like some of her others could. And that includes even her very, very old stuff like Blood Simple, even if that one barely got any awards recognition. But hey a movie about humans practicing a social distancing lifestyle and a great deal of isolation? Of course this had to win liberal Hollywood's Best Picture Oscar during the pandemic. Never in doubt. Now that's really it."
NOMADLAND,18 February 2021,7/10,"Nomadland is an exploration of people living in vans who are houseless.Some of the nomads have opted out of the rat race where you are saddled with a mortgage and an uncertain job. Others want to enjoy their retirement and live life on the road.Frances McDormand is Fern. She once worked in HR in a Gypsum factory in the town of Empire in Nevada. Her husband worked in the same factory.When the factory closed in 2011, the town died. Later Fern's husband died of cancer.Fern sold most of her belongings, bought a van to live in and travel the country looking for temporary jobs. Maybe Fern was just running away from her grieving.Fern is always meeting people and moving on. It is a world of hellos, goodbyes and see you down the road.Based on a non fiction book. This is a stark slice of life drama from director Chlo√© Zhao without a conventional story structure.Real life nomads talk about the challenges of living life on the road. Fern faces those tests such as repairing punctures. Later she needs money to repair her beat up van and has to contact her sister.This is a moody, introspective piece. It is at its best when the non actors interact with Fern. Some of them have to cope with illness and maybe reaching the end of their road.Nomadland does not romanticise this lifestyle. It is a hard road to travel. The granite features in Fern's face attest to that.Ludovico Einaudi's music adds a lot to the mood and atmosphere to the film."
NOMADLAND,26 May 2021,5/10,"Frances McDormand loses her job in Empire, Nevada and lives out of a van, working seasonal jobs at Amazon. She works less, vacations more, but has to poop in a bucket and give herself bad haircuts. She hangs out sometimes with folks like herself who celebrate their poverty as a way to getting back to nature to find answers and other BS philosophy poor people come up with. Like old Eskimo grandparents left to die, so are the nomads. They are the throwaways of society finding some solace in community.No one in this group was a criminal as in real life. The film was boring and theme-driven. I find it amazing that it was even nominated for best picture, let alone win the award.Guide: No F-word or sex. Brief distant nudity."
NOMADLAND,18 July 2021,9/10,"Or restless - and really going directly at some of the cliches or rather missconceptions people might have of people who do not have a home - sorry house/roof over their head - a consistent one that is. Frances McDormand fabolous as ever - I mean by now I reckon most know how good she is. You don't even need the Academy Award recognition as reference.She plays that role with such an ease that I caught myself, actually believing she is the character. And she clearly isn't. Of course some authentic people around her (who live the Nomad life, if that is what it is called) help set the mood. Many things may seem random - but that is what this life would be like. Which also makes it kind of unpredictable.Of course you have to have a love for a movie like this. There are so many genuine little moments ... that you may cherish or find annoying. Obviously this is aimed at a specific crowd. And while I did a double feature (I'm calling it that) with F9 as the second movie, I'm more than certain I was the only one who did this. And there won't be many who will watch both movies - certainly not both in the cinema.Which is almost as funny as seeing a movie theatre showing The Avengers in this movie - especially since the director also is responsible for ""The Eternals"" - a MCU project coming out later this year. Looking forward to that."
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,8/10,"If not for the presence of Frances McDormand and David Straithairn, one would almost consider this film to be a documentary rather than a fictional story. It explores the plight of vagabond folks living on the road between somewhat longer stops to work for a spell before moving on again. McDormand's appearance is almost shocking compared to prior films, here she looks haggard and ravaged due to circumstances forcing her to leave her once home town of Empire, Nevada, a location that no longer has a zip code due to the local Gypsum Company plant closing down, and taking virtually all of it's residents with it. McDormand's character Fern searches out employment at various locations, making enough to get by until the major expense of a broken down van requires reaching out to a sister for financial help. A certain sadness permeates the film, as one realizes that the freedom offered by living on the road carries with it a trade off, as relationships formed become at best temporary, and often times one is reduced to mending a broken plate rather than incurring an additional expense. Yet the handful of vagabonds we meet from place to place are always reluctant to offer their good-byes, rather having a more positive attitude that suggests ""I'll see you down the road."" This film will certainly not appeal to a large segment, as the pace is rather drawn out and is heavy on dialog, though the impact of the message will resonate for those of a compassionate nature. The film just earned a Best Drama Picture at the recent Golden Globes, and even though I generally agree with it's commendable IMDb rating, I'm not sure if that would have been the best selection against competition like ""Mank"" and ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"", but for those of a wandering spirit, it might certainly earn that distinction."
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,10/10,"Without a doubt, Frances McDormand has been one of the greatest US actresses of the past three decades. Humble and unglamorous, she's the opposite of the stereotypical movie star, making her Oscar wins all that more important. So it's no surprise that she now stars in Chlo√© Zhao's ""Nomadland"", as a laid-off woman traversing the western US. McDormand put so much effort into the role that many of her co-stars - many of whom aren't professional actors - didn't know that they were working with a professional actress.I've heard of Chlo√© Zhao for a few years, but this is the first movie of hers that I've seen. I now want to see her other movies. This is simply an excellent movie. The performances, as well as the use of visuals combine to create a look at the effects that the Great Recession had on countless people. Everyone should see this movie."
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,7/10,"No worldwide pandemic was going to stop Awards Season, and thankfully many films had been made before the lockdowns happened, including this film that was getting many award nominations, based on a non-fiction book, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Chlo√© Zhao (the first woman of colour to win, and only the second female). Basically, set in 2011, the United States Gypsum Corporation plant in Empire, Nevada is shut down, and the town's ZIP code was discontinued. Fern (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand, also producing) worked there for years along with her husband, who has recently died. Having lost her job, Fern decides to sell most of her belongings and buy a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon delivery packaging and shipment centre through the winter. Fern's friend and co-worker Linda (Linda May) invites her to visit a desert rendezvous in Arizona organised by Bob Wells (himself), which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines but changes her mind as the weather becomes cold, and she struggles to find work in the area. At the rendezvous, Fern learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road and meets many other nomads. When a tyre blows on Fern's van, she asks fellow nomad Swankie (Charlene Swankie) for a ride to town to buy a spare. Swankie berates Fern for not being prepared and they become good friends as she helps her to learn more road survival skills. Swankie tells Fern that she was diagnosed with cancer has a short life expectancy. She plans to make good memories on the road rather than spend whatever time she has left in hospital. They eventually part ways. Fern later finds work as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campground in Badlands National Park. There she meets Dave (David Strathairn), another nomad working there temporarily; she met and danced with back at the desert community. Dave falls ill, and Fern visits him at the hospital where he has emergency surgery. The two of them later take restaurant jobs at Wall Drug in South Dakota. One night Dave's son visits the restaurant to inform him that his wife is pregnant and asking Dave to meet his grandchild. Dave is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines. Fern takes a new job at a sugar beet processing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home in California. Her sister lends her the money, but questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why she stayed in Empire after her husband died. Fern's sister tells her she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family; she learns that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. Dave admits feelings for Fern and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days and heads to the ocean. Fern returns to her Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life. Fern talks to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and Bob shares the story of his son's recent suicide. Bob has the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again ""down the road."" Sometime later, Fern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to get rid of belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road again. Also starring Gay DeForest as Gay, Patricia Grier as Patty, Angela Reyes as Angela, Carl R. Hughes as Carl, Douglas G. Soul as Doug, and Ryan Aquino as Ryan. McDormand gives a terrific performance as the free-spirited woman plunged into a transient existence being ""houseless"", Strathairn is likeable, while the rest of the cast is made up of real-life nomads essentially playing themselves. This film shows an unforgiving, independent, and almost spiritual lifestyle, with social gatherings and a sense of community, connecting with nature, it has fantastic cinematography and a melancholic and soothing score by Ludovico Einaudi, it is quiet and quirky, but a most worthwhile drama. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay for Chlo√© Zhao, Best Film Editing, and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound, and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,6/10,"After her husband dies and she loses her job at a Nevada sheetrock plant that permanently shuts down (emptying out the entire town of Empire), a fiercely independent and stubbornly self-sufficient woman in her early 60s takes to the road in her RV. Unwilling to file early for Social Security benefits--and equally unwilling to put down roots with family or friends, both of whom offer shelter--she takes on a series of seemingly temporary jobs, living in her vehicle and stopping at various parks and parking lots to rest up before taking to the road again. Jessica Bruder's nonfiction book ""Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century"" from 2017 has become a very personal film for star and co-producer Frances McDormand, writer-director-editor Chlo√© Zhao, and a large cast of mostly non-actors playing themselves. Our heroine, Fern, is eccentrically driven and a hard worker, though the film's narrative--splintered and spotty and darting about--only allows us quick snippets of her days and nights. For instance, we don't know where the money goes that she earns working various jobs; we don't understand why having a roof over head makes her feel boxed in (putting her on the defensive, as if the road was a jealous lover); and we don't know why she prefers living a Worst Case Scenario lifestyle instead of formulating a plan to improve her conditions. Fern experiences the desert, the mountain forests and the ocean, and she loves the freedom nature allows her...but what are we to feel about her when she refuses help? I didn't find Fern particularly likable; McDormand plays her with a tight smile and quick, friendly herky-jerky movements (she's not anti-social), but we don't learn what makes her tick. She's a ""nomad"", a drifter, and always has been (according to her sister), so there's not a dramatic character arc here. Fern doesn't want a man in her life, she doesn't want a home. She's loyal, and a good listener, but she seems to be not just a hard luck case but a bad luck case. By the third act--when fellow-traveler David Strathairn hands Fern a baby to hold--I was more concerned with the baby's safety than enjoying Fern's motherly affection for it. **1/2 from ****"
NOMADLAND,11 August 2021,,"This is a fictional story based on real experiences as a modern nomad. While Frances Mcdormand is the star the ""cast"" also includes many real life nomads, people who are generally in their 60s and older and travel around in their vans, many working seasonal jobs all over to support themselves. The whole movie has a real authentic feel.My wife and I are in that same demographic, we are retired and chose the conventional life, in our home with a kitchen for food preparation, a bathroom with toilet and shower, and a garage for our cars. Pretty much the opposite of the people depicted in this movie. But we understand the life, we have been short term nomads, camping in Yellowstone one time, hiking Glacier National Park, motorcycling across the US, at times riding all day in the rain. But we always had our base to return to.We really enjoyed this movie, we respect the nomad lifestyle but also accept that it isn't for us. I wonder how the younger viewers, i.e. Those under 50, relate to it, if they enjoy it as much.We watched it at home on BluRay from our public library, the disc also has several interesting extras."
NOMADLAND,3 January 2021,,"I don't really understand this story. She makes some choices in the film, but the reason she makes these choices aren't explained."
NOMADLAND,21 November 2021,8/10,"Not 'homeless', but 'houseless'. Frances McDormand as Fern, packs a van and what belongings she has room for. Her home disappears following the close of a gypsum mine. She will begin exploring life on the road as a modern day nomad. On the road she will meet other nomads, who become her mentors in her new life. In a white van, she calls Vanguard, she becomes a member of the dispersed tribe of a subculture and movement of ageing liberal and unsettled Americans. A heartfelt story with breathtaking landscape as a back drop."
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,5/10,"""Nomadland"" is a movie based on the non-fiction book "" Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century "". It stars Frances McDormand. She portrays Fern,who initially had a satisfying life at Nevada. Then the Great Recession happened. She lost her job. Her husband died. In the end, she lost her money and properties and becomes a nomad living in a van travelling across the United States. She meets different nomads and interacts with them which presents the viewer of what nomad life is all about.The movie won three Oscars.One for Best Actress. No question that Frances McDormand is a great and talented actress and provided a good performance as Fern. Her character was interesting and viewers who are into melodrama will surely love her. The story (if there was one) focuses on her interactions with fellow nomads while on a road trip as she drifts from state to state. Nothing more.It also won Best Picture and Best Directing for director Chloe Zhao. Why? As a movie, this basically has barely a story. It just shows Fern just on a road trip drifting from one state to another while meeting different characters. It had a boring story that was exploitative as it presents the theme of depression and the issues of inequality in American society. Nothing more. Fortunately, McDormand saved it from being a complete disaster.Also, it tries to present a political message about the hardships that Americans that they have been facing for a few years now. It tries to paint a picture of poverty in the US. What is worse is that it does not present hope during these difficult times. Evidently, the movie was exploitative in the sense that it makes the viewer feel depressed especially during the difficult times of the pandemic.Subtly,it is political too. It also presents the idea the United States is on a decline if keep trusting the people Hollywood does not want to endorse and promotes something that it has been vocal about for a few years now.Overall,it is just an issues-based movie about poverty and inequality of society. Also,it is a woke culture promotion of social inequality."
NOMADLAND,9 June 2021,7/10,"Frances McDormand is ""Fern"", a lady in her sixties who has found herself rootless after her town has effectively been shut down by recession. She packs what few possessions she has into her van, and sets off travelling through the American west where she encounters plenty of like minded individuals who, either by necessity or design, are living similarly transient lives. The majority of the characters she meets are real life ""nomads"", and it is they who give the film it's potency - they are not actors, but they deliver with some aplomb a series of cameos depicting their lives, their problems, their motivations and their aspirations. These may be itinerant people in terms of their lifestyles, but they are convivial, bright, engaging, intelligent people with their own sense of decency and community that director Chlo√© Zhao does much to demystify. Essentially, these people are little different from their more static compatriots, living an existence that - especially in the winter - is both harsh and challenging. I struggled a bit with the dramatic parts of the film, though. The scenes with David Strathairn (""Dave"") seem to clutter up what is otherwise an authentically delivered effort to expose us to a way of living that the vast majority of us will never have experienced, and for the most part will take a fairly pejorative approach to. The excellent McDormand is in her element, and the intensity of the film is at it's best when she is amongst her new companions. It's not always an easy film watch - there are high points, certainly, but there are plenty of poignant moments where loneliness and isolation play their part; particularly in the winter when their accommodation offers little by way of shelter from the biting cold. The travelling folks take to the screen like ducks to water, a testament to the star and the director's ability to draw out some effective storytelling from a cast who, most originally, have an unique story to tell. Certainly thought provoking, just a shame about the unnecessary romance."

NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,8/10,"After the local plant shuts down, the town of Empire, Nevada ceases to exist. Widow Fern decides to travel around the country, working in odd jobs and living in her van. Along the way she meets some interesting people and discovers that her nomadic existence is not unique.The 2021 Best Picture Oscar winner is a wonderful, emotional journey. We initially sympathise with Fern, thinking what a predicament to be in, but then realise that this is what makes her happy. Rather than be sad for her, we should be happy for her. Similarly, all the people we meet seem to be the debris from the pursuit of the American Dream, but they're happy doing what they do - they don't want our sympathy.It's these realisations and the feeling of freedom that the people have that elevate the tone of the film. A few other themes are touched on: ageism in the workforce, corporate greed, the winner-takes-all social structure but thankfully these are not examined in too much detail. Rather than blame anyone or anything for the sequence of events that leads to people ending up on the fringes of society, these are presented as merely factors. Plus, once again, who says they're in a predicament?Great writing and directing by Chloe Zhao as she sensitively and deftly steers the film along its path. Her writing got her an Oscar nomination and her directing won her an Oscar.Frances McDormand gives an excellent performance as Fern and well deserved her Best Actress Oscar. However, it's in the supporting performances where Zhao's directing skills shine through. Many of the supporting cast are unknowns, many not actors, some actual nomads. Zhao effectively lets them just be themselves, giving the film a natural, unforced, almost documentary-like quality.I was expecting a more powerful, profound conclusion, however. The plot did seem like it was building up to something more jarring. Then again, this film is about the journey and not the destination: the profundity accumulates along the way, rather than is delivered at the end."
NOMADLAND,27 October 2021,8/10,"McDormand and Strathairn portray nomads, and other than the two of them, everyone else appearing as one actually is one. The authenticity makes the movie even greater than it already was. They travel around America in RVs, which they quite literally live out of, and work the jobs that no one else will. They're physically strenuous, disgusting, and/or poorly paid, and if even a single day passed where this work wasn't done, the rest of us would notice it immediately, and not take it well.All have to brace for the elements. They are sometimes shown empathy, by people who are in better situations, but often that is not the case. There are people who barely acknowledge their existence. Each of them has a story, and most of the ones we hear in this movie are real ones. This is exceptionally well shot with a tremendous eye for natural beauty and humanity.This features brief non-sexual nudity and a little mild language. The film is currently streaming on Disney plus and some countries. I recommend this to anyone who watches social realism. 8/10."
NOMADLAND,12 March 2021,10/10,"I cried through about 75% of ""Nomadland,"" and I'm not even sure I could explain why.Well, maybe I can. This past year, the year of COVID as I write this review, has been one of tremendous loss in many ways for almost everyone. Even if you didn't lose anyone close to COVID (I didn't), you said goodbye to life as we knew it and realized how many things we thought were mundane were the source of little joys once we could no longer have them. We said goodbye to a vision of America as a nation of people who maybe have their differences but are able to unite in a common cause when it matters most. I personally said goodbye to my Dad (from leukemia, not COVID). And the entire human race is constantly reminded that we're saying goodbye to our planet.""Nomadland"" taps into all of this sadness and just ruminates on it. It doesn't draw conclusions, it doesn't judge, it doesn't manipulate, it doesn't politicize. It's deeply melancholy but it's not depressing. It's about how hard it is to just be a human being living on this planet and the various ways we all go go about trying to find our way to cope with it. It's about community and friendship and how much those things can help stave off loneliness, but it's also about how, even with those things, life is still really lonely.Many people are reading ""Nomadland"" as a celebration of freedom from a certain kind of American capitalist doctrine that keeps us all enslaved in the pursuit of stuff. But I didn't read it that way. Our guide through the story is Fern, played by Frances McDormand in a performance so good she doesn't seem to be acting. Fern has lost pretty much everything as the movie begins. Her husband has died from a lingering illness. The factory that kept her small town employed has shut down and the town has literally disappeared. The nomadic life we see her living seems less like something she's chosen out of a spirit of rebellion and more like something she's been forced into. Likewise, many of the people she befriends along the way, played in most cases by non-actors actually living as nomads, seem more like damaged peopled gingerly finding their way to some healing rather than free souls taking charge of their own destinies. They all give the impression of being like Fern -- people who have rejected what America has to offer because it rejected them first.That's not to say that once thrust into this new lifestyle there aren't benefits and advantages to be had. We get a glimpse of some of the alternatives in a scene where Fern visits her sister and another where she spends some time with the family of a man she forms a bond with (David Strathairn, in an understated and excellent performance). Through small gestures and the look in her eyes, McDormand is able to convey that Fern perhaps wishes she could be happy with what these people have. They have family, friends, comfort. But she just can't settle. She's a restless spirit, was one before her circumstances changed, and is even more so in the aftermath. She doesn't seem to completely fit in anywhere, her loneliness is palpable, and if loneliness isn't a primary facet of the human condition, I don't know what is.I was blown away by director Chloe Zhao's last movie, ""The Rider,"" and my love of that movie and the praise ""Nomadland"" has been receiving from critics and awards groups made me worry that my expectations would be too high for it to meet. But they weren't. I'm not at all surprised that this movie is resonating so much with people. It's one of those movies that captures the feeling of a moment. We're a damaged, grieving nation, and Fern the character, though her specific personality and circumstances may differ in the details, captures what it feels like to be American right now.Grade: A+"
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,9/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Traditional beauty is nowhere to be found in filmmaker Chloe Zhao's extraordinary film adapted (by Ms. Zhao) from Jessica Bruder's 2017 award-winning book, ""Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century"". There are no breathtaking shots of majestic sites like the Grand Canyon, and the people we meet rarely bathe, and are not concerned with fashion. Despite this, the film can best be described as one of the most beautiful and most unique cinema experiences in years. Ms. Zhao provides a look at America's roads and landscape through the eyes of folks that society tends to overlook.A significant reason this film works is the incredible performance by two-time Oscar winner Frances McDormand (FARGO, 1996, and THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI, 2017). She plays Fern, a strong woman who refuses to let grief suffocate her. Her hometown of Empire, Nevada was erased from existence in 2011 when US Gypsum shut down the local plant, resulting in the town's zip code being discontinued a few months later. As if her town disappearing wasn't enough, Fern's husband passed away, leaving her with little evidence of a life to which she had grown accustomed. We watch as Fern packs up her van and hits the road.Her first stop is working at an Amazon distribution center during the holiday rush season. She lives out of her van as part of the company-sponsored CamperForce program. When the season is over, Fern hits the road again. We slowly get a feel for this subculture of van-dwelling nomads, young and old, who travel the country's backroads and keep to themselves, except when they gather to form a temporary community of similar-minded individuals. Fern makes it clear she is ""house-less"", not ""homeless"", and has nicknamed her customized vehicle, 'Vanguard'.Fern thrives on her solitude, but is also friendly enough to connect with others wherever she stops driving or works. She joins the annual gathering of Bob Wells' community/tribe, and her other odd jobs include acting as a ""host"" at one of the stops, shoveling sugar beets at a farm, and cooking/cleaning/serving at the famous Wall Drug Store in South Dakota. Along the way she befriends Dave (David Strathairn), a fellow nomad whose dreams don't necessarily coincide with Ferns. Respected actor Strathairn is the only other familiar face in the film, other than McDormand. Non-professional actors fill the scenes, most of whom are real life nomads kind enough to share their ways in front of a camera.Director Zhao has reunited with Joshua James Richards, her cinematographer on the excellent 2017 film, THE RIDER. Their work here is a masterclass in taking us into a world most of us know little about, and doing so in a way that combines both the intimacy of people with the scale of nature. Even the sequence where Fern revisits her past life is quietly emotional and done with grace, while also packing a punch. The music from Ludovico Einaudi is exceptional in its complementary nature and ability to leave the quiet moments unspoiled, while also driving our empathy and emotions. This is an extraordinary film with a superb performance, and one that is entertaining, while also proving thought-provoking at a time when so many of us are questioning the sustainability of our current societal structure, and wondering just who will toss a rock on the fire in remembrance.
In theatres and PVOD on Hulu beginning February 19, 2020"
NOMADLAND,24 June 2021,8/10,"Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in. Nomadland is a good movie, maybe not the happiest movie, but certainly food for thought."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,,"""See you down the Road."" Bob WellsNomadland may take the Oscar for best picture, and Frances McDormand as Fern may take it for actor. If not, then you will still see an unusual movie better than most screened in 2020.Bob Wells (see above) has popular YouTube segments that teach daily survival for those who have taken to the highways to survive a disinterested economy. In the fiction-verit√© mode, Nomadland chronicles the travels of widowed, disenfranchised Fern living in an RV and a life still ready to be lived in her '60's.Here's a road trip with no guns or sweat (at least not in the fall, winter, or spring) and a modified happy-go-lucky attitude except when you have to pay for a new tire or buy a newer RV. Fern grieves for her deceased husband by smelling his overalls and surviving best as she can now that she has no mining company to provide her with a tract home or daily food.In the drama's favor is the use of mostly camera-ready amateurs and pop-cult pros like Bob to take the narrative into entertaining stories and philosophies of the road. Even when Swankie reveals her cancer, she follows with a catalogue of reasons life has been good.The real genius of this road trip is combining the blue-collar heroes with only two recognizable stars, McDormand and David Strathairn as Dave, a potential love interest for her. The feel is it's about white blue-collar retirees surviving and finding friendship, with a couple of real actors (one a multiple Oscar winner) to anchor the aesthetics and imposing landscapes of Arizona, Nevada, South Dakota, and California. With music soft and low, we understand the characters without being manipulated.Nomadland is at least one of the best films of the year because it chronicles road warriors tattered by a thoughtless economy but, like Swankie, still seeing the beauty in a country that fights for its dignity:""The way I see it is that the Titanic is sinking and economic times are changing. And so my goal is to get the lifeboats out and get as many people into the lifeboats as I can."" Bob"
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,9/10,"""Nomadland"" is one moving emotional like drama that gives a grim look at life for one after better times have passed. Director Chloe Zhao made most of the film in a doc like close up feel as it was populated with many real life folks only the acting and interaction does it in small parts and moments of open roads, highways, and a western backdrop that helps give the film a feel of escape as the mood ask for hope. As you watch you see a nouveau West American like dream. As it's like a search for the lost American spirit for many.The movie is made from the performance of Frances McDormand(who's great and super in down to earth blue collar common roles) as Fern a weathered, wrinkled and past her prime middle aged widow who becomes houseless after almost losing it all once her job at her gypsum plant folds up in her local Nevada hometown. Then it's a journey of traveling the West in Fern's high mileage rattle trap Van in which Fern calls home too as she lives with the grid and grind while meeting other nomads(many were real life one's). One thing for certain as you watch you admire the strong will and determination of Fern as after her seasonal job at Amazon goes she still travels and makes the most of it. As the great recession simply will not ruin Fern. Really the theme of the picture can be classified as grim look at our country supposed safety net showing those in middle age have to develop a new journey and destiny seeking means of new hope.Really it's a celebration of real people and folks from stores, diners, rest stops, and a glimpse of wonder by seeing the open roads and beautiful lands of the old American West as this is well on display thru the film. During it all Fern and the others learn and live in the moment all while making connections in the meantime they reflect on the past as this movie for one teaches about loss, yet loving even after work, and family. As overall this film is about moving on and accepting change while remembering your past journey as the new open road and highways have hope and love with closure in the sunset."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,6/10,"'Nomadland (2020)' really is one of those films where 'nothing happens', a slice of life drama focusing on an elderly woman who lives life as a nomad. In reality, of course, plenty of stuff does occur over the course of the narrative. It's just that it doesn't really resemble a traditional plot. The main focus of the flick is the inner journey of its protagonist, which manifests itself as a series of character interactions and, for lack of a better term, set-pieces (though not the kind you may first associate with the term). It's a quiet picture filled with plenty of moments of gentle beauty; it's a serene experience pretty much throughout. On top of that, it's surprisingly engaging. There's never a moment that even comes close to being boring. Having said that, the movie does meander quite a bit. In fact, it's almost all comprised of meandering. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering what the affair aims to achieve. It just means that the thing is only ever so compelling, and that some of its moments seem ever-so-slightly repetitive. Strangely, the more traditional narrative elements (those involving actors other than Frances McDormand) are arguably less effective than the non-traditional aspects. As I understand it, the majority of characters are portrayed by real people who aren't aware that McDormand is acting when she interacts with them. At times, the film is almost like a documentary because of this. There are a couple of moments in which we see people really open up and express themselves in honest, brave and genuinely affecting ways. There's a slight sense of disingenuousness, though, because these people think they're talking to a regular person just like them. It's almost like their testimonials are being solicited, extracted under an icky false pretence (for instance, one man shares a deeply personal and deeply tragic story as a way of empathising with McDormand's own struggle - which, I'll remind you, is entirely fake - in an effort to console her). Still, this issue isn't too detrimental and its impact is actually more on the people directly involved with filming. Ultimately, the movie offers a close and subtly caring look at an underrepresented segment of American culture. It's an effective, understated 'slice of life' drama, but it's very low-key and is only ever so compelling. It won't be for everyone, but it's a worthwhile watch. 6/10."
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,5/10,"I'm really huge fan of deep movies with interesting plot. I like to watch films who don't receive a lot of attention from most of audience. But this one wasn't it. It was really bland, story line basic, it was just very, very average... Of course, it had great visuals and acting from main actress but that's all I can say about this movie. Did I like it? Nop, it didn't grab my attention. I've decided to watch this film just because it won several oscar awards but now I can say it's really overrated. I woudln't recommend to watch it because there are more interesting films."
NOMADLAND,25 March 2021,8/10,"The fact that director Chlo√© Zhao's 'Nomadland' is nominated for some of the most important categories Academy Awards and that it is even considered the main favorite for the best film of 2020 may have influenced my experience of watching this film. Don't get me wrong. 'Nomadland' is a beautiful and sensitive film, a combination of road movie, documentary and drama that tells a lot about America today, a film that I liked. However, its charm consists in simplicity and sincerity and there is no too much of a story in this film. It looks more like a European film, Agn√®s Varda's 'Sans toit ni loi' ('Vagabond') being the film that comes to my mind now as a term of comparison, than like an American production with a good chance of dominating the Academy Awards ceremony. Academy. It's an anti-Academy movie. Maybe it's exactly the nominations that make some (rather minor) minuses of the film that I might otherwise have ignored stand out. The heroine of the film, Fern (the wonderfulFrances McDormand) is a widow and no longer has a house of her own. She defines herself as 'houseless' and not 'homeless', her game of words indicating that she considers the caravan in which she probably invested her last savings as her home and the roof under which she wants to spend the rest of her life, a mobile home that she uses to drive across America. She is not the only one who chooses this way of life. Same as Fern, who had gone through the tragedy of her husband's illness and death and the ruin of the city built around a mining industry gone dry, there are plenty of other Americans who choose to live a nomadic life by traveling in their caravans on the roads of America, living close to nature and sustaining themselves from temporary and seasonal work. At one point another character tries to put this way of life into words by linking it to the historical epic of American heroes with their pioneering spirit, but Fern seems to reject this rhetoric. The reasons why she chooses this way of life are personal, although maybe not necessarily prosaic. So we are dealing with a road movie, in which the spectators of the film accompany Fern for a year in her journey. This is the America of simple people, of ordinary life situations, of the nature that envelops and overwhelms. I hope that my association will be excused, but some of the situations in the film reminded me the movies featuring Borat, the hero of Sacha Baron Cohen. As there, we are dealing with 'Deep America' and its people, but the approaches are opposite. Cohen seeks (and sometimes provokes) farce and behavioural extremes, Chlo√© Zhao immerses herself in everyday life and brings to the film the humanity of those she meets. The use of non-professional actors, people who do not act in a film but live their own lives on screen, contributes enormously to the authenticity of the film. Joshua James Richards' cinematography constantly makes the connection between the characters and the social environment (I like the excellent scenes in the Amazon hangars) or the surrounding nature, which is sometimes spectacularly beautiful, other times cold and hostile. The music, belonging to the Italian composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi, manages to be authentic, beautiful and expressive without ever capturing more attention than necessary. Frances McDormand, who succeeds in every new film in which she appears to give birth to another character, integrates here perfectly into the almost documentary style of the film. Her character being so consistent, I missed a more consistent narrative structure around. For more than two thirds of the film, the actress builds a complex, deep character that triggers empathy and makes us, spectator to ask questions. When the answers come, they seem too mundane. It is here that perhaps the director and screenwriter could have given up simplicity. Anyway, out of the films nominated this year that I've seen so far, 'Nomadland' is my favorite. Let's see if this film with an anti-Academy approach will convince the members of the Academy to award it any of the significant prizes."
NOMADLAND,2 July 2021,5/10,"A film that is undeniably unique and well crafted, but also one that should have no business winning best picture, at least according to me, Nomadland is a perfectly fine film, and one that I will almost certainly never revisit.5.7/10."
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,6/10,"The heart is certainly in the right place here, so I wish I had liked this film more than I did. It speaks to taking an unconventional path in life, one without the traditional conveniences but perhaps with more authenticity and connection to nature. There is a heartwarming sense of community and of helping one another even though these people are nomads, shifting across the country from one seasonal job to another and living out of their vans. By contrast, I know of many people living in houses next to one another for years who barely know one another. Director Chlo√© Zhao gives us beautiful scenery out in the desert and along the coast, and there are lots of touching little moments in what is a (very) quiet film.My favorite bit was when an old woman named Swankie describes the beautiful moments in her life kayaking, such as the swallows bursting out of their nests along a cliff face and reflecting in the water, which we later see in a video. What memories will come to mind when you're at the end, those heartstopping moments that at the time made you feel like you could now die, feeling like your life was complete?One of the disappointing things about the film for me was that it didn't truly explore the failures of capitalism, after its introduction mentions the closing of a plant that led to an entire town being wiped off the map. Ironically for Frances McDormand's character, this actually enables her to live the life she's always wanted - as her sister puts it, she always wanted to be ""out there,"" and as she herself puts it, something she hadn't been able to do for all the years of her marriage, because her husband loved his job and was popular in the community. There is a moment when she's visiting her sister and she rebukes the real estate agents talking about the strength of the market, something incredibly relevant for the period when the film is set considering the number of people ruined by the housing crash, but it doesn't go very far. The fact that Amazon is shown in a very rosy light when it's been such a predator towards its blue-collar workers was frankly pretty sickening.This is more about a life choice and that's fine, I've liked other ""beat of a different drummer"" type films, but I guess in this case I was hoping for something that dug into the systemic problems in America that's led to so many being crushed under its wheels.The other thing about it that wasn't so compelling for me was just how mundane so many of the things we see McDormand doing are. It's making an attempt to show the realism of this kind of life, but it's just not that interesting to see her menial tasks or how she goes to the bathroom in the van. This drags down the more inspirational elements, the community, the rugged beauty of the surroundings, and the character's strong sense of independence. It feels more like a missed opportunity than it does a great film."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,8/10,"What a congruous contradiction in terms is ""Nomadland."" It's a dramatic, fictional movie based on a non-fiction book. The expanses of the picture's scenic cinematography seem to demand being seen on the big screen, yet it's wide theatrical release is concurrent with its appearance on the home streaming channel Hulu. It's about hitting the open road and traveling the country when much of its audience remains quarantined at home. It's part of one of America's oldest, mythological genres, the Western, while also recalling pioneer days, but it's a ""neo,"" realist one set in the recent, post-Great Recession era of the 21st century. The ""nomads"" are mostly elderly, near or in retirement age, most of their lives and much of their memories in the past, while they set out for new work, adventures and personal relationships. Home owners taking to living and moving in vans and other automobile transportation. Real people and characters, participants and observers. An economy of extracting raw materials and manufacturing turned to Amazon fulfillment centers. The great outdoors remain, though, even if they've since been charted along the way with tourist spots, restaurants, utility poles, rest stops, parking lots, storage facilities and ghost towns. Painterly and awe-inspiring and familiar as though we've already been there. Distant and intimate. Free and not. Dawn or Dusk.I won't be surprised if this wins the Best Picture Oscar along with other honors. It also has enough and somewhat vague socio-political commentary or relevance that seems to be to the liking of professional entertainment critics and awards shows--even if in contrast to its geography, the mostly-happy campers are a rather homogeneous bunch with little to no sign of mental-health issues or dangers of the road. And she likes to work, but down with capitalism as presented by a subsidiary of Disney. With the reminder that I'm expecting a Prime delivery soon. Poverty depicted by millionaire producers, and two-time-possibly-going-on-three Academy Award winner Frances McDormand defecating in a bucket in a van. It's inside the mainstream enough to be viable, but so outside, including largely abandoning common narrative constraints in its meandering, open-road plotting, as to also be interesting.It works even if and maybe because it doesn't always. I love that the relationship between McDormand's Fern and David Strathairn's David doesn't turn into a clich√© movie romance, or that some families may become reunited and others not so much. Ditto abandoning the dog. I even like that she doesn't quit smoking and that other characters don't bother her much about it. The seeming lack of make-up and perfect hair styling. The monologues Fern listens to from reported real nomads playing some version of themselves make for some powerfully emotional scenes. And, again, to go along with Chlo√© Zhao's overall direction, the cinematography by Joshua James Richards is outstanding--recently, surely the best in merely recording nature, probably the most enjoyable to look at, and still up there conceptually with the daylight lighting and painterly compositions. It's the sort of road trip, manual labor and contemplative conversations that lend to rumination of various possible avenues. Big-picture topics no matter the limits of the frame and size of the screen for its vast horizons. Love and family or solitude and new acquaintances, wage slavery and job mobility, work and retirement, materialism and trash, remembering and moving on, life and death."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,,"A quiet, contemplative & engrossing portrait of the human condition, Nomadland brings the vandwelling nomadic community's way of life to the film canvas with a level of intimacy & understanding that's seldom seen in such stories. With a touch of serenity in every frame and compassion in every interaction, the story offers an emotionally enriching experience that seamlessly humbles the heart, mind & soul.Written, produced, directed & edited by Chlo√© Zhao (The Rider), the story follows a woman who journeys through the American West after losing everything in the Great Recession. There's a tender beauty & ethereal quality to Zhao's storytelling & characterisation. Her writing exhibits careful consideration, her direction brims with unfailing gentleness, and the addition of real-life nomads in scripted spaces helps bring an authenticity of its own.Further uplifting the experience is the sumptuous cinematography that captures those breathtaking landscapes with finesse while the unhurried approach allows the viewers to bask in the gorgeous sceneries with our protagonist. Camerawork remains composed throughout, lighting is perfect, and Ludovico Einaudi's music strikes an evocative chord with the heart. And then there is Frances McDormand who elevates it some more with her silent & stimulating showcase.Overall, Nomadland is an exquisitely crafted, elegantly narrated & expertly acted neo-western that approaches its genre from a wholly refreshing perspective, and makes for a spiritual ride that's not only riveting & illuminating but also ethereal. Establishing Chlo√© Zhao as a filmmaker of enormous talent & distinctive eye, her latest film marks a massive forward step for her career, ranks amongst the finest entries in Frances McDormand's body of work, and is a very strong contender for Best Picture Oscar."
NOMADLAND,18 May 2021,7/10,"Nomadland slowly wanders through a series of scenes that give us a peek into the thought-provoking lives of vandwellers. At times, it feels like a documentary, blurring the line between fact and fiction, and the sparse amount of dialogue seems mostly improvised. Perhaps this movie would have been even stronger as a documentary. In the end, there isn't much to the story, but I guess Nomadland is more about the journey anyway."
NOMADLAND,1 January 2021,9/10,"About 20 minutes in, we get just a taste of the underlying philosophy behind this literally hypnotic film. As our leaders, our self-proclaimed betters, drive us further and further into materialism and transhumanism, the collateral damage to those not at the tippytop of the foodchain leaves tens of thousands lost and alone. This film looks at those people and what they do to find peace. It is relevant today and likely will be just as relevant to historians of the future. Assuming there is a future."
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Nomadland"" (2020) was a type of a movie I've not seen in a very long time. It reminded me of Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" and some other of his works. It is a slow paced film but not boring for a second because craftsmanship of it was first rate.In a term of acting, this movie is a tour de force with a great Frances McDormand. She was like a true person that comes alive on screen - you can't really call it acting. In other words - she was brilliant. Were this movie also shines was superb directing, writing and cinematography. The look and overall feel of this movie is a bleak and stark and down to earth real. But at the same time a bit poetic.Overall, i really liked ""Nomadland"", but I'm not sure i would like to ever see it again. Its down to earth real account of life and we have more then enough of it each day. But in term of movie making - this is a pure gem."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,8/10,"It seems like that since this movie one the award for best picture, lots of people decided that they wanted to go and watch it, which I have to admit isn't all that surprising. There is nothing better to boost audience numbers than winning an Oscar, particularly Oscar for best picture. Did it deserve it? Well, I have to admit that it is certainly somewhat different, and I have been going through a number of these best pictures over the last few months, probably because I'm starting to find some of the other ones that I normally watch to be rather dry and boring.The interesting thing about this movie is that it explores a group of people - American Nomads - that seem to fall under the radar. Sure, racial justice and gender equality are important things, but there always seems to be movies coming out addressing these issues, whereas this movie explores the lifestyle of a completely different, and somewhat forgotten, group of people.These aren't the so call grey-nomads - the ones who sell their home, buy an RV, and then travel around the place in their retirement. No, these are people who have found themselves unemployed so they end up working wherever they can get work, and travelling to these places to work. They tend to be older, and low skilled labourers as well, which is why the protagonist Fern ended up working at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre. What was interesting was that there was no criticism of the workplace, and Fern actually said that not only did she like the job, but the pay was good as well.Another suggestion seems to be that there is a part of American culture that can't seem to settle down. Hell, there is a part of Australian culture that is like that as well, and I am certainly one of those people. I guess one of those reasons is because we have the ability to travel greater distances these days, and as such aren't tied down to one place like we used to be (and also that serfdom has been abolished). Another thing that stood out, though it wasn't necessarily discussed, is that these people tend to be more conservative, but that is usually the case with people who live in the country.The film felt like a documentary that followed a nomad around, and I probably would have expected it to be the case even if I didn't know the background, just not the type of nomad that they were referring to. However, I suspect that this is done on purpose. One of the interesting things is that there are characters in the movie that are being played by themselves, who are actual nomads. This, I also found quite interesting.In the end I have to admit that this wasn't actually a bad film as well, and it does explore a phenomenon that has arising since the great recession, and that is of the older American who now travels the country looking for seasonal work. Mind you, as a life style itself really doesn't seem to be all that bad, though I suspect that those living it would probably say otherwise."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,10/10,"Frances McDormand (Fern) experiences homelessness in such a humble and beautiful way by choice. Very much reminds me of Into the Wild (2009) where Emile Hirsch's character chooses not to live by the government's rules, some differences still similar. Nomadland is so lovable with the stories in it and ambience! The cinematography/scenery is beautiful and acting is so authentic!"
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,,"""Nomadland"" is about the life, or lifestyle, of a community of people, seen from the perspective of the protagonist Fern (Frances McDormand). At first glance, it is tempting to compare ""Nomadland"" to Odyssey. On second thought, however, the difference clearly emerges. While Odyssey is a journey with a beginning and an end, Nomadland just wanders, meanders and drifts, without any final destination. Characters encounter along the way appear, get out of the picture, then reappear later.While most of the people you see in the movie are real life nomads that make up the loosely defined title community, the protagonist Fern is fictional. Personally, I have particular empathy for her because I have experienced the same devastation, albeit as an outsider (external auditor), of a dying mining town. It was painful (even for just one week) to watch people facing the imminent fate of their hometown where they have lived their entire life wiped out from the face of the earth. Fern, unfortunately, is not an outsider. Empire, Nevada, the town that is synonymous with United States Gypsum Corporation, goes into oblivion with the closing of the mines there. For Fern, there is double calamity in that her husband Bo, a lifelong employee of the company, recently died.It would be easy to succumb to making this into a tale of grieve but Golden Globe winner director Chloe Zhao is way above that, as is our protagonist. Fern treasures the memory of her late husband, as she intimates towards the end of the movie ""I may be spending too much of my life just remembering Bo"". But then, she moves on, taking the only possession she has been left with, an old van, into her new life of Nomadland. Previous acquaintants she comes across keep making offers to take her in, which she courteously turn down. At suggestions of early retirement benefits by the bureaucratic institution, she claims that she can't get by with that. ""I need work"" is her brisk answer. ""I like work"" she adds, after a short pause. There is dignity clearly palpable.That is the movie, nothing more, and certainly nothing less. In that ""nothing more"", there is everything. Around the campfire, we are privy to worldviews that we don't get in stifled, developed, urban communities. They talk about a lifestyle of connection to the earth, with the possible downside being ""we have to take care of our own s--t"". Down-to-earth people with a sense of humour. The people of Nomadland are the continuation of a heritage of pioneers, as Fern's sister observes.
""Nomadland"" is beautifully filmed, best exemplified in a ""framed from behind"" scene (Zhao's favourite technique) with the panning camera following Fern at dawn along the campground, culminating in glorious sunrise. Background music is also wonderful, mostly piano, serene, a little pensive, and always charmingly melodic.It is a big surprise (perhaps even a huge shock) to many critics that McDormand did not win Golden Globe, perhaps the only miss among the major awards she has been predicted to sweep like she did three years ago with ""Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". It is even tempting to compare her two role in these two movies. Both are grieving, but for different reasons. Beyond that, however, there is a big difference. Mildred in ""The Billboards"" is trapped in anguished anger. Fern, while resigning to the hard reality (some inevitable, some reflecting the inadequacy of the human race), carries on with her genuinely friendly disposition, greeting and offering helps (albeit very small ones) to total strangers she meets along the way.While, as mentioned, none of these are professional actors, there is one exception, David Strathairn, who plays Dave, a man whose path intersects with Ferns frequently, with him eventually asking her to stay during her first visit to his family. ""I like being around you"", he explains. While Strathairn's exquisite works are too many to list, my personal favourite is ""Good night, and good luck"" (2005), the only Oscar nomination for this sadly under-recognized actor."
NOMADLAND,6 April 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a woman trying to balance her life while searching for her next job after losing everything. She is living as a van-dwelling and we follow her on her journey to the American West.I liked this movie very much because it had a nice and very interesting plot. It also contained many great scenes combining very well drama with loneliness. The direction which was made by Chlo√© Zhao, it was very good and she presented very well her main character, her story and her fears. She also did a great job on the way that she focused on her character and on some details that made the difference. The interpretation of Frances McDormand who played as Fern was simply exceptional and reminded me her interpretation on the movie ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". Lastly, I have to say that ""Nomadland"" is a nice drama movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that will make you think and consider life from a different perspective."
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,5/10,2.5 out of 5 stars.Nomadland is a pretty bad drama film about a lady Fern (Francis Mcdormand) who loses everything during the recession. After losing her husband. She becomes a modern nomad. Driving all around the mid west. Living in her van.The plot is decent. About Fern working multiple jobs on the go. Parking her van at camp grounds or parking lots. Living on the go. While her family and friends offer her a place to stay. But she prefers to be on the road.It does have a beautiful direction for the first half. After a while the film gets slow and boring. Fern just being on the road can barely go on for so long til the movie becomes unbearable to sit through.Francis Mcdormand did a great job with the role. The story and direction i could not get into with nothing really happening. It tries to have meaning but its hard to care for.
NOMADLAND,13 January 2021,10/10,"For just her third feature film following on from her debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me and the critically acclaimed drama The Rider, director Chlo√© Zhao has crafted one of the most humanly beautiful dramas of recent memory with Oscar frontrunner Nomadland.An adaptation of Jessica Bruder's novel that follows the van dwelling Fern through an American West odyssey in the wake of the death of her long-term husband and the closure of her entire town due to the great recession of the 2012-13 period, Nomadland is a transformative experience that will take those under its spell on a life-affirming cinematic journey full of heart, grace, humanity and soul, that is all courtesy of Zhao and her innate ability to capture humans and the emotions we all share.Whilst brilliantly lead by another awards worthy performance from Frances McDormand as the shy, caring and most importantly likeable Fern, Nomadland much like The Rider is littered with non-actors playing versions of their real life selves or even quite literally being true to their true selves and its incredible to watch Zhao bring these souls into her narrative here and witnessing Fern mingle and come to terms with her new life in this van dwelling community is authentically touching, more so than any conjured up characters or Hollywoodization could ever muster up.In many ways Nomadland feels documentary like in its capturing of Fern's ride through life and the American landscape, but in saying so its taking away from the beauty Zhao captures with help from her D.O.P Joshua James Richards, who manages to perfectly encapsulate proceedings in both an intimate and grand manner, with small moments such as Fern wondering amongst a gathering of nomads in the cactus strewn plains or Fern exploring a Mars like setting, Richards and Zhao have put thought and care into every little detail of Nomadland's visual storytelling.Backed by selected compositions from esteemed pianist/composer Ludovico Einaudi, there's no denying that Nomadland by design is an intimate small-scale film at heart, perfectly suited to its $4-$6 million dollar budget but so much of the film feels grand and without a doubt necessary to the time and place it has been released in, as many from around the world reevaluate where their lives are at, what's important to them and what makes our lives meaningful.It's a quiet film, a film devoid of grand moments by the typical definition but one where you will find yourself moved by nothing more than a conversation between two people (featuring one of the real life stars of the film Swankie) about Swallows and Moose and to think of what Zhao can bring to her next film, Marvel's high profile The Eternals, makes one very excited for a director that understands human interest and will no doubt manage to combine that with some stunning visuals and flair that should make her highest profile film yet another must-see.Final Say -A film deserving of the high praise it has so far received and is likely to get come this years untypical Oscar ceremony, Nomadland is an unforgettable piece of work by Zhao, her leading lady and all involved, as this moving and touching drama takes us to places few films can manage to inspire.5 buckets out of 5"
NOMADLAND,2 June 2021,8/10,"Nomadland (2020) was written and directed by Chlo√© Zhao.It stars Frances McDormand as Fern, a woman in her sixties who loses most of what she owned, and goes on the road in her van. The film is a road movie about the people Fern meets as she travels. McDormand won an Oscar for her superb portrayal. (She also won her fourth Oscar for Best Picture.)McDormand is one of the great actors of our generation. I learned to appreciate her acting when she starred in Fargo (1996). She won an Oscar for her work in that film, and another for Three Billboards (2017). My opinion is that each of those Oscars was well deserved.Nomadland is an excellent movie. What I don't understand is why it won six Oscars. It's good, but I didn't think it was great. IMDb raters agreed. It has a IMDb rating of 7.4, which means raters thought it was very good, but not outstanding. That's what I thought as well; I rated it 8."
NOMADLAND,14 April 2021,5/10,"Being poor by choice is very different from being poor without any choice. Only people living in safe conditions can make a poetic work about poorness. Nomadland is no bad movie but it is very hypocritical or at least a very naive movie. Most of the people ""travelling"" and conquering the West did this not because of a urge of adventure but because of the terrible conditions they lived in. They simply hoped for a better life, for the chance to build a safe(r) life somewhere in the West. Nomadland - a movie made by privileged people for privileged people who think living without any safety and healthcare and so on is adventorous or romantic. I bet people living in real bad conditions could tell you another story. And last but not least: those modern nomads use lots of stuff only modern society can provide them: cars, trains, trailers, gasoline, all the food and so on. One could be tempted to say that their ""freedom"" is nothing but an illusion.Anyway, technically the movie is well done, we get some nice pictures and the cast also works good (Frances McDormand, is without any doubt a fine actress). As we got a main actress, and a directress (and Asian ""background"" too!) and an en vogue story, I bet Nomadland will head straigth to get some Oscars. Okay movie, with some good moments, but nothing people will remember in a few years."
NOMADLAND,7 April 2021,7/10,"Nomadland (2020) :
Brief Review -A permanent journey down the road on transient spell of struggling yet fascinating life. Nomadland is quite an attractive and vibrat film if you really find the fascination from it, otherwise it's a great philosophy with boring seminars. It's not a typically nice piece of dramatic writing because the story doesn't add any sort of theatrical features, rather it is just a life exploratory on screen. After losing everything in the Great Recession, a woman embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad and finds an unknown meaning out of this meaningless life. To be god damn honest, yes Nomadland lacks many things in the writing but fortunately it covers all the minuses in other fields. The acting departement is as rich as a billionaire's pocket. Two times Oscar winner actress Frances McDormand is all set to grab the third Oscar doll. What she does in this film is sublime, unshaken and simply awesome. The supporting cast is fabulous and some of the real life nomads provide that natural touch of acting. The screenplay is flawless and has all the classy materials needed for a cinematic orchestra. Joshua Richards takes you on trip of an art/painting exhibition with his beautiful cinematography. Every frame captures the beauty of nature and artistic expressions of all the artists. The minimalist designing of Chloe Zhao's direction keeps the film relatable to the contents. Nomadland is specifically made for the audience who have patience and taste for quality framework. It doesn't entertain you a lot, it lacks the pace and several other dramatic elements but the overall product is surely satisfying. In a nutshell, Nomadland is a journey you don't expect but it rides you along very fine that you would have loved to expect it even though it's little unacceptable.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest."
NOMADLAND,30 March 2021,7/10,"The film, sometimes slow, gets boring, but when we understand the essentials of the work, we are enchanted, real characters, in a real work, lived for 3 years by Jessica, and I love Frances McDormand, fantastic, best impossible choice, Oscar would seem even trivial, how perfect this performance is, as if it were simple for her to be an unemployed widow at 60 ... Oscar this year is more intimate, valuing biographical works, beautiful, but tiring..."
NOMADLAND,29 December 2020,7/10,"Nomadland is a good look inside of nomad culture and way of living and i liked the way how was all of that shown and potrayed but there were some moments that fall flat to me.But lets still stay on good side, Frances here give a very good performance and she basiacly caried film on her shoulders and she will probably be nominated for awards but i just failed to connect with her character and she was very empty of personality or interes that would make her more captivating to follow.Nomadland is a film with a great performances that carries entire movie forward"
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland"" (2020 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Fern. As the movie opens, we are told that the USG gypsum production plant, located in Empire, NV closed its door in July, 2011, and effectively turned Empire into a ghost town. We then meet Fern, as she takes some clothes and other things from a self-storage facility. She hits the road with her van, in which she also lives and sleeps in. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon distribution center, where she befriends Linda, another ""van-dweller""... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this film is a labor of love by Frances McDermand. She bought the film rights to the book when it came out in 2017, and then approached Chlo√© Zhao to see if she'd helm the film. And so it happened: McDermand stars as Fern and produces, and Zhao, whose previous film was the excellent ""The Rider"", directs, produces, edits and writes the script (based on the book). The essence of the movie is how to deal with grief and overcome the loss of a loved one (in Fern's case: her husband). A sublayer of the movie is how the Great Recession affected swaths of people, creating these modern day nomads. The question then becomes: does Fern and Linda and others choose to live in their vans and RVs, or were they pushed by economic and other conditions? The film explores these issues brilliantly. Besides McDermand, David Stratheirn stars as Dave, and the rest of the case is made up of real-life nomads, playing a fictionalized version of themselves. The movie's photography is wonderful, and along the way we see a number of landmarks from the West. This truly is a road movie! Last but not least, check out the beautiful original score, courtesy of Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi. I'm going on record that if the Oscars are held this year (for last year's films), ""Nomadland"" will get a bunch of nominations including Best Film, Director, Actress, Adapted Screen Play, Editing and Original Score, and chances are that it will win at least 1 or 2 Oscars, period. (As a complete aside, if by chance you haven't seen the movie's trailer, give that a look as well. Sheer brilliance. Made the hairs on my arms stand up.)""Nomadland"" premiered last Fall on the same day at the Venice and Toronto film festivals, to immediate critical acclaim. There is good reason why this is rated 94% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The film received a limited theater run, opening this past weekend. The Tuesday early evening art-house theater screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay: 10 people to be exact. That is on the high range for most theater releases while the pandemic is still raging (many films I see get about 5 to 10 people; about a third of the films I see are private screenings, where I'm the only person in the theater). If you are in the mood for a gorgeous and moving film about dealing with grief and living a nomad existence, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,5/10,"I saw director Chloe Zhao's first two films at Spirit Award screenings in 2015 and 2017 and at that time complained that they were both lugubrious with paltry plotting. I am sad to report that despite displaying her consistent technical prowess as a director, Zhao still is unable to come up with a clever story that hits all the marks for a successful three act screenplay. Based on a non-fiction book of the same name by Jessica Bruder, Zhao taped interviews with various ""Nomads"" (self-described as ""houseless"" as opposed to ""homeless"" by the film's protagonist, Fern, played by Frances McDormand), and incorporated some of their stories into the film. Some of the actual non-actor Nomads Zhao interviewed are cast in the film and perhaps provide the most colorful moments as we follow the protagonist's journey.The plot focuses on Fern, who after losing her job as a result of the 2008 economic downturn (the gypsum plant she worked at closes) decides to put most of her possessions in storage and go on the road, living out of a run-down camper. It's noted that the town where she's from-Empire, Nevada-faces a mass exodus of its inhabitants, eventually leading to the elimination of the town's zip code from the postal service directory. To add insult to injury, shortly before she goes on the road, Fern's husband passes away, leaving her at first bewildered, only to take solace later on by embracing (by what some may call) ""rugged individualism.""We learn that because the Nomads are unable to subsist on their social security checks alone, they're forced to take seasonal employment to support themselves. Thus we follow Fern first as she takes a job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center and later other jobs including a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campground in Badlands National Park, a restaurant job in South Dakota and later at a sugar beet processing plant.As we keep following Fern, we're introduced to various real-life characters such as Bob Wells, a sort of self-help guru for the Nomad community, who runs a desert rendezvous in Arizona. Wells proves to be an interesting father figure to the community but has little to do with the plot involving Fern, possibly with the exception of a heartfelt conversation they have together at film's end in which he reveals the pain he experienced following his adult son's suicide.Less successful in terms of developing Fern's story, is a subplot involving another nomad, Swankie, who's facing a cancer diagnosis and decides not to spend her last days in a hospital and instead to go on one last vacation (it should be noted that Swankie's cancer is a standard fictional construct and Zhao uses it to manipulate our emotions-a completely unnecessary strategy given the rich backstories of the various real-life nomads).The Nomadland plot basically revolves around whether Fern decides to continue on the road or not. There's the friendship with Dave (David Strathairn) who eventually opts to stay with his son and daughter-in-law who have a new baby. Toward the end of the film Fern visits Dave at the son's house but declines to accept his invitation to live there in a guest house.Perhaps the crisis of the second Act is when Fern's camper breaks down and she's forced to take a bus to California to borrow money for repairs from her sister. All's well that ends well when the sister obligingly gives her the needed funds. The scene with the sister is indicative of Zhao's persistent desire to idealize her protagonist's situation-the worst the sister can say to Fern is that she was always ""eccentric""-nonetheless, she praises her, again for the previously alluded to ""rugged individualism.""In a sense, Fern is the updated version of the ""noble savage."" In the days when Native Americans were castigated as savages, there was (if I may utilize a Freudian term here), a reaction formation in which certain writers in the 19th century went to the opposite extreme and depicted them as uncorrupted outsiders, emphasizing an innate, essential goodness. The same could be said for certain individuals today of a more liberal, progressive bent who seek to help the ""homeless"" in all ways possible, ignoring other aspects of their self-destructive behavior and threat they may present to the social order.Indeed we only see Fern get angry once (when Dave breaks some of her dishes by accident) and the reality of community opposition to the nomad lifestyle is only hinted at occasionally. When Fern clings to her camper and refuses to sell it because she's constructed it as a special ""home away from home,"" it becomes painfully obvious that her possessiveness is akin to a tried and true hoarder which many of us are familiar with from a fairly well known cable TV program. Indeed the unhealthy interior of the camper is only hinted at also occasionally (Fern complains about ants in the van as well as having to relieve herself once into a bucket after experiencing a bad reaction to something she eats).Ultimately Zhao leans a little too much toward idealizing her protagonist and unfortunately McDormand can do little with a script that emphasizes a monochromatic personality. Fern is simply bland and seems to relish in avoiding conflict. And that's what Nomadland perhaps lacks the most: conflict!In the end, Zhao has her heroine Fern returning to the road, afraid to suggest that maybe everything is not peachy keen in Nomadland. Despite some beautiful cinematography and use of music, Zhao appears content to remain in her indie niche, lucky to win an Oscar for Best Picture but probably the last time that will occur."
NOMADLAND,10 February 2021,6/10,"'Nomadland' is based on a work of non-fiction - and it shows. It's a well made movie, but not a lot happens. It's the kind of movie where if someone asked you what the plot was it would be hard to answer. You'd basically just say we follow a woman around for 108 minutes while she travels around and changes job a lot. Some people seem to be falling in love with this movie, but I'm not quite sure what they're seeing in it that I didn't.Frances McDormand is critical to this movie being as watchable as it is. She is becoming one of the most likeable and consistent actresses working today. I do prefer her in roles like 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' where she has a little more sass and edge to her character. Here she is a little flat, but that's more to do with her character not actually having a whole lot to do throughout the film.I guess I just wanted more out of this film. I wanted it to be inspirational or moving or even just thought-provoking. I was hoping for a film more akin to 'Into the Wild'. I did get that sadly, and what I did get was pretty forgettable."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,10/10,"Nomadland (2020) is a movie the Mrs. And I saw in theatres a few months ago. The storyline focuses on a woman who lost her job, then her husband and then her community. She is a hard working survivor who lives in her van, does odd jobs for money, moves around the country interacting with unique people and living a life you can hardly comprehend. This movie is directed by Chloe Zhao (The Rider) and stars Francos McDormand (Fargo), David Strathairn (Lincoln), and Linda May. The storyline for this picture is truly compelling. There is so much going on even when nothing is going on. Her method of living and hustling alone was entertaining. The characters, writing, acting and cinematography was all out of this world. This is an epic masterpiece. I can't say anything bad about this movie. I'd score it an easy 10/10."
NOMADLAND,26 January 2021,9/10,"Frances McDormand will surely win her third Oscar for her role as Fern, a laid off worker who hits the road in a van in search of herself. Along the way, we meet an assortment of her fellow nomads struggling to survive in modern day America. Fern works an assortment of service jobs to pay for food and gas as she travels the American West. The scenery is breathtaking and McDormand owns this film. Many of the cast are real life nomads and it gives this movie the feel of a documentary. Not only is Nomadland the one of the ten best films of the year, but most likely the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,6/10,"6/10 - while expertly crafted and a good follow-up performance for McDormand after Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, this movie did not leave the lasting impact on me that it did for so many others"
NOMADLAND,30 October 2021,7/10,". . . behind America's largest home delivery company, which sort of rhymes with 'marathon.' Have you ever wondered WHY this trillion-dollar business empire so frequently screws up your orders, continually dropping off items that are broken, soiled or even totally random things you had no intention of ever seeing in person (especially during the Holiday Rush)? As NOMADLAND graphically details, warehouse employees working on order fulfillment (that is, trying to match goods to invoices, and attempting to secure the right stuff to be delivered clean and in one piece) seem to be a scrum of bums who've aged out of the Good Will program, who live in their vans in the warehouse parking lot, who need to work into their 60's and 70's because their loser 'careers' qualify them for just $550 month Social Security checks and who have at least one foot in their grave because they're dying from cancer or another Old Fogies Disease? When not at work, these warehouse malingering miscreants' bathroom consists of a five-gallon bucket in their van, and they enjoy fewer showers than Death Valley. So 'bottoms up' if you ordered a beer stein for the upcoming Yule Tide."
NOMADLAND,22 June 2021,8/10,"After stowing away her material possessions and hitting the highway, a widowed van-dweller roams the seasonal workplaces and temporary sanctuaries of the transient life. It's a lonesome road, one of fleeting connections and uncertain destinations; a solitary existence that's half choice and half necessity. I've noticed a certain sense of daydreamy romanticism floating around this sort of lifestyle recently, the glamorized prospect of working from a cel signal with the great outdoors as a backdrop, but Nomadland strips away much of that veneer in showing the other side of the coin. There's promise in such freedom, but also great risk, and not every van lifer is cut out for the harsh realities of such a compartmentalized existence.Frances McDormand drew a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of Fern, the wandering protagonist whose compassion leads her to make deep connections with similar spirits, but whose withdrawn emotional restlessness forces those relationships to remain decidedly brief. She's wonderful, as expected, with an expressive authenticity that can make the film feel more like a documentary than a staged drama. Evidently, moviegoers weren't the only ones taken by that convincing act: without a firm script, much of the film's dialogue is delivered by true nomads who happened into the indie-scale production and, taking McDormand for one of their own, opened up to her. That knowledge can cause the film to teeter a bit too close to exploitation, but it also lends extra credibility and sentimental power to the viewing experience.Gloomy but stirring, with a potent contemporary subject, a number of rich supporting characters (if they're actually characters at all), a beautiful photographic sense and a smooth narrative flow. It's a meaningful picture, if not an uplifting one."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,8/10,"A woman in her sixties who, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.Director: Chlo√© Zhao
Writers: Jessica Bruder (based on the book by), Chlo√© Zhao (written for the screen by)
Stars: Frances McDormand, David Strathairn, Linda May.Starring two-time Academy Award-winning firebrand Frances McDormand as a house-less drifter, Nomadland strives so very effectively to present cinema au naturel. Populated predominantly by a host of actual citizens and non-actors of this ilk, the film occupies real lives with mobile roots on more genuine spaces without a set in sight. Shot on rustic outdoor locations, floating movements and piercing stares shot at magic hours brighten undressed squalor into a vision of reflective richness. Rawness comes out of this movie's pores.Empire, Nevada, during the Depression of 2011. When the town's gypsum plant closes down, recently widowed Fern (McDormand), stripped of any reason to stay in what is becoming a ghost town, packs her belongings into her RV (camper van) and hits the road.The film spares us little of the deprivations of such a life, including primitive sanitary arrangements. But it finds beauty in solitude and the vast plains and rock formations of western America. You feel that this is a uniquely American experience, and not one for all tastes. Give the film time, however, and it will exert something of a grip on most.Scaling her signature fervor way down, Frances McDormand melds into the intensity and fragility of Fern. There are no shout-to-the-rafters rants or lashes of madness. Instead, she is understated beyond measure, scene after scene. In her performance, there is a steadiness to bear burdens, give witness, and provide empathy to fill canyons and vistas. That's the rawness to label and flesh out with clarity. McDormand's quiet resolution is the glue that holds it together; she really is outstanding."
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,10/10,"I haven't seen all the main films from 2020 yet but I would be surprised if another film surpasses this one for the best of the year. The film-so deceptively simple on its surface-is a striking work that can be viewed from a number of lenses. The film is an emotional journey of self-discovery and the restlessness that the Great Recession caused. It is also a gripping sociological work that gives an sympathetic hearing to a relatively obscure subculture. It is also a film that has one foot in the past as the formal elements of the film are clearly inspired by the classic Westerns. This story had to take place in the American west. This is a complex work that will be with us for a long time. It is everything a film should be.2nd viewing thoughts:I have just re-watched this movie on blu ray; it a tremendously engaging and emotional film because of its textual restraint and committed naturalism. The film refuses to get into any political polemic material but there's a straight forward condemnation of late capitalism if one cares to look-I don't know why anyone thinks the portrayal of Amazon is positive or neutral. On my second viewing the despair that late capitalism has caused in people of Fern's age, generation comes across. But so too does the appeals of the nomad life; there is a group of people trying to make the best of a bad situation. Everything about this film-from the acting to the visual construction-is paired down to the essence to the minimum amount required. There is an storyline about overcoming grief but the film works as a mosaic of what being on the road feels like. Fern's inner struggles-thanks to McDormand-are felt clearly but again the script refuses to provide pat and simple answers. It is clear that the grief has been or is being processed by the character but it is a naturalistic continuum. I think the film is primarily a Western-specifically a deconstruction of the Cavalry and Indian Wester, i.e. The movie is about suburbanites becoming unsettled-but is is also a gripping portrait of loss, grief and resilience."
NOMADLAND,19 May 2021,1/10,"This film start with a woman ""Fern"" moving things to her van, and she paying a man scene! As turnout, this film is about Fern need to live in her van from place to place, after her husband die, and have no place to live! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the working scene, overuse of e staring scene, and overuse of the calling names scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Fern back to her house, and drive away her van! That's it! Wasting time to watch!"
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,7/10,"McDormand character suffers as a result of her town essentially closing after the mine is shut plus her much beloved husband has died. So, she takes to the road and lives in her van, befriending the nomad community as she finds them and moves from place to place doing seasonal work.Extremely gentle, slow moving piece with a very low key performance, avoiding any form of affectation, from McDormand whose character just has to keep moving on lest she settles and reverts to her earlier life. It never loses your attention, both from McDormand, who is in every scene or the various characters she comes across. It also shows the beauty of the country and is supported by a delightful soundtrack. Perhaps not to everyone's tastes, it is decidedly a mood piece, but it is a charmer and a chance to view non corporate America for a change."
NOMADLAND,14 October 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is viewed as a relentlessly sad film by young people; but that is because they are young. The film is not happy-happy nor inspiring, but simply just a slice of real life as it is faced by older adults without a lot of money. Our society seems to value the lives of those with lots of money more than those without a lot of money. That is society's loss and a loss to people who think that way. This film is a bittersweet journey from where one has been to where one has never been before. ; and that is not necessarily sad or tragic. My experience has been that people are either land or water people. I am a water person; I must live near a large body of water. However, I spent several happy years in places where there was little water in West Paterson, New Jersey. Frances McDormand is picture-perfect in this film, as is David Strathairn, the fine actor from Eight Men Out. The rest of the cast are all amateurs, and they do a nice job. If you are over 70, you will enjoy this film; and many who will be older adults some day will also enjoy it by knowing there still is a future for you at any age."
NOMADLAND,9 February 2021,8/10,"Emerson, Thoreau and all those transcendentalist thinkers would have absolutely loved this movie.Frances McDormand....this just isn't fair. She literally can just wake up one day, decide to do a film, and then instantly become the frontrunner for Best Actress.This is such a beautiful film. For about an hour and a half, I am in Chlo√© Zhao's full and total control. It feels so personal and intimate. We never know too much about Fern until the end but she never feels like a stranger. Small moments inside of her limiting and enclosed van inform us a lot more about her life than fleeting lines of dialogue. It's these moments that get to you, it's these moments that cast a spell on you.Rooting for this to win Best Picture at the moment."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,9/10,"Quality.No surprise to see the hype around 'Nomadland', it's extremely well made and holds a lot of heart. Frances McDormand is the star, her performance is truly outstanding. A few of the other cast members, most of whom are real life nomads, merit props too - namely Charlene Swankie, who has one great scene. The cinematography and music, meanwhile, is stunning.Not much more to note. It's simply a terrific film, one that feels incredibly real."
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,5/10,"A bleak sad gray.story, set in a bleak dusty gray cold landscape, about bleak emotionally and economically lost people. And I wish that Writers: Jessica Bruder and Chlo√© Zhao had not taken a 'middle of the road' approach to this film. By that I mean it is clearly shown these people are there, some by economic circumstance and some by choice and some due to emotional confusion.By films end I felt ""Fern"" was there by choice. Or maybe she was the personification of all three issues. You choose."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,8/10,"I have to imagine 'Nomadland' is a hard sell for general audiences. There isn't really a plot, per se, beyond what any one-line premise conveys. Yet that's not the intention, anyway: 'Nomadland' isn't narrative fiction. It's a quasi-fictional portrait of America. And in showing us the country we don't see, it excels.Great credit (and much deserved accolades) are due to Chlo√© Zhao, who not only directs here but also serves as producer and editor, and who also wrote the screenplay. While there are characters, and a loosely scattered progression of events, this is not a conventional film. More than anything I'm reminded of short films of the sort that probe some esoteric concept, with free flow between scarcely related scenes that encourage audiences to draw their own conclusions. It's a style that's a unique challenge for viewer and filmmaker alike, even over a mere 5, 10, 15 minute runtime - and 'Nomadland' is a full-length feature.It does seem at times like the movie leaps too quickly from one scene to another; it becomes difficult to appreciate what one moment is conveying before we move on to another. Yet that also seems a bit appropriate, and intentional: after all, this is a story about modern-day nomads, who move from place to place and see many things without putting down roots. How perfect to capture that same spirit in the crafting of a film?Through that construction, and the scenes laid before us, there is indeed much to glean from 'Nomadland.' Opening title cards and occasional dialogue relating economic and personal, financial hardship work toward that end, as well, but only show a small part of the picture. The feature follows an individual on a journey, yet what it's really about is a lost sense of exploration, freedom, and openness. It's about the bonds placed on us by a society and economic structure that demands endless labor and rigid obeisance; the trade-off of opportunity that comes with uncertainty - and the confinement that stability demands.'Nomadland' explores, through protagonist Fern and the people she meets, the incredible diversity of our country, and the natural wonders it contains, that our societal structure purposefully keeps us from witnessing - a caged animal won't yearn for freedom if it doesn't know what it's missing. It examines the bizarre dichotomy between the found community that pops up in wide, open spaces, and the disconnection that's felt in those places where people live close together.It offers a perspective on poverty, homelessness, and class structure that gets lost for those of us who have known relative comfort. We so often are told to look down upon people who seem to have less, and live different or more austere lifestyles. Capitalism gives us false promises of elevation while also evilly casting any apparent lack - of material goods, of nebulous success - as a moral failing. But it's all a transparent illusion meant to put up walls where true community, and mutual aid, should exist instead. And 'Nomadland' gives us all this and more in the form of scene by scene snapshots, not unlike the glimpses of the independent lifestyle nomads lead.For seeming to do so little, 'Nomadland' says so very much.Zhao wears many hats for this film, and does so deftly, with skills as a writer that matches those of her editing, and direction. There are many beautiful shots in this movie, of landscape and person alike. Zhao expertly captures the far-ranging emotions of her subjects, which apparently includes some real-life nomads portraying fictionalized versions of themselves. That, too, lends authenticity to the picture, and greater credence to the themes and notions it touches upon. Moreover, the somewhat minimalist original score by composer Ludovico Einaudi builds still further upon the emotional heft in 'Nomadland,' to great success.A long time ago I would have said that 'Nomadland' isn't the sort of movie I'm interested in, what with the bare threads of plot and lack of narrative action or conflict. That's certainly not true any more, but it's still not the easiest film to sit through. Because this is a feature where what a viewer sees is far less important than what they perceive between the proverbial lines, and there is a great deal to pick up on as such.I can absolutely see why this has garnered so much acclaim, and so many awards. By the nature of how and why it is crafted, 'Nomadland' isn't going to be for everyone. Yet for those who give it a try and are open to learning, it is a fantastic cinematic experience well worth the investment."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,7/10,"This is the story of Fern, a woman who lives in her van. She gets seasonal work at Amazon, but it doesn't last all year. She wants to work but she is told she isn't qualified for anything. The town where she lived was abandoned after a sheetrock company went out of business. In this story, she meets other people living like she is and travels a bit. It's kind of a slice of life story. It looks like she has some choices when she is invited to stay with relatives or a possible romantic interest, but she says she could not do either of those. She goes through hardships like cold nights and a blown tire. She gets through the year and continues to travel."
NOMADLAND,30 March 2021,7/10,"This is just another of those life movies and just like any other life movie, it is good. The scenery in the film is beautiful, great cinematography with soft music adds a lot too. It's a film about the daily routine of a houseless woman and her experiences on the road. The film is extremely calm and watching it was a great relaxation."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"Beautiful film. Truly absorbing story along with a fantastic cinematography. Depressing movie and moved very slow. Easy to sleep through. The score adds to the emotional weight of this movie about moving on and Frances McDormand is, as usual, amazing."
NOMADLAND,31 March 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a fascinating film. A hybrid of sorts that blends the idea of a narrative story with something that feels very much like a documentary as well. It's moving in it's efforts to showcase these people that have left ""modern life"" behind in for the sake of a nomadic life, traversing the land in their vans and campers, questing for little jobs to keep things running as they live out their lives. No real connections or ties, just the freedom to go. Admittedly, a lot of these people embark on these journeys due to pretty depressing reasons but all the same it is a fascinating tribe of people engaging in this lifestyle that, I suspect, most people are entirely unfamiliar with.I feel like a bit if a naysayer for not giving this the rave review so many others have, so let me clarify before I get into why I don't LOVE it. For as fascinating and engaging as the movie is, I found the pacing to be a little too 'nomadic' for it's own good at times. I've heard people refer to this film as being poetic and I totally get that, I just don't think it worked for me personally to the same extent. It is spectacular and poignant and a fascinating watch but I think the nature of the film somehow prevented me from connecting with these people on a level I would have liked. It felt so much like an educational exploration of the subject that at times I just felt like I was watching a school video rather than a film. That said, minor complaint because this is a spectacular film and one that calls into question our quest for things and stuff and reaching these arbitrary goals in our lives while these people are out there enjoying freedom and self-reliance and also community in a way that most of us couldn't understand.I suppose the best way to say it is I really enjoyed this but I can't see ever wanting to go back to it again. Powerful performances, potent message, beautiful cinematography and yet it just felt like it didn't hit my heart just right. Yet, if this were to win Oscars I would totally understand it and not question or begrudge that in the slightest. Strongly recommend this to people, just be prepared for a slow, pondering trip."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,6/10,"Although it hardly matches the perfection so many critics have called it- NomadLand is a very interesting and somewhat slow journey into the mundane of poorer lives throughout America today. To start off, i'll focus on the flaws of the film. It can move at a rather slow pace, so much so at the beginning I really had to power through it- as it honestly was just kinda boring to watch. The film does provide some insight into people who live this way, which I found interesting, but I felt like there was almost a lack of something more- something missing to really tie this film together, as if it were settling instead of striving to put its own pieces together- almost feeling unfinished. Frances McDormand is great n her leading role. She isn't the best performer of the year by a long shot, but she does pack a raw and very personal energy to the character at hand that truly makes you care about her on screen. The other actors, or really real people on screen can be interesting to watch, but I feel Zhao's direction and formatting of story don't give a lot of room for us to embrace all the big small parts each supporting character may have. The cinematography is very grounded and visually beautiful to look at. The film is messy, but by the end you will feel remotely glad you spent the time watching it. It isn't perfect, but it's interesting, and maybe that's all it needs to be.My Rating: 6.5/10."
NOMADLAND,3 January 2021,8/10,"Nobody in the movie business lays everything bare , warts and all on screen quite like Francis McDormand .
Here she is playing a woman , who ,
after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.To say this is melancholic is an understatement.
It's a film about making decisions in life. Wether they are right or wrong decisions is open to interpretation and for the viewer to decide.This feels incredibly real .
I'm sure most is scripted but there are scenes that don't feel that way at all , especially with the nomadic community.It's a very contemplative film , hence it is very slow . Maybe too slow.While I really appreciated this film for what it is , I'm absolutely sure there will be many people who liked this more than me and I'm sure it will feature prominently at awards season .
If it does , then it should be Francis McDormand who picks up the awards , rather than the film itself."
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,,"What a shame that this phenomena, which has been present for centuries, and likely all of human and hominid existence, has to be treated like a poltical ""lesson"" by the author of the book and the makers of this film.
There are worthwhile moments in this film. But in the background, attempting to spin the story into something it is not, is a creative team with a hamfisted agenda that apparently are wannabe Steinbecks.
We know from much better, academic and reality based study and interviews of these modern nomads that virtually all are doing so by choice. Put almost all of these people in very good housing, with all the social support possible, and they still leave for the road.
Essentially the ""journalist"" who wrote the book wrote fiction and crammed her own imagined narrative into this. It is typical of the unethical journalism that has ramped up mistrust of journalists to record levels."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is a phenomenal drama that's emotional, intimate, engrossing and feels extremely natural. Frances McDormand gives a perfect lead performance and David Strathairn and Swankie are both great. Chlo√© Zhao's direction is incredible and the cinematography by Joshua James Richards' is amazing, consistently visually stunning and beautifully filmed. It's extremely well paced and the music is excellent."
NOMADLAND,7 January 2021,,"Certain movies could only provide you with the reality of life, the real peoples' tragedies they have to deal with, but these movies could never find an answer to solve the problematic situations, so it usually ended up with nothing but only gave you an endless question mark. This movie is exactly what I am trying to say here. There's no answer. Aging, poverty, job loss, sickness, love ones dead, people growing apart, drifting apart.There's only one better solution to your soiled dirty clothes of those drifters, the laundry marts all over the world. Without them....well, think about it.Some reviewer gave a very low rating of this movie simply because he or she hated a successful talented female actor whose market value and wealth over 30 mils, and her husband is even richer, a 60 mils worth. So he or she just couldn't accept to have a rich actor to play a poor drifter. I really don't know the logic of this particular reviewer. Do you mean that the role of this movie should be and could be only played by a hungry waitress around the Hollywood area?She's successful because she rightfully used her talents to play role after role in many box office ensured movies. She gradually added her fortune by playing authentically for being those roles in those movies. Audiences paid money to see the movies she signed on. Her money making career is not a crime or an excuse unacceptable. She is just an image of a motion picture projected on a screen. She earned her salaries by faithfully carried out what she was required to play. There's nothing for anyone to blame so illogically.This movie only deepened our sadness and hopelessness of a woman or a man when they become old, then one by one dying on the vine. Poverty is not a crime but a cancer that got no cure at all. Don't believe America is the greatest and the richest country in the world. The greatness of this country only belong to those 1% rich people here, and the distance between these rich people and the poor is light year apart. It'll only getting worse and afar.After I saw this depressing movie with my wife, our only thought was:
What monthly bills in the mail that we might receive after the mailman left tomorrow? So if we couldn't help having such scary thought, it only proves that we are in the lower bottom of the so-called greatest and richest country of the world but still, I won't blame Frances McDormand becomes richer and richer, 'cause our poverty really got nothing to do with her and her husband."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,9/10,"IN BRIEF: Frances McDormand creates another vivid character in this lovely episodic travelogue.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Before I begin this review, I wanted to share a little story. Many years ago, a friend once decided to quit her job, sell her house, buy an RV, and travel the country. ""There's a big world out there"", she would say. And that is what she did. I thought it a bit mad, and many other closer friends shared in her excitement and kept track of her destinations with occasional postcards that were from the ""Welcome to"" series. As months passed, communication tapered off, lives went about their business, and dear Lois was forgotten. Three years later, I heard that she returned, booking a room at a nearby hospital, only to die of cancer. I saw her once before she passed, but she had no regret and many stories to share about her journeys before taking her final trip to the afterlife. After all that upheaval, I still never truly understood her obsessive and odd behavior. To give up everything and take to the roads? Totally alone? In search of what? After seeing Chlo√© Zhao's mediative ode to travel, Nomadland, I finally understood her pioneering spirit.This thought-provoking film is an insightful and joyous celebration about life. It stars Frances McDormand and she illuminates the screen as an American outcast and Everywoman. It is a quiet but far-reaching performance. Ms. McDormand has played this loner character numerous times and she has perfected it into an art form here. As Fern, she chooses the vagabond life, a lifestyle called vandwelling, and heads to the hills in her beat-up white van for some adventure and enlightenment. She gets the occasional odd jobs to support her road trip and meets colorful quirky figures on the road again and again. Some of these characters are played by non-professional actors which gives an air of authenticity to the film. But, mind you, it is the incomparable Ms. D. who holds your attention.Along the journey, she meets Dave (the talented David Strathairn, the only other real ""actor"" in the movie). Their attraction is the centerpiece of the film and the two professionals create a convincing bond between them. Their scenes together encompasses the issues of aging gracefully and being aware of life's random moments.Ms. Zhao is a driving force here. Not only does she direct and edit the film, but she writes the screenplay too (based on Jessica Bruder's novel). Her sensitive vision is a thing of beauty. She fills the screen with haunting images of this country and a deep appreciation of nature's wonders. Many moviegoers might find the pace of the film too leisurely done. The director gives more screen time to build characters and situations that are varied in their point of view.The literate screenplay is filled with wonderful fitful moments to experience and we, as moviegoers, learn the awe of living. Do not expect a real plot. It does not exist. The film is a series of episodes that come and go, just as Fern does on her daily encounters. Ludovico Einaudi's soundtrack and the cinematography of Joshua James Richards underscore the poetic vision of the film.Nomadland is essentially a fine character study, with the main character being America. After all, there's a big world out there and this small independent movie is a big little picture of it. (GRADE: B+)"
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,8/10,"The film is very realistic, rare for an American film capturing grief with subtlety. Ludovico Einaudi's composition for piano (Low Mist Day 7) is wonderful and appropriately used in the film. The performances of Frances McDormand and David Strathairn (reminding me of Strathairn's work in Sayles' 2000 film ""Limbo"") carry the film, Director Chloe Zhao is a talented editor. It richly deserved the Venice Golden Lion and Denver's Rare Pearl awards. The cinematography is commendable, too."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,1/10,A Very monotonous film where nothing happens except the main character travels boring places and has several dumps on screen. If this is your kind of film enjoy. Not for me.
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,10/10,People stories. A person's story told slowly. There is a beautiful melancholy in this production. The characters have authenticity. Francis MacDormand's face alone deserves an Academy award. Every micro expression tells the story. Beautiful cinematography. A truly masterful movie. I give this film a 10 (minimalistic vastness) out of 10. {Drama}
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,7/10,"Not an ordinary movie of these times. Because it has no sex, explosions, punches, blows or shots. Only love, friendship and solidarity. Fern (Frances McDormand) is a nice woman that travels through American West, working here and there, helping people and visiting family and friends. She has always good words. No conflicts are seen. And the performer McDormand does an excellent job in her role. A movie that brings you calmness and goodwill."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,8/10,"It's commendable that a Chinese national, Zhao Ting can so perfectly create such a poignant testament to the trailer nomads of the USA. The way she paces and edits her own work is a joy to the eye - there's poetry in each sequence of her film. This is also attributable to the outstanding work of her director of photography; Joshua James Richard - his stylish use of a camera with strong, steady images, is nothing less than superb. Zhao also balances her use of music to its most evocative form, and features inspired use of the ambiance compositions by Italian Ludovico Einaudi, from his '7 Days Walking' sessions. Her images, with his music blend in perfect harmony, creating many high points throughout this engaging picture.In this case, it's good to see Frances McDormand away from her now predictable, overly dark Cohen Bros works as well as other over-ripe roles we've seen. She's perfect as the somewhat lost soul, living with her memories and finding it difficult to allow herself to become too close, even when some offer her the comfort of a bonding relationship. McDormand's nude scene added nothing to the story (they rarely do) but was at least tastefully done, but that said...how many places will there be in this dry desert landscape, where you can find an Oasis that no one else seems to know about, and you can swim naked, without fear of leeches, snakes, and 'human' predators? Might this seemingly romanticized scene possibly have been shot in some hotel or a closed studio set, and likely added as an adult rating grab?Slipping co-star David Strathairn in amongst other roadies works quite nicely, and he's a welcome addition to this work. I realize it takes all kinds to make a world, still, when this obviously lonely woman gives up the offer of a loving home life, to go back to all the desperately looming problems yet to be experienced on the road - might be a rather long bow to draw (?)Taken overall, Nomadland is one of the few recent movies to earn its nominations and awards (despite the absence of over-the-top action and effects) simply for its heart and soul. It sort of seems a pity Zhao has been wooed by the big-time, with a blockbuster Marvel Comic slated to be her next - It's to be hoped we may see more of her doco-like humane work. Also, how foolish is China to censor one of its higher achieving citizens - because she's been critical of some aspects of China's policies - their loss, our gain."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,6/10,"NomadlandFor an Oscar movie, usually a byword for a worthy and tediously correct political statement, this movie was surprisingly watchable and perhaps even moderately enjoyable. Let's not go unduly overboard here I would not pay good money to see this film but for a freebie it's worth a punt!Whilst superficially simplistic this movie sought to develop several themes concurrently. I was left unconvinced these were tackled in any coherent way!These were:There is such a thing as community, here it is!There is a great and noble American tradition to be a drifter,Being close to nature reminds you of your human frailty and sets the soul free,Closure can take many years and comes in many forms, and it's not over till you dead,We all have a personal story to tell and no two stories are the same, a trite observation.The script writer sought to magnify the simple personal story of Fern, played by Francis McDormand, an eccentric drifter who chose to live an unconventional life without family ties, into a statement of humanity living in a capitalist society where the ""dollar"" speaks to decide your destiny. This really didn't work as initially we, the viewer, were led to believe that due to her husband dying and her workplace going bust and her lack of family she had fallen on hard times, however it was subsequently revealed that she had always shunned conventionality and living in the van was her choice. My casual observation is Fern had unaddressed mental health problems that subsequently took years to resolve on their own and this ""working out"" was the major central theme of the move.The ""nomadic"" American tradition is more just a pragmatic reality of near destitution in a society that has a vestigial national health service and social security system. The tone of the movie tried to establish not just this ""noble"" tradition but also some romance, respect and admiration with music and sweeping vistas however this was crass and grated in the obvious reality of defecating in a 5 litre bucket and unaddressed, drug, alcohol and mental health conditions.The acting had moments of subtlety from Francis McDormand but mostly we lacked any real range of expression, and we had so many meaningless blank expressions we were verging into continental art house movie territory. The pacing was slow bordering on stop and really nothing happened except a portrayal of banal human existence.I can give it a weak 6 out of 10, mainly for the camera work but as for the rest it was dull, very dull!"
NOMADLAND,24 June 2021,7/10,"Nomadland is a boring film. There is very little plot to this film; and it's not the most interesting of character studies. Frances McDormand was good, but in a very subtle way. I'd certainly never have thought of it as an awards-worthy performance. The cinematography is very good. There are some beautiful landscapes. The score, which was necessarily good considering how many scenes there were of Fern just walking around camp sites. The casting of actual nomads was praise worthy. At times it was difficult to tell who was an actor and who was a real nomad. Much of this film sees Fern simply sitting down and talking to these people, hearing their stories. In a way it felt like a documentary rather than a drama. In terms of achieving what it set out to do, you can't really criticise Nomadland too much. Clearly, considering its awards success, it was a well made film. However, being a technically well made film doesn't necessarily make it an enjoyable one. 'Nomadland' is yet another example of a film that one would appreciate and respect while at the same time desperately willing it to end."
NOMADLAND,16 April 2021,4/10,"Saw the advert and thought it looked quite interesting - I was wrong!I do not have a clue how films like these get such high awards and praise except perhaps that the shill reviewers must be working overtime and all the toffy-nosed cognoscenti who know the price of everything and the value of nothing film-wise but like to pontificate about a films deeper meanings give it high praise in their equally vacuous review websites.There are no deeper meanings in this film it is just a random travelogue of scenes stitched together like a speechless documentary and not a very good one at that - Don't let the ever so clever crew fool you, this is boring , tedious and will only appeal to those with their finger where the son don't shine to put it politely or as my father used to say ""up their own kazoo""!"
NOMADLAND,31 December 2020,9/10,"... and in the end, all we have is what we remember. A thoughtful, contemplative and reflective piece of storytelling, riven and scored with meaning and significance, your interpretations uniquely your own. With outstanding performances all round, as sincere as any you will encounter in film, brought to life through great direction and translation with captivating, mesmerising cinematography and the sublime Frances McDormand."
NOMADLAND,13 March 2021,,"For it's entire history, the U,S. has been marked by it's wanderers. Vagabonds. Drifters. It's nomads. Whether they be Native Americans, the early European explorers, pilgrims, frontiersmen, hobos or Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Always searching. Many settle down, but others are driven either by choice or by circumstance to continue their peripatetic ways.Jessica Bruder's 2017 non-fiction book of the same name took a look at how the last great recession in the late 2000s and early 2010s created a new Nomad culture. Writer-Director Chloe Zhao (THE RIDER) took a passage from the book about an industrial town in Nevada which literally became a ghost-town overnight and draped it around a fictional character in the form of Fern (Frances McDormand). Widowed, without a job or a real place to live, Fern fashions a home out of an old trailer and hits the road. She takes seasonal work at places like an Amazon warehouse and at small dives here and there. Along her travels she encounters other displaced citizens, many also living out of their campers. Eventually, she joins the culture herself.Zhao isn't creating so much a narrative here around Fern, as a sense of what the road means to her and the other characters. Indeed, the road itself is as much a ""character"" as any of the people. Still, it's the folks such as an elderly woman known only as Swankie that form both Fern and the viewer's perception of the Nomads (most playing themselves including Bob Wells, who has become a guru to the movement). David Strathairn is of one of the other experienced actors on hand, playing Dave, another rover who takes a liking to Fern. But, Dave is woven into her script skillfully by Zhao who is creating more of a mosaic than a true ensemble, much like Robert Altman at the height of his powers. When Fern briefly exits the road to see her Sister and another family, it's as jarring to the audience as it is to Fern. While a house with a roof and a yard may be the American dream, Fern and the nomads know all too well that this may not be their ideal - but, that it's also increasingly out of reach for many.Even though it is set a few years ago and was shot in 2018, NOMADLAND has had a special resonance during this pandemic era. It's been a year where many people have had to deal with economic and physical pain, but also deep loss. There's been a yearning to connect with others. To communicate. To feel. Add in the long decline in the Middle class (especially those once connected to ""good, steady jobs"" and/or a pension) and the nomad experience has been felt in some way by many who would never have imagined that it could happen to them.McDormand's lived in, committed performance (she even stayed in a trailer herself for some of the shoot) anchors the movie (she helped initiate the project as well). Without a lot of dialogue, she brings an honesty to Fern, who's greatest attribute outside her will, may be that she's a good listener even when she remains resolutely stubborn. She hears people. Zhao's unhurried direction and Joshua James Richards' camera linger over the characters' faces and on the endless landscapes, but, not is a picturesque way. Abetted by Ludovico Einaudi's wistful score, Zhao creates a contemplative mood where the viewer can participate. To connect. It's an immersive experience, and a mighty fine achievement."
NOMADLAND,31 December 2020,9/10,"Of course the writing, directing, and acting is fantastic- everyone's already praised that stuff to hell and back (if this sweeps the Oscars, it won't be surprising).
But there are several more interesting things that made me realise this was great:1. Saw this at a packed cinema on New Years Eve and people were actually quiet and respectful. No one was distracted or talking; everyone seemed immersed.2. This film spans from the end of 2011 to the start of 2013, but if it had just kept going up until the present day, I genuinely think I could've just kept watching.3. I kept waiting for the movie to get Hollywood or cheesy or overly sentimental, but it never happened, yet stayed engaging and compelling throughout.4. Frances McDormand will probably get another Oscar, but really, the whole cast is great. There are people who are only in this movie for five minutes or less, yet still make such an impact.Overall, a must watch for sure."
NOMADLAND,21 April 2021,2/10,"Nomadland was everything I thought it would be and less. I was fairly confident this would be a bit dry and bland, little did I realize that it would have virtually no plot either. I'm all for a film that explores the lives of nomads who are living on the road, often because big business (and/or the federal government) left them with little or no other options. But if that's the story you want to tell, and you want to use the real people who are living this lifestyle, then just make a documentary. Instead of trying to make their stories fit into a non-narrative wander through the wilderness by Frances McDormand, just interview these people and make the entire thing about them. There's some interesting stuff to be gleaned from those real moments when we see the nomads living their authentic lives, but then we're jarred out of that by suddenly seeing that same bland expression from McDormand or the simple smile from David Strathairn.I hate that Nomadland wants to have it both ways. It wants to be so real and down to earth, but then it still wants to be a film with planned scenes and clunky dialogue. I had no interest in the main character, and the fact that she is just randomly roaming from one scene to the next with no variance in her routine was kind of mind-numbing for me. I was bored through most of the film. On occasion there would be a real person that was placed in the spotlight, and you could tell that they were sharing something heartfelt. Suddenly I'd snap to attention, because they had something important to say. But then it would cut back to Frances McDormand wandering around on her own, and I'd check out again. To be fair, my opinion on a film I don't enjoy is always made a little bit worse when I'm told how great it is before watching it. The list of accolades for Nomadland are almost too many to be counted, and I was just sitting in front of the TV shaking my head and begging for it to end."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,9/10,"This is so unlike the traditional Best Pictures. It's quiet, when others are boastful. It prefers simple, over peril. It's a beautiful film that doesn't toy with the pain of its subjects. They have no choice, but do not want to be pitied.McDormand is fantastic, it looks fantastic; it's simply a fantastic movie."
NOMADLAND,30 September 2021,7/10,"Based on the book by Jessica Bruder: In 2011, Fern (Frances McDormand), a recent widow in her early sixties, has lost her job in small-town Nevada. After selling most of her possessions, she buys a van and lives a nomad life, taking seasonal odd jobs at various places and connecting with fellow van dwellers who gather in various open spaces.Director/Writer Chloe Zhao also edited the film in a very unique way. Nearly all scenes are in tiny snippets. Sometimes, a few short scenes are part of the same segment but there are rarely extended scenes. For the most part, this style pays off in its own special way.The film has a very unconventional story that is more like a steady pace of the day-to-day with few surprises and few tragedies. The tragedies that are expressed are not in the story itself but more in the narrative as some of the characters recall their difficult pasts. Only a couple of scenes have impact beyond the routine of Fern's life: one includes a conversation she has with Swankie, a fellow nomad. Swankie is aware of a bad health situation and wants to travel to Alaska one more time. Her reflection and outlook about her past make for a touching monologue and the actress (Charlene Swankie, a real-life nomad) does a wonderful job in this segment; the other special group of scenes involve Fern visiting her well-off sister. Their short conversations provide the viewer a glimpse of Fern's personality via her past. The film would have been richer with more segments like this one.At first, ""Nomadland"" seems to be about the 'underclass': those whose lives were turned upside down due to the economic downturn of 2008. But more interestingly, it seems to also be about unusual souls who might actually prefer lives separate from mainstream living and rules. This certainly seems to be the case for Fern.While the film's subtle approach says a lot, it would have been stronger with more exploration of Fern and the other characters. It seems to just touch the surface. But the unique style, the beautiful music, and the stunning vistas and photography make ""Nomadland"" a film that causes serious reflection that lingers well after the film's completion with questions like 'Do I have anything in common with these folks?'. And putting the focus on real people who are mostly ignored is another praise for the film."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,10/10,"As Nomadland reflects current America it focuses on the massive underclass that has been increasingly marginalized, impoverished. It took an immigrant woman like Chloe Zhao to respectfully acknowledge them.The opening title cites the annihilation of a sheetrock-based town called Empire. The town died when its industry died. No government aid came to the rescue. Even the mail zip code evaporated. Of course when even a real item steps into a fiction it transforms into potential metaphor. Hence this microcosm - America as Empire - has collapsed.Why sheetrock? It's a basic element in construction, a mix of paper and gypsum, of the ephemeral and the stable. Absent this fundament of construction the society disintegrates. So Fern drifts among the uprooted, finding there the community denied her in ""normal"" society.Why ""Fern""? The name evokes an essential vegetation, an outline of foliage, but a sprig of life against that landscape of desert and rock. The desert loses its foliage. Kid sister Dolly remembers Fern's bravery and insightfulness - the hole she left when she left. ""That one's on me,"" Fern admits.The narrative is framed by Fern's work at Amazon, the new ""empire"" of American commerce, that giant that is replacing the community of small local retailers, with its bargains based on new exploitation.As it refers to the community of wanderers, ""Nomadland"" is also a variation on No-mans-land, in two senses. It's not the space between two conflicting parties but the national cost of the class war in America. That's less a war than a tyranny.The term also de-genders the original. The most moving testimonies come from women - Swankie, Merle, Linda, with Fern our figure of identification and entrance. Gender is no issue here. There is no sexual tension or threat. The one possibility of romance - suitably performed by the two prominent pros amid the effective amateurs - stays platonic.To the contrary, Frances McDormand plays Fern as a sentient but wholly de-romanticised woman. Her skin is as dry as the desert, with saving fertility in her feeling eyes and smile. Her bowel scenes frame her de-romanticising of the usual heroine - and of the mythic American Dream.While the women embody courage and generosity, the organizer of the RV community, Bob, has the traditional patriarchal emblems of Mosaic mane, beard and rhetoric. As the poor are always with us Bob can confidently say ""I'll see you down the road."" Given their narrowed range of mobility, the poor will meet again, especially when this confidence embraces the afterlife. That's how the group see off their dead.Bob's purpose is to rescue the workers the society has exploited and abandoned: ""The way I see it is that the Titanic is sinking and economic times are changing. And so my goal is to get the lifeboats out and get as many people into the lifeboats as I can.""
The lifeboat image echoes Merle's coworker Bill, who worked too late to enjoy retirement on his sailboat: ""So I retired as soon as I could. I didn't want my sailboat to be in the driveway when I died. So... yeah. And it's not. My sailboat is out here in the desert."" The image of sailing on the desert encapsulates their hopelessness - and their saving dream, community.In contrast to the unregulated capitalism that has reduced them, these nomads are mutually supportive, generous within their maximal limits. Their ""business"" is giving or bartering. The people who have virtually nothing exemplify what the people who grab everything might consider ... trying - to share the nation's wealth. To serve the common weal.The film benefits hugely from its largely nonprofessional cast, using their own names. Swankie's reminiscence of epiphanies - the moose, the little white swallows on the water - feel like memories that can't be scripted. Thoughts of her dogs pulled Linda back from suicide. This is life bursting free from someone else's script, as the town and the Empire could not.Then there's the paradox of ""real"" estate. As Fern points out, ""It's strange that you encourage people to invest their whole life savings, go into debt, just to buy a house they can't afford."" This may offend the real estate agents in the house, but it feeds Fern's distinction that she is not ""homeless"" but ""houseless."" She has a larger home than the sheetrock can define, as she acknowledges a larger community than herself.In these examples of mutual support the personal means the national. America has forgotten the promise of its Empire, equality in citizenship and opportunity, a refuge from the foreign tyrannies and injustices. That's the resonance of Fern's explanation why she stayed in Bo's beloved Empire after he died: ""He loved being there, everybody loved him. So I stayed. Same town, same house. Just like my dad used to say: 'What's remembered lives.' I maybe spent too much of my life just remembering, Bob.""
America's key forgetting is the loss of her defining ideals. This is how Dolly explains her vagrant sister: ""You know, I think that what the nomads are doing is not that different than what the pioneers did. I think Fern's part of an American tradition."" Fern is what America was when it was a dream of freedom, equality, a supportive community of independents. Before the Empire died. Before sheetrock became its only concept of construction."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,7/10,"Fern is a nomad. Partly not of her choosing and partly because of her choosing. Having always been a wanderer, Fern embraces the nomad lifestyle as a way to cope with her husband's death, who was a nomad himself. Nomadland is an ambitious film that astoundingly feels like a documentary. That's because, in many ways, it is. The nomads we see here are real ones. They aren't actors. In many ways McDormand herself feels like an authentic nomad in the role of Fern. Chloe Zhao gives a sweeping view of a downtrodden America that is as humble as the characters themselves. In these times, where humanity lacks any positive exposure, that is welcomed."
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,8/10,"Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological structure that explains how people will obtain their basic needs before attempting to fill psychological and self-fulfillment needs. In the current American culture, these basic needs of food, water, warmth, rest, and safety are usually met by living in a house. Of course, there are plenty of strings attached to household living-such as a steady income through employment. While this is the most common way to reach self-fulfillment, people out there manage to achieve it without living as part of the standard American structure. Nomadland (2020) is an intimate look into the society of people who-for lack of a better term-are houseless. Part of me was jealous of the amount of freedom these people have to live the lives they want, experiencing much of the natural beauty of the middle of the United States. Much in the same way that Nebraska (2013) captured the realities of the flyover states, Nomadland presents a part of the country that most who live on the coasts rarely get to experience. In fact, it does such a good job of representing this region that I'd almost consider Nomadland to be a pseudo-documentary. As someone who has chosen the standard route of buying a house and working a job until I retire, it is somewhat frustrating watching some of these people try to survive when the simple answer is to settle down. That being said, the hidden message in Nomadland paints a picture of a healthcare system that sometimes forces individuals into these kinds of situations. Settling down isn't so simple when there are extenuating medical circumstances. And despite the isolation of these nomads, their community seems tight enough to overcome the loneliness that must accompany them with their freedom. A pseudo-documentary of living life without a house, I give Nomadland 4.0 stars out of 5."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is based on Jessica Bruder's novel of the same name. A woman named Fern(Frances McDormand), loses a lot during the recession. After this, she goes on a long trip across America, living in a van & becoming a nomad.Nomadland is a great film. Director Chloe Zhao has given us a movie that is super authentic, in depicting the lives of American nomads. What's highly impressive is the extremely realistic approach taken by Zhao, throughout the film. Chloe Zhao deserves all her accolades & nominations for Best Director. The cinematography by Joshua James Richards is mind-blowing & is the highlight of the movie. Richards has captured the American landscape, beautifully. The only flaw of this film, is that it's quite slow. The plot progresses at a snail's pace. This is the only reason why Nomadland doesn't deserve Best Picture at the Oscars, though I pretty much know it's going to win, after sweeping the award at all the other award shows. However, Zhao, Richards & Frances McDormand deserve to be frontrunners for Best Director, Best Cinematographer & Best Actress, respectively. Frances McDormand gives us another performance of a lifetime, as Fern. McDormand nails the portrayal of her extremely complex character. David Strathairn is amazing as Dave. The supporting cast is memorable. Nomadland is a must watch for its technical brilliance & unique story. Just watch it with lowered expectations."
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,7/10,"Frances McDormand is an interesting character actress to watch, one that uses her character actress looks to disguise the fact that she is, in fact, a strong leading actress that draws our attention to her in whatever project she is in. This facet of her on-screen personae is going full throttle in her new film NOMADLAND.And, thank goodness it is, for without McDormand on the screen, this ""slice-of-life"" pseudo-documentary disguised as a feature film would be almost unwatchable as McDormand's character floats through ""slice of life"" after ""slice of life"" in what is referred to as the ""Nomad Lifestyle"".Earnestly Directed by Chloe Zao, NOMADLAND tells the tale of Fern (McDormand) who loses her life, her job and her husband during the recession of the late 2000's and starts to float through life - and experiences - as a ""Nomad"", a person with no permanent address who goes from place to place, catching on to the random odd job and living her life in her van.Zao and McDormand spent years filming in actual Nomad communities with the others in this film often times not realizing that McDormand was an actress playing a part. For McDormand, it had to be the ultimate acting challenge - living in the real world as a character - and she brings a watchable, lost Fern to the screen and she genuinely and earnestly interacts with the real-life characters she encounters. She is very watchable and is a pleasant character to spend the time with.Most of these real life people she encounters open up about their lifestyle and the movie took on the feel of documentary with Fern as the interviewer/narrator of the story. This made for an intriguing glimpse into a heretofore unknown world (at least to me), but not a compelling film does it make.Zao does try to drive a narrative as the only other notable actor in this film - David Straitharn - shows up as a fellow Nomad that develops a crush on Fern and is interested in leaving the Nomad life and invites Fern to join him.This is the only real conflict in this story as we spend an hour-forty-five watching Fern flit from place to place and person to person not really trying to find herself, but letting the wind blow her to wherever the trail takes her next.An intriguing (enough) slice of life, with a watchable central performance by McDormand, but not substantial enough to engage me as a feature film.Letter Grade: B (I applaud the attempt)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,10/10,"So I was expecting the worst at all turns but , (spoiler) it wasn't so bad! :)
I really like this Asian lady.I don't know about the book but I think this lady captured the essence of what it feels like to be alive and dead and everything in between! Good job!But above all , I just love the main actress lady! Gosh she has a neat face to watch! Lol! Good job!"
NOMADLAND,27 October 2021,6/10,"As a feature-length however, this is just too slow, too long and too draining. Frances McDormand inhabits her character exquisitely but there are only so many shots of her gazing solemnly into the distance that one can take. Beautifully shot and a great homage to natural beauty but is in dire need of an actual storyline."
NOMADLAND,21 March 2021,9/10,"This is a very beautiful film about misunderstood people escaping a past and looking for a freedom from that past and it's relationships. Discovering and carving out a new present moment with new relationships. All shown through the eyes of Fern, the protagonist. It's a deep movie.The film is very raw in a documentary style with incredible acting performances. It doesn't feel like a movie. Instead it feels like you are witnessing another world first hand."
NOMADLAND,31 March 2021,6/10,"""Nomadland"" 2020
Chloe Zhao, writer director
Frances McDormand, David Strathairn, and ""real people"" stars""Nomadland"" is a low-budget film about displaced senior citizens, almost all white, who live in their vehicles and travel from one low-paying job to another around the West and Midwest.I have much in common with the folks onscreen. Even though there was much onscreen to love, in the end, I felt betrayed by ""Nomadland.""First, what I loved: the real people. ""Nomadland"" features Linda May, Charlene Swankie, Derek Endres, and Bob Wells, three real ""nomads"" playing fictionalized versions of themselves. Their authenticity and heart burns right through the screen. All of them brought tears to my eyes. I had to stop watching a couple of times, I was so moved.I loved the film's willingness to talk about poor, white people, a demographic that is mostly mocked in mainstream media. We are ""white trash,"" ""trailer trash,"" and, of course, homeless poor whites are really the bottom of the barrel. Too, all the main characters have gray hair and, except for the movie-star-handsome David Strathairn, are not particularly good-looking. I loved the attention that the film paid to Charlene Swankie, a plump and creased-cheeked woman in her seventies. She's one of the most charismatic, interesting characters I've ever seen onscreen, and she is no curvy starlet.""Nomadland"" focuses on poor people, living rootless, homeless, isolated lives, working jobs few would want. One job is Amazon factory worker; another is cleaning toilets in a national park; another is harvesting beets. Agricultural labor, which I've done, is backbreaking. I did it when I was much younger and I spent off-hours immobile in pain, waiting for my muscles to recover. What must it be like to do that work in your sixties?What I wish the film had handled better. ""Nomadland"" doesn't have much of a plot, script, or character development. It's more of an episodic diorama. Here's Bob Wells, telling his story. Here's Linda May, telling her story. Here's Derek Endres, for his moment in the spotlight. We don't stick with one character long enough to get to know him or her in depth. This episodic approach treats the nomads as if they were freaks in a freak show, rather than deep characters worthy of our investment and time.These folks all tell tragic tales. There are a couple mentions of suicide, of poverty and despair. I have to ask: would the character who hit the road after a suicide had responded differently if health care or pastoral care had walked the sufferer through the tragedy to the other side of healing?Have people like Swankie rejected society because of latent conditions like social anxiety, that would respond to treatment, or are they just introverts? Another character spoke of suicide. What if that character had met with a caring professional?In other words, are they on the road because of mental illness? Because of inborn traits like Asperger's or other issues that make contact with other people difficult?The movie never convinced me that this was just about economics. If it is just about economics, then why does the film work so hard to make the nomad life look romantic and enviable? If it's a problem of economics, then how about offering some potential solutions? If there are armies of poor, elderly people driving up and down highways, sleeping in parking lots and dreading that knock on the window from a security guard growling, ""No overnight parking,"" then shouldn't we be doing something about it? And why is there such a huge disconnect between rents and what a retiree who has worked all of her life can reasonably pay?The film never even hints at any answers to these issues. In that way, I do feel that the film doesn't treat its ""real"" characters as respectfully or compassionately as it might. Rather than treating them as people we should care about, they become superficial curiosities.I've also gotta say that I didn't like France McDormand. I didn't like her performance and I didn't like her character. McDormand acts up a storm. Her face is a series of twitches, grins, grimaces, scowls, and soulful stares. I had no idea what she was reacting to half the time. Perhaps a private dialogue between her face and her fleas.I really disliked her character, ""Fern."" I had no idea what motivated Fern. Her husband died and she lost her home and job when a gypsum plant shut down. These are tough life events, but many of us go through similar events and eventually find a path back to love and a new home. Why doesn't that happen for Fern? The David Strathairn character offers her what appears to be a sincere and appealing alternative to a solitary life on the road. I found Fern's behavior toward the Strathairn character to be completely incomprehensible.There are a couple of scenes, one, of Fern waving her arms in the Badlands, and another, of Fern walking besides the ocean, that I did not understand at all. The camera focuses, at length, on Fern's face, signaling that something noteworthy is transpiring in Fern's mind. What is that something? Hope? Despair? Pleasure at being in nature? Missing her husband and former life? Worry about the future? Thoughts about what she'll have for dinner? The movie doesn't care enough about Fern to find out, or to communicate its discovery."
NOMADLAND,14 February 2021,7/10,"""I never read the book but if i was told to choose between the book and the movie i think i prefer to read the book, yep i think the story just didn't work to be adapted to became a movie, the perfomance is great , i love it, the score is just the best, it's beautiful, but again the story is the big problem here, i'm not bored at all but if you ask me am i enjoyed it? not really, overall Nomadland is not as good as lot of people say"""
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland"" sees a widowed and depressed Fern (Frances McDormand) take what she needs from her lockup garage and head out on the road in her beat-up converted camper-van. Taking work wherever she can get it, she joins and befriends a similar set of 'nomads', all equally battered by life in different ways.Positives:
Undeniably a superior motion picture, full of memorable imagery and with an incredible central performance from the impeccably dour Frances McDormand. Few actors can 'listen' and react as well as she can.A key part of this is the superb cinematography from (Brit-born) Joshua James Richards. This is a movie which I MUST revisit on the big-screen when the cinemas reopen in the UK in 2 week's time. I thought ""Mank"" was terrific (rather against the grain of many other movie fans) largely because of Erik Messerschmitt's glorious black-and-white cinematography. But I suspect Mr Richards (interestingly, Chlo√© Zhao's partner) was mightily hacked-off for missing out on the golden prize, as well he might be.It's difficult to rate the script on this one, primarily because it's difficult to know sometimes where the scripted bits end and the 'ad lib' parts begin. The majority of the cast are real nomads, recounting - presumably - their genuine life experiences. (The only exceptions, I believe, are Frances McDormand, David Strathairn and his son Tay Strathairn. The two Strathairn's last appeared on screen together in 1988's ""Eight Men Out"" when Tay was just eight years old!). As such, the film is an interesting blend of fiction and documentary.The movie skewers both capitalism and materialism nicely. As someone who has recently got off the corporate rat-race by retiring, the tale of the man who died before he could use the retirement sail-boat parked in his driveway resonated strongly (and made me very pleased with my decision!). We all get so wrapped up with running around the maze trying to find the cheese that it's often difficult to appreciate that 'getting off and cutting back' is a stress-free and acceptable option. (Not that I'm particularly cutting back, a la Fern..... start saving the retirement coppers early kids!!)The movie is also an effective study of grief and the different ways in which people come to terms with it. (Although that does make the overall film feel like a bit of a downer).Beautiful classical accompanying music by the great Ludovico Einaudi.Negatives:
I really loved this movie for its first hour. But then, for me, the story didn't really maintain my full interest. It was all a bit grey and bland. Did Fern really have much of a story-arc here? She started off at point A and ended up at point B where AB is a short distance! True that perhaps she has a little more acceptance and contentment with her position. But I was looking for more. If this had been a 90 minute film rather than a 107 minute movie, it would have (imho) worked better.Summary Thoughts on ""Nomadland"":
When a movie gets so much awards-hype thrown at it, I often fear watching it in case I absolutely hate it! That's not really possible with Nomadland, since it is just so well made that you can't help but appreciate what Chlo√© Zhao and her team have done here. It successfully challenges your misconceptions of what a ""normal life"" can be. The life might not be for you, or me, but it is an option.That being said, this is not a movie that will be on my ""must re-watch repeatedly"" list (although I definitely DO want to see it on the big screen). It sits on that 'worthy-but-dull' list, alongside ""Lincoln"" and ""Moonlight"": Movies that I can fully appreciate for their artistry but not for their entertainment value.As a movie that explores an unexplored social strata in America, and does it in a novel semi-documentary manner, I can understand and accept why it was voted as the Best Film by the Academy. But 'entertainment' ranks highly on my list of criteria. So - for my personal Oscar Best Film choice - I would still go with ""Promising Young Woman"" every time.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks.)"
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,2/10,"Nomadland is an unabashedly sparse and minimal film. Everything about the plot is pretty much told in the trailer and logline. A woman in her sixties takes up the life of a nomad after she loses everything. The entire film is only about that. Observing Frances McDormand's character go about her unique life. If you're wondering how there's enough story there to fill a nearly two hour movie;the answer is there isn't. But I suppose Nomadland doesn't care about such things like a complete story, it lives in the moment. A very brief moment that too.The average shot length is probably two seconds long, which makes some scenes almost look like stills. And there is neither any depth nor movement in these scenes. No matter what Zhao might think.The entire picture is told in a very abrupt and choppy manner. It throws scenes at you like an unrelated slideshow with glimpses of random moments. That is not profound, that is vapid.If the picture succeeded in any way it would be in feeling real. The plain scenes and bland dialogue combined with the cast, give you a documentary vibe. You feel like this isn't a movie but merely a camera following actual people(maybe that's also because the cinematography is so bad). But did I mention that it isn't intresting at all!Due to the lack of releases last year, the Academy had very few films to pick from. Even taking that into account, Nomadland is a terrible Best Picture winner. The picture scorns at entertainment and blazes down a path of art. However, it isn't art. The style-which is all it has to offer-is meant to be so serene and emotional, but it fails at that as well. If you want to see everything Nomadland aspires and fails to be, watch fellow Best Picture winner Out Of Africa."
NOMADLAND,14 July 2021,8/10,"One of the best dramas from recent years in my opinion. It may be too slow moving for a lot of people, but I was hooked from the first scene. Everything feels so believable, because of a unique documentary style filmmaking and the use of non-actors."
NOMADLAND,10 June 2021,7/10,"I've left some time to view the film in which time it has won several Academy Awards in 2021, including Director for Chlo√© Zhoa, picture and actress for its main star Frances McDormand.It is part documentary using characters to bring Jessica Bruder's book of the same name to the screen.The main character is Fern (McDormand) who experiences financial hardship after the 2008 economic crisis that leads to her place of employment and indeed it's postal or Zip code vanishing.I say part documentary feel in that the viewer may be introduced to the nomad community that currently resides complete with it's unique road based way of survival with seasonal jobs and rv living.Using great cinematography and a soundtrack I had to listen to again by Ludovico Einadu. In particular a piano tune called Oltramare.The sweeping cinematography of the United States countryside may be lost somewhat on television screens. I had, or I am glad I opted to wait to watch in a real cinema for that alone.The second half of the film shows Fern making new bonds and reuniting long lost ones including with her sister and friend Dave.However she feels uncomfortable staying in conventional accommodation and returns to her nomadic lifestyle.One of Ferns seasonal jobs is shown as at an Amazon warehouse. I wonder what with all the focus on Amazon's employment practices how this film goes along with them now they are firmly in the film industry?Some of the characters shown aren't professional actors. More real life members of the modern day Nomadic community."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,3/10,"I really wanted to love this movie, and the first half was real & compelling, but then Mcdormand (I think her real last name was Smith) became so annoying, unrelatable, closed off, self righteous, and unlikable. All take, judgemental and no give. She didn't even take a dog in at the start. very boring movie. The film doesn't have a plot, I think the underlying plot of the film is Fern dealing with her immense grief and finding closure on her old life. Horrible depressing movie. Art accomplished but as a nomad it dies Not portray us nomads at all. It follows a book in one persons Depressing life I wish I never watched it."
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,8/10,"Houseless but not homeless. A woman in her sixties who, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.First of all, this movie was a big slow-burner. The essential plot is the main character, played wonderfully by Frances McDormmand, wandering through life as a nomad while jumping between jobs. For the majority of the movie, I had no clue where the movie was going. She was just driving around, and talking to people. It's a quiet movie.The performance definitely carried the movie forward. Most of the runtime focused on McDormmand's character, Fern, and she delivered so much realism to the character. I bought the character as an old woman who was fed up with her old life and just wanted to travel to enjoy life along the way.Not only was she great, the other nomads were also real and their conversations with Fern were interesting and emotional. It turned out that three of them were non-actors, but instead were real-life nomads that played part of themselves in the movie. The director even used their real names in the movie. It's quite surprising because these nomads were so convincing.Another fascinating aspect was the introduction to life in the nomadic community. It's enjoyable seeing groups of people having conversations with each other and enjoy their activities together. Not only did I feel the sense of community, I also appreciated the goal that the group shared. The goal was quite thought-provoking and not one that I expected.Overall, besides being very meandering, the raw performance made the movie beautiful and enjoyable. 8/10"
NOMADLAND,13 September 2020,9/10,"It's intimate films like this that remind me why I love movies so much. Not intimate in the way of romance or anything like that, but a quiet atmosphere, anchored by one central performance that completely sucks you in. Films with hardly any story and hardly any supporting characters really need to prove themselves in order to win you over, which is why I believe films like this to be just as challenging to make as Hollywood blockbusters. Having just premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival online, I felt the need to check out Nomadland, given the talent in front of and behind the camera. Here are my thoughts on this great little indie.Nomadland follows Fern (Francis McDormand) and picks up after she has lost everything in her life that was ever important to her. Journeying across the outskirts of America, homeless, and living out of a van, regardless of the climate, her character discovers a new side to herself. This isn't a film about discovering who you are, but rather if you can find a new version of yourself that can push forward after such sorrow. I thought this was something different than most dramas like this usually delve into. For that reason alone I was immersed more than I thought I would be.More than anything, I was willing to watch this movie because Francis McDormand was carrying the movie on her shoulders alone. She's easily one of the best performers out there today and I look forward to everything she's in. This may sound a little premature to say, but this may be her best performance yet. The raw emotion that is present on her face throughout the entire duration felt incredibly authentic. Certain scenes toward the end of the film that has her either opening up or listening to a deep and emotional story that someone else is sharing with her is what sent this movie over the edge in terms of appreciation. There were multiple moments in the third act that had me glued to the screen, due to the absolute simplicity of it all.Directed by Chlo√© Zhao, who also wrote, edited, and produced, shows how much more stellar her work has become. After 2017s The Rider, people really started talking about her as a filmmaker to look out for, but this is the one that I'll remember most I think. Everyone film lover will know her name soon enough though, as she just finished directing Eternals for Marvel. Her sensitive touch to this particular story lept off the screen and her communication with every other technical department, especially Joshua James Richards (the cinematographer), who's sweeping landscapes only added to the story of this central character in Fern.Overall, Nomadland will surely bore some audiences and some won't even see the point of the movie as it seemingly goes nowhere if you take the film at surface value, but there's so much more going on here than a character just walking around. I throughout enjoyed the journey this film took me on, as simple as it was. It was the interactions with different types of characters that came in and out of her life that had my attention the most. Nomadland will be in theatres this December and I absolutely think you'll be hearing more about it when awards season kicks in, in the new year. Although it can feel its length (even though its only 108 minutes), I absolutely recommend Nomadland."
NOMADLAND,13 January 2021,10/10,"My Review - Nomadland
My Score 10/10
Wow what a movie I noticed Nomadland's 2 week Cinema release was finishing today and it wouldn't be screened again till after the Oscars probably because they're sure as I am that there will be some Oscars won or at least nominated.
I took a 2 hour each way train trip so as not to miss a film that my prime purpose was to see Frances Mc Dormand in another powerful role I wasn't disappointed.
In 1940 John Ford Directed a seminal movie about The Great Depression that depicted a poor Midwest family forced off their land and travelling West by truck to California in search of work to survive. It was of course John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.
Nomadland takes place 80 years later based on a book by Jessica Bruner this powerful but gentle film tells a similar story . Instead of a family having to leave their home and loved ones behind after the dust bowls that Oklahoma had become in The Great Depression we have an identical scenario 8 decades later.
After losing everything in the Great Recession, Fern a woman on her own embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad.
Instead of the desolate Oklahoma farm lands we have a mid west town called Empire in Nevada that has died even the Zip Code has been deleted due to the U.S. Gypsum plant shutting down.
After living and working with her husband now deceased Fern takes to the road in her van she names Vanguard she fits it out with all the amenities she requires a side table a mattress and a bucket and a few treasures from her past life an incomplete dinner set and her photos.
Frances McDormand gives her quietest most dignified performances ever a stark contrast to her Academy Award winning role as Mildred in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing . Her sensitivity and quiet resolve and even enjoyment in her new lifestyle help make Nomadland an uplifting experience rather than a depressing one.
Fern is a gentle woman an ex teacher with a reserved nature but not a recluse . Fern likes people and people like Fern.
We see her adjust to this new life joining fellow Corporate system refugees as they search for work where they can and take to the road stopping in Van camps and forming temporary communities till they take off again .
I mentioned a movie yesterday that I thought ""unauthentic "" Nomadland ""is the opposite in fact many of the cast in Nomadland including 2 of the finest characters are actual Van nomads
Linda May plays herself and Charlene Swankie plays Swankie in a deeply moving role and they may be up for best supporting Oscar roles.
The movie was filmed in seven states during four months, during which Frances McDormand actually performed several of the jobs done by people who do nomadic work and inspired the book, such as harvesting beets and packaging Amazon orders with the CamperForce program.
The film is a triumph and Masterclass in acting from Frances McDormand she shuns the publicity that great stars like Meryl Streep receive but she is right up there with the best. I hope she receives her Third Oscar for this brilliant performance.
There are also a number of splendid male performances in Nomadland especially David Strathairn as Dave .
Also Bob the Nomad Community Leader has a great line "" One of the things I love most about this life is that there's no final goodbye. You know, I've met hundreds of people out here and I don't ever say a final goodbye. I always just say, ""I'll see you down the road.""It's no wonder Nomadland won the Golden Lion at the 77th Venice International Film Festival and many others.
If Director Chlo√© Zhao is not at least nominated for an Oscar this year it will be a disgrace and an insult to the Great Women Directors in Hollywood at the moment.Ps. What a joy to see a film like this on a proper Cinema screen where it belongs.."
NOMADLAND,18 March 2021,9/10,"I found Chlo√© Zhao's sophomore effort, The Rider, a truly poignant authentic and honest portrait of its hero and I was amazed by how its cinematography draws us very close to him in the personal moments not only with its effective close-ups but also by reflecting our main character's feel of emptiness and loss in the gloomy atmosphere that prevails the entire film. However, I honestly struggled to finally get to its brilliant tear-jerking ending, simply because of its deliberate pace that never picks up even when the story demands that. Here, things are evidently different. No doubt Nomadland is a very slow-paced movie, but it has a perfect tone and the movie, consequently, rarely, if ever, drags.A further testament of Chlo√© Zhao's remarkable artistic maturity, and what I genuinely loved about Nomadland, is the staggering balance it strikes between between everything it tackles from its major themes and main concepts to its minor underling details. Most notably between offering a social commentary that's relevant in the present economic environment and weavering an intricate realistic portrait of the downtrodden, underdogs, forgotten and lost individuals with an almost complete disregard to focusing on a specific social strata.By embracing realism and detaching it from all its oft-affiliated cinematic clich√©s, Zhao has also managed to walk a tightrope between depicting the ""Nomads"" life as a salvation for our Fern and her likes and the representing this new lifestyle as a total failure that resulted from a desperate search for belongness. It's true that we see Fern striving to adapt to this new life style with all its rigors and hardships while overcoming her grief in the process, but it's evident that she ""belongs"" to nature because that's only where she can get the feel of freedom. We see that her conversations with other broken-hearted people alleviate their pain in the sense of ""life goes on, anyway"", but we barely see them offering a consoling arm around each others' shoulders.Nomadland is poetic achievement that blurs the line between fiction and non-fiction by representing a marginalized people whom we very much recognise but also by making its titular land a realistic fictional haven for people who find their identity by letting their souls roam in the spacious wilderness, all that while serving as a tribute to the travel lovers by merely capturing the ethos of wanderlust.(9/10)"
NOMADLAND,3 April 2021,6/10,"Very human and personal story. Kinda slow and minimalistic. But I didn't really care about the characters, so I really wasn't that invested. The movie is nicely made though, but just just not that interesting of a story.6/10: good but not really for me."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As of this article's date, Nomadland has already received countless nominations for basically every ceremony that honors movies in some shape or form. This includes Chlo√© Zao (The Rider, Songs My Brothers Taught Me), who has also been nominated for the director and screenplay categories, gaining tremendous support from the film community since female directors are rarely recognized for their magnificent work - Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman) and Regina King (One Night in Miami) are also in the game this year. Despite never watching the two previous movies of Zao's career, I did know about her filmmaking style being very connected to reality and authenticity, not letting the typical Hollywood-isms impact her vision.If there's something that definitely proves her remarkable commitment to achieve that realism is the hiring of non-actors to participate in her films. Throughout Nomadland, several *real people* tell their story, explaining why they became real-life nomads and offering an enriching, inspirational perspective of life. This is, by far, the most captivating, emotionally compelling aspect of the movie. Learning who these people are and what drives them is incredibly enlightening, shattering wrong, terrible stereotypes that should have no place in our world. With so many outstanding deliveries from the non-actors, I'm absolutely sure some of the interactions between Frances McDormand's character and the real-life nomads are unscripted.In fact, there's a clear documentary style associated with this film. From Joshua James Richards' on-the-ground, gorgeous cinematography to the well-structured editing work (also done by Zao), the narrative holds a superficially uneventful, observant storytelling that many viewers will find tiresome and boring, which is completely understandable. It's hard to deny that the screenplay is pretty much based on following McDormand in an RV through the American West, watching her meet new people, working in a couple of different jobs, and that's really it. If people go into this movie expecting mind-blowing developments and Earth-shaking revelations, all will leave extremely disappointed.It's a slow-paced, somewhat repetitive film told through Zao's unique vision, which is the key aspect that makes this movie work so well. Her astonishing dedication to delivering such a grounded depiction of a particular lifestyle elevates the overall piece. Technically, I already addressed that the film is beautifully shot, but Ludovico Einaudi's score is tear-inducing on its own. With heartfelt piano tracks, Einaudi's music plays during the most stunning landscapes, helping those moments to induce the viewers to enter an introspection-like state of mind. Zao's screenplay is packed with underlying themes, but the diverse, impactful views on what it means to live and how to deal with grief and personal traumas grabbed my attention the most.Despite all that I wrote above, Nomadland is highly performance-driven. Frances McDormand carries this movie with yet another powerful display to add to her already impressive career. Her reactions in every single conversation that she has with the non-actors seem to come from McDormand herself and not from her character, Fern. Speaking of her, Fern is an amazingly likable character, the absolute definition of what it means to be a good person. Following such a protagonist makes the extremely long journey a bit lighter. Every non-actor is absolutely perfect. I have nothing but overwhelming respect for them and the life they chose to live.I don't expect the general public to love this film, but I'd love to see the viewers trying to figure out what makes it so special. Many spectators will finish their viewing and think this is just another ""technical feature"" that only gets praises from critics. I sincerely wish that viewers would ask themselves why they didn't enjoy a movie as much as other people and research about it. Learn about what makes the film so inspiring and such great storytelling. Yes, it's heavily philosophical, its pacing could have been better controlled, and it doesn't really have massive surprises or significant events. But if it possesses a lot more than what it's at the surface, then investigate, read a little bit about what went into creating this movie, and maybe - just maybe - it will become a more enjoyable watch.Nomadland offers a contemplative, enlightening, touching story about a nomad's life, starring real-life people that make this film much more special. Chlo√© Zao's unique, passionate vision and her outstanding dedication to authenticity are more than enough characteristics deserving of dozens of nominations. Gorgeous cinematography and a lovely score tremendously elevate the movie, creating the perfect atmosphere for thoughtful storytelling. Some pacing issues and an uneventful narrative based heavily on merely accompanying the protagonist through her journey negatively affect the film's overall enjoyment, which will definitely leave some viewers disappointed. Frances McDormand carries the movie on her shoulders with another commanding performance to add to her remarkable career. However, the spotlight goes to the real-life nomads who participated in this beautiful project, sharing personal stories filled with valuable perspectives on so many themes related to life and ways of living it. A worthy contender for the awards season.Rating: B+"
NOMADLAND,18 March 2021,9/10,"In the manner of melancholic Poetry, the portraiture of ""Nomadland"" follows the path of this telling journey which connotes human sentiments above all else. With minimalist visuals, a calming piece of music, and a phenomenal act from the magisterial female lead; it will indeed leave its own legacy!""My mom says that you're homeless, is that true?""
""No, I'm not homeless. I'm just house-less. Not the same thing, right?""'Nomads' are people without fixed habitation or home in simpler terms! Moving from one place to another in an unending loop! The film exhibits their estranged livelihoods by incorporating the actual nomadic communities and their folks in here.Thus encouraging the Screenplay to safeguard a rather pragmatic tonality overall! Characters appear to be more natural and regardless of what part of the world you are situated in; you would be able to establish a strong link to these stoic individuals. Disregarded by social norms yet remained resolute and in unison; living their lives on their own terms!Quite Audacious, aren't they?Furthermore; a stunning piece of Cinematography, deftly capturing far-reaching horizons teeming with beauty and diversity! An exquisite Score that not only tugs at your heartstrings with those entrancing melodies but also reflects upon the despair and remorse; Nomads hold deep down their hearts!Frances McDormand as Fern is simply sensational!Her character resonates with incomparable charm and serenity! Despite losing everything she had ever loved; Fern has not given up! Not yet!
Whilst clinging on to treasured memories of her past; she keeps on going! Setting an example by never abandoning hope or the certitude she so dearly believes in!Never Quitting.In rare instances, some work of art leaves you speechless. The same thing happened to me right after the credits rolled. I was lost for words! At that particular moment, I was clearly devoid of the needed insight to articulate what I have just seen. In the end, It's all up to personal interpretations.For me though; it speaks on behalf of us, humankind! Subtly showcasing human nature in general. Although I gotta admit, it's not for everyone!"
NOMADLAND,4 January 2021,9/10,"Nomadland is one of those movies you can just feel. One where you can almost feel the cold air on your skin as you watch it. One where every interaction feels authentic and every person has a story.Frances McDormand gives a powerful performance that's never grand or showy, but subtle and restrained like the movie itself. It's a wonderful film."
NOMADLAND,18 January 2021,7/10,"This movie certainly opens your eyes to the fact that there are millions of people across the world that live in cars/vans/RVs/trucks and who have no 'home' other than their vehicles. We take for granted that we can just turn the tap and water comes out or that we can just open the fridge and there's cold food inside... these nomads have none of that.The movie offers a glimpse into the nomad life and even features a handful of real nomads in the movie as characters. The movie at times makes you feel sad and sympathetic, but I think this movie also have some parts where it makes you feel happy and hopeful.I think the movie could have been somewhat longer and spent some more time exploring the various characters' individual journeys, but overall I think it's a fine movie and I'd totally recommend any adults to watch this movie (kids would find it boring and likely wouldn't grasp the meaning of the film). A solid 7.5/10."
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,9/10,"What a beautiful and touching movie. I was moved deeply. It is also one of the most authentic films about real people I have seen in a long, long time. Its a triumph of a movie that is so needed in a rather mediocre film year as 2020 is. The documentary touch was excellent because you really dived deep into those peoples lives, stories and lifestyles. Many of it was probably real and some added for dramatic reasons but the way it is portrayed in the film is so effective because you really believe everything. And yes, it of course helped that amateur actors were used that mostly come from the nomad culture, but there is also a 2 time Academy Award winner in the middle of them: Frances McDormand and she just adapted that role so freaking well that a third Oscar should actually be around the corner. What a brilliant and natural performance. She not only lived her role she lost herself into it. Its her career best. Simply wonderful. There is also David Strathairn who was really good, but also quite limited, he had many nice scenes but I was waiting for his big Oscar moment as he is also receiving a lot of buzz for it. I found some of the amateur actors performances more engaging first of all Swankie but also Bob Wells. Both more or less played themselves but it looked like they didn't do anything else their whole life. Very professional.
The score is wonderful and so is the cinematography. Chloe Zhao gave us a great tour through this kind of lifestyle that is different but as mentioned in the film also big part of the pioneer tradition and not only in the USA. Extremely beautiful film that hopefully gets all the awards it deserves. So far the best film of the year."
NOMADLAND,18 February 2021,9/10,"""Nomadland"" is a drama film based on the non-fiction book ""Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century"" by Jessica Bruder. Starring Frances McDormand in the lead role and directed by Chlo√© Zhao (Songs My Brothers Taught Me, The Rider), it sheds light on an often overlooked group of people who do what they can to persevere through tough times.In 2011, the town of Empire, Nevada has been greatly affected by the Global Financial Crisis, with most of its important industrial factories closing down and leaving many people unemployed, including a longtime worker named Fern (Frances McDormand). With little else left for her here, Fern decides to purchase a van to live in with the remaining money made from selling most of her possessions and sets off on a road trip through the western US states. On her journey, Fern befriends various nomads along the way who teach her their own methods of getting by with the bare essentials and how to solve with any problems she is likely to encounter at certain points.Over ten years ago, several people in America felt the devastating impact of the Great Recession, which caused them to lose not only their jobs, but their houses as well. As a result of this, some were even relegated to staying in their vehicles and wandering the country in search of a better life, echoing the plight of the early pioneers centuries ago. What a film like ""Nomadland"" does so well is show the intimate human side of these individuals that a previously ignorant viewer such as myself would have probably not known about otherwise. It's fascinating to see how these down-to-earth people make the most of their living spaces and that they don't necessarily regard themselves as homeless, but instead ""houseless"". This definitely puts things into perspective as it better allows us to see why they are able to appreciate the small things around them so much, taking situations as they come while learning a great deal about life itself. Best of all is that the film serves as a reminder that there are humble people like this everywhere and that each one has a different story and life lesson they could teach us.Chlo√© Zhao, who also wrote and co-produced the film, appears to have chosen to direct very much in the style of a low budget indie picture, right down to the minimalist camerawork and limited use of music. This gives the movie a prolonged, almost documentary-like tone as we watch Fern interact with the nomads one by one as though she is living among them to gain a better understanding of how they survive with what they have. Of course, this approach will be off-putting to some audiences who may not like the slow pacing and lack of action, but to viewers like me who weren't aware of how people like this are able go about their lives will be thoroughly invested in what each nomad has to say. One such nomad that stood out to me was an old lady named ""Swankie"", who reveals she has cancer and is travelling around America to take in the sights and make happy memories before she'll eventually pass on. Fern's support of Swankie during her journey was a beautiful moment in this film and it definitely left a touching impression on me as it is proof that it is never too late to follow any long term dream you may have.Frances McDormand once again does what she naturally excels at; playing women who are tough-as-nails but have a heart of gold. I greatly admired Fern's resilience in the face of any challenges she needed to overcome, whether it be dealing with a flat tyre during freezing temperatures or finding alternative methods of paying for repairs when her van breaks down. She is exactly the type of strong female character that I like seeing in movies, ones who feel like real people you are bound to meet and respect at some point in your lives, as opposed to those who have obviously been written as an outlet for female supremacism. Interestingly, most of the supporting characters in the film are indeed real nomads and not professional actors, which adds a feeling of realism whenever Fern is being taught something important from them. A creative decision like this should not be taken for granted so each real nomad who appears in this film has rightfully earned my praise and gratitude.In conclusion, it seems there are many different stories waiting to be told about each specific nomad we could meet one day, but to do so would be an impossibly monumental task. At least we can be thankful that a film like this has helped bring attention to them and the unconventional lifestyles they lead given their circumstances. With that in mind, I think we could all learn a thing or two about life from these well-travelled people.I rate it 8.5/10"
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,9/10,"Having seen The Rider in theaters, I knew then that Zhao had a keen eye for filming stunning, emotional scenes. She has a great way of letting the images on screen do the speaking for her characters. While some might deride this aspect of her filmmaking, I think it's refreshing to see in today's cinema where everything is usually so spelled out for audiences.Nomadland doesn't have an intricate plot, but you still feel very much a part of this character's journey. The pace can be a bit slow, however this does help you absorb everything on screen and really feel the moments. McDormand is excellent in an understated, but profound performance and the cinematography is world class. Nomadland is a poignant look at the lives of some fascinating people in our country and an ode to those who feel the spirit of adventure."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,8/10,"Just as Fern's life could have followed many paths, this movie could have been many things - a tragic portrayal of those let down by capitalism, a polemic about what our society cares about and loses along the way. Instead, the film just chose to be. Fern just chose to be. There was so much beauty in that presence, and in every person's face along the way. Sunsets lit up the sky. Waves crashed against the shore. Highways extended forever. Kitschy tourist traps somehow became picturesque postcards. There were lots of questions to ask, but this film opted not to try answering them in 100 minutes. Instead, it invited me to sit with Fern, look out into the vast unknown, and just be."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,4/10,"It's been exactly one year since my last movie, so my senses aren't as sharp as they should be. frances mcdormand stars and produced this vanity production. she is a woman who lost everything and lives in her van. she is in every scene. she meets lots of similar lost souls. david strathairn is completely wasted here. it is a depressing film, especially for the times."
NOMADLAND,5 April 2021,8/10,"There's quite a fuss being made of this on release, I can see why, it does stand out. It's the sort of dramatic entertainment focused on social struggle that Frances McDormand does so well. She plays Fern. Life is hard for her, living in America's interior with industry failing and her husband passed away. It's slow, purposeful, real. Not a doc but most of the cast are essentially playing themselves, giving this a disarming reality, living in a van, trying to find work... where there's little work. Despite the bleakness, this isn't looking for sympathy. It's a world of open skies and people looking out for each other. People like Fern that are faced with a sense of loss, a life that's no longer there for them. For others though it's more of a choice, recognising that the American Dream is failing and it's up to them to forge ahead, shunning materialism and embracing a tranquil peace. It is a film, there is an arc, but it's also a window. A world that most of us have no clue about. Fern doesn't either, she's learning fast though and we learn with her. How to look after herself, after her van. It's tough. Very raw, very honest and perhaps surprisingly very exciting. The stories that are told, the people Fern meets, it's really humbling and there's an inherent sadness and melancholia. I really can't emphasise enough the positivity in the community though and that's what sticks with you. It feels like these a real friendships being forged, that McDormand and the cast have made real connections. There's a lot of alone time. The camera solely on McDormand, but she's perfect, subtlety commanding every shot. The only other 'actor' aside McDormand, certainly that's easy to spot at least is David Strathairn who plays Dave, not as much a love interest as a positive anchor. One that's sorely needed when things take a tough turn. There is a moral tone, a defiance against corporate America, but it's truly at its core a story filled with wonder and a sense of freedom. Many won't enjoy this, will find it too bleak, too slow. Each to their own, but in my opinion it deserves the praise it's getting."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,9/10,"This movie is so good... it is a slow story... it is character driven and is so unique, I've never seen a movie quit like it before. Soundtrack fits perfect and the acting is just top notch. I really can't say anything negative about it. I think it simply shows that each person in this world has their own journey to travel. And We all deal with life in our ways. Some will probably not like this movie... for me it was so worth watching. If you are a tick older (50 years or older) I think you will appreciate it more than if you are just starting on your own journey of life. Such a well made story and will definitely watch it again..."
NOMADLAND,14 April 2021,8/10,"There is a lot of hype for Nomadland as it's a frontrunner in the latest Oscars and most likely to win Best Picture. After months of anticipation, I finally saw it and liked it but I'm not sure how many will.Nomadland follows Fern, a woman who has lost everything in the Great Recession and journeys through the American West as a van dwelling modern-day nomad.This is a film that's not going to be for everyone. The pacing is very slow and if you say nothing much happens then I completely understand. Like Sound of Metal, I saw Nomadland as an educational experience. It's a subtle, quiet and even poetic film that shows us the lives of people that live off the grid. Chlo√© Zhao's approach to this film is unlike any film experience I've gone through. It almost has a documentary-esque feeling to it as Zhao uses and tells the stories of real life nomads in America. The way these people tell their stories doesn't even sound scripted. It blends beautifully with the fictional character of Fern and her story. The film takes us through various characters Fern meets and it was very interesting to hear the way these people perceived life and how they wanted to live it.Frances McDormand is at the top of her game here as Fern. She fully transforms into this character and meshes with the community with such ease. If she wasn't a Hollywood actress then I would've just assumed she was an actual nomad. McDormand has always delivered outstanding performances but this is easily one of her best. Cinematographer Joshua James Richards also does a stellar job here as Nomadland is one of the best looking films of 2020. His cinematography not only shows us striking visuals but also creates a natural and intimate look into this world for the audience that makes us feel we're there with McDormand living this lifestyle.Nomadland was an experience like no other. It taps into poverty in America and the meaning of a home but I personally saw it as a film about people, their experiences and how they cope with certain situations. It is quite slow and meanders a bit but what Chlo√© Zhao is able to portray alongside Frances McDormand's fantastic performance is simply brilliant."
NOMADLAND,17 January 2021,10/10,I love road movies. It teaches us many lessons and Nomadland is exactly that. It's a beautiful movie with beautiful performances. Enough said.
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,8/10,"Many problems with this.Starting with the good things: Beautifully shot, good editing, great acting and very good score. This would be enough to give a positive score to most of the movies, but...The movie feels like a documentary, but to me, it also felt like a documentary could have been much more interesting than the movie. It's very, very American and unfortunately I couldn't emotionally connect to it (not even close to). I think there was a lot of space to speak about what are the biggest reasons for some of these sad stories, starting with the company where...the main character works, to give us points of discussion about society and wild capitalism, but very close to zero.I also have an issue with this kind of structure, or should I say non-structure? The 1st, 2nd and 3rd act seem exactly the same and the movie ends exactly in the same place (and I'm not talking geographically) where it started. No, the problem is not the pace. The problem is the lack of direction, the lack of tension. Why should I really care about it, if I know exactly what is going to happen (like, nothing)?There was a time when I would think that I should agree with critics and love this, but...nop. It says a lot about US and the Academy, when Nomadland and Mank (two very American movies) are favourites to Oscars one year after Parasite (this one, yes, a masterpiece). I thought that we had learned that a movie can be artistically superior, really well edited and filmed, but keeping the tension and suspense. But no, we are back to the old filmmaking style and ready to show the world that Parasite was just an accident."
NOMADLAND,23 September 2021,1/10,"The acting may be good, it may be considered art, it may be considered a thought provoking film, but it is also pointless and mind numbingly boring.There is no story and is not entertainment."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,9/10,"I'm quite a traveler so I loved this movie as much as Into the wild. First, what a superb acting class from the main character. Oscar winning. No doubt.Second, the scenarios are simply amazing. Pretty good choices and beautiful ones. Last, the script is amazing. A bittersweet symphony.So, overall one of the best 2020 movies, no doubt."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,8/10,I am sure this film will have as many critics as it does fans it is not your normal run of the mill film with a beginning middle and end story wise and I am sure it will be marked down for that by many however I think for this film you need to just experience it let it wash over you and the beauty will be revealed I found it to be quite an effocative beautifully photographed film the acting was first class and it was lovely to see a positive human side maybe those of a certain age will take a lot more from this film than the younger audience who I can totally appreciate not seeing or enjoying this film as I did in my 64yr view of lifeI found it a touching thought provoking film and a joy to see no blood and violence for a change.
NOMADLAND,12 January 2021,4/10,"I can understand why people like this film, it just wasn't for me. I actually turned it off with about 20 minutes left. It had great cinematography but that was about it. The storyline was too slow and became boring. Quiet lady living in a van that moves around to different trailer parks and has brief friendships with random strangers. I don't understand what the big fuss is about. This film is definitely overrated. 4 stars."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,9/10,"""It's strange that you encourage people to invest their whole life savings, go into debt, just to buy a house they can't afford.""After losing everything in the Great Recession, a woman embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad. Nomadland is no doubt the most breathtaking film of the year. Even those who don't follow any awards season conversations probably know about it. It had won countless awards and just won the Nation Society of Film Critics award for best picture. By this point, there's no doubt that this will sweep out the rest of the season including best picture. Chlo√© Zhao crafted a beautiful film. She did almost everything. I don't know how someone can write, direct, produce, and even edit an entire film. That's just so much work! But this shows how dedicated of a filmmaker she is. Her direction is absolutely impeccable. The approach feels much like we're watching a documentary and not a scripted film. A good majority of the nomads we meet throughout are indeed not actors so in that sense it is much like a documentary. We hear their stories on what caused them to choose this lifestyle. Overall, that aspect is just so beautiful.Frances McDormand honestly gave us her best performance by far in my opinion. In her Oscar winning performances in Fargo and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri she gave us a range of acting abilities. Much different from those roles, Fern is a quiet character type. From that we see a more natural performance and really get to know her motives. Some don't agree with her lifestyle, but her reasonings are all valid where any criticism against the nomad community feels like an insult to us. McDormand is just really good and this is a performance to remember. David Strathairn gives an excellent performance as well. He's also quiet and not in it as much where he blends in with the nomad community. That enhances the performance for me giving that natural feel to it. Everyone is great, whether an actor or not.The story is setup in a non-linear fashion. The editing works well in this case. It's hard going for the non-linear fashion sometimes, but Chlo√© Zhao gave us the finest editing of the year. And screenplay for that matter! I've mentioned this a few times now, but it's just so natural. The conversations feel so unscripted most of the time. Most of the lines are very deep and meaningful. It feels less of a film based on plot but rather getting a piece of what this life is. And not just that specific lifestyle, but life in general. Nomadland really hits hard at times where you think about your own life and the life of others. There's not much of a way to properly describe Nomadland. All I can say is beautiful. This is truly a beautiful film. It's also just beautiful to look at. The cinematography is the best of the year so you can't look away. I adored Nomadland and it is one of my favorites of the year. I'm not ready to give it a perfect rating yet as it's just not one of my all-time favorites, but that doesn't mean I won't revisit it over and over again. I will be thinking about Nomadland for years to come.And now for its Oscar chances (in my opinion):

NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,7/10,"McDormand is a beast of an actress. And she's asked to do a tall task, which is show the deep sadness and cavernous space of a woman that's trying to find her way through life after 60 and losing everything."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a bit of an odd beast. It's undoubtedly a good film, and what it does well it does very well, however I couldn't help but think there was something missing.The biggest thing Nomadland has going for it is that it looks absolutely gorgeous. From the sweeping landscapes, the rich and colourful skies to the long and barren roads, this film is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography on this film was stunning and can't be faulted. When the score began to kick in over some of these shots, everything just seemed to fit together perfectly and created such serene and meditative moments.Then there's the performance from Frances McDormand. I'm yet to see her in a role that isn't worth shouting about, and Nomadland is no exception. This was a vastly different role and performance to her two previous Oscar winning roles, much more restrained and inward and reflective, and it was great. She always manages to convey so much emotion with her face and was just on top form in this film.Chloe Zhao needs to be congratulated on the direction of this film, and was much deserving of her Oscar. She managed to blend the more documentary style elements of the film with the more cinematic moments perfectly, which made for very interesting viewing. As already mentioned, she made the film look stunning and as a complete film it is very well put together.My only real criticism of Nomadland is that its one of those films where nothing really happens. I don't mind this, but I feel these films need a slightly more interesting central character or a stronger premise / situation. I'm not faulting McDormand's performance, but the character wasn't that inspiring or interesting to me. I also thought the whole nomad situation had legs, but not enough to carry the entirety of the film without any additional plot points or conflict. Not that the film ever felt boring, the pacing was always great and it was always enjoyable to watch, but it could have done with more.Probably not for the more casual film fan, but an accomplished piece of cinema and most definitely one to watch for movie buffs out there."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,6/10,"Not a lot of things happen in this. Everything is very subtle. Reminded me a bit of Lost In Translation. I don't have huge criticisms of it. But it felt a bit like it could have been a documentary interviewing people at a hospice. Very mortal and somber. Don't expect an upbeat story. Also had a bit of Florida Project in it about forgotten people living under unusual lives. Was it Oscar-worthy? Not really, but then again, the Oscars have gotten so woke these days, and surprisingly this wasn't a woke movie (thank god), that it was nice to see a small Indie win. It was really just about the loss of life and how people deal with it.I wish there had been a bit more drama and a story there, but it is what it is. It will not be for everyone, but I think if you are looking for something that may hit you personally on a deeper level away from the standard Hollywood big blockbuster nonsense this should fulfill your needs. I can't give it 10 stars because I doubt I would watch it again."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,7/10,"Living in a camper is not a bad thing per se. But it's no picnic either. Chlo√© Zhao shows her main character, who after a few strokes of fate ultimately lives in the van, neither as a victim nor as a heroine. Instead, she is based on the bestseller ""Nomadland: Surviving America In The Twenty-First Century"", for which Jessica Bruder spent a year so-called ""work nomads"" has joined. They actually appear live. Ultimately, that makes the movie even more believable. All in all, the main reason why the film is good is that it does not want to conjure up an entertaining tragedy in the characters, but merely portrays their lives as they are. A simple road movie with an outstanding Frances McDormand"
NOMADLAND,24 March 2021,9/10,"Exquisite slice-of-life cinema: thoughtful camerawork, editing, and music, along with natural performances (the excellent McDormand blends in seamlessly with the non-actors) showcase the subtle beauty of weathered landscapes and faces, of aching reflections on the past and tender moments of small joys in the present, of both the practical and spiritual aspects to settling in and moving on. Either the hints of more pointed character work or those of corporate critique could've been expanded upon.
8.5/10"
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,4/10,"Sorry I tried 3 times to watch this and the farthest I have got is 20 minutes.I have no idea what all of the rave is about. If you read the reviews from people who are houseless but not through choice the movie does not reflect the truth.Also how can you get employment at Amazon without an address.Sorry I just can't get this film. Slow, boring and I didn't care for any of the characters."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,7/10,"NomadlandMovie 7/10Nomadland is a slow burn movie with a documentary type feel. The camera follows Fern played by the sublime Frances McDormand as she flits from state to state across the massive expanse which is America. Her character has lost everything due to the Great Recession. Fern dwells in a tiny van taking work where she can to keep her head above water.This film never excites but the epic cinematography and fine performance by the lead actress is enough to hold the audiences attention. This movie may not be for everyone but considering the stellar reviews Chlo√© Zhao's film must be doing something right. This is not my usual go to genre but I have to say that I was captivated for the movies entirety.Can I recommend this movie to you? Well I think you will have made up your own mind from the trailer if this is your type of entertainment.Picture quality 8/10As aforementioned this movie looks gorgeous with sumptuous landscapes of America's Wild West. Sometimes a gloomy looking film intentionally so to convey the mood. Available on Disney Plus in 4K HDR. The High Dynamic Range elevates the cinematography and I believe this movie should be seen on a large screen or high end TV.Sound quality 7/10There's no surround sound effects here. After all this is not 'Godzilla Vs Kong. Instead we are given a very atmospheric sound mix. Available in standard 5.1 the mix delivers vocals with precision and there's one scene that will wake up your subwoofer. A scene involving crashing ocean waves was very realistic.Nomadland has done well
At the Oscars and I can understand why.This is a very mature film that showcases fine acting , great cinematography and direction with a tightly written script."
NOMADLAND,15 December 2020,10/10,"This is an astounding film. Impossible to categorize, with non-professional actors playing fictionalized versions of themselves and a bona-fide Hollywood A-lister in the lead, it's semi-documentary, I guess. It's a highly personal way of telling an incredibly complex story -- and by that I don't mean plot. There's nothing as crude as that here. The story of Fern (Frances McDormand) has many strands, which writer/editor/director Chloe Zhao tells with care, tenderness, beauty, and a complete absence of the three poisons of Tinseltown: cynicism, sentimentality, and CGI. The result is a film so compelling, so intensely moving, so full of human detail counterpointed with visual majesty, I needed to wind down for a couple of hours afterwards after I'd seen it, so I could get back to my world having spent an hour and three quarters with Fern, her friends and, in a particularly emotionally devastating sequence, her family.I feel privileged to have seen NOMADLAND. It is film-making at its very best, helping us to question ourselves and our values as we attend to the stories of our fellow travellers on this earth."
NOMADLAND,21 September 2020,8/10,"Fern is such a loveable, unique character and Zhao manages to fit her inbeetween all these real people and their stories. McDormand carries every moment with her usual swagger and sensitivity but knows when to let the other characters take the wheel. Zhao explores the american landscape with great purpose and a clear idea how to handle topics of aging, poverty, unemployment and what a life on the road means."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,7/10,"Why does no one talk about how immensely depressing this is? Definitely one of the most depressing movies I have seen in a long time.It was a solid movie (the hyper-realism was extremely accomplished) but the main message I took from it was: life really sucks for a lot of people, and there's pretty much no way out of it. Sometimes people's life sucks so much that they finally realize they'd be better off dead, but they're too cowardly to actually kill themselves - and then they're just stuck here. (This isn't a spoiler because it's not part of the story in the film - it's a random conversation that's had). After a woman failed to kill herself, she looked at her dog and thought ""what am I thinking? I can't do that to my dog"". This was extremely dark because it made it clear she had no reason to live for herself, only for this dog. This was a reminder that many people get pets because they NEED them for their well being - just to feel OKAY with being alive - because otherwise the world sucks that much. Though this was only one conversation in the film, I felt that it tonally captured the essence of the entire film. It's all just an encompassment of how miserable life is for so many people now. The other primary theme I saw represented was how once people get lost in this pit of misery, eventually all spirit, hope, and sparks die - they become this numb, lost soul in this sort of limbo on earth, and even when subtle opportunities or paths to lighter places present themselves, they are too far gone to explore them, almost like Stockholm Syndrome. ""Nah, I'ma stay here"". IMMENSELY depressing.Very interesting choice for Picture Of The Year, LOL."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,9/10,"It's amazing to think how the worst year in modern memory has generated what is perhaps one of the most hauntingly beautiful portraits of an individual in modern memory. That's exactly what Chloe Zhao's 'Nomadland' is - the reflection of a woman who has persevered through personal and societal challenges to pave her own path forward.It's clear that 'Nomadland' is what it is thanks to the incredible dedication from two women - Zhao and the always impressive Frances McDormand, who once again fully immerses herself into her onscreen character; this time, it's the nearly-broken yet ever-resilient Fern. As expected, this film focuses almost exclusively on McDormand's Fern, painting a picture of a woman who must survive on seasonal work due to her choice to live on the open roads of the American West following the loss of her job and the death of her husband. As Fern's sister Dolly puts it, Fern is a ""modern-day pioneer."" Despite the pain her lifestyle has inflicted on her loved ones, deep down she understands the road she's taken is her choice and everyone must respect it.Aside from the obvious acting prowess in this film, elements that elevate its quality include poetic dialogue and soliloquies between Fern and her fellow nomads, vast landscape shots that capture the elegance of the terrain and the strategic use of sound. All of this is done under the direction of Zhao, who proves that meaningful stories can be told with the simplest productions.At this time when many are struggling, 'Nomadland' is an important story that shows and tells about the need for recognizing one's own worth and discovering the motivation to keep driving in spite of the obstacles that cut across the path."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,10/10,Nomadland is an absolutely awesome film that is on its way of sweeping the Oscars this year.
NOMADLAND,24 May 2021,9/10,"It's been 15 months since I stepped into a film theatre, so as I crossed the threshold of Boness' stunningly beautiful restored 1926 cinema I almost had a lump in my throat.On exiting I sure did.Nomadland is a very unusual film. Virtually plotless, it evokes Tree of Life by Terence Malik to some extent, Boyhood by Richard Linklater maybe, in that it's an emotional and spiritual journey rather than a scripted one. It's semi-documentary, but it's patently not one.It captures the lives of America's nomadic community. People who have variously opted out, been thrown out or simply squeezed out into the margins in society. They chase seasonal work (like Christmas at Amazon) in their battered RVs. They camp in the desert or on wasteland, occasionally in organised trailer park's like the one run by sort of philanthropic Bob's.Frances McDormand's Fern is one of these people. And she really could be, so natural is her perfotrmance.Director Chloe Zhao passes no judgement on them. Nor does she force you into any yourself. This is NOT a Michael Moore production in any way, shape or form. But you can tell she empathises with them.There is no judgement going on here. You might decide they are trailor trash, but that would be absurdly unfair because these people work hard. You might castigate them as hippies, but just because they like a campfire doesn't mean they are all earth mothers and fathers. Indeed, pointedly few of them are even vegetarian.Is it a happy film or a sad one? I'm not sure it's possible to decide. But it sure is an emotional one.I didn't particularly like the music, but it was a good choice for the movie because its neo-classical lyricless mood-making underscored, rather than dominated, the action - or lack of it.Yes, you may find this boring. But that's fine, if you do it wasn't meant for you.I feel the cinematography was a little oversold to me. It's good. It's not great.But the strength of this movie is heaped onto the shoulders, the mighty shoulders of Frances McDormand. An actress so great she rarely seems to be acting.She seems at one with this movie, with its largely unprofessional cast.Her relationship with Dave (David Strathairn) is a stunningly underplayed masterclass in relationship building. At no point does one know where it will go, how it will develop.The running references to rock, stone, water and fire makes it completely elemental. Preternatural. And simple. So simple.It's an abstract oil painting. Maybe a Rothko.It's wonderful.Is this the real life?Is this just fantasy?Caught in a landside,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes,
Look up to the skies and see."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,10/10,"""I need work, I like work""Frances McDormand gives a staggeringly beaten performance as Fern, a woman in her 60s who journeys through the American West after losing everything in the recession. This one you'll need to slog through the slow pace, and real downer of a story, really it's McDormand who makes this film what it is. She is absolutely fanatstic (it wouldn't be the first time), it's good that she comes with some baggage - in a good way as she needs it in Nomadland. But it's more than just a film, it's a miracle, a beautiful miracle and one that couldn't be more timely. Setting itself up from the very beginning as a poetic character study on the forgotten and the downtrodden, and thanks to Chlo√© Zhao's stunning directing it's a beautiful and yet still deeply saddening memory of the Great Recession.Zhao brilliantly captures the forgotten American traditions of being a Nomad and thanks to Joshua James Richards' beautiful cinematography of the gorgeous American countryside, Nomadland is a joy to watch and well not since Robert Redford in All Is Lost has a lead star carried a film through wordless moments and plain glances at what lies ahead. And like Redford before her McDormand is breathtaking even without Zhao's spectacular directing and Richards' cinematography she could essentially carry this film on her shoulders.The life of a Nomad - or van dweller has never so beautifully captivated or so enrichally told until this moment and it might be a bit late for this kind of film but it is no less relevant. And as Fern, McDormand is the vivid recreation of the political downfall that hit all of us and that is by no means a negativity in fact she's better than she's ever been. And that is the highest compliment. 5/5. A must watch."
NOMADLAND,11 February 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland"" is many things: it tells about loss and grief, it is a deep journey seeking the true self, understanding what is the real meaning of life, putting in discussion ourselves. It is a film about human connection, that can enrich us, by providing new perspectives that we never remotely considered. A return to our roots, surrounded by the nature. It made me understand how grateful and lucky I am for what I have. It feels real, authentic and sometimes it seems that I was not even watching a film, but a documentary about American nomads. The acting is really good: Frances McDormand was spectacular and you can easily bound with Fern. She had a very difficult life, and after the death of her husband and the failure of the enterprise for which she used to work, she needs to reinvent herself, by finding her true nature.There are many valuable lessons here, and everyone is free to interpretate this small gem however prefers. For someone this could also be a wake-up call to do better in life, to be a better person and to value more friendships and relationships. ""Nomadland"" is perfect for whoever is searching for a really deep and thoughtful narrative: topics treated are not easy and in my opinion you should be in the right mood, in order to watch it. Can be really heart breaking in some sequences, but at the same time, uplifting and hopeful."
NOMADLAND,13 August 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland"" is a film about resilience, about mourning, starting over and in a way even about survival, conducted in a raw and sober way, with a blue and melancholic photography, a serene track and a magnificent performance.The film tells the story of Fern, a traveler who runs around the united states living inside a motor home, Fern is an old woman who lives in the shadow of her husband's loss, runs searching for a meaning and an explanation, and this work of anguish is very well done by the director Chlo√© Zhao, who manages to even somehow convey the feeling of annoyance.McDormand does a great performance, as always, the actress is completely given over to the role and manages to give very personal touches to her character, the supporting cast is also great, just like the aforementioned photograph, the demerit is a bit for editing, the the film's rhythm weighs heavily and the contemplation is sometimes exaggerated.""Nomadland"" is certainly a personal film, both of its director and its audience, the weight of the feeling of the work is measured by the personal experience of each one, the film was not very exciting for me, but there were many people who they left my session crying, like all art, ""Nomadland"" needs a previous experience to be brilliant, otherwise it's ""just"" a good movie. Grade 8/10."
NOMADLAND,5 April 2021,4/10,"I found the story interesting, I suppose that for people who live in the USA this is a real problem, but the movie is slow and boring."
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,6/10,"One of the most beautifully directed films I've seen in a long time. It's a simple
Movie and the way it's done is amazing. My problem with the film is with the main character. First thing Francess Mcdormet is amazing in this film tho her character is so depressing and annoying. You can play the victim and be selfish and I just don't feel for her. It shows how the American dream is flawed. I wanted to care for her and feel her pain and I did at first but by the 60 min mark I was annoyed with her and her actions and I just couldn't stand her and by the end of the film I hated her."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,9/10,"A lot of people get turned off by Nomadland because of the slow pacing and ""lack"" of story, which I completely understand. Nomadland is a very slow film, and it seemed like it was heading nowhere most of time. But what kept me interested throughout the entire entire movie was the people around Fern. Nomadland is about the struggles of everyday life, and not just the struggles of a Nomad. Struggles such as: loss of a family member, financial issues, loneliness, and incurable illnesses. Each character Fern meets is struggling in someway, and how this movie handles those characters and their stories is what makes Nomadland so good for me. And what's most impressive is that most of the characters in Nomadland aren't being played by real actors. Chlo√© Zhao is such a good director that she can turn any normal person into a good actor, and so her winning best director is totally deserving. Nomadland is also very well shot and edited, and I really liked the limited use of music.Overall, Nomadland, in my opinion, is the best film of the year. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely worth giving it a shot. I would say give it at least 20 minutes, if it's not for you, then I'd recommend checking out something different."

Overall rating 98/100Nomadland is about a woman in her 60's, after losing everything in the great recession, who embarks on a journey through the American west, living as a van dwelling modern day nomad.Wow, what a beautifully crafted film, this really moved me. The cinematography was stunning, the performance from Frances McDormand was exceptional. The themes of the film were amazing and beautifully handled, it gave the movie so many layers, tackling grief, finding a community where you belong and so much more. I loved the contrast between certain plot points. With the main character showing her struggles and the way she interacts with other people. The main character was really fascinating and likeable. The amount of character depth, background and development they gave her was excellent. The script was incredibly well written. The movie had a really charming tone, some good humour and fantastic chemistry between the cast. I really loved the sense of community this film had, and how it made you understand each and every character and the reasoning behind why they do what they do, each character in the movie served a purpose. I loved the development to the plot, it had a great amount of emotional weight and was very moving in places. I liked the character conflict, and the balance the movie gave to how the main character thinks. I thought the ending of the film was very moving and gave the main character a fantastic and satisfying character arc.My only tiny nitpick would be that there were a couple of unneeded scenes and slightly choppy editing in places that effected the pacing slightly.But overall, Nomadland is masterfully directed by Chloe Zhao. Who 100% deserved her Oscar. She crafted a beautifully written and moving film. With a fantastic lead performance from Frances, and it went into so much depth that you truly understood and connected with each character, this really connected with me and its Oscar is completely deserved."
NOMADLAND,17 March 2021,,"Nomadland is the story of Fern, an older White woman, who loses everything in the Great Recession and embarks on a journey through the American Midwest, living in her van as a modern-day nomad.I was affected by Fern's detachment from human connection. Throughout the film, friendly people come into life offering help and connection, and Fern rejects them as she is still dealing with the grief of losing her husband and hometown. This is a quiet film, and the ending is a bit ambiguous, but it does leave you with a sense of loss, yet optimism at the same time.I was absolutely floored when I found out this was written and directed by a Chinese, and native-China born, director. The film seems so authentically Midwestern American, but I think this is proof that stories can transcend racial boundaries.The film seems distinctly American in the sense of its framing of the ""meaning of life"". What does it mean to have lived a meaningful life, in this film? The characters constantly reference nature, and the reverence of the open outdoors, as a connection to meaning. While I appreciate nature, I think that a meaningful life can come from more than just nature. Rather, I think of love and relationships. I wish the film delved more deeply into this."
NOMADLAND,30 May 2021,7/10,"Definitely an interesting film and being so unlike the usual Hollywood formula I can understand why Nomadland received so much attention, but it's no masterpiece. The settings are visually appealing and set the tone and atmosphere well, the acting cannot be faulted, especially as some did not even know the two main characters were played by actors, and the addition of real life nomads to fill the wider community was truly excellent. However, although there is the general following of one woman's life, there isn't too much of a plot. You could say there was no need for a plot and the message was what was important, but without it it did drag at times, and I'm not sure what the message may be. 'Fern' was evidently content with her lifestyle, or she would have taken the several opportunities to change it, so how is the audience meant to feel about her? If she's happy with her life then great, but then the struggles cannot be seen as such. There just needed to be a little more something behind everything. It is a good film and well shot, but it appears that the gender and race of the director pushed Nomadland further into the spotlight for reasons irrelevant to the film itself."
NOMADLAND,24 November 2021,7/10,"Nomadland is a new drama directed, written and partly produced by Chlo√© Zhao, the director of The Rider.The film is about Fern (Frances McDormand), who decides to experience her life in a different way after the economic collapse of her company and the loss of her husband. So she sets off in her van and tries to join the modern nomads. Life as a nomad takes some getting used to for Fern without a solid home ground and with a different view of the world. In this way she learns to live in this different way without it happening less, compared to her old life.With this film, Chlo√© Zhao has made a special film about the life of modern nomads, because with the exception of Frances McDormand and David Strathairn, most of the other cast members have really been played by real nomads. Most of them also did not know that they were together with a Hollywood star during the shooting of the film. Zhao tries to convey the lifestyle of these people with this film, to show that you don't need a big house or a lot of stuff for a happy life.By following many different nomads, who live their lives in their own way, the story can seem a bit unclear, because there is not really a fixed storyline in the film except for the lifestyles of the different nomads. These different lifestyles can seem fascinating, especially for people who are used to the 'normal' life of work, school, tax and wage income. This film teaches that life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.Together with photography director Joshua James Richards, Chlo√© Zhao beautifully portrays the living areas of the nomads together with the nature reserves. In this way they show how beautiful the world can be outside the economic and urban world.Frances McDormand does a good job in this movie and has adapted herself well to come across as really fitting among the real nomads. For the part, she lived in a van for four to five months, to really come across as a nomad and experience what this lifestyle is like now. She deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for this. Furthermore, the nomads in the film almost simply act out their real lives without conveying that they are being filmed. With the exception of a single nomad who looks a bit too much into the camera, they also bring realistic about how their life as a nomad works. This makes this film almost like a documentary. It is also beautiful or tragedies to hear how some of these nomads ended up in the nomadic life. Most ended up in this life because they had no other choice, but otherwise make the best of it."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,,"Two weeks ago I read quite a few reviews here as 'we' planned to see it in the future; which is 'today'! So I was prepared to face something possibly beautiful or very boring. It grabbed me from the start bathing in the beauty of the scenery and its sweet music scores. And I let myself go with the flow till the movie was finished, still with the sweet music and the splendid panorama...
FMD was not as eccentric as i remembered her in Fargo or 3 BB in.... She was just a person making contact with herself and nature, sometimes alone, sometimes with others. I'm a poor historian, and a worse geographer especially when it comes to the US...But I got the msg. Depression job hard to come by and some folks have to live without a house although some chose to.It was not boring for me, I was happy to share this experience in the comfort of my cinema seat and in reasonable health with no imminent death threat for me or my family, yet I could appreciate this is not always the case with advance age and end all life in a closer horizon which brings questions, sometimes without answers. I felt this film dealt with it but with subtlety. I realise its not only advance age that can make you a nomad or a person who seeks answers, again this is touched upon in Nomadland.I also understand how it can be not so appealing to a generation that has learned to be fast with need for action, achievement and extravaganza at all time. Yes no time to watch the paint dry. Then watching someone relieving oneself may not be a treat, but sometimes 'punctuation' is helpful to remind us we are human and nature call is part of our humanity, even if we don't need to ""Passer le r√©veillon l√†-dessu"" (pardon my French - 'Spend whole new year eve over it')!I would recommend for people to take the gamble. I really think there is not much to loose, but I hope like I did, you'll 'win' big."
NOMADLAND,11 January 2021,2/10,"No script, just an outline and ad lib for 90 min. Like a HS senior did a journal with his hippie mom. Sooooo boring. Cannot even"
NOMADLAND,8 April 2021,5/10,This was empty. Nothing new. I couldn't take the emptiness of it another second. No life revealing moments and rather depressing the whole way through.
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,3/10,"Other than the fine acting and a good premise, this film did not deliver. There was nothing out of the ordinary. No shocking surprises, action or even a bad character in the film. Quite frankly , I don't get the fuss. This film based on truth, still could have had more pizzazz and it simply did not. Such a shame too, because I actually believed the hype and I was let down."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,5/10,"It runs like a Documentary and for that quality it's good. But nothing happens, I mean really, nothing happens. Maybe it's because they were real people and not actors, I don't know but I do know I was left unfulfilled and thought I had just wasted 2hrs of my life."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,6/10,The story.... The script.... just a bit not interesting for me. It looks like a documentary film.
NOMADLAND,21 May 2021,7/10,"Until this film, I did not understand the term ""company town"". This was quite enlightening and fills a knowledge gap not actually covered in the movie. McDormand, of course, is the perfect choice as the lead character. She brings more than her acting skills to this presentation, which, all things considered, is remarkable. The real people. The real landscapes. The real vehicles. They add a little; nevertheless, there is a great void. None of the people are 'running away', they are 'seeking' - seeking belonging what we can only guess. For most, it seems, they are not content with the false security that an apparently settled life affords to some. There's a sense of loss that is more than four walls and a roof, work and pay from an unseen corporate employer, connections with people that are other than transactional. The abandoned dog will just stick in your mind. A sad film. A sad reflection on the state of humanity."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,5/10,"This is a study of normal people, it reflects a mundane lonely existence, that many around the world experience.Do I want to go through it on film as entertainment, probably not. Is this worth the awards it received, maybe, maybe not. In all it's just a bit too real and real is only good to a point."
NOMADLAND,22 June 2021,9/10,"I am a fan of American/European films, eventhough my first language is not English. Nomadland is one of them, especially when we have the actress who stars in Fargo.What amazed me is that her performance is really something, her accent, speaking style and I never get bored with her film.There is no weakness in this film but the one that need improvement is the ending."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,8/10,"Shining a light on a very real community that deserves a voice while underlining the travesty of our modern economic situation, this is an important movie with expert execution. McDormand is perfectly believable in her roll, expressing her sadness through the nuance of a woman just trying to keep it together. The very nature of the film though does necessitate it's very slow pacing, making it probably not the most riveting, edge of your seat movie you'll ever see, but it is nonetheless vital."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,7/10,"First and foremost, Nomadland is made to cater the tastes of film festival audiences, mainstream audiences may not enjoy the movie like film festival audiences. Nomadland in short is a journey of a sorts, under taken by an aged woman, whose indecisions while young costs her dearly as age catches up, yet in a brave display put on by her, she doesn't accept defeat and fights her inner demons. All this by pretending that it's her own decisions and choices are right according to her, while remaining confused for most of the time.I have been a big fan of Frances McDormand over the years and have seen and loved most of her work since blood simple, Her performance in Nomadland resonates her character in many ways, like director's Chole Zhao's previous work Nomadland is an unassuming film, its aptly meandering, unhurried non-narrative layering impressions rather than building a story with the standard markers. But the cumulative effect of its many quiet, seemingly inconsequential encounters and moments of solitary contemplation is a unique portrait of outsider existence.Cinematography is excellent, especially the landscapes in the country, captured in various exorbitant tones. With a runtime of 107 minutes editing is excellent. Production design, costumes and makeup are very good. Background score is just outstanding, Ludovico Einaudi deserves an applause for his stunning music. Frances McDormand's poetic performance remains stand out, but definitely not her best.Overall, the movie is a poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden, Nomadland that beautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of the losses faced in life due to her indecisions. The movie will suit older and mature audiences more than the young, to analyse their own life accordingly. At the 93rd Academy Awards, it won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for McDormand, from a total of six nominations. Does the movie deserve these? Maybe each one of us have to explore that our selves. 7.3 stars out of 10 for Nomadland for its presentation."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,8/10,"I have to write a summary to my English teacher every time I see a movie. For movie with no ups and down, no stunning storyline and no twist, it is so difficult for me to write a long summary. And it is difficult simply to memorise the content.Usually I prefer a movie with a clear storyline, and not those just like a virtual real life show, but for movies depicting life of a female, especially an elder one, like this one.Female lead is 60. Her husband died and she regretted in the way the medical treatment she chose for him. She has a sister that invites the female lead to live with her in the house. But she refuses. A male nomad invites the female lead to stay with him, and she refuses. She loves the life being a nomad.On her way in her mobile home she works in Amazon, cafe... to earn a living
She meets nomads from all walks of life. Like a lady with cancer, a father who loses his son, a young lad running away from his parents. The nomads would gather together for a party, to hold a campfire.... They stay together in a site, leaving to step on their own ways, and may meet sometime by fate. Life of them is just full of uncertainty. But that is that way the like.I will be on my way to 60. I will have knee pain as the female lead do. I admire her courage to venture. I admire the new way of life so many people turn to be - being nomads."
NOMADLAND,13 January 2021,6/10,"Watched at Lido cinema. A very pleasant experience.Joshua James Richards' cinematography was exceptional. Shot on arri alexa mini, zeiss ultra prime lenses arri amira, zeiss ultra prime lenses. Like the image Frances McDormand was great, so was natural scenery and natural characters. Unfortunately that's where my praise ends.Nomadland is more about the situation than the characters, this resulted in me not caring about anyone. There are several emotional and fairly lengthy monologues from characters who I just didn't care about in the slightest. The score was pretty bad too, it clashed with the events and imagery most of the time and it's nothing musically special either, it's basic, sappy piano. Possibly the biggest issue with nomadland is that the story doesn't go anywhere. If you watch the first 30 minutes you've pretty much seen the whole movie, it's 2 hours of build-up. I was disinterested for a large chunk of the runtime and started thinking about amour, probably because I watched cache yesterday (both directed by Michael Haneke).Despite my gripes I'll still watch whatever Chlo√© Zhao makes next, the direction was far from the worst element."
NOMADLAND,7 February 2021,2/10,"Look interesting - The story. But poorly executed. Overall, it's average and boring."
NOMADLAND,21 April 2021,5/10,"I guess now I know what it's like to live in a van and poop in a bucket?I also guess that might have honestly been the most I got out of this film, because I really didn't care about nearly any of the characters, and the story goes absolutely nowhere in 107 minutes, so much so that I feel like this would have been considerably better as a short documentary.And that sucks, because I think the two things no one is denying the brilliance of here is the acting, which is fantastic all around (even if casting actual nomads just reinforced my belief this would have worked better as a documentary), and the cinematography, because this is a pretty stunning film visually.It does kind of scratch on the surface of some interesting things it could have done narratively, like what the concept of ""home"" really means and some economic themes, but again, it never goes anywhere with them, soooooooo...that's all I've got for you."
NOMADLAND,27 September 2020,10/10,"Nomadland is quite the beautiful, cinematic achievement. It's a meditative exploration through the life of a woman struggling to find a workplace, but finding home where she least expects it. Chlo√© Zhao does a terrific job of directing this film and the wideshots and landscapes are a thing to see. I would also like to point out that although the film is a drama with some comedic moments, I can definitely see some documentary style of filmmaking throughout this film as characters explain how the life that Fern is going to live is. In conclusion, although the film is slow paced, it is so entertaining that time flies. McDormand also gives us a charming performance which we can relate to easily, and carries the film with ease. I give this film a 9.5/10, but will round it out to a 10."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,5/10,"... i found the story boring and depressing, though Frances McDormand gives a stellar performance.The world direly needs more films such as Singin' in the Rain and Casablanca."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,6/10,"When people complain that Nomadland is a ""message movie"" (of which we're allegedly getting way too many as of late), their real problem is so rarely with message movies.In fact, the same viewers who will dismiss a powerfully acted drama with well-selected breaks for quirkiness as ""preachy"", since it does technically elucidate the unfairnesses of late-capitalist America, are often the same idiots who would praise in-your-face agitprop like Unplanned because it affirms their notions about the sentience of zygotes which in turn suddenly makes it a-okay to repeal reproductive rights. We always pick our spots.Nomadland, as a story on its own, does work even if you don't agree with its supposed lesson. It doesn't work perfectly, though, and a few redrafts may have done its pacing some good. It delivers that which you most likely came for, however: another great, uncompromising, unglamorous outing from Frances McDormand.Was she better in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri? Perhaps, but this one's definitely getting an Oscar nomination when we finally get to that; it is a mighty performance that ranges from facial subtleties to strikingly believable body language. What we're lacking is an arc or a satisfying final destination.Also powerful is Swankie as Swankie - a woman whom McDormand befriends after losing her job, failing to maintain a new one, and moving into a La Paz, Arizona van-dweller settlement. If the film indeed has a point, it is epitomized in a scene where Swankie attempts to make enough money to live by hosting a jumble sale that contains some of the most cherished items she has ever owned. ""This was given to me by my grandmother"", she explains, ""so take good care of it"". As despairing as it seems, we can tell Swankie has accepted the state of things. Many other nomads seem to have discovered a certain peace, out in the places where no-one else will go.McDormand's voyage continues, in a way that some critics have compared to Vagabond (an older movie by Agnes Varda), notably Armond White, who is definitely among the critics who discount this as an overly political ""message movie"" while more explicitly propagandistic works get a pass for espousing the right things. White is sure to point out that one of the first images we see is of McDormand, in lieu of anything else, taking a piss on the ground - this makes sense given the situation of the character and lets us know the story won't go easy on us, but White seems to read it as taking a piss on America itself. Even if that's accurate, do we have reason to view pissing all over America as a bad thing?You can't even use the excuse that Nomadland is bad and preachy because it ""goes over-the-top"" and tries to scare us of a dark future that needn't necessarily come to pass. The film stars real-life nomads, chief among them the greybeard Bob Wells - who, as I've understood it, really does set up a Quartzsite rendezvous point for ""van-dwellers"" like the one we're shown. This is already happening. This isn't Blade Runner.Once again, however, what makes it truly work is the sheer power of the performances, as well as the way that cinematographer Joshua James Richards makes the undisturbed vistas of America into a character of their own. The music, in my opinion, was a little disappointing. Ludovico Einaudi, for those who don't know, is the man who scored This is England and created one of the most heartbreaking tracks from Xavier Dolan's Mommy. This one's not as memorable, I think, but Nomadland is admittedly one of those films where the best moments are done in complete silence.I also feel kinda bad for writer-director Chlo√© Zhao, yet another promising indie filmmaker picked up by Disney to create something ""slightly out there"" that nevertheless fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe mold of aesthetics and style. Nomadland might dominate the Oscars; her upcoming Eternals barely even seems acknowledged by the Marvel fanboys. Hoping for the best, Zhao."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,9/10,"This is a wonderful, deeply moving and inspirational piece of art. I felt my emotions kicking in within about 2 minutes from the start simply due to a jacket in the hands of the absolutely perfect Frances McDormand. The cinematography is beautiful to behold, the music used is perfect and the cast of non-actors are amazing. I was a bit taken back when David Strathairn first appeared as it broke the spell with a well known actor suddenly appearing, but he soon melded into the crowd and was fine. The direction of all these non-actors in all of these awesomely beautiful locations was perfection from beginning to end. This is a very honest piece of filmmaking which is where my only tiny reluctant criticism lies. Not everybody is as good and kind as every character in this film is, especially in these circumstances. This in no way really damages this near perfect film. It was a sad afterthought of reality."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,5/10,"In 2011, after losing everything Fern (Francis McDormand) in her 60s, sets out to be a Nomad and takes off in her Van, which she makes very comfortable.The economy is still reeling from the 2008 financial bust, the town she lived in also became an economic bust, her husband had died and she takes odd jobs at Parks and small towns and keeps moving. We hear her saying that ""stopping is like dying."" She likes being alone although she is a very personable person who makes friends easily enough at the Van Dwellings she commits to. I had never heard of Van Dwellings until now, but they do exist, I suppose, and many people in these Dwellings don't want to die without seeing all the country they can. There are many stories as to why these people come to the Nomad life and some are heartbreaking.We see she wants no attachments. She turns down a dog, holding a baby makes her uncomfortable and she doesn't encourage Dave's (David Strathairn) subtle advances.What was good: Fern is adaptive, friendly, resilient and really likes this Nomad life although we aren't really given any real insights why Fern does what she does. She doesn't regret her husband dying and speaks very little of him, there are no kids to contend with, but does have a sister who is mindful and fearful of Fern and the life she has chosen. The last scene typifies Fern's life and why she likes this life so far: She visits her old house and from the back door she sees the desert for miles and there is nothing in her way to stop her. See?Okay, to be fair Fern does do the remembrance things by looking at pictures of family and friends. The cinematography was good, but the best scenes had sunsets of a Pastel Nature. My favorite.Notables: David Strathairn as Dave, who took a serious liking to Fern although nothing romantic came of it; Bob Wells as Bob and Linda May as Linda and Charlene Swankie as Swankie, who all are Nomads and who gave Fern good advice on how to survive in Nomadland.This almost views like a Documentary, a Ken Burns story (without narration) so to speak and hopefully we won't see copy cats of these kinds of movies that end up in Best Picture categories. Hollywood needs to put these kinds of movies into a Documentary or some other suitable category. Hollywood learned a lesson with the outcry of anti-Best Picture movies that contained numerous Animation movies. We can only hope.Okay, let's finish up the What Was Bad: this was too much like a Documentary. Hollywood: we need stories..............Get it? In some ways I did enjoy this, but truthfully, I kept hoping it would be over soon. Worthy of an Oscar for Best Picture? No. An Oscar for Best Actress? No, although Francis McDormand is a good actress: Ya You Betcha! (Bob, you do know it won both Oscars, right? Can I get a Ya, You Betcha? ) Hmmmm....... (5/10)Violence: No. Sex No. Nudity: Yes, but from a distance, Fern is floating face-up in a lake without clothes.Humor: Not really although some would differ.Language: No.Rating: C: (8 May 2021)"
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,10/10,"Chloe Zhao directs , Frances McDormand ( producer) in an American Masterpiece of a masterful contemplative drama .
This movie is about several different things but for most part it's about the loss of jobs and the lack of support for retirement.
People , Americans mostly white , adjust to the this loss they innovate based on the amount of income . 500$ a month for retirement .( that's a no joke) . Their circumstances force them into a lifestyle change many would consider beneath them, or perhaps to consider it to hard .
Living in a van or an rv and travel and work where and when you can . This Nomadic lifestyle
is not new America has always had its share of people moving around , the indigenous people of the world up to the pioneers and in this time those who live via a mobile existence.
It is like a long poem about the ending of many different things all intertwined into the fabric of their existence.
Some many find it boring due to its slow pace but the message is so important and once one settles in and realizes this is a film about accepting once's situation and making the best of it . These people have not given up on America rather America has given up in these people . The loss of manufacturing has destroyed economic stability for many regions of the USA . But the one constant is the hard working people who adapt , change , and endure, the American.
I recommend this film because it's message is important . People will find a path and travel it
regardless of circumstance"
NOMADLAND,5 January 2021,5/10,"I am quite sure in light of all the hyper over the top reviews of this movie that my review will get voted down to the enth, but did I miss something and watch a different movie?Boring it the only word I could use to describe this movie. I am a BIG fan of anything Frances McDormand and she was my main reason for watching this all the way through.Maybe I had an off day, but sorry, this was seriously boring from start to finish.it gets a 5/10 from me just because Frances McDormand is in it."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,8/10,"The movie is beautiful, and I love how it's about a concept, or a life style if you will, that I had never seen anything about before. It explores the live of a ""modern nomad"" woman, and I think the story manages to say everything it needed to about that, you understand that, most of the people, just love the ""freedom"", and connecting to people along the way.The acting is phenomenal, Frances McDormand, once again, is just insanely good here, and all the other members of the cast, that were apparently not actors (and I just discovered that rn) were also pretty good.The score is great, the script is also pretty good, it manages to tell the story, and make the characters emote a lot, even tho they aren't actually saying much.At first I was unable to relate with the character's motivation to stay a nomad, cause well, in the beginning it seems that she only does that, cause she doesn't have a better option, however, during the film, she does have other options, and even choses to sleep on her van instead of a bedroom in a regular house at some point, and I found that odd, cause, well how am I suppose to care about her struggles, if she is choosing to live them?But, after a while, and talking with some people, I realize that she actually founds the meaning in the nomad life throughout the movie, by meeting with people, by been part of a community, and, by refusing to live a ""regular life"" again, when she does have a chance. So, I think I get it more now.To sum up, Nomadland is a pretty good movie, with great acting, great cinematography, and that explore a completely different subject, I hadn't seemed before anywhere."
NOMADLAND,17 May 2021,7/10,"This Oscar-scooping biopic of a modern-day nomad is intricate: the personalities Frances McDormand meets (most of whom were not actors but real nomads) are what build the environment, contrasting with the bleak realities of work and health. Enveloping this story are the jaw-dropping vistas of the USA - they are enough to make anyone consider why these nomads live they way they do.As McDormand traipses from job to job (the inside of an Amazon warehouse being one particularly stark environ), you get the sense that her life has as much of a cyclical nature as anyone else who is shackled to a routine. The reality is that whilst she does live on the poverty line, the freedom of her mobile home allows her to live a lifestyle most others would smirk at anyway.The fact that this manner of living was imposed on her by the death of her husband and her town is an interesting concept, making you wonder whether the change was her choice, or a necessity of her position. The story is less the driver and more an incidental occurrence: people on the road shape that experience, and Chlo√© Zhao does a terrific job of conveying this.I've written several times before about how America offers something so unique in terms of setting, and ""Nomadland"" comes closer than almost anything to demonstrating that. From the snow-driven mountains of the north through to the dry hills of the mid-west, this film looks superb. Zhao's eye goes further than just scenery, and her touch around every shot is evident and appreciated.""Nomadland"" will not be everyone's cup of tea. Some will see it as a slow and heavy process, but I more look at this movie as a heartfelt instance of realism. It meanders through American life (however you might interpret that), and in that regard, it is a memorable watch."
NOMADLAND,18 March 2021,4/10,"This movie is for whom love to watch movies based on daily life or reality.It's about how old poor homeless people lives, how much they face difficulties in finding jobs,how much they misses their loved ones.It's a clear picture of old people's life."
NOMADLAND,3 September 2021,9/10,"Despite the fact that this film does not have a well-defined plot, it manages to empathize with the protagonist.The plot may not be very attractive but the script manages to define its characters well and what they are going through. Frances McDormand's performance is impressive, she is so talented that she manages to fully immerse herself in the role and triumphs by bringing it to life, it has very good photography that highlights the beauty of the desert and the beautiful locations where it was filmed. The director does a spectacular job deserving of the Oscar, but I think that the Oscar for best picture must have been for The Father, for the most constructed plot.Through this film we can appreciate that loneliness is not bad for everyone, it teaches us that we must appreciate the moments that have an important meaning in our life, that happiness can be in ourselves and that we always have to do what we want and seek the best for us."
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,7/10,"From the very beginning of Nomadland I was captivated by the sights, sounds, and characters. Frances McDormand does a wonderful job with the material she's given. The bulk of non-professional actors assembled are genuinely interesting and drew me in as well. Director Zhao once again does an admirable job of capturing the beauty and majesty of the surrounding landscape. The score was powerful and complimentary to her vision. I really do appreciate the care taken to avoid exposition and the subtle, nuancing of the story itself resulting in a film that could have easily gone political and preachy, I really do. However, I also think she may have taken this approach a bit too far, leaving us with too many questions regarding Fern (McDormand's character). Some of the nomads seem to be there by choice and others due to circumstances. It's not so clear with Fern though and we're given conflicting and muddled messages. It is these mixed signals that prevent the viewer from fully submitting to her character and Nomadland as a whole, even though I very much wanted to. Nomaland is still an interesting and enjoyable film worth checking out."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,9/10,"Fran, a middle-aged woman who lost everything, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a nomad.Nomadland is going to be, for sure, a film that I will constantly review. Chlo√© Zhao committed herself to this project, taking over the reins of the script, the production and the editing, and she did everything right. In an increasingly rushed and artificial world, Nomadland is a breath of fresh air, lasting 2 hours, which transports us to another reality, one that does not tell us how to survive, but about how to live.Francis McDormand is very strong in the main role, showing an independent and resilient Fran, but also vulnerable and insecure in certain situations. The story gains a lot by focusing on the people who built it, especially the real nomads who are part of the cast, with real and emotional testimonies.I take my hat off to Joshua James Richards (Director of Photography) for the ability to capture an United States of America so cold and empty in such a beautiful and cozy way.""I'm not homeless, I'm just houseless""."
NOMADLAND,13 April 2021,9/10,"It is high time Frances McDormand is afforded the same stature and respect afforded to a Meryl Streep of a Helen Mirren.She is an absolute force of nature in Chloe Zhao's Nomadland, a poignant tale of loss, self-realization and love for the open road.Despite a minimalistic narration, there is so much nuance and depth to every scene that you cannot peel your eyes away.As a bereaved and homeless elder lady in search for meaning for the rest of her life, McDormand shines especially int the emotionally charged scenes,
David Strathaim and Linda May are good in their roles but at the end of the day, Nomadland is all about its leading lady.If there is any justice in the world, McDormand should win her third Best Actress Oscar come the 25th of April.Highly recommended. Masterclass."
NOMADLAND,13 February 2021,2/10,"What was that Seinfeld episode? ""It's a show about NOTHING!""Well, there you have it, except this is a movie. Preface to say the only reason I even watched this is because many critics have it as one of the frontrunners for the Oscars. I was curious.You get to watch clothes flip in the laundry, hamburgers cooking on the grill, and mostly see a lady walk around areas that have little to no meaning.That's about it.At one point, I thought I was watching a parody about an overly artsy movie and had to remind that it is a serious drama.If you are not a fan of slow films, then you can just pass on this. It is no exaggeration to label this one of the slowest movies ever.Most startlingly, for a movie so slow that seems to strive for meditation and deeper meaning, there really actually is nothing underneath the surface. I wish I never seen it, and can't wait to get the taste out by watching something truly good.1.5/10"
NOMADLAND,1 January 2021,9/10,"First of all Frances McDormand is brilliant in this movie, she is really one of the best actresses ever she perfectly fits in any role she plays. The cinematography is stunning with many amazing sceneries of the landscapes. The dedication of this movie is beautiful and touching. Screenplay is very good. Original score is awesome. The movie is great and so emotional but it's so slow-paced and a bit long with nothing much going on which makes it a bit boring sometimes."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,8/10,"First of all, ""Bravo to Frances""..... to lay yourself out as brilliantly as she does takes some kinda courage for an established actress.She must have had as hard a time as I did in seeing herself portrayed in such stark plainness, some scenes are so poignantly real that you have to force yourself to keep on watching. Some of the rest of the cast make for hard viewing too, but this is a film that takes realism to another level.It's easy to see why she was cast in this role, some of the backdrops are very ""Fargo-ish"" and ""Mississippi Burning-ish"" and Frances just fits in like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle. When Directors get these shots right there's just nothing better.So why's it so hard to rate?Well you have to be in the mood for a slower paced story, you have to be in the mood to sink a couple of hours of your own life into an examination of the rolling life that is the path of the American Gypsy.There probably was a music score, but there's no music I can recall that helps you through. You just have to sit back and learn about the way people live their lives and get by in the itinerant world of RV/camper van/back- of- your car living.It's much the same way as roving cowboys did when the West was won. A temporary job here, a McJob there, just enough to get you through the next few weeks or months until you move on. Every character has a story and some of those stories will have you crying just a bit.Chlo√© Zhao, the Director, does a great job in portraying the workplace at the Amazon warehouse. She could have made it look like an exploitive sweatshop but no, she makes it into a place where sweet people work, people care for each other and take pride in what they do.Not many in the film industry would miss an opportunity to put the boots to the megacorp but she deals with it without judgement.
I know that I could never work in such a vast, sterile environment, but then again, I have the luxury of choice.The premise for our heroine's transition from middle class America with home and a great job is the failure of the Gypsum plant, the main employer in the town, and the subsequent collapse of its reason for being.Her husband dies and she is left with nothing but state subsidies to keep her going. Living in a van is not only the cheapest option but fulfills her introverted way of looking at existence.There is a great scene where she visits the abandoned Gypsum plant, and for all the world it comes across as an Amazon warehouse with inches of gypsum dust covering everything. I don't know, but maybe it's a forecast for the future of Amazon itself... nothing lasts forever.All in all a very good movie if, as I said, you get yourself in the right frame of mind for watching it."
NOMADLAND,5 April 2021,,"Early on in Nomadland, Fern tells someone, ""I'm not homeless. I'm just houseless. It's not the same thing."" Fern is 61. She's a widow. But she hasn't just lost her husband. She's lost her way of life. Empire, the company town where they lived, has been shut. We are told the zip code has been discontinued. So Fern becomes a nomad. She fits her van, which she names Vanguard, with a bed, a cooking area and a small storage space. She takes up temporary jobs, including one in a gigantic Amazon fulfilment centre. Mostly she drives through the vast American landscape. Sometimes Fern seems dwarfed by the immensity of nature - towering trees, snow-covered plains that stretch as far as the eye can see, thundering seas crashing against ragged rocks. Fern is alone but she isn't pitiful - not even when she's using a bucket in the van as a toilet. Her resilience is deeply moving. Her dignity and strength made me weep.a"
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,9/10,"Skillfully filmed and edited, this slice of life is as real as it gets. Cast with non-actors (except for the Strathairn and McDormand), this film paces itself with the determined, unshakable faith in living on the road. Most of us are not nomads, but the unfiltered emotion portrayed by these first-time actors affects the viewer like very few movies.It's not perfect. At one point, my attention wandered but a gentleman talking about a tragedy in his life woke me up with his touching real-life story.. Many will be put off by the lack of a traditional plot, but the reward here is a very different one. For anyone who has traveled across the country for the experience and affirmation of being truly alive, from Kerouac to McDormand's character in this film, this just might be a revelation."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,1/10,"Frances was great as usual. But this script was not capable of allowing her REAL talent to shine. Don't waste your time! Then again, if I'm going to waste my time and money on a slow, boring film, I at least want the benefit of looking at some reasonable facsimile of Scarlett Johansson. Call me shallow, I won't care.While there is something exotic and thrilling to the idea of becoming an itinerant vagabond, there is nothing that this film exhibits to make such a lifestyle remotely desirable. And when the credits role, it is just another fantasy tale of life as played out in an era of social turmoil. For as we slowly settle back into reality, we know for sure that none of the actors in this film would ever voluntarily choose to leave their walled-off mansions and Filet Mignon diets for a chance to be truly free. After all, they may have to drink tap water instead of Perrier."
NOMADLAND,4 March 2021,7/10,"Have you ever thought about going off the grid to drive around in an RV and live without a care in the world? I know I have because it sounds like a spiritually liberating experience. However, I know that it would probably be a simple adventure and eventually, I will get back to normal living. In this film, the protagonist doesn't have this luxury because not only did her company shut down, but her entire town was removed from the map and to top it off, she lost her husband.Finding herself in such dire circumstances with no place to call home and no children to fall back on, she chooses to live as a Nomad. She takes on random jobs to sustain her existence and sleeps in parks before finding a supportive Nomad community who are also living a similar kind of life. One common thing between these Nomads is that they are old and I couldn't help but think about old age, retirement and what it would hold in store. These troubling thoughts hit me quite hard and that is what made the film impactful and engrossing for me.The reason why this tragic realism felt so accessible was because of Chloe Zhao's melancholic directing and McDormand's gritty and poignant acting. And yet, while some hardships were touched upon, the experience lacked any true challenges like security, health, fuel costs or food. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. What's more, we never get to understand the protagonist's motivations, specially knowing that she is living this way by choice.Nevertheless, if you are into soul searching experiences and don't mind a slow movie that kind off floats around, then give Nomadland a shot and maybe you will connect with it the same way I did.Movies.shmovies on Instagram"
NOMADLAND,26 December 2020,9/10,"Fern played brilliantly by Frances McDormand has lost her job in the great recession. She decides to track around the midwest of America in an R.V. She meets a lot of interesting people in search of something, finding meaning to her life. This is a very beautiful film. Beautifully shot with some amazing cinematography it is beautifully acted and a film that really stays with you. The film is really well directed by Chloe Zhao chinese american director who has had acclaim on the independent film circut. This film is a slice of life of america that you dont usually see. I think it is one of the years best films"
NOMADLAND,8 February 2021,8/10,"With ""Nomadland"", writer/director/editor Chlo√© Zhao has crafted something special, something that pulls you in and never lets you go. Many times you catch yourself just basking in the imagery. The plains, the mountains, the natural landscapes. It doesn't feel like a movie, but a feeling that just carries you all the way through. With a lead terrific performance from the legendary Frances McDormand and a supporting turn from the reliable David Strathairn, Zhao combines so many complex things to create a true piece of art."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,9/10,"This is a very quiet movie.It is a very slow paced film due to it being a very ""fly on the wall"" tale, I didn't find that this hindered the experience in any way though, I was never board when watching.I think the casting of real world people was a fantastic movie by the film makers. I really am a sucker for this type of thing in a movie like in Freaks (1938). It adds this realism to a fiction story that just can't be manufactured and lets you get some sort of glimpse into a world different than your own. It is very documentary like at times.I think Frances was really good and I really appreciated all the effort that she went though trying to capture this lifestyle. Honestly though for me the real life nomads stole the show. I thought they did a fantastic job for people who are not actors. I could have sat and listened to their stories for the whole movie. I couldn't tell if these stories were their real life experiences or they were wrote for them to say but I was just captivated by them.The shots in the movie are also incredible. Chlo√© Zhao really knows how to get an amazing shot. There are so many in this film. They are really a treat to watch.I think the score is really lovely too and works well with the story. It is quiet and reserved much like the movie.I do however think that the character of Fern could have been a little bit more fleshed out. I could see this glimmers of personality trying to break though but they didn't. All I know is that she was a friendly woman. She was kind. I inferred other things about her but I didn't know if I was reading too much into it. I think a key moment is when a character talks about Fern and tells us what she is like and I was so confused because this wasn't the person that I had been watching. I think maybe they could have spent just a little bit more time fleshing her out maybe if they removed one of the jobs she does there could have been time.I would definitely watch it if you are at all interested in this type of film and I think that it is just an interesting watch due to the production of it. It's something a little different."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,3/10,"There is virtually no plot and there are long stretches with no dialogue and nothing happens. I know I""m probably missing the point, but I prefer films that tell a story rather than just pointing a camera at someone else living their boring lives."
NOMADLAND,25 May 2021,6/10,"POSITIVES:1) The acting is incredible. Frances McDormand steals the show but also the performances from the real life Nomads are so impressive
2) The cinematography is fantastic. Lots of the shots are notably beautiful and there are lots of long uncut sequences
3) There are plenty of very emotional scenes and the film definitely works on an emotional levelNEGATIVES:1) There just isn't really much of a plot?? There's no real arc from beginning to end or any real resolution, which made it hard to be invested at times
2) I found the editing very unusual and abrasive. A lot of the cuts between scenes seem very abrupt and seem to randomly switch location and plot line and put the viewer in the middle of something random."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,6/10,"Not being American, I can't fully tap into the mindset of that type of traveller in those circumstances, but in Europe we have ""travellers"" as well, so I guess this is a thing.For the most part It just seems to paint a dystopian picture where good willing people due to hard luck are forced to begrudgingly take on a life that is not necessarily all that wholesome and great.The messaging I get from this that this lifestyle is bearable when shared does not make it a great style of life in my opinion. What I see here is the erroneous championing of misgiving charity where for most people a social safety net would have been mote eficience and better for mental health.The celebration if a massive failure of a rich society, to me, it not cause for celebration. Essentially it shows how the ""American dream"" in reality is a nightmare and a dogma."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,8/10,"A Beautiful look into the wonder of life. The tragedy of loss people towns a home. A majestic marvel that is outside our door. As humans drift up and down the roads nature Animals do to. Like a wave from the sea , all needing to be seen. Waiting to be spotted. Hopefully of being remembered even if unknowingly."
NOMADLAND,12 September 2020,10/10,"A stunning road movie, distinctly american, with a soul of its own.
I have never seen a Chloe Zhao before, but I can say that her style feels close to some of Malick's less radical works, which I mean as a praise. It's a film that makes you strongly empathize with its characters, it successfully manages to make you want to embark on such a nomadic life. It is able to transfer that sense of connection to nature that its characters feel. Imbibed with Thoreau, it manages to even slip in quite a few Shakespeare quotes.
Many might argue that my assessment that the life depicted is close to the one imagined by Thoreau in his ""Walden"" is wrong, as the protagonist doesn't isolate herself from society. Yet, Thoreau's account of his experiment also shows that he interacted with local communities, next to living in the woods. Similarly, these nomads live in a liminal level between society. they do small, temporary jobs, but are free enough to connect with nature, to build their home, in a similar fashion to Thoreau. In this sense, Nomadland is an authentic, culturally american movie, opposed to the unauthentic, modern-day chaos that is often perceived in the word as representative of what is ""american""."
NOMADLAND,25 July 2021,8/10,"Any movie starring Frances McDormand and David Strathairn is going to be dependably first-rate. Nomadland is a touching, revealing look into an American sub-sub-culture that few might even know exists: people who either by choice or by necessity, have taken permanently to the road. The story centers on Fern (McDormand), a widow who lost her home in the 2008 housing crash and has only a camper van left in which to live and travel. The movie shows a year in her 'new' life. It's her story, but in a sense she stands in for all the other nomads on the road. Most days, she just drives and -- exists. When money gets really tight, she'll pick up an odd job for a while (Amazon warehouse, farming co-op, you name it) before she just moves on again.Her new nomadic life seems to be without goals, and I guess that's part of the point. What do you do when your life and goals have been taken away from you? She meets others in her situation at trailer parks and camps scattered around in the western US. They form short-term bonds, trade and barter useful little possessions and valuable advice, separate, talk over campfires, maybe meet again ""down the road"" and do those things over again. They have vanished from any kind of organized society. Tracing their lives within their curious non-culture is what makes this film unique.Fern, as a character, starts out as a blank slate and in the end, she's still something of an enigma. She's able to be perfectly sociable with others, but there's always a bit of a wall around her that nobody can get past. Not even Dave (Strathairn), with whom she has a chance to get off the wanderer's treadmill and back into an appealing version of mainstream life. But she steps away from that too, for reasons we never quite grasp. Maybe she doesn't grasp them fully either. Reconnecting in that way is apparently a bridge too far for her. The only thing we see her really enjoying is the geography -- the diversity of beautiful settings in the western states. Frances McDormand seems born to play characters like this -- observant, sympathetic, yet in a way tragic.All the other people in the cast are just that -- utterly regular people who by choice or by force are getting by as wanderers. One other small role that stood out among them was Bob (Bob Wells), a kind of sage of the nomads whom others can confide in.It's all very absorbing. One problem I had with it was that it was built almost entirely out of little snippets and vignettes -- short scenes that have neither a beginning nor an end; we just see the middle and then it jumps to the next one. I suppose that, too, is part of the point -- these people's lives are built just that way -- but there were almost no scenes that were allowed to develop past those snippets.Kudos, of course, to the director/writer Chloe Zhao. I just hope she doesn't direct ""Eternals"" (the upcoming new Marvel epic) the same way."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a surprisingly balanced look at the van living, nomadic life within America. It is hauntingly beautiful, beguiling and poetic while not sugar coating a difficult lifestyle.Frances McDormand has become a legend. From her debut in Blood Simple to her iconic role in Fargo to her latest gritty, down-to-earth performance in Nomadland, she disappears into her roles like a perfectly fit glove.Nomadland is comprised mostly of actual American nomads. If it wasn't for her star factor, McDormand could be mistaken for her real-life counterparts. She is mesmerizing in a few scenes where she flits around in gorgeous natural settings like an eight year old beholding these views for the first time.The third act is a bit jarring tonally as it shifts towards scenes of a ""normal"" suburban life, which I'm not sure were necessary, but thankfully it was short.Another fascinating real-life character is Bob Wells who apparently is the face of this lifestyle. While not an actor, he is so charismatic and authentic. I plan to check his story out next."
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,9/10,"This is the story of a brave woman who is very different from your usual grandmas. Fern is one of those people, who after having lost a husband she adored & a home that she loved, can't start all over again. So final is her heartbreak that she doesn't want any other husband & she definitely doesn't want any other house. And yet, she is a pleasant person to be around. People enjoy her company. She enjoys working & has retained her connection with mother nature.Fern is different than other vandwelling nomads because she is a nomad by choice. The film shows a fellow nomad who settles nicely into his family life, but Fern doesn't want such a thing for herself. She's aware of all the hardships & insecurities that she'll have to face along the way but she chooses to follow her own path! That's a brave lady!The only hitch with this pitch perfect movie is that some of the problems of the vandwelling life have been sidelined, especially with regard to those who are living a nomadic life due to their impoverished circumstances & not by choice."
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,6/10,"Most Americans don't know European Cinema, that's why so many people consider this original when it is in fact an adaptation of the neo-realist style established by Michael Haneke and the Dardenne Brothers over 20 years ago. You will notice the resemblance if you watch ""Rosetta"" (1999), ""Cach√©"" (2005), ""L'Enfant"" (2005), ""The White Ribbon"" (2009) and particularly ""Amour"" (2012), all of which won major awards. That doesn't mean that Chloe Zhao is a copycat - ""Nomadland"" is performance-driven like most American films, and Frances McDormand delivers some her most accentuated work here. However, for a European audience, there isn't any novelty, and the film seems average compared to classics of the genre.As someone who did sleep rough long ago, I also have to side with reviewers who deem this a romanticized and unrealistic look at outsiderness. Alas, there is no covenant of the dispossessed, you watch your stuff as poor people steal from each other, many die from lack of medical care, and police will make you step out of your vehicle if they catch you on a parking lot at night even when it's freezing. Gleaning, which is of major importance to all drifters, and was examined by Anges Varda in the far superior ""The Gleaners and I"" (2000), is hardly referenced. An honest look at poverty would be Danis Tanovic's ""Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker"" (2013), which features the very protagonists of its real-life story. That is more convincing than having poor people interpreted by millionaires - the main negative aspect of this film, which could easily have employed a less privileged person for the lead.Realism has already gone out fashion in Europe since it's been the dominant style for decades, and I truly hope that the inevitable Academy Award win of this film is not going to revive it. ""Nomadland"" is bagging awards for lack of alternatives, as 2020 was the worst film year in living memory for obvious reasons. And of course it's preferable over a hot mess like ""Tenet"". But it's not an original work that will stand the test of time as a major artistic contribution. If you want to watch a recent film that uses a real-life premise more convincingly, I suggest the Serbian ""Otac"" (Father), or among the Academy-Award nominated lot, the Romanian ""Collective""."
NOMADLAND,14 February 2021,8/10,"Few films are as stunningly real as this one in portraying economic adversity. The ravaging effects of the Great Recession are encapsulated by the story of Fern, a human resources employee at a large factory in Nevada who sees her life upended by the factory's closing and the subsequent loss of her home. Fern's story is brought to life by an amazingly subtle performance for Frances McDormand whose protagonist conveys anguish, anxiety and quiet persistence in the face of disaster. The film portrays her unstable, winding road in the aftermath of all these tragic upheavals.From the superb acting to the heartfelt soundtrack to the grand scenery of Nevada, Arizona, South Dakota, Nebraska and California this film is a gripping portrayal of struggle in late middle age and a grim reminder of how steep a fall the country's economic decline was for those of modest means. I would only raise one small critique, that I would have liked to follow the journey with more information on the locations and distances travelled.It is quite touching to witness this nomad's life where people enter and leave lives of others so frequently, and even with these very short encounters it seems like friendships are built. Maybe it is their heartache which unites them on their journey and gives these nomads strength to keep on with their - sometimes not freely chosen - lives on the road. For some this is their final path, others get an opportunity to return to a settled life - and some just struggle somewhere in between.Overall this is a gem of moviemaking in a very unique way and close to a documentary. Recommended to everybody on the journey through life who is openminded to facing also the challenges of economic loss in later phases of life."
NOMADLAND,13 March 2021,9/10,"Nomadland is the latest movie from the director Chloe Zhao who was also behind The Rider and will be making the upcoming Marvel movie, The Eternals.The film Nomadland is about Fern (Frances McDormand) a nomad, who has lost everything and has now took to the road to get everything she can from life.This film is going to be very hard to describe with words. For me, it was one of those experiences in the theaters were I was just amazed. The story was a part of that. It created many investing characters that you felt sympathy for throughout the movie. Many people you felt happy to see again if Fern met them down the road. That was a big theme of the film. Even though you are leaving someone, you will still see them later on. You don't really get messages that are that strong in movies. There was one problem that I had with the story, that was that the ending. Nomadland didn't really end in the best of ways. It sort of just ended the way it started. For some people, I bet that was a nice ending, but I didn't like it that much. That is the only complaint I have with the whole film. Otherwise, the story was a work of art.The acting was a key part of making this film what it is. Frances McDormand gave one of her best performances. I think she has a pretty good chance at getting an Oscar for her work in this film. David Strathairn also played a pretty big part in the film. He portrayed a very likable person and just knocked it out of the park. Everybody in this film was likable. There was nobody that was hard to feel sad or happy for. The rest of the characters that you saw throughout the film were all actual nomads. They all gave pretty good performances in this film. None of them felt like the people in The 15:17 To Paris.The scenery was outstanding. Many times, I was in awe by how nice this film looked. It really captured how nice many places are in the United States. That was one of the things that made the movie feel so special to me. The many places they went overall just made me feel like I should explore the world more and go to more places. Also just all of the opinions of the end of life just made me feel not that sad about it. It sounds weird but when this film talked about death, I didn't feel all depressed like in Five Feet Apart.Nomadland looked beautiful and was told even better although the ending didn't really line up. Nomadland is a film I would recommend to anybody."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,9/10,"The movie is very deep, meaningful and tries to guide towards the answer. How shall we accept the death of our loved ones? The regrets in our lives and moving on with it. The acting is great. The journey from denial to acceptance and viewing an alternate view to our life. The movie paces slowly and will be remembered for long time to come. Personally I liked the metaphor of the broken plate amd fixing it, same goes with the downs in our lives."
NOMADLAND,27 September 2020,10/10,"Chloe Zhao's film with Frances McDormand as a widowed ""nomad"" who spends her years living from place to place in the western United States and working various occupations is a stunning piece of cinema. While the plot of the film may sound rather understated, its understatedness is actually part of its inherent beauty.McDormand's character, Fern, initially starts off working for Amazon before deciding to leave and start moving from place to place. The cinematography of the film's settings across the West and Great Plains is absolutely gorgeous, to put it mildly. Its shots are grand in scope yet never flashy or pretentious, immersing the viewer head-on in real natural beauty on a level that enables them to truly escape from the realities in which they are living in. There is a great mix of wider road, park, or mountain shots and more up-close shots focusing on Fern, other characters, or everyday facts of nature. The sheer diversity and beauty of the aesthetic will remind film lovers of Terrence Malick and/or Emmanuel Lubezki. The score is also beautifully tuned and bittersweet, pairing neatly and thoroughly with the tone of the film as a whole. McDormand's performance is outstanding, providing an irresistible combination of tenacity, pathos, and grit. Her acting feels remarkably genuine and down-to-earth when she is in character, and the screenplay develops her character very well. It truly is one of the greatest performances of her career. The various jobs that she works throughout the film and the people she interacts with all complement the film's character development. While most of the supporting characters are not in the film for too long, they are all thoroughly unique and interesting as well. You truly empathize for them and realize that the nomad lifestyle is not only one rooted in hardship, such as financial difficulty, but also one (in their opinion) of hope, relatability to common struggles and ordinary concerns, and opportunity; almost inherently liberating to some degree. The film is paced leisurely yet cohesively, allowing viewers to fully engage with and take in all the details of its aesthetic and presentation of the nomadic lifestyle while still moving deftly enough to propagate how it represents various facets of such lifestyle.All in all, this is the best film of 2020 so far and a superbly well-made picture on every level--acting, emotional power, cinematography, editing, and score. I can't wait to see what Chloe Zhao does next (she has been hired to direct the upcoming Marvel blockbuster ""The Eternals."") 10/10"
NOMADLAND,17 March 2021,10/10,"Saw this after the preview of Michelle Pfeiffer's overcooked posturing in French Exit, Nomadland made her look like a pretentious tiresome try hard.This film is simply flawlessLoved it."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,7/10,"For me Nomadland has the feeling of a study: a study of a certain type of person, including her personality, to what she's attracted, what she fears, and the kind of environments to which she is drawn. Taking all these features as part of the study of Fern, the character inhabited by Frances McDormand who won Best Actress for it, the film is a unified whole.By the end of the film I was thinking, What a sad movie. But then I realized, no, it's not supposed to be sad. It's meant to portray a very independent woman who cannot be hemmed in by anything. Not by people, not by her environment, not by her own emotions. She is always leaving.She's presented as someone who must be free to be her own mild-mannered self for whom the only bothersome thing is having her freedom taken away. Here, freedom means not being hemmed in by needs or commitment to anyone or anything. Her mood, as well as the overall mood of the film, is portrayed like the scenery: open, vast, peaceful and full of a certain kind of mellow beauty.I kept waiting for something terrible to happen to her, especially because of scenes such as when Fern and other women she was with were checking out tasers, suggesting they should carry them as protection. Then her friend Dave (David Strathairn) warns her about walking alone at night in a certain area.But ultimately those scenes I interpreted as foreshadowing amounted to nothing and for that I was really glad. The subject of potential harm coming to a woman on the road alone created a bit of tension, but the film delivered a happy message by not having that potential lead to anything.In the end, it is a subtle yet moving film in which nothing spectacular happens."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,6/10,"Nomadland (2020, Chloe Zhao)
From director Zhao comes this understated movie that is easily the best reviewed film of 2020. Zhao is a bit of an unknown, but stakes her indie cred here with this extremely well regarded film, and she has been tapped to direct Marvel's Eternals film which should be an interesting marriage of styles. This film does capture a timely slice of Americana where many people struggle on the downside of capitalism under the yoke of recession. Knowing next to nothing about this film I was surprised to find that there are only about two real actors in the film, and the balance of the cast are real people playing basic versions of themselves. It can be construed as a bit of a gimmick, but it works effectively in this story as the film relies more on these folks as emotional entities and foils for our main character Fern rather than relying on them for any great feats of acting. That being said Zhao gets very organic performances from these non-actors. Frances McDormand gives a very real, inhabited performance for main character Fern. It is not a super splashy role with outpourings of loud emotions. Like the rest of this film it is very understated and under the surface. David Straitharn costars and, to my eye, is the only other professional actor in the cast.The plot centers around the nomadic wandering life of Fern. For an unknown reason she packs up her belongs in a somewhat modified van and begins roving around the American west living this sort of underground, off the grid lifestyle. She gets seasonal work here and there in national parks, Amazon facilities or whatever else she can find. She maintains a loose collection of friendships who also exist in this lifestyle and we come to find out that there is an entire subculture of people like this, living as wandering nomads. Fern seems to have trouble associating with loved ones who are as baffled at her life choices as we are as audience members. She can't even manage to navigate a relationship as her and Straitharn's David have chemistry but when he leaves the lifestyle to settle down with family she balks and tramps on. We learn that Fern and her husband shared a house in Empire, Nevada which was a mining boomtown and had a good life until fate turned and the gypsum plant shutdown which crippled the economy essentially wiping the town off the map. Fern's husband died from cancer shortly thereafter and launching into this lifestyle was a way for Fern to deal or not deal with her thoughts and feeling regarding this, or perhaps to continually deal with them as, I would think, being a nomad affords you a lot of time to think and ponder the state of affairs. After she essentially rejects settling down we learn that she feels to settle down away from Empire would somehow dishonor her husband. She returns to the town and her old house for a quiet, contemplative moment amidst the rubble of her former life before hitting the road yet again. ""The road goes ever, ever on.""
I must admit that this film did not resonate with me as much as it did for some critics out there. I did enjoy the tone and visuals and did not even mind the laconic pacing. I just could not discern what, if any, commentary this film was trying to make. There are two themes that are present here and one is a statement about America and this nomadic lifestyle and the people who live it. The other is Fern's specific story, and why she is out there roaming around. I felt that no points were made about the nomadic lifestyle and despite some wonderful sequences with some wonderful people I am not sure if this film was trying to say that it's alright to exist this way or these are damaged people finding the only way they can to deal with their damage away from what society at large considers acceptable. The film never really committed to any commentary on that front other than to display it which very well may have been an intentional creative choice but it felt lacking in some way. Fern's story goes down a similar path. For the longest time we don't know what drives her, and when we do I am not sure we fully understand it. The film doesn't strive to make you understand. The film only has a few moments of anything resembling rationale for why she is making her way like this, and like I said, these are probably specific creative choices but the lack of insight doesn't give the audience the appropriate tools or motivation to figure out what Fern is doing or why. I am not saying she has to be a completely open book, but we need a little something otherwise all I really get is a damaged person is still on her path in a way that allows her to deal with life once her utopia has crumbled to dust around her.This film had some interesting ideas to explore I just don't think it fully was able to explore those ideas. It walks a fine line being so understated without any insight or closure that it could be construed either as brilliant or pretentious. I like lyrical, understated, message movies but this film seems to start and end at the same point and while I want to understand and empathize with the main character neither the director or the writer (in this case the same person) gives us the latitude to make that connection.Eric's Grade: C+"
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,10/10,"Chlo√© Zhao and Frances McDormand did a superb job with this major story peoples tale! It was totally the right picture for an Oscar honour and finally gave Holywood a Kudo for once instead of the usual 'Lovey Dovey' raspberry award! When you think of all the many multitude of utter rubbish actors in the business these days, it was incredible that 99% of the other characters in this movie were not actors in real life and were in fact real life nomads.The people who gave nothing but negativity about this must have sad existences to knock such an easy going informative film such as this one.No stunts, No CGI and all just a visually chillaxing road movie!"
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,7/10,"This film can serves as a historic record of 2010-11 (the recesssion and that year there was a global movement of ""Occupy"" incidents like in Manhattan NY, etc.) by looking at a factual incident of small town, closed due to a company bankuptsy in 2011 (based on the book by Jessica Bruder). The tenacity of the film's castmember: Frances McDormand is but a fantastical performance.This film continues the same vein as Zhao's previous film on rural working class ""cowboys"", hinting Neo Realism, natural landscape cinematography and subverting tropes about the working class, or in this case the underdog.This story (dramatized by facts) explores the ""nomad"" subculture, of their RV/trailer camps moving in and out parks, deserts, etc. delving into the idea of ""sustainability"". A community of economic disadvantages, yes there's a bit of ""romanticism"" in depicting the nomadic communities but it's still a must-see!The main character may not fit into the average ""nomad"" in which the film tends to give a backstory of the character (breaking general stereotypes, presenting more of an individual portrait)."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,9/10,"A challenging movie, for one to keep up amongst the non-digital and spicy life of nomads.But maybe, that's what life was all about before we made it into a frenzy."
NOMADLAND,13 June 2021,1/10,"I'm a fan of Frances McDormand, David Strathairn, slow moving films that focus on character study with beautiful scenery, a great soundtrack, and the use of real people as actors. Nomadland had all of this, and yet, it was not for me.The story centers on Fern, McDormand's character, a widow who was evicted from company housing in Empire Nevada after the US Gypsum plant closed and the town became a ghost town. As a result, she begins living a nomadic lifestyle in her van. I realize this is not a documentary set to cover all the aspects of vehicular nomadism, though I might have liked it better if it had been.I found the film a grim, depressing, unrealistic, and ultimately privileged and romanticized view of Americans who take to the road in their elder years due to the inability to support themselves on their measly retirement income, even after working hard all their lives. This film touches into physical hardships, loss, and lonliness. Life is complex; through the worst of times, good souls, friendships, new viewpoints, and beautiful sunsets will often surface.I have friends who were once successful professionals, now displaced from homes and living in their cars due to medical malpractice that is rampant in the U. S. Our legislators ignore this epic problem. I've talked to them as they try to settle in to sleep in gas station parking lots. I know other medical malpractice victims who tried to commit suicide because they are are unable to work and are on a path to homelessness, or still others who were left so impoverished due to medical harm, they have no vehicle, were disabled and can't drive, and therefore no prospects for a viable future, even living in a car.For these and other reasons, this was not the movie for me. Given that it won numerous awards and ravenous praise, clearly I'm in the minority viewpoint once again with regards to a popular film."
NOMADLAND,4 June 2021,4/10,"It felt more like watching a documentary about the real life struggle of American hard working people, but this one had real actual actors."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,"Its a good movie. Some reviews say this does not represent the traveling lifestyle, and they might be right, but I don't think the movie is trying to do that. It is a story about what happened to this one person and her journey through grief, loss and the search for meaning and freedom.There are plenty of documentaries that describe the lifestyles of nomads, tramps, travelers, snow birds, roadies etc. My favorite by far is Richard Grant's 'American Nomads'. You can find on you tube I really recommend you watch that. In it he actually meets a few of who Fern is representing.Does Nomadland deserve an Oscar? Maybe not but I really could care less about the Oscars or what they represent. Its a good movie."
NOMADLAND,20 October 2021,10/10,"This movie won most of the big awards when it was released, and it was very much deserved.Telling a very uniquely made and realistic story, it's a very unconcentional film, where most of the actors are playing themselves in order to make it more authentic, and it makes you ponder where the line between feature and documentary is drawn?Francis McDormad is, of course, incredible as always, and it's a very slow paced and interesting film that chronicles the every day life in a great fashion.Overall, everything from it's amazing script, it's unique cinematography and it's great acting from everyone involved makes this a very important and uniquely put together film."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,9/10,"Nomadland is a highly pretty film, where Chlo√© Zhao forces us into the middle of somewhere in America. Fern (Frances McDormand) attacks life with a quiet power, a menacing indignity against most of humanity. Dave (David Strathairn) meanders through life, finding connections in time to be grandfatherly and kind.If you add Into the Wild and I, Daniel Blake with a strong dash of Willie Nelson, you get a Ken Loach-esque stab at the heartland. Whither will we go, and whence were we now and then? Through the Badlands and huge piles of dirty beets we meet a few real-life nomads, people who do not fit in with a more normal, static lifestyle. The nomadic path is one of shifting connections that never last much more than necessary, yet Fern struggles each day to gather meaning in the mundanity of her self-dealt loneliness.Fern avoids emotional attachment at the cost of never really letting go, caught in a trap of her own making which she tries to escape through van life, trailer-park life, and fulfilling the occasional Amazon order. The consequences of nomadic life leave behind an emptiness replete with memories and experiences, suggesting that perhaps society and nomads are better off sticking to their own devices, at least until we need each other, or at least until we agree we might want each other."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,7/10,"The cinematography and acting are excellent. The movie is an interest blend of fiction and documentary. It's slow and somber. I think the movie is an interesting achievement in cinematic art, but it doesn't really stand out to me as something I would normally go out of my way to watch."
NOMADLAND,18 April 2021,8/10,"Director Chloe Zhao's movie Nomadland is about Fern (extremely talented Frances McDormand from movies Fargo, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), a widow that carries contentment, love and happiness of her past in her present life . Fern expresses peace and gratitude of a pleasant life . Fern opts for a nomadic life and interacts with many interesting people . But Fern does not make decisions to get a dog left behind by owner or get involved with Dave(actor David Strathairn) who is also a nomad but with children and grandkids. Fern recollects her dad's words of how she spends more time with her memories than her actual married life with her loving husband who died of illness and in pain. Cinematography is beautiful of states I have not yet seen mainly SD, NV, NE. Oscar worthy acting by Frances McDormand. 107 minutes long, too long. Some scenes could be edited without having an impact on greatness of talent in Frances McDormand."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,7/10,"A run or a journey into the life of Fern is quite interesting and believing and there comes Nomadland. The grooviest subject at the peak where we feel that the camera just turns to the life of Fern. She is an abandoned woman, or somehow it can be said that she chooses that isolated or that lonely life. She is happy with it. But was she happy? The answer will give you through the film and you have to grab it. At all, it is a documentary type movie which talks about the life of nomads and the way of their living. Fern is just added to it. When Fern is cut into separation (I mean thematically) we can find the lives of many nomads in it. The film also counts about the 2008-recession that shook the American economy and the common people. Beautiful frames at its crest and echoing of the splendid music notes color the situation. It is a good realistic depiction of the nomad in the deserted areas of the USA. No matter of disbelieving in getting three Academy awards in the section of Best Film, Best Director, and Best Leading Actress for this film."
NOMADLAND,8 January 2021,9/10,"With a few, right and essential elements, Chlo√© Zhao puts on a quality, impactful film, full of important meanings on life and its reflection. All adorned with very simple, albeit refined direction, which manages to capture places as if they were the backgrounds of a theater, making the narration alive and allegorical. Film that also wins for the singular, unique and always daring performance of Frances McDormand, which once again enchants and amazes. Certainly important film, which without shame, is expressed with intelligent simplicity, but which leaves the mark of an allegory, therefore of meanings that go beyond mere simplicity."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,6/10,You can easily see why this film scored big on Oscar night. Frances McDormand carries this film. Her acting is both beautiful and painful to watch. Cinematography and soundtrack are top notch too. It's an almost documentary look into the unknown world of the nomads. But storywise it's a bit unsatisfactory as the plot really doesn't go anywhere.
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,"Nomadland peeks into the lives of modern day ""nomads"". Celebrating the beauty and also the sadness in their life.Not often does a cinema tells a story from a point of view which is not only very secluded from pop culture but also so grounded on harsh reality. The harsh reality not being the homelessness (or houselessness) but about how the society underrates their life.Nomadland is beautifully written. It portrays the liveliness, the monotonousness, the mundane, the sacrifice, the experience.Mcdormand is the soul of this film. She is breathtaking in this film."
NOMADLAND,2 August 2021,6/10,"It deserves all the Oscars, the acting is great and directing is really good, but... is it a documentary? Yes, definitely it is. The lives of people (mostly aged), who don't have enough money to live. People forgotten by the society, condemned to live on the road with their vans. Some of them decided themselves to live in this way, someone else have been obligated, because they lost their jobs, no family, no money, none who could help them.Somehow this is a movie that might say... society, shame on you! But this is not the point, probably this, sorry, boring and depressing documentary would like to show how wonderful is the life on the road, traveling, living in the nature, seeing many different places, enjoying the company of other people living as you do. Not for me, I'm not far from ending up like them and even worse as I don't have money to buy a van and not even I live in the USA. Everything I watched scared me, but likes me it or not, that is going to be my future. My bad of course, but now, at my age, I can say without any doubt that too many people are selfish and help is just a word. Definitely it's not the movie I was expecting to watch, my fault, I had to read some reviews before deciding. 3 Oscars had to be enough to think to watch something worthy, but in this case it's not. Do you want to watch a similar movie, but much better than this, but no Oscars at all? Into the wild, 2007. Sad of course, but not boring and probably not so depressing as the protagonist is young. Going back to Nomadland, to those who have financial stability, this movie will be surely considered wonderful, a masterpiece and they probably would applaude for minutes, wearing expensive clothes and then going back driving beautiful, exclusive cars to their warm and comfortable houses... who cares about the poor people depicted in the movie? Forget it! Enjoy!"
NOMADLAND,13 September 2020,9/10,"TIFF 2020 04NomadlandThis is my favorite film of 2020 so far. It's bitter, it's sweet, it's tender, heartful, tear-breaking at times, it's about people, it's about some very ordinary people with each one, each single one feeling and being unique with his/her own story, it's about nature with sooooo many beautiful wide-open shots and landscape frames, it's about life on the road, the life that's maybe harder than it seemes but offers lots and lots of freedom and liveliness. The more I think about this magnificent film, the better it gets. What a great achievement in filmmaking and storytelling. Can not wait to see it again."
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,3/10,"Life boiled down to its essence is a series of boring events - showering, eating, driving, shopping, and finding a place to park your van. Life when you are broke is sad. The movie begins with the closing of a plant in Nevada where a widow played by Francis McDermott has worked for many years.The entire town moves away, leaving the post office to discontinue the use of the zip code. She lives in her van and travels around the west on a shoestring. Lots of quiet spaces and lengthy shots of the countryside. McDermott meets a lot of poor people who share their modest philosophies and their strategies for dealing with life on the road. She takes a series of temporary jobs, then moves on.It's not completely dreary, but it is not an upper. It's slow and depressing.The script was empty. The cinematography was marginal. The direction was slow and there were gaps in the film that are not explained. It is difficult to evaluate the acting when the story is so vapid. It's a hard pass for me."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,8/10,"Chloe Zhao's Nomadland is a movie so serene and simple. The movie follows Fern (as portrayed by Frances McDormand) living with and for herself in a van as a nomad, and the journey she undertakes with no apparent destination across the United States... the people she meets, the similarities they share.The highest points for this movie are three things in my opinion; Frances McDormand's portrayal of life, the color palette and the music... all evoking an emotion of self-reflection; peace as synonymous with death.It was a movie of humanity and comfort... Comfort in the familiarity of the world we are seeing, and one I would recommend more people to see."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"This movie will not be for everyone but it WAS for my husband and I. It is a bit slow moving in places (hence the two stars deducted) but it feels so natural and authentic. It is sometimes sad, uncomfortable and dark but also shows that we are all human beings who have been dealt different circumstances and make our own choices. Many will not get this but perhaps some of those have never felt isolated or alone or marginalized. If you ever felt like you were on the outside looking in or lonely, check it out. Actually check it out anyway. It's a beautiful film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled."
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,3/10,"A forgettable movie, ""Nomadland"" has me repeatedly checking the clock wondering when the movie would end. The production ambience feels very similar to ""The Florida Project,"" in which a big-name star is used amongst unknown actors and some real-life people, bringing to light a social and economic problem long-neglected in the U.S. The difference is ""The Florida Project"" has a plot, some entertaining moments, and a couple of breakthrough performances. ""Nomadland"" has no such things. Yes, Frances McDormand is solid as usual, and she makes the most of her character here. So yes, her acting could be award-worthy but that is truly as far as it goes. The movie is so forgettable that it did not even warrant a review. I am only compelled to write one after it won the top honors for motion picture last week."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,5/10,"I don't really understand why this film has been winning so many awards this year. The cinematography is pretty good at times but on the whole is just mediocre and there are some good performances but the story of this film can really be summed up in four words, Lady in a Van. The story is super predictable and never has any moments that really stand out, the film feels slightly rushed, it doesn't really take it's time with anything, every scene feels short and as if it is there for no other reason for it to exist than to move the plot along, never like these moments have just naturally come up, and what's the point of trying to move the plot along when there isn't really any plot? Needless to say I don't think this film deserves all the critical acclaim it has gotten and I wouldn't recommend it, there are plenty of films about the day to day lives of outcasts that are far better than this film."
NOMADLAND,6 July 2021,4/10,No disrespect. Just felt like I was being dragged with a noose around my neck... behind a snail.
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,10/10,"For those who think that this film doesn't go anywhere and it's just a showcase of random events occurring, I think they aren't getting the point of this film. Nomandland is meant to portray what it is like for someone who doesn't feel like they have a sense of security, belonging or sense of direction in life anymore.I didn't know too much about this film and assumed from the title it was about some woman who decides to leave it all behind and live life on her own terms. But this is not about that. This is about a woman who lost everything in an economic recession, didn't have much options and still wants to maintain her independence and still have some sense of dignity that she can hold onto.Frances McDormand gives a really subtle, yet powerful performance as Fern. Her acting isn't out there or anything like that, but she captures the quietness of the character who has to cope with the situation of being on her own, away from her friends and kind of being isolated from everything that was once familiar. You see the struggles she goes through with the several jobs she has to do to make ends meat, the highs and lows she goes through in her daily life with her work, doing the odd fun activity. Yet what I loved was that she has to go back to the reality of her situation each day - living in that van that is tiny and claustrophobic, all by herself.I loved the cinematography in this film. It captures the sense of isolation perfectly and contrasts with how small we are as humans in this big world out there. This is a film that makes you wonder what could happen to you if you work your whole life, then one day something happens to you and you lose it all. For those who don't have a back up plan, this might be one of the options you would have to consider.The film also explores the idea of what home truly is. Is it just a place you go everyday at the end of your day, or is it the feeling of belonging somewhere and feeling secure. It doesn't necessarily have to be the same place does it?I was pleasantly surprised by the end of the movie and I'll have to admit that I teared up a bit at the end. It was just how this film in subtle ways conveys to you that sense of loneliness when you are trying to run away from grief, when the world you once knew no longer exists and you just have to keep going forward in life. One of the best films I've seen this year."
NOMADLAND,12 April 2021,5/10,"We found this movie to be very slow, and you knew that nothing much was going to happen."
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,8/10,"Half way into this one, neither my wife nor I could understand the fuss about this movie, ""Nomadland"". But we stayed along for the rest of the ride and we were ultimately rewarded.I was interested to read the comments of just one other reviewer here who, with good reason, saw this not so much as a triumph of the human spirit over adversity but rather as an indictment of American society which, it appears, can often fail people who have worked a lifetime for no great support or reward in their later years.Now, after having watched the whole movie, my wife and I quite understand why this has been nominated for this year's Best Picture Oscar.Like the best of movies, it is, ultimately, nothing more or less than a tale of human interest. The highs and lows of life as told through the eyes of several of the principals who have had struggles in dealing with life and with a lack of support from a society that many would say owes them a lot.The script was very well written, the direction always great and the cinematography was just lovely.It's not a movie that reaches out and grabs your heart from the off but, if you stay with it, and if you are a sensitive sort of soul, it will get you in the end. By which time, I just loved it. ""Nomadland"" is going straight into my list of movie To Watch Regularly.Jmvscotland."
NOMADLAND,1 October 2021,8/10,"An old woman lives in a van and live a life from place to place. She cannot live a ""normal"" life in a house but set her heart in the nature. Many fellow nomads went through life hardness and illness and even death. This movie makes to cherish your past and reflect the real meaning of life. I like the music and have listened to the album of solo piano. Just wish the have something original. Overall quite successful low-cost movie by a Chinese director."
NOMADLAND,25 March 2021,4/10,"The title of my review is basically what I was left thinking at the end of the film: ""ok..."" This is set up as a documentary/dramatization. Don't get me wrong, I like hearing the stories of the actual nomads and what lead them to choose the lives they've chosen to live. I just wish it was made in the form of a full documentary and not the experimental thing they went for. I didn't care for Frances McDormand's made up character, I did when the film started, but I stopped caring when the real people came along. If anything it rubbed me the wrong way to see her made up character hanging around with these actual people, the strong sense of disconnected hipster just glowed off the screen as I watched this actress interact with these people. My gripe isn't with the actress but with the director in that respect. The actress gives a great performance but it's wasted on this hipster wet dream production. I would rather see these people's stories told in an honest light, without a fake made up character basically patronizing them. This film would've worked 1000x better as an actual documentary. I like that their story has been brought to the screen but what irony to show the negative results of capitalism by using capitalism - did Amazon produce this film ? The cinematography is great, it deserves hype for that, they caught some great shots thanks to the settings they chose to film in. Great stories are presented (the man who's son committed suicide, the woman with cancer living her last days as a nomad) but you're left with a bad taste in your mouth with the smug approach used to tell these people's stories. Still this was just poorly executed and doesn't deserve the hype it's getting. This is an elitist, hipster lens on the nomad lifestyle. It's not to be romanticized, it's not to be applauded. Hollywood wants to show this, then they should do so as a documentary and not ""Oscar Bait"" it. I can't even see this as Oscar bait from how bad it is. This movie personified is the ""activist"" that protests for social justice issues from their comforts of their big homes in lovely areas like Pasadena or Westwood, pretending to care or get to know the issue they're ""fighting"" for but really just using it to stroke their pseudo artistic ego. All performative. That's this movie.This didn't deserve to win the 2021 Oscar. What a joke. Shame on the academy."
NOMADLAND,30 November 2021,9/10,"Films like these aren't made for entertainment, they are meant to touch your soul. Its the story of a woman in her sixties who lost her husband, job & housing, which forced her to live inside her van but she finds a nomadic community in similar situation like her, and once again discovers the gift of Life & Earth. In an almost docu-drama style approach, Chloe Zhao makes us tag along with Frances McDormand's character, living her daily life with her. She also incorporates real nomadic people who seamlessly blend into the narrative and give surprisingly great performances. And then comes the incredible wide landscape shots with the piano score. Frances Mcdormand once again proves why she is probably the Best Actress working today, that woman is a Force of Nature. This film deserved all the accolades it got."
NOMADLAND,30 March 2021,6/10,"Is this movie overrated ? Yes, I think so.This film appears to be a serious documentary of sorts on the life of nomads moving from place to place in self sufficient vans which serve as their houses. Except for Frances, the others are all real nomads. Those cinegoers looking for entertainment are advised to keep away.Frances McDormand is Fern, a single 60 plus nomad who says "" she is not homeless but only houseless"" like her nomad colleagues. After losing her job, Fern moves into the open grasslands meeting nomads, exchanging stories , and helping each other on day to day issues. Hardly the stuff commercial feature films are made of.Fern is lonely, cold and depressed as she navigates life with little cash, company or warmth. She is desperately unemployed too ( I need work, I like work) She takes up odd jobs like kitchen work and crane operator. She cannot park her van overnight in the open and has to move. There are occasional breaks of happiness in the form of bonfire , songs and dances. Most of the players are seniors with tragic backstories of sadness and memories. ( When you get old you get personality, they say). Also they feel that"" What gets remembered, lives "" ). The coordinator , a grizzly old man says they are workhorses who are past their prime, the Titanic is sinking and he is handing out lifeboats , whatever this means. Fern is a diehard nomad as she refuses an invitation from her sister to settle down with them in their home and also declines to stay back with her male colleague who loves her. There are a few touching scenes.What's good?. The superb cinematography which captures the landscape in exotic frames with some lovely piano background music. Some attractive shots of nature dot the slow narrative. The camera is voyeuristic no doubt and becomes part of the proceedings. It also brings out the desolate barrenness of the characters and the environment. There are some long duration shots as the camera follows Fern as she moves out in the open saying hello to friends. Frances McDormand has acted well as the sad and stoic Fern.The film ends on a message of hope saying
""Dedicated to the ones who had to depart. See you down the road. Direction by Chloe Zhao is competent. She with her cinematographer bring to life the life of nomads. She has clearly not made a mainstream film for all types of audiences."
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,7/10,"Frances McDormand is pretty much always fantastic and fierce and convincing and all-around amazing. If she's featured or starring in a film, that's a ""must see"" for me, because she's also pretty choosy about her projects. And all the buzz around NOMADLAND really had me very excited to see it. I didn't know too much about it, but I did know that it would feature McDormand as a ""nomad"", essentially a person not living in a house but moving around the country, following low-paying jobs wherever they can be found (mostly seasonal work) and living out of an RV, van or car. A study of life on the fringes of American life. Not exactly ""homeless"" but ""house-less."" A loose-knit society, all struggling to make it, and all helping each other where they can.And in many ways, that is the movie we get. Writer/director Chloe Zhao has taken a nearly documentarian's approach to the film. It is indeed scripted, and aside from McDormand, also features the always enjoyable David Strathairn. But most of the rest of the cast are actual nomads playing, essentially, versions of themselves. It all feels very much filmed on location at these encampments, including the very famous gatherings in Quartzite, AZ. McDormand's widow Fern, forced to leave the town that essentially evaporated with the closing of the gypsum factory that was its only reason to exist, learns about this nomadic existence pretty much as the viewer does. We see the hardships of a cramped van (she can't even stretch out to full length in her bed), the hard-scrabble existence, the campfires and camaraderie, and underlying it all is the gift of a closeness to the beauty of our land and also the ""curse"" of knowing just how close to the edge of existence this life is. It is clearly a mixed blessing in every sense of the phrase.My favorite part of the film may have been simply enjoying the lingering shots of some amazing American vistas, whether the sparseness of Nevada away from the cities, the beauty of the South Dakota Badlands or the roiling character of the California coast away from the beaches and tourists. All this land we have set aside for the enjoyment of our citizens is also the only true way these nomads are able to live the life they do. The beauty offers the comforts of this life.The film itself has virtually no plot. Although there are little emotional payoffs throughout, it is a film of brief stories and images. Various folks Fern meets share small moments of their lives (an elderly lady, dying of cancer, tells Fern of the time she came upon a cliff full of thousands of swallows and how lucky she is to have seen something like that. Moments like that are when the film really gets you. It's sneaky like that). We learn a little bit about Fern throughout the film, but McDormand never makes it easy for us to get close to Fern. She holds others at arms length, and although she is a very kind person, she certainly has built an armor for herself. Towards the end of the film a few things happen that sort of resemble a plot, but in many ways, we pretty much know how things will resolve during these moments. The film's plot has few surprises; yet the people we meet and the conversations we listen in on constantly surprise.Frankly, it's a movie that helps us see a group of people we might normally not give much notice to. They ARE on the fringes, but they are not out of touch. They care for each other in ways that could teach much of the rest of society a lesson. In many ways, the film is about small kindnesses. How sharing a cigarette lighter can be a huge act of kindness that will be remembered months later.There are many things to enjoy and feel in NOMADLAND. But despite all the glowing things I mention above, I still didn't quite love the film. The pace is VERY slow, but not to the point of being boring. I think perhaps it was the juxtaposition between traditional film, with real actors like McDormand speaking character dialogue and having little plot-like things to deal with, and the more documentary style wherein real people tell their stories or engage in moments of dialogue in the slightly awkward way any of us who don't act in front of a camera would likely have. There are many things to admire about Zhao's approach (and I respect the idea of having these nomads speak for themselves), but for me, it doesn't quite work. It made me aware too often that I was watching a film that was experimenting with style and form. At times, images and incidents flowed over me in a beautiful way and at others, I was jarred with ""oh hey, this actor is just a real person trying to handle dialogue.""Having said that, the film is still well worth watching. McDormand is quietly gripping and the beauty of the land and the presentation of a nearly unknown way of life is very worthwhile to see."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,9/10,"Overall, I thought Nomadland was a superb film that evokes many different emotions. It's a look at how people stick together and drive themselves on during very tough times, told from the perspective of Fern, played brilliantly by Frances McDormand (who won her 3rd Best Actress Oscar for this). I can really see why the film Best Picture at the recent Academy Awards, it's beautiful. The cinematography is what I admire so much about the film, the landscapes and the way the film is shot really is astounding and catipulte this film to new levels. Yes the film is slow and drags, but you have to be aware of that going into the film, don't be expecting twists and turns. I only think the film will get better overtime, more will come to appreciate how good it is and I really loved it. 100% recommend, go treat yourselfQuote - One of the things I love most about this life is that there's no final goodbye. You know, I've met hundreds of people out here and I don't ever say a final goodbye. I always just say, ""I'll see you down the road."" And I do. And whether it's a month, or a year, or sometimes years, I see them again. - Bob WellsRating - 5/5."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,7/10,"Lets be honest here, the movie is quite long and nothing much seems to happen at all and even when it does, it happens very slowly and feels like a bit of a slog at times - this is going to be a hard watch for some people.On the plus side, the acting is first class by everybody especially Frances McDormand, who in my eyes is one of the best actresses around, the direction and those vast bleak landscapes are beautiful and to be honest the story and lifestyle choice the movie portrays couldn't really be shown much differently than ""slow"" otherwise you would be missing the whole point of the movie.It is what it is, you really need to be in the mood for this type of movie - I obviously wasn't, but on a different day I might well have given this a 9/10."
NOMADLAND,22 August 2021,8/10,Fascinating and sad at the same time. Life you don't realize people have.
NOMADLAND,28 August 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is one of the best drama movies I've ever watched. Coming from the single perspective of an old lady who survives by being staff at a stall, then living in the van with her friends. I mean, the scenes seem so real to me. I can't imagine how is living in America in a van, but that happens. The way the actress thinking, having friends, then memorizing good times are so real to me. This movie deserves many awards, including Oscar, especially for the acting of the lead role. The plot is also simple but so deep, you can thank for yourself if you have degree and home with all family inside it. You can also see other perspective of modern life, it is not just all beautiful. Love this movie."
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,8/10,"It is a normal what is described here, what a good performances here, I hope you watch this film, well done, too much normal,
they watched another America, another kind of life
I really enjoyed it."
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,7/10,Film too overrated for me. Nothing special. It's not as big as they recommend.
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,7/10,"Good story and a good drama movie too which isn't for all people; well Frances McDormand deserves it's Oscar as always; for me just the idea of being a Nomad is so hard, let's face it people need people and to have a fixed home is very important to have a fixed life too, of course you shouldn't put your money in a house you can't afford but you should have your own house too; being a Nomad because of hard issues is a thing and because of you want to is a different thing."
NOMADLAND,5 August 2021,4/10,"Let us praise the Hollywood elites (pretty well 100% left wing lemmings-if they want to work) who will shine a light on the plight of the MAGA deplorables pictured in this flick. Would these characters struggle to survive without unlimited immigration (mostly illegal) cheered on by the makers and star of this flick? Probably not-they would likely be middle class, not poverty class. Oh well if there is one thing Hollywood has always been great at it is slinging B/S and blaming somebody else."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"No guns, no violence, no CGI, no big explosions, or little yellow tic-tacs, just good plain old fashioned filmmaking with a storyline that is very much needed in the times we are living in. A film that shows how people should treat each other with love, respect, and courtesy. A film that shows that some of the best things in life are the smallest and simplest things and the people you surround yourself with. For those reasons alone makes me commend this film. What also makes this film engaging rather then a snooze-fest was the charismatic performers that were cast in this. It was genius to cast McDormand, and Strathairn, both give off a homely vibe, yet deliver their performances with such complexity. This, the story and Zhao's direction keeps this film on the railway. I also can't forget about the real nomads who partook in this film as fictionalized versions of themselves made this film feel believable, and although they're not actors, each did a great job playing their parts. However, what keeps this from being a perfect 10, or even a 9 is the film did feel like it dragged on at times. Many times I was expecting the film to end, but it kept going, so the pacing was off a bit mostly towards the end. Other than that, I really liked this film, I was engaged for the most part, loved the casting choices, related to the story, and made me think about life as it is today. If you are an adult and you want a good, relaxing film that's engaging and thought-provoking, I would recommend it. Kids however, should stay away, they'll doze off in the first 10 minutes. 8.4/10"
NOMADLAND,5 January 2021,8/10,"The movie feels so real it resembles a documentary sometimes. But don't let that in the way, go watch it. It is a tranquil and minimalist movie. I loved it!"
NOMADLAND,27 October 2021,2/10,"This is not a good movie. It's a depressing tale of a mentally ill woman who cannot deal with life. It is slow, ponderous and in the end goes nowhere. I absolutely cannot understand the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars. Frances McDormand gave a good performance but nothing at the Oscar level. Don't waste your time on this one."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,9/10,"2020 was a year like no other in American history. It seems fitting that the best film of the year is a picture like no other (the only movie I can think of that resembles this one is Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas). This is a very quiet story about a ""houseless"" (not ""homeless..."") woman who drifts from state to state, living in her van, searching for work at Amazon distribution centers and National Parks, connecting with other Americans who have--either by choice, or not by choice--been forgotten by society. With the homeless rate of Americans at an all-time high (and not just because of COVID), this film is as fitting to its period as Up in the Air was in 2009. It is stark, mesmerizing, heartfelt, beautiful, and occasionally frustrating. But never depressing. Frances McDormand wowed me again as Fern.. Could she get a third Oscar for this movie? David Strathairn also deserves mention as a potential soul mate to Fern. The film showed me a world within our own borders that I didn't know existed. Highly recommended."
NOMADLAND,3 October 2021,9/10,"Nomadland is a beautiful collage, skillfully made by the bits and pieces of a widow's life as she embraces the life of a nomad, after her husband's death. It is an odyssey of self-realization and self-actualization where an ordinary individual understands her true potentials through the hardships of life. Nomadland is a celebration of the free spirit, liberty, and values.This is not any regular movie laden with emotions, action, or thrills. In fact, this is a subtle piece of art working on soul searching, finding out the true philosophy of life. Director Chloe Zhao creates a masterpiece where death has been portrayed as a mere stoppage in the journey to the abode of eternal peace.Frances McDormand as Fern is brilliant. Looks like she is getting even better with age. The last time she won my heart was through her brilliant act in the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and she delivers even better performance here. It is of no wonder that she bagged the best actor's Academy Award for this role. Her nuanced performance is the soul of the movie. Another beautiful thing is that almost all the characters in the movie have been named after their original names. For example, Frances as Fern, Linda May as Linda, David Strathairn as Dave, Gay DeForest as Gay, and so on. All of the other actors do justice to their roles. And all the characters even with their personal limitations and flaws are uplifting, adorable and thoroughly researched.The most brilliant aspect of the movie is its cinematography. The barren lands of Nebraska, Nevada or Arizona have been beautifully shot. The movement of the camera is always soothing and brings hope aesthetically. Sky has often been treated as a subject and its varied hues often signify the changing moods of the protagonist. Mother nature has often been used as a metaphor for the melancholy of Fern. Another aspect that will definitely move the viewer is its brilliantly penned dialogues. ""I'm a houseless, not a homeless and I guess you know the difference""- sums up the spirit of Fern. As Bob Wells says ""There's a thing I love the most about traveling life, is that there's no final goodbye, we just say I will see you down the road, and I do, maybe a month, a year or sometimes years, but I see them again"", you start introspecting the personal losses you have endured in your life.Be warned that you are not going to experience any adrenaline rush in this masterpiece. It takes time to develop the premises. Like the philosophy enshrined in every frame of the movie, it is like a journey. And if you are in search of the true meaning of life, true values of existence, this is just the movie you want to watch before you die. If not, it is better to stay away."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,7/10,"Grief, loss, change, coping, not coping. The film channels the Bardo with its unremitting references to the in between; lives are over, but not quite prepared for the eternal endless finality. Landscapes are desolate and the characters are one dimensional. Interesting subject for an art-film that presses against the documentary boundary, thought provoking, but not that entertaining. How many times can one look at Frances McDormand mugging as a semi-peasant, un-anchored, widow smoking her way through post recession America? It is not inspiring, dulls the thrill of adventure, and drags the viewer through sand, dirt, dust and all the romance that a bout of diarrhea next to one's bed can. Nomadland tries to sensitize the viewer to the road-going life-style, but instead may demoralize us with a particular focus on the vulnerabilities people acquire, the ones that we escape from when we settle in for a good movie."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,5/10,I dont get it. How is this different from Into the Wild and all of the 60's and 70's films about road exploration?
NOMADLAND,23 March 2021,8/10,"And now to a film that has earned six nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for Frances McDormand.
It also received four nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director.
I smelt Oscar bait and deservedly so.
""Nomadland"" exists in the #metoo era where it's directed, written and produced by some incredibly talented women.
If it doesn't win at least one award then I will have to mansplain it to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Third time feature film Director, Chlo√© Zhao, steers a superbly written script she wrote for the screen based on a the book by Jessica Bruder.
Following the economic collapse of a company town in rural Nevada, widow Fern, played effortlessly by Frances McDormand, packs her van and sets off on the road after losing everything in the Great Recession, including her husband.
She explores a life outside of conventional society as a modern-day nomad.
NOMADLAND also features real nomads: Linda May, Swankie and Bob Wells as Fern's mentors and comrades in her exploration through the vast landscape of the US of A.
In a way the Nomads are like Pioneers riding their wagons through the desert.
David Strathairn is warm and genuine as Dave and even his dead ringer real life son has a role as his on screen son.
It all adds to the realism of the cast...to the point where at times it feels more like a very entertaining documentary narrative than a feature film.
Just for the record: The Wall Drug Dinosaur is a real tourist attraction locals invested in after the main highway bypassed their small rural community just to attract tourists to make a detour and spend some dollars in their town.
It's in South Dakota, in case you're planning your own road trip when and if the world goes back to some kind of normal after Covid-19.
This movie lets you marvel at real life people on their separate journeys and even enjoy the minutiae of thousands of tiny birds flock from their eggs and rock wall nests.
Watching this movie gave me a glimpse into the lives of our own Grey Nomads here in Australia (including my own Mother) who drive their motorhomes, tow their caravans or other vehicle all over the countryside like the Leyland Brothers.
Setting up camp and making lifelong friendships, plus the hardships that come with that lifestyle, but these are people who can't be tamed and boxed in a bedroom or four walls like the rest of us.
They long for the open road and whatever that might bring.
""Nomadland"" will touch you deeply.
Don't wait for it to come to Netflix.
Do yourself a favour and watch this movie on the Big Screen to fully immerse yourself in essence of this gritty, real journey.
Given the same circumstances would you survive this America in the 21st century?
I honestly don't know if this reviewer could cope and I pray we never have to find out.
See you down the road."
NOMADLAND,18 March 2021,6/10,"This film had lots of potential and I was excited to see a Frances M film, and Zhao is an excellent director. However I felt like the script was very dull with unnecessary minimalism that did not build the characters and it was annoying to see this acceptance of cash from her sister and rejection of a roof over her head from supporting actor family. There is no real reason for her nomadic life except self torture and misery but it gets old quickly with no arc except to return to her point of departure- a documentary would have been more suitable.
Shocked to see this film nominated as best picture or director.It's a solid 6 stars but don't be fooled by critics and maybe you'll enjoy this documentary pseudo film. And learn how to watch people make burgers which happens too often rather than more character depth."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,4/10,"Been putting off watching this film but gave in with the current shortage of new tv shows this time of year
And I know awards don't always translate into universally adored movies
It's not all bad the scenery and photography is quiet stunning but you can get that on the discovery channel every day of the week
What this film does is start slow
Gets stuck in the snow in the middle
Then just peters out to a complete stop
Really not my idea of an award winning film."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,5/10,"It is the picture of life of American underclass of 90% real characters and because of that it is more documentary movie than anything else. Nice photography and great Frances McDormand and that's all. Of course, all of those real characters should be awarded for their time and stories."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,9/10,"There's times where I felt sad and happy during this film. The environment looks lonesome yet free, and characters felt real due to its superb acting. As nomads living their lives and trying to move on. It shows that people takes different paths and choose their own future for better or worse. For me, I think this movie speaks volume for me as I worry for my future but hope for the better the path I make, as long as it makes me happy or living."
NOMADLAND,22 April 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is a film where everything seems to work. It's very minimalistic but yet very powerful. It's very quiet yet turbulent. It's introspective and yet reflective of society as a whole. It focuses on Fern, a widow who decides to become a nomad living in a van throughout the American west in the late 2000s and early 2010s after losing her job. She is played by Frances McDormand, whose performance was very good. Fern is a relatable protagonist, although the film is as much about what she sees as it is about her. If there's one thing that stands out about this movie, it's the cinematography and score. The landscapes seen throughout the movie are magnificent. Evert shot in the whole movie is framed perfectly. The film's score is very calming yet also sad in its own way.One thing that's interesting about Nomadland is that it's one of the first movies to look at the late 00s and early 10s in retrospect. The film focuses on Fern and friends during the Great Recession. It shows how older adults were left behind during the economic crisis, which caused many of them to become nomads. And yet the film doesn't romanticize the nomadic lifestyle. It's very honest about what it portrays, the good and the bad. The people Fern meets also feel very real, as though this were a documentary. The relationships between people, even with as little as they see each other, are beautiful. Despite how quiet the film is, every conversation and encounter feels meaningful. Nomadland is a very powerful film, despite its outward appearance. A sad film, no doubt, but one that does so beautifully."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,1/10,"This isn't even a movie, it's a depressing documentary, sort of.. There is no real storyline where the characters develop or go somewhere so it's super boring! How the hell did this win awards!"
NOMADLAND,27 September 2020,9/10,"In her third feature film, Zhao continues to prove she's going to dominate Hollywood."
NOMADLAND,22 April 2021,6/10,"Let's start by I had viewed this movie twice in a few daysFrom the first viewing I was totally in snooze fest it was slow and plotless even though I can rate the movie I decided to on hold my rating and give it another go with Chloe Zhao the director two other movie before watching this again.After watching the two movies which one I finds kinda interesting the other not too fond of it.. I decided it's time to visit this movie againThe second time I watched it is definitely better than my first viewingI knows where's the director is heading Chloe Zhao's movie always depict her protagonist as an isolated individual could not blend in with society type of personality.The things I like about the movieThe movie talks about nomads and a lot of real nomads acts in it not particularly by choice such Linda May which really shines in her performance the second character is Swankie which her portrayal is typically by choice which I finds her acting is brilliant tooOnce it gets to the second act the movie starts to get dull where Fern is asking her sister for a hand out.. What I like to point out is Fern is actually living as a nomad purely by choice not by chance where a lot of the nomads when given a choice would rather stays under a home rather than the Van which in Fern doing is totally senseless.Towards the end when the grieving is over yet Fern continuing her lifestyle is another just doesn't make sense moment. The movie tries to define her as a nomads with all care free lifestyle but to me Fern character is just stubborn and selfish.The acting , cinematography, location and talent scout is outstanding but the story line is definitely notChances of getting outstanding picture is huge may be the voters might say this is art and I kinda agree but definitely not a best picture for me.My rating is the movie is better than the rider but not as good as songs my brothers taught me."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,4/10,"Well, Streamers, have you heard about this movie called Nomadland? It recently won Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director at the Golden Globes, and now, it is presumably the frontrunner for the top prize at this year's Academy Awards. I heard the buzz - good things - about Nomadland, and realizing that it is now available on Hulu, I decide to see what all the hype is about. By the title of this review, I have given away my opinion, but read below for more.Nomadland's synopsis goes something like this: After the devastation of a small Nevada town by the collapse of the local factory, a lady in her sixties, Fern (Frances McDormand) embarks on an unsettled life living as a modern-day nomad. She moves from place to place in her van, taking seasonal jobs and making her way alone. Nomadland is directed by Chloe Zhao from her script based on a non-fiction book of the same name about the nomad lifestyle. The film features real-life nomads telling fictionalized accounts of their lives as well as breathtaking photography of the American West. Fern is just as devastated as the town was from its economic collapse we learn. It is all set up to be a potentially deeply emotional film about grief, self-discovery and loneliness.Generally, I don't mind character studies, and this nomad lifestyle is intriguing. Why would one decide to live this way? What brought them to where they are? Those questions are explored in Fern's story. Frances McDormand is a good actress and so she's fully embodies this character. However, since the film is also populated with non-actors, who are real-life nomads, it is obvious that there is a naturalistic quality to their presence in the movie. I think it undercuts the fictional narrative. In fact, I'd rather have a documentary about those people and learn the how's and why's of how they came to be nomads. As it is, I was very bored following Fern's story. I checked at least 5 times how long I had to go in this movie. I will say though that the cinematography and the brilliant colors and landscapes of the American West are beautiful, but that is not enough to sustain and almost 2 hour movie.If you have 2 hours to devote to watching a woman travel across the country doing odd jobs and not much else, then Nomadland may be the movie for you. There is potentially an interesting and emotional story here, but as it is, this movie is not what it could be. I'll wait for the documentary about nomads. For this, you only need on popped kernel of popcorn."
NOMADLAND,20 January 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a movie that not just starts with a soothing vibe but also it catches your attention right on spot with the mesmerizing moments. The pacing in the beginning feels fast but it gets slowed down in the middle. The direction of Chloe Zhao and the performance of Frances McDormand delivered a powerful punch that definitely hit our mind and heart. The main attraction of this movie is not the story but the main character. This movie is more like character driven rather than story driven. The way the movie starts telling the story of a regular old nomad and it goes on and on until the movie ends and When it does it teaches us a lot about living our life through the journey of a nomad down the road. In the end it's a movie you can definitely add on your weekend list not because it has a really good story but because of the acting, the direction and the visuals."

NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,3/10,"I don't understand. She said her husband worked the same job for 26 years. And she had numerous jobs while they were together.But she needs to sell all her belongings to buy a old run down van?The husband's job was a union job. He didn't have any benefits? No retirement? No medical insurance? No life insurance?She said they were living in corporate track housing. They weren't spending much on rent.She said they had no children. They lived out in the middle of nowhere. They weren't spending much on entertainment --- restaurants, theater, concerts, etc.They didn't save for retirement, a rainy day, emergencies?Where did all the money go?Was she a victim of the recession? Or just a victim of bad money management?Lady seemed kinda crazy to me.She's got a sister who lives in a good neighborhood. Who says she can stay with them in her own bedroom. But she rather live in her old beat up van pooing in a bucket.She's got a boyfriend who's living with his son, who's apparently well off. He's got a big house, they said they could stay with them. She had her own corner bedroom with windows on two walls. And a guest house they said she could stay in. But no, she rather live in her van pooing in a bucket.This movie is extremely slow. Large portions of time with nobody talking.And it's getting all kinds of accolades for good cinematography. The cinematography might be good. But the scenery is ugly. Desolate, barren, grey desert."
NOMADLAND,3 April 2021,8/10,"You could consider Nomadland as a raw documentary with a splendid cinematography, It draw for us the portrait of a community damaged by capitalism and economic ruthlessness, A film that shifts between the feeling of joy and melancholy. Of course, one of the major aspects of Nomadland is Frances Mcdoman's outstanding performance.A great watch."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,4/10,"The whole time I watched Nomadland, I wanted it to go somewhere. I wanted to root for someone. I kept wondering where the story was going. After all, it won a Golden Globe for best picture. And best director. And was nominated for best actress and best screenplay... So there has to be a screenplay, right? Well...The acting was really good. No just by the stars, but by everyone. The cinematography was excellent. I felt like I was stuck in a desert. But that was the problem. It didn't seem like anyone was stuck. They all chose to be in the situation they were in and had no desire to get out of it. That is really the whole plot. All the writer wanted to say was - They live differently than most and what they are doing is satisfying enough to them, regardless of what others think. They were not accepting any help and had no concerns about living out of a vehicle with nowhere to go and nothing to do. But how much story is that? It took me about 20 mins to get it. I didn't need 2 hours of it.I wanted to get engaged by the best screenplay it was nominated for, and it never told me any kind of a story. It just went on and on without starting any kind of reason to watch. It was very interesting at first, but after I figured out that it was more about the lifestyle than an actual plot, it got boring. I stopped caring about what the main character was doing, because she obviously didn't care what people thought about what she was doing and she was just going to keep on doing it. I don't get the hype. I thing this will be forgotten about very quickly, because people will sniff out that this was a very artsy film without much plot."
NOMADLAND,16 April 2021,8/10,"Frances McDormand's commitment to this role is one of the finest displays of method acting I've ever seen. Her performance alone is worth a watch, but the great direction and beautiful score are equally fantastic."
NOMADLAND,3 April 2021,5/10,"I had a hard time identifying with this movie, for me it seemed that it didn't quite found its own direction, we are led to believe that the main character becomes a nomad out of necessity as mentioned earlier in the film, since her work place shut down and a whole community was forced into unemployment and financial struggles, in a country where social help is almost non-existent, but as the story developed we also get the feeling that this is a life style chosen by her and and the focus is more on the journey rather than the actual problem.Maybe it was the expectations that might've ruined the experience for me I can accept that, but still I wasn't impressed, the movie is very slow paced, we get some interesting moments indeed and the score goes mainly to the beautiful scenery and nature landscapes captured, but other than that there isn't much going on.It's a story about a nomad, depicting this way of living, very few dialogue, no actual story and a very depressive tone and as if this wasn't enough, I am not sure what we are suppose to fell towards the protagonist because there isn't much likability on her, on the contrary some of her decisions were actually questionable, like leaving the dog, seriously?But here's the part that triggers me, the movie conveys the message that she is miserable or at least not a very happy individual mostly due to her past, yet she continues to chose the nomad life, what are we suppose to take from here, is it that it's a tough bad life for depressed individuals or a homage to it...? So far the worst academy award nominated movie this year."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,9/10,"I was worried before going to see Nomadland, worried about how I would feel and react to accomplished 'actors' playing characters living on the underbelly of the American dream. I wondered whether I could make that transition and accept the film as genuine. I needn't have worried. Whilst even so afterwards the question still nags me ever so slightly, it was easy to immerse myself in the film and let it carry me. Its a warm, hopeful and quiet experience which doesn't attempt to directly answer a lot of questions, given the situation of so many people. Instead it paints a beautiful picture and honours them in many small intimate segments. It builds slowly from fairly matter of fact beginnings but blooms into a mosaic of people and emotions that is at once both touching and uplifting. Frances is an actor of course whom you cannot take your eyes off and she runs with the film in a breathtakingly minimalist performance. The cast of unknowns supported her all throughout. Nomadland will work differently with different people and everyone can cast perhaps their own experiences and reflections upon it to judge its merits. A truly lovely and lovingly photographed piece."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,4/10,...but why is there no story? Is this not an essential part of movie making? The film jumps from place to place from character to character without any structure. Is it a documentary or a movie? I have no idea...
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,9/10,"This movie fully deserves its three Oscars. It's an insightful movie into the inner mind of a woman swept away by the events of the Great Recession. Her home and in fact her entire town are gone with the town's sole major employer. Her beloved husband has died after a draining illness. She has no kids. She's alone and mentally hollowed out. Now, all she has left are her van and the possessions she can fit into it. She survives as a migrant worker. She works at an Amazon distribution center during the seasonal rush of the Winter holiday. Otherwise, she works odd jobs wherever they can be found. Her new family and friends are similarly dispossessed American nomads living in vehicles of one sort or another. This is ""Grapes of Wrath"" written just as large as Steinbeck's Great Depression novel but triggered by the Great Recession in the 21st century. Brilliantly acted by Frances McDormand with a few professional actors plus some actual modern American nomads including perhaps the most famous and accomplished nomad of all, Bob Wells. For those who reviewed this movie negatively because of its slow pace, the pace it depicts is the pace these nomads are forced to live. Most of us will never experience this life. This is as close as we'll ever get."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,9/10,"An atmospheric indie film to which Chlo√© Zhao has lent a great deal of down-to-earthness, humanity and poetics with her sensitivity in the director's chair and which is considered a hot contender for this year's Oscar race. Nomadland is a character study of the suddenly ""houseless"" Fern, who tries to adapt to her new life as a nomad as best she can after the death of her husband. On the almost documentary-like followed journey in her van, Fern meets people with different personalities who help her in her new world.The centre of the film throughout the entire running time is clearly protagonist Fern, played by two-time Oscar winner Frances McDormand. She undergoes all kinds of setbacks and always carries around an inner conflict. She could do better, but wants to take the challenge on herself with all her might. McDormand embodies the basic mood of the film and tells the story of many: she is a victim of the glaring class differences and capitalist overweight in the USA. In the process, she works her fingers to the bone, is constantly on the lookout for new jobs and means well for people. She illustrates what the new situation triggers in her character and how she keeps her head above water. Fern goes hand in hand with the mood of the film: she is unobtrusive, subtle and has a lot of depth. This role is arguably the most important in McDormand's glorious career so far because she represents a group of people who are not seen. The actress lived in a van on a campsite for a few months before the start of filming herself and got acquainted with this kind of life. David Strathairn, as Fern's good friend Dave, is also very important to the protagonist's journey. He makes her conflicted by his obvious intentions and lets us experience the interpersonal component first hand. This comes across in almost every scene in the film, despite the clear main character. The other characters are real-life people, which brings an enormous amount of closeness and authenticity to the film.McDormand carries the plot of the film brilliantly on her shoulders, but the real heroine of Nomadland is its director. You can tell from start to finish that Chlo√© Zhao cares deeply about this subject matter. She has turned a low-budget independent film into a technical masterpiece against which every action film with elaborate special effects falls short. The cinematography captures lengthy and beautiful shots of the landscape, making the film's actually dreary setting seem colourful and idyllic. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is softly and empathetically composed, making Fern's rides in the van meaningful. Zhao has put together a film that takes its time, but where all the cinematic elements become one big whole. As a result, Nomadland does not create seas of tears despite the sadness of its subject, but a cinematic masterpiece whose basic idea is always present and sticks with one."
NOMADLAND,4 January 2021,9/10,"Nomadland provides a very secure portrait of a woman looking for a place in this Earth. She doesn't fit in a society of material possession. She keeps moving from place to place, with minimum of things she needs to survive. Her van is her home and the road is her backyard. Great performance by Frances, sometimes showing empathy towards strangers without being dramatic and other times showing her own pain with a silence.
She definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,8/10,"Brilliant acting makes this movie great, the dialogues feel so truthful and natural that at times you wonder if the movie is a documentary with real people's stories.One critique is that the movie comes too close to make a bolder statement through the story and yet doesn't go there: is the main character a nomad (someone who decides to live freely on the road)? Or is she a homeless as a result of an unfair capitalist system, unemployment, low minimum wages, unskilled labor... that are affecting million of other Americans?"
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,6/10,"When you only have a few lemons,make lemonade.Most of these people are borderline poor.Their worlds have crumbled and they are adrift in the pieces.Their main asset is a bit of retirement income and a running, for now, vehicle. It's a survival strategy polished up to be a positive pop philosophy .Like the mountain men in the old days they rendezvous a couple of times a year in places like Quartzite,Az. .Bob Wells for instance is a real life You tube booster,guru of this lifestyle, and he is a hurting person too.
The circle here is poverty, drifting in motor vehicles,the western spaces, a minimum lifestyle of perpetual camping,a little work if you can, more poverty,vehicle problems,repairs you can't afford, and luckily reconnecting with family for a loan. Its a very borderline lifestyle this way .One wonders what happens when the vehicle dies, you have,no $$$ to fix it and no family to mooch off of? When you can't clean toilets, toil for Amazon,or pick vegs?
My wife's cousin does this lifestyle ,but he is well to do , and goes in the grand manner. He also works as he goes for a corporation.He loves the lifestyle.
As for the movie,it was rather slow and long. It could have been edited .A lot of laundromat scenes. The cinematography was good.The score was sometimes not in sinc with the events going on, my opinion. The people in this are mostly nonactors, but they are kind of naturals.
Francis M is rather flat. I didn't really connect with her character and situation. It's like she is a blank wall that others,bounce off of. David Straithairn ? pops up now and again as a potential partner ,but FM is not open to that. He finally reunites with his family. I think the film wants to make a shallow statement on Americas family disintegration, economic decline, poverty, inadequate elder life, pop philosophy, the end of one's worklife, coping, and a patched together lifestyle. A lifestyle with no heat, little water,crude accomadations, no bathroom. Like Texas after the Great Freeze, forever, in a van.
Someone mentions the pioneers of yesterday in this movie. The pioneers were usually familys, or related familys,going some where with a definite goal, to set down roots..They did not ramble aimlessly around the wasteland sections of the western landscape. They crosssed,arrived, settled down, and got on with life.
Its not a great movie, it isn't a comic book,it's not the Grapes of Wrath, so....6 stars?
Where as GOW proposes govt.as a solution,people together taking action, and more Socialism !!!! , his sticks to the great American solo flight. Right until the final trip you take and that trip isn't to Alaska."
NOMADLAND,2 June 2021,7/10,"It's an unusual film in that there's no progression of a story, no climax and resolution like you'd expect in most films. At some points it sounded like a documentary where real people describe the struggle they're going through.Frances McDormand is great as usual. I have to say that I didn't feel as bad for her as I did for other characters. She chose to be houseless, despite having the choice to live in houses of others. This begs the question of why did she decided to do so? That can be open to different interpretations. The one I think is is because home is ""not where you live but it's what lives in you"" and she never felt she belonged in any of the places offered to her.Even though this isn't a movie that's completely memorable, I'm not upset that it won Best Picture. I felt the director took some risk with making this type of film and it turned out to be a very good film."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,9/10,"Chlo√© Zhao's ""Nomadland"" is a movie built on subtlety. It is a sneaky report of institutional injustice towards the lower-to-middle class, labor unions and a person's very soul. The link between its fragility and brutal realism relies in its lead character, Fern, portrayed by the everblooming Frances McDormand whose personality only seems to grow with age.A woman in her sixties, Fern, after losing everything in the Great Recession, embarks on a journey through the American West, living as a van-dwelling modern-day nomad. They are like modern explorers, except there is nothing left to explore on the outside, this exhibition being more about a person's inside. Fern is a strong woman--the type of characters fitting McDormand perfectly--but she suffered great loss and she feels like she doesn't belong anywhere. It is why she refuses any opportunity to sleep under a roof with friends and family who will gladly have her. She lives in a van.In that aspect she is joined by actual real-life nomads led by the charismatic Bob Wells. Each of them feel like they are home on screen, this is because Zhao simply filmed them in their environment. Fern's interaction with each one of them feels like a documentary while not getting to factual as to negate emotional wisdom. As we watch we see that each of them were hard-working women and men--there is even a Vietnam war veteran. Therefore you cannot help but ask--how did they come to this? The answer is stuck somewhere around trickle-down economics and political abuse.Some of the most powerful moments in this movie come from the life experiences of these people especially Bob Wells. His voice is as charismatic as he is, a homemade life philosopher who never passes as a cult leader, but as an actual wise consultant. His optimism is from experience. ""One of the things I love most about this life is that there's no final goodbye"" he says in a warm tone. It's the hope in the desert and the meaning of the constant scenes of desolate roads which also denote a natural beauty well known but not well experienced.Not only her power, but Fern also earns respect through her dedication to her husband. After he passed away, she had a chance at love again, but she reluctantly and elegantly refused. Subtle in its power, meaning and message yet not to a subliminal level, ""Nomadland"" finds director Chlo√© Zhao at her most focused."
NOMADLAND,31 May 2021,6/10,"The connection to the characters was great , it was incredibly aesthetically pleasing and the issues presented are relevant and important to portray in the big screen . I don't mind a slow burn but this was... just slow , not a lot or burn .The almost documentary feel made it feel like we should have some interviews . The acting was great and it proved its point .Worth the watch but didn't deserve picture of the year in my opinion."
NOMADLAND,6 January 2021,6/10,"Nomadland is a purposeful tedious film. Some will applaud this others will detract it. I unfortunately side with the latter. Although Frances McDormand gives an incredible subdued performance, the overall plot and the film itself never matches her great acting."
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,10/10,"I was looking forward to this (based on a book) as it explores the nomad van and RV culture made up of mostly older Americans traveling around the country and working at temporary jobs to get by after losing their careers, homes in the 2008 financial crisis or their savings. Far different from the YouTube (often fake) nomads or the Class A RV crowd in their massive $150,000+ homes on wheels.It centers around the fictional story of an older woman, a widow who lost her job and home in a company town in Empire, NV. When the plant closed, the company town closed with it and she lost everything. She is somewhat of an enigmatic, broken woman having few if any real friends and often rejecting companionship of others interested in her including a potential boyfriend and her own family who offered her a home. A life on the road is her choice, not necessarily her fate. It is a slow moving movie showing the nomads in these barren desert campgrounds (with some stunning mountain scenery though), working at an Amazon warehouse, harvesting beets and working at campgrounds and Wall Drug cleaning kitchens and toilets - all hard physical labor jobs just to earn enough to go on.One often gets this image that nomad life is lots of fun from media stories and YouTube. Travelers and retirees with money exploring the country, seeing all these great sites and make loads of new friends and having great experiences. However, if you are not well heeled financially, the nomad life is not very pleasant or glamorous. Not a very great existence. More of just an existence for many. It is an overall somewhat depressing film. But it does show the harsh reality of what happens to those who lost everything due to the massive economic changes in the country with the offshoring of jobs and financial disasters. The film is is more like the modern Grapes of Wrath, the original 20th Century nomads. That is why I gave it a ten."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,1/10,Watched this after seeing the high reviews. But this is the most boring movie yet this year. Movie synopsis said it's a woman's journey after losing everything due to recession. What recession? She had a job throughout. Looked well and fine and traveling. So what's the story? Nothing. A dishonest movie. And high ratings are totally unjustified.
NOMADLAND,27 May 2021,3/10,"Have you ever seen a movie, after which you're walking out of the cinema thinking: 'that's x hours of my life I won't get back', this is one of them. Don't buy into the hype because it won some award."
NOMADLAND,23 October 2021,7/10,"There was a sense of quiet beauty to this film that I really enjoyed. The cinematography is stunning, really capturing the vast empty expanses and haunting desolation of the landscapes, and the soundtrack meanders throughout, rising and falling gracefully and adding a great deal of emotion.Frances McDormand was fantastic and the supporting cast, many actual nomads, brought a great deal of authenticity and spirit to the film. Well worth a watch!"
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,8/10,"McDormand and this director create a fine if, in the end, unrealistic portrait of life on the road. There's a lot to be said (and shown) about exploring nature and being an independent spirit. The realities of thankless, low-paying jobs and the inevitability to struggling too keep up with vehicle expenses and lack of health care are daunting.I understand that loners don't like being dependent on relatives and friends. These people didn't seem to explore Social Security, Medicaid, or other financial aid before setting off to explore America. Also, this film didn't address the dangers of women traveling the country alone. Still, the story was compelling and the reality-based supporting cast were terrific."
NOMADLAND,20 August 2021,1/10,After watching this movie I did a test. I used a roller and put a roll of paint on the living room wall and I watched as it dried. It was way more exciting than this movie.
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,10/10,"I don't think a lot of people noticed this at last night's Oscar ceremony, but with her win Frances McDormand became the only woman to win Best Actress three times (the record-holder, as we all know, is Katharine Hepburn, with four Best Actress wins over 48 years).Meryl Streep and Ingrid Bergman won three Oscars, but one for each is for Best Supporting Actress.As for the men, only Daniel Day-Lewis can match McDormand; Jack Nicholson and Walter Brennan each earned three statuettes, but one for Nicholson and all three for Brennan are for Best Supporting Actor.All that being said, McDormand truly deserves the honour, and her performance in ""Nomadland"" is unforgettable, as is the film (how did it not win Best Cinematography?).I'm sure these words can be found in other reviews here, but it's a glorious celebration of life, something we all need in these extraordinary times.If you liked ""Nomadland"" you really need to see Chlo√© Zhao's second feature film, ""The Rider"" from 2017 - it won 24 awards around the world including several for Best Picture, but was totally ignored by Hollywood (no nominations at the Oscars or Golden Globes)."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,4/10,"I'm a huge fan of Frances McDormand, but this is a nothing movie with real life nomads who obviously can't act making the whole film feel like a really dull documentary. But the critics will praise this movie in the name of ""looking good"" by supporting an Asian female director, real life nomads on the edge of society, and the commentary on the Great Recession. Do a real documentary and skip the bad movie making."
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,3/10,I can't understand why this film won the best film. It was slow and boring . It played more like a documentary. The Father and Promising Young Woman were vastly superior. Don't waste your time .
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,9/10,"A soulful, interesting, believable depiction of how some people in this country choose their livelihood. It is true that their circumstances may force them into being nomads but despite the hardships and struggles that are depicted it seems they would not have it any other way.A little more unique for film to depict this somewhat elder demographic who are living and embracing this alternative lifestyle. (If you like the style of this film I recommend American Honey to depict the younger demographic of ""nomads"") Although the main character was fine and an interesting character study, the assortment of side characters really make Nomadland deeply soulful, melancholic and inspiring at the same time. Most of the more involved dialogue provide mini-stories and insights into these side characters struggles. These characters are well done and their stories seem true to life therefore opening up our hearts to care for even the characters with a mere few lines. It seems that getting to a certain point in age and in life you can't help to have an assortment of deep hardships, struggles and losses. And choosing to live on, live freely, living warmly towards your fellow human being becomes what life is about to them. It was beautiful to see as they get close to their dying years they choose to swallow as much as life can hold and keep on going down the road.The beauty stems from the naturalism and truth depicting the landscapes and the people. The vast, arid landscape showcased through beautiful cinematography envelop these independent spirits and represent their soul. Their soul for yearning for space, peace and freedom. These people out west living communally in their campers, trucks and tents, off the grid, struggling to survive create their own unique culture within the US. A culture of warmth, comradery, boisterous swashbuckling fun, a necessary self-sufficiency. But most of all a culture of connection and the drive to create a brotherhood and sisterhood.As the main character doesn't seem to resolve in a direct path perhaps as a metaphor for the nomads themselves and their lack of resolve or actually their conscious resolve to leave their life unresolved, to continue to search and quest where ever the winds of the world take them."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,8/10,"This film is just lovely! Everything about it is beautifully balanced, without being sentimental. It's not longwinded or teary; nor does it bash you over the head with a message. It just flows and washes over the viewer.Parts of it remind me of the Japanese filmmaker Ozu, in its musing on nature and the importance and specialness of reflecting on a moment.Frances McDormand is utterly marvelous, as ever and David Strathairn's solid-but-subtle performance is also captivating. The nomads, each of whom played themselves were a treasure...and SUCH stars!"
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,5/10,"Yeah! Besides Frances McDormand and David Strathairn have you seen the other actors of this ""movie""? No! Exactly! Director sold us this like a movie but her trick is she only put 1 famous actress and 1 supporting actor interacting with regular nomads and recorded it and in the editing room trying to make a story. That's it! Overrated as hell."
NOMADLAND,12 June 2021,4/10,"I have very mixed feelings about this one. If I wanted to watch a documentary about the nomad lifestyle I would have done that. I appreciate that this movie portrayed that lifestyle in an interesting way but it was not a documentary and it was wayyyyyy too boring to be a feature film. Honestly, this movie just made me feel really bad - this is seriously how some people live in our country. And this very well could be me one day. I saw a lot of myself in the main character. I don't really have anything holding me down where I live (family or friends) and in that sense the movie felt a little too real for me. The thought that this could be me one day makes me really sad. I honestly wish I hadn't seen that movie. Nothing really happened in it. The story was minimal. This movie could have gone so many places and could have been something. Instead, it was just blah. And yet it won picture of the year?? Are you kidding me?! C'mon. This is beyond ridiculous."
NOMADLAND,10 March 2021,10/10,Beautifully made movie. Frances deserves her another Oscar
NOMADLAND,7 January 2021,8/10,"This revealed a slice of American life I wasn't aware of - nomadic working houseless (not homeless) generally older people moving around smaller towns and regional areas of the US. We follow Fern (Frances McDormand) on her travels from place to place, job to job, friend to friend in her mostly reliable, well worn van, surrounded by people living similar lifestyles playing themselves. The seamless interaction of Fern with scores of non professional actors being themselves is quite revelatory, giving a genuineness to the ups and downs of the realities portrayed.It slips easily between encouraging highs and depressing lows, mostly seeing the positives in things I mightn't have felt or agreed with. There's a lot about independence against limiting personal options from well intentioned or charity imposed support, and the financial reality most of these people confront constantly, brought into focus when something central goes wrong, such as major vehicle mechanical issues or serious illness. It's easy to get swept up into the portrayal of these folks' lives, experiencing a bit of their joys and sorrows.They seem to have a lot of time to consider their options and priorities, the times when a path forward isn't obvious or won't start till the weather turns or something else out of one's control happens. This is reflected in the gentle pacing of the film, and some could well find it slow, possibly irritatingly so.
The locations, camera work and lighting are delightfully evocative, revealing what you'd expect to see - sometimes hope to see, in gorgeous low evening and morning light, and at other times the challenges of freezing temperatures, pouring rain and muddy or dusty roadsides.It's a thoughtful, considerate film, which I'd recommend if you like character and story based cinema."
NOMADLAND,3 April 2021,3/10,"For the moment it stars to me moment it ends, nothing happens, there is no plot, no drama, no quest, no search for meaning, no twist, nothing. Save your self from this one. I'm warning you. You can't trust movie critics anymore."
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,6/10,"This is possibly my least favorite good movie of the year. Given the times we are currently living in, going back a decade earlier to an equally bad time, is almost a guaranteed depressing movie watching experience. The bleak landscape of the movie doesn't help either. Frances McDormand as Fern elevates the movie and makes it watchable. Part of the problem is that she travels through rural survival of the fittest territory which reminds us of the fact it is Trump country and Fern needs to get the hell out of there, not immerse oneself in it. Living in a second hand run down van is symbolic of a country that doesn't really care much for people down on their luck. The only helping hands are from her fellow nomaders and that speaks volumes about our country."
NOMADLAND,12 April 2021,8/10,"Shot with beatiful cinematography, great music and blended with yet another brilliant performance of one of the greatest actresses ever, Nomadland seems to be an ode to the ones choosing to be on the road in their caravans. It is only towards the end of the movie, we get to see why Fern chooses to hit the road. It is not a mere matter of financial difficulty. The conversation with Bob where both share their feelings about loss and how to move further seems to be at the the heart and soul of this movie.Not a masterpiece perhaps, but film manages to touch the soul of its audience.Recommended for the ones who experience similar losses and carry the hope of meeting down the road."
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,6/10,"I was expecting something special, but Nomadland was a disappointment. It's documentary style approach is effective in showing the nomadic lifestyle and open landscapes but maintains an air of aimless sadness without much emotional engagement. Frances Mcdormand is well cast and the film has terrific honesty, but with little substance or plot to draw in the audience there was nothing to enlighten or inspire and I was left with a sense of disengagement and mixed feelings."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,,"It's not the kind of movie I'd see again. Wonderful acting, directing, and cinematography. It felt like watching a documentary in a way - the non-actors were very natural, dialogue and delivery. I can only imagine it was mostly ad-libbed with a ton left on the cutting room floor. So probably superb editing.Several of the characters, mainly the guys, all pretty much got on my nerves. That's not the movie's fault - it just made me think, if I was there, I'd have walked away from most of the hippie dorks who speak too much of ""making the most of it."" They weren't all like that, thankfully! And no one called her out on her $70 a week cigarette habit?But seriously, I'm really glad I saw the movie. The takeaway - live better than paycheck to paycheck or you'll end up dying in a smelly, gross van. How to do that might be a good sequel."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,,"I have worked on films for 30 years as a costume designer. Some of the films I have done had crowd scenes""EXTRAS"" which always was problematic for me. As a costume person I dealt with dressing them, which developed a closeness to them. When our lunch was served we would line up at the catering van and usually had a choice of a hot meal. The extras were given a styrofoam box with a sandwich and piece of fruit. I could never bring myself to eat at the tables set up for crew. I would take my tray to my wardrobe trailer and eat my meal there. I bring this up because this film, we are told used real homeless nomads. I wonder if they got the same sandwich. Would love to know ,if anyone knows."
NOMADLAND,19 May 2021,6/10,"This was my first film of 2021 as restrictions are lifted and what a disappointment.The story of the aged dispossessed in the fallout of 2008 is one that needs to be told and with it a critique of the failure of American capitalism but this film isn't it.In our story we have Ferne, played by Frances McDormand, with as much skill as she can muster given the weakness of the script and the lackadaisical direction, travelling across America from one temporary seasonal job to another connecting with fellow 'nomads' in some kind of odyssey.During the disjointed and single paced narrative with no dramatic resonance whatsoever we are let into the world of a generation who are at the end of the American Dream and it's disappointment. These people have worked all their lives for the Dream and it has turned to ash but apart from the occasional piece of reflection by a character here and there you wouldn't know it, in fact, at times, you could be forgiven for thinking it's a pretty good life.We see Ferne in a number of low level service jobs during the year of her life we journey on but there seems to be no problem getting jobs, the conditions are fine, the people are fine, so why make a film billed as a social commentary when it doesn't do that? The one time things get serious and her van needs major repairs she just pops to her sisters, endures a bit of family angst and comes away with the money. Equally her friend Dave meets his son at the diner he works after abandoning his family and hey presto he's back in the comfortable middle class bosom of his extended family.There is nothing wrong with the performances, McDormand and David Strathaorn are solid but not career defining and definitely not Oscar worthy. The direction is meandering and muddled and definitely not Oscar material. I was bored most of the time and disengaged.This material should have been a documentary and would have had far more resonance as such.Really this is a classic case of Hollywood liberals wanting to seem relevant by handing awards to a 'socially aware' film directed by an ethnic minority female and that is not a good thing."
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,9/10,My aunt used to drive to the dessert and do the trailer and loved the fluidity and freeness of the journey. This movie goes deeper and Frances's portrayal of the freedom of being a nomad or gypsy is quite thought provoking as while she could stay with family and friends she chooses not too as she has that traveling heart. Dave S is always a great actor and took the path of living with his family. I know their are folks that sail the world like the vehicle nomads - so it was just an honest portrayal of life.
NOMADLAND,8 September 2021,3/10,"Frances McDormand was great as always, but the story was slow in the beginning and lacked a relevant social message or conclusion. Unfortunately, some may see living in a Van or RV as a viable alternative way of life instead of the equivalent of Hospice for a dying one.Instead of the Nomad Life, most would be better off building their community and social network and starting over either where they are or in a new permanent location."
NOMADLAND,21 May 2021,7/10,Nomadland is where roaming memories and wandering tales of bittersweet lives meet to tell us their story.
NOMADLAND,15 April 2021,5/10,"You have to feel sorry for the circumstances that led to these people becoming nomads but, once they made that choice it's their problem. Frances McDormand's character passes up multiple chances for help along the way and gives up the happily ever after for the bleak and melancholy. Good for her but not anything to break out the tissues for. I could have passed on this movie and never felt like I missed any great accomplishments in acting, cinematography or plot."
NOMADLAND,24 May 2021,8/10,"A beautiful story of grief on the road. Tales of meetings with great characters, each with their own story both told and untold, along a trail of beautiful scenery and landscapes enveloping this movement through loss. The pain at times almost unbearable in what is unsaid.This was emotionally powerful, beautifully shot and directed, with a wonderful smorgasbord of a cast. Francis McDormand is sublime with controlled elegance. So worthy of the Oscars. This is an artistic film, gentle, moving with such beauty and emotional depth. If that's sounds like you, experience it, on a big screen if you can."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,8/10,"Speechless, but not through the words, but because of the awe and sophistication of the world. The movie presents commoners under actual world no other than ours, but with a complete different experience and lifestyle that many are currently practicing. Furthermore, despite the incredible display of various aesthetic topographies, the film introduced us to several men and women, and their soul-stirring stories under the grimaces. Aside from the sociological allegory, every element in this movie brings peace and harmony, as an ordinary van and road could lead to smile-worthy adventures. Where do we belong? Where should we go? Absolutely recommending, enjoy it when you feel inner stress."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,9/10,"This is a quiet, beautiful film. With the amazing shots of landscapes and a great performance by Frances McDormand, the movie perfectly conveys the everyday struggle of surviving, finding a sense of belongingness and the loneliness that comes with it, but at the same time showing the beauty of life and the experiences and the great people you meet along the way. I think this is a relatable movie in many ways and that's how it reaches the audience."
NOMADLAND,30 November 2021,10/10,Beautifully directed. Perfect lead. Writing embraces humanity honestly. Blown away by the beauty in this. Highly recommend for the sensitive variety of humanity.
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,8/10,Really superb all the way through. A movie that definitely lived up to the hype. I think there was maybe one bad shot the entire film. Should be up for (and win) multiple awards. Definitely glad I saw this one.
NOMADLAND,12 March 2021,6/10,"While I think this story have a great melancholy type of journey, I thought it was a little slow, but I love the characters and character development is really important to helping people form their opinions around a movie. I love Francis McDormand because I think she plays some really tough roles and does a stellar job at showing emotion and her characters. Check it out and try it, but don't get into it if you don't have a good two hours to spare understanding a main character."
NOMADLAND,1 April 2021,4/10,"This movie is being hailed for its verisimilitude. Can't deny that it's realistic. And gritty. And, at times, Nomadland is genuinely thoughtful. But, imo it is more often maudlin. Fern's hometown has shut down along with its gypsum plant, so now Fern, an older widow, lives in a van and travels the US taking seasonal jobs in the American West and North Country. She poops in a plastic bucket. On screen. In stereo. She meets other people who live in vans. Some have abandoned their pets. Nobody else adopts their pets. Some are dying of cancer. Some have planned their suicides. Some have lost loved ones to suicide. Others have different deep regrets. A handsome, older man, who is also a nomad, inexplicably falls for Fern, but when he wants to settle down, she is wary of forfeiting her lonely freedom. Seriously, this movie comes very close to being a parody of a downbeat slice of life movie. It's just too much. Also, I found myself wondering if Frances McDormand was planning to keep playing the hollowed out lady from Three Billboards for the rest of her career. Fern is just like that character, minus the animating lust for revenge. She even dresses like her and kind of has the same haircut. Hmmm. In its defense, this movie occasionally offers glimpses of beauty courtesy of America's National Park System. It is also much too dull to offend any viewers. Prosaic, dreary, and inoffensive- maybe the perfect movie for our current era. It has been nominated for six Oscars."
NOMADLAND,25 March 2021,3/10,"I am ambivalent about this film. Every piece of the film is very good. Cinematography, the direction, screenplay, especially the music are first rate. Empire, Nevada was only 750 people to begin with and in the middle of no man's land. Why (in 2010-11) would people live there???? Did the gypsum plant close with no warning? Who is the culprit/villain of the story? If people want to be nomads, then what is the purpose of the story? This would be a great art-house film; as main stream cinema, it's lost on me."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,10/10,"What a film. What an eye opening view on a strand of existence in the U. S. A. I live in a country that still has free health care & a good safety net of benefits. The people in this film don't. They're making the best, after personal disasters, in a country that doesn't care about them but they care about each other. Some reviewers on here really need to look long and hard in the mirror."
NOMADLAND,30 December 2020,7/10,"Chloe Zhao's Nomadland is a very artistic film. It is beautifully shot, Frances McDormand gives a unique performance. I was never bored in this movie. It also has that documentary feel. The thing is, with a story like this, a story so thin, you anticipate something to happen and nothing really does. The story does ""go places"" at some point, but there is not really any major drama. I thought there would be some drama, I was disappointed, and that was 1 hour and 10 minutes in to the movie. Another thing is that I feel like Chloe Zhao might be too in love with this beautiful cinematography because she uses a lot of clips that look beautiful but there are so many of them, it becomes overused. She does a good job showing the lives of these people and their everyday routines. Nomadland will probably win many awards."
NOMADLAND,31 March 2021,8/10,"Nomadland starts out like most gritty, realistic movies about economic struggles. A mining town. Mine closed. Town decimated. It could have been ripped straight from the headlines, except things like that happen too often to make headlines. Older people, who can't find steady work, but are too young and poor to retire. People who worked their entire lives, but were never earning enough to get livable Social Security. That too is far too common, but rarely talked about. Fern, played by always brilliant Francis McDormand, is all of that. We first meet her as she loads a few possessions into her van and takes off for a Holiday Season gig at an Amazon warehouse. The fact that Amazon is paying rent on the RV park spots tells us whom they expect to fill those jobs. We follow Fern through the horrifying beginnings of her nomad life. But then the focus shifts - from logistics, economics, and politics to simply living. Living, not just surviving. Getting out of life what she and at least some of the others might have actually always wanted.I find myself torn. On one hand if feels almost irresponsible the way the movie avoids talking about how many things can go horribly wrong, glossing over the reality where one busted engine or knee can lead to immediate and total disaster. On the other hand I can't help being in awe of these people, who may have found themselves thrown into the air by circumstances, but who find their wings and take off, never looking back, to keep on flying for as long as those wings can carry them. I find myself torn between feeling underwhelmed by the simplicity of the way Nomadland is made, given all the accolades, and understanding the it is exactly how it should be."
NOMADLAND,1 January 2021,8/10,"Technically and narratively it is a masterpiece of Americana.For anyone who has ever lived in a car, however, this film is probably going to be offensive. It does not do a very good job of depicting the emotional and physical impacts living like that has on a person.Yes, there are people out there who choose to live in a car instead of a house. They are a small minority of the houseless individuals out there. The movie is trying to thread a needle between houseless by choice and houseless by circumstance that just doesn't work well. Almost nobody in real life is both of those things...There are a few moments of the film which capture small snippets of what it is like, but it seems the desire to romanticize that lifestyle as something uniquely American caused the film to gloss over the worst aspects. Yes, pooping in buckets happens. Yes, if your car breaks down and you can't afford to fix it you suddenly are on the street. Yes, it is terrifying when police wake you up by pounding on your vehicle to tell you you have to move. Yes, it can get quite cold at night in the winter. Those are parts of it.But there is also the constant lack of sleep. The noise. The world that seems hostile to your continued existence. In the film almost everyone McDormand encounters is compassionate and friendly to her. That is not how it is in real life AT ALL. Not to mention the pain in your back from sleeping in such cramped conditions. The inability to access healthcare if you get sick. The mental illness of people around you or perhaps yourself. The children who live in cars with their parents and what that does to them (there are many). Not everyone you meet is thoughtful and poetic. The reality of this situation is much more horrifying and painful than the film portrays for a lot of people, and that is a problem.It would have been better if the film had chosen one of these two varieties of a nomadic lifestyle instead of trying to do both. The film seeks sentimentality in an area of life that is very real for many people, and about to become real for many more as the eviction moratorium expires following the pandemic. That is a recipe for offending the very people you are ostensibly trying to paint an honest portrait of."
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,5/10,"Emphasizes ugly side of nomad life too much. Can be seen as realism but it's unbalanced as not all nomads are old, in grief, no job and no interest. Many are not forced into that life like all the characters in this movie. Many chose the lifestyle to do the things they like to do. Mountain climbers for example. But none of those nomads are represented in this movie. All in this movie are old people who lost their jobs and grieving. Forced drama.Also the director's choice of using non-actors doesn't work. I can see the intention to bring more realism but the contrast in dialogue between non-actors and actors are too great."
NOMADLAND,21 April 2021,7/10,"The movie was good but the music was great. I like it so much, you can just close your eyes and enjoy the beautiful music."
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,4/10,"It's well made, and you might enjoy it if you wanted to see something of what life MIGHT be like for people who live this way.People have criticized it on account of it not representing their own singular Nomad life experience, which they can't realistically expect, as this represents one portion of a characters experience within a their story, rather than life for everyone with these living arrangements. Got to say it's been overhyped though. I think my main gripe stems from this movie not really going anywhere - it attempts to outline aspects of this life experience for some people, but does nothing more.I had to watch it in pieces. 30 minute segments. After the first 20 mins I thought I'd done an hour of it, until I paused it for a moment, to discover I'd barely done any time with it at all.I've not hammered it, in terms of my critical assessment, in writing at least, as my rating may change if I see it again, knowing what exactly to expect. But I think going into it with somewhat reduced expectations would be helpful for most people.The acting is all really good, the writing too, in that it all feels very real, and natural, however as far as I'm concerned nothing really happens, nothing that really drew me in anyway. I can appreciate why others might love it, but I think those people are rather more few and far between."
NOMADLAND,25 November 2021,3/10,"A docu-drama of limited appeal - the film is nothing more than a NatGeo-styled road trip film, with some wonderful sceneries of rural America and a predictable, and frankly irksome Frances McDormand performance. All the Oscar and critical buzz is simply baffling for me."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,6/10,"This was depressing. I should have had an open mind but given the situation that was 2020 and its long term effects, I struggled with this.I wonder, will this become a reflection of not just the OLder people in society but the reality of many even the young whose lives will be rocked by the Covid economy."
NOMADLAND,22 January 2021,9/10,Def felt like a National Geo doc with the Beautiful Cinematography Of West Coast to Midwest America.Also she captures the loneliness vibes of this lifestyle beautifully.This movie makes u feel a type of way when you hit rock bottom after the Financial Crash n losing a Loved 1.Beautiful film of how we cope through life In tough times and how we keep on going n keep moving forward.Couldn't picture any other Actress other than Frances playing Fern. The snow scenes gave me Fargo vibes lol.
NOMADLAND,11 November 2021,1/10,"The film tells the tale of Fern, a van-dwelling nomad who travels the US in her van after her husband dies and the sole industry in her town closes down. We see her interacting with other fellow nomads mixed with some beautiful shots........and that's about it.Honestly, this film is one of the most overrated Best Picture winners ever (still think Promising Young Woman should have won). Nothing happens onscreen, Fern ends up in the same place she was in at the beginning of the film, nothing interesting happens to her, we just get a series of random encounters that don't really add up to much and the pacing is absolutely terrible to the point where I nearly fell asleep.At least with Birds of Prey, Cathy Yan actually wrote and directed Dead Pigs, another indie flick which, compared to Nomadland, actually felt like it was going somewhere and had a good story. With this film, I can definitely see why Eternals was so boring."
NOMADLAND,30 May 2021,3/10,"Everyone involved in this deserves credit, it's an amazing piece of filmmaking and feels more like a documentary. Every character in the movie feels very real and genuine.It's just so dull and uninteresting after about 30 minutes I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it, and didn't feel I missed much."
NOMADLAND,1 September 2021,6/10,"I can't imagine a nomad's life for me, but I definitely recognize the need for something different; for at least some less avoiding of the consciousness that we are perishable. And that is in the movie. On the other hand, what is shown as an alternative, is different only in scale - McDormand's character still has a home, although in the form of a van, and is actually quite attached to it. She is also quite determined to keep it and makes all sorts of compromises to that end, including borrowing money she can't return. So when she says: ""It's strange that you encourage people to invest their whole life savings, go into debt, just to buy a house they can't afford"", it sounds true and hypocritical at the same time. Another note that I have is that I doubt people become nicer just because they hit the road. So, I presume, you would find the same amount of assholeness among your fellow nomads in the desert as you find in society."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,5/10,"I was so looking forward to this film. I so admire Francis McDormand but this film is a disappointment. I admire the people who have been let down by their government and society, admire their independence and perseverance, but cannot see that they are only fooling themselves. This lifestyle is not one to aspire to. This is a failure to community, society and humanity. This is misery."
NOMADLAND,19 May 2021,8/10,"NomadlandThere's no question to whether Nomadland is a good film. The real question is would you enjoy it? It's definitely not for everyone and older viewers and those who have experienced enough life to feel genuine pain will relate most.Filled with an overarching edge of Melancholy, Nomadland isn't an easy film to watch. It constantly asks it's viewer, did you do everything you wanted to? If the answer is no, the film asks us, what are you waiting for?These are hard questions for viewers to face. It's definitely easier to sweep those questions aside and I can imagine there are many viewers who aren't ready to face their own mortality yet. But it's in these hard realities we find the true beauty of Nomadland. The stunning reality of our own obscurity as humans is never as present as when the film presents us with long shots of incredible natural vistas. The film whilst entirely based in the USA doesn't show us the America we usually see. Instead we're confronted with the endless deserts and dramatic skies of Nevada, it's barren and we barely ever see shots of towns. The film asks us another question, are you lonely?Another main theme is consumerism and corporate America. It isn't shoved in your face, but instead presents itself as an opportunity to ask yourself key questions. I'll not mention more for fear of spoiling key moments.Nomadland is a worthy Oscar winner. It's arty farty, sure! If it was a painting it would be a picasso with its unorthodox approach. In fact the film often lets you answer and draw your own conclusions and there's a lot left unsaid. That's a traditional approach of modernist art, and without trying to lose you, but when you view a Picasso nobody says, 'wow that's beautiful'. Instead we try to figure out what on earth he was thinking when he made the art. That's Nomadland! How do you feel? How many films even ask you that question? It's a rare gem, it's unique and offers a perspective you won't often experience."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,5/10,"A snapshot of the nomad lifestyle and the acceptability of economic poverty. It could have been great but it's dull. You look through a window onto a life that is ultimately very, very sad. If you have more time watch a documentary rather."
NOMADLAND,26 May 2021,6/10,"It felt like if an Artificial Intelligence directed a film. Lots of visually appealing shots, a cascade of quick cuts and a Lead that lacked depth."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,9/10,"I can see why people are giving this film a low rating probably because of the films direction. It's not a normal film in terms of structure. But I didn't mind this and I thought it worked beautifully for this film. It felt like a documentary of Fern as we follow her life as a Nomad. It's as if McDormand isn't even acting, she's just living her life and I love the use of real nomads which makes the story more raw and real. Cinematography was amazing as well. The film overall was just so simple but powerful."
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,5/10,"Sadly, a very disappointing film, the actual Nomads in the film were more interesting than the fictional character portrayed by the lead.What the Academy saw is beyond me, as The Father and the Sound of Metal are much better films.Nomadland should have been made as a documentary, discovering the stories of those who chose their lives on the road would have been a more rewarding film.As for the Directing, it was at best, the equivalent of a 3rd rate film student.When the cinemas reopen, don't bother with this film, go and see The Father and Sound of Metal, far better films, especially the Father."
NOMADLAND,15 June 2021,8/10,"I saw many comments telling that this film is kinda slow and leaves nothing special in them. Well, maybe their lives are not in the same as in the film. As the ending saying ""Dedicated to the ones who had to depart..."", they are the ones who always lives with their memory, and that memory is the only thing in companion with them all the time; and things they are doing right now is keep living with it, not with anything else; and I appreciate that a lot. I am just the one who find a good film to watch, not the one who need to see what an Oscar Winner Film should have. It's simply wonderful!"
NOMADLAND,25 July 2021,8/10,"I'll take McDormand any day of the week. And this is another fine movie and performance from her. The director does a great job handling non-actors which is not always an easy feat. After watching the movie, there's definitely a peculiar allure to chucking it all, by choice or by force, and hitting the carefree lifestyle of the road in your vehicle. Sleeping under the stars and relieving yourself in fast food restrooms off the highway. A lovely, intimate slice of Americana for sure."
NOMADLAND,14 April 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is the rare kind of film where the cinematography of the great old American west and the people who travel in vans and RVs are interesting to watch. I love open road pictures like this. McDormand gives a well-deserved performance as the character Fern and as a producer of the film, she has exquisitely and strangely become a true Hollywood legend, Chloe Zhao direction is all about beauty over glitz and glamour."
NOMADLAND,7 September 2021,7/10,I don't quite understand this movie. I've never seen an art movie before. I think that maybe I won't be able to understand what the director is trying to express until I'm aged enough.
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,8/10,"Yet another film depicting what we would today refer to as ""Neorealism"" and this one actually does work. It is the film lovers type film. Not being at all familiar with Chloe Zhao's other work, you sure get the understanding she uses her direction to perfectly capture emotion of both character and environment.
What really helps is also her way to converse the story effortlessly bringing new characters who have a depth of rawness that immediately makes them admirable.
The acting though is impeccable. Even David Strathairn is excellent as Dave a man whom is key to Fern's journey. Its Fern herself played incredibly by Frances Mcdormand that keeps you in this. Its probably her best role yet.
The film might be a bit slow and tedious at times with continuous landscapes and desert walks, but it still gives great storytelling."
NOMADLAND,28 June 2021,6/10,"Minimalist movie with almost no storyline, with a semi-documentary appeal to the houseless, but not homeless nomads life. Worst thing first: a painfully wrong choice of soundtrack, Ludovico Einaudi's kitsch music is not emotional, it's sentimental. The emotional impact should have come from the story, but there was none.Thank God for Frances McDormand, creating another unforgettable character here, carrying the movie almost alone, telling us a story about loss and loneliness. She is the heart and soul of it, with modesty and dignity, strong personal independence, showing us that solidarity, empathy and integrity are still values to live for.But I couldn't help myself to find the movie a bit overrated."
NOMADLAND,24 January 2021,5/10,"The great Frances McDormand repeats every acting trick in this going-everywhere-without-going-anywhere story. If you ever wondered how a film could go on for two hours without any of the characters or the story undergoing any changes whatsoever, you have found your answer. As it progressed, flat tire episode after flat tire episode and laundromat scene after laundromat scene, the film becomes an almost parody of self-conscious pretentiousness, its director clearly hypnotized by her star and the rambling story going absolutely nowhere despite the multiple locations across the US. Why would this have made a better documentary? Because some of the lives it tangentially explores would have provided some interesting narratives had they been more fully developed and had the film moved away from its central character. As it is, the film stays on McDormand's, who doesn't evolve at all. Tedious, overhyped ""art film"". Do not watch after a full meal."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,5/10,"This is piece of filmography got nominated for the Academy Awards Best Picture. Damn!I expected it to be some good drama film but what I got is something not good at all.The only thing which I found good was it's cinematography and Lead Actress' acting, these two things were really good. All the supporting actors too did a good job.The story is about a homeless woman who lives in a van, this movie shows the VAN LIFESTYLE.The director didn't pace the film well, it's okay to be slow-paced but the viewer should feel entertained and he shouldn't feel any lag. But things were so different and it was a slog for me complete watching this flick. I don't know why this film is hyped and rated at this level but it just doesn't deserve that much! Anyway, this is just my personal opinion.Try watching, you may like it, many people liked it. The reason why it didn't felt very good for me maybe because this film just doesn't suits me."
NOMADLAND,14 June 2021,8/10,"Tonight I finally got around to watching Chloe Zhao's Nomadland. I'd put off watching it on Disney Plus and waited to watch it when it came out in the cinema in the UK. Frances McDormand was right. This is a film you have to watch on the big screen. The cinematography is stunning with big, sweeping photography of the beautiful but desolate Arizona, Nevada, and South Dakota landscapes, and it is complemented perfectly by the wonderful music of Ludovico Einaudi - I was filled with emotion whenever I heard those piano notes from pseudo-title track 'Oltremare', a song I haven't listened to in years.Frances McDormand is wonderful in a quiet yet powerful performance that fully earns her that Best Actress award and is supported by great performances from many of the cast who aren't even professional actors.I was one of less than ten people in the single screening that this film had today, and two of them were teenage girls who were just sitting on snapchat for the whole film. It's really a shame that a film like this isn't getting much attention from the wider public.I still enjoyed Judas and The Black Messiah more but I'm not upset that this won Best Picture. It's certainly a much more worthy winner than many others I've seen in the past."
NOMADLAND,14 June 2021,5/10,"I can't really fault this movie as it plods along from one dreary, depressing set piece to the next. The atmosphere was real, and I felt sympathy for the main character. That said, ""Nomadland"" really only evoked one deep feeling inside me, and it was a longing for the days of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and ""The Godfather"". How far-far-far we've come in our concept of a Best Picture winner, and how low-low-low our expectations have become. I can appreciate a story about ""real"" people doing ""real"" things, but Francis McDormand defecating in a bucket is a little over the top."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,3/10,"I am a cinephile AND I love Frances McDormand. So it pains me to recommend you stay far, far, away from this movie. It is relentlessly and needlessly depressing. And according to various actual nomads who have reviewed here on IMDB, not based in reality. The hype is just that.
The cinematography is stunning, therefore 3 and not 1 star."
NOMADLAND,14 October 2021,8/10,"One day, some time ago, I thought about IMDb and realized that one could likely write most anything in this review space as long as it wasn't offensive - except to the intellect... I find it hard to believe that there is an actual human being, on IMDb's payroll, who checks the countless poorly written ramblings on offer here. (But in that case, hi to you, Tom or Kathy, hope your day is going well. I love this site. And let me ensure you, there is nothing inappropriate in this text. Aside from some inconsequential ramblings, if you'll forgive me.)So, it's a Thursday night in 2021, and I'm at home, alone, bored, depressed and desperate. Thinking about life, which in my case seems to mean movies a lot of the time. But something has changed. I don't go to the movies anymore. It's weird, because for about 20 years I did. A 100 times a year. I love movies, with a passion. Still do, I guess. But, they have changed, or so I feel. They've become even more of an amusement park ride than they already were. And the change into digital image capturing has killed something within the art. Some level of expression and...craftsmanship, perhaps? Movies don't feel like films anymore. The flicker is gone, and I miss it. The cinemas have also changed and turned into living rooms and diners. Going to the movies these days makes me feel older than I am.But I did see ""Nomadland"". It's a somber and sober drama with some actors who feel like real actors and not stars, and one can sense, that somebody was behind the camera actually thinking about the directorial choices. Watching ""Nomadland"" feels like you're in conversation with a mature person, who's taken a look at this world of ours and has something to tell us about it.""Nomadland"" is a story of, or a look at, a good woman who, like me, doesn't feel as old as the candles on a birthday cake say she is, but is already of no use to this world. Her existence is pointless - to everyone but herself. So, she turns to the nomad lifestyle, drifting from a temporary job to another. At Christmas time, she does seasonal work at a warehouse for Amazon, a real life E-Corp, which should be dismantled immediately. It's a horrifying world we live in.The events in ""Nomadland"" actually take place 10 years ago, and the desperation has only grown since. In this context, Frances McDormand's character seems almost like a symbol of a free spirit caged in a soulless, man-made reality. Genuine human interaction is almost impossible, all you have is you...and your mobile home of sorts.I don't know. ""Nomadland"" is a fine movie. But I'm not sure if it teaches us anything, in the end. Or, rather, it does, but the question is, what can we do with the wisdom that it offers to us? We can merely relate and accept. Or not. ""Nomadland"" gives us an opportunity to be away from home for a couple of hours, and then return. None the wiser, but perhaps bothered by the meaninglessness of it all.On some random Thursday night, at least. In coming days and years there'll be other movies, and then other movies and so on and so on. And the silver screen looks more and more like the desert in ""Nomadland""."
NOMADLAND,5 January 2021,,The movie sucks big time . I don't know what the hell was this movie about ?? The Acting was fine but that's the only positive thing about this junk . Cmon Frances you are way better than this .
NOMADLAND,23 April 2021,4/10,"I love the Cohen Brother's movies, but I turned the channel at about 20 minutes in on this one. The reason: Depressing and boring.I just spent a year on lockdown, and now I have to watch a movie about an old lady nomad? Yikes....please, No!I actually watched reruns of ""Frasier"" instead. Much happier now.Perhaps it was bad timing for co-bros?"
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,7/10,"It's a film very different from any other I've watched. The acting, the music, the cinematography- it's all superb. It's a very quiet and subtle film. You need to let the film sink in.However, to some extent, I have felt somewhat disconnected and sensed a little lack of engagement."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,4/10,The whole plot can be summarised in a few lines. There is way too much footage without anything happening. At first it is nice because it tries to immerse you into the life of a nomad but then it gets boring fast. Other than this major complaint everything else is pretty solid. But for me the idea works better as a painting rather than a movie. That's how light on plot it was.
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,7/10,"A Quiet Exit Mesmerising Landscapes, Haunting human decisions !! A Character Study Nomadland Melancholic drama that will make you think of old age and appreciate your current life."
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,8/10,"Such a sad film, yet such a true film. USA is such a new country, yet everything that can go wrong has. Nice people, sure, but in hardness of time nice is not there is it. I feel sorry for America. I feel sorry for all its dead, for all its mislead, for all its misinformed. Thanks for a film that broke my hart."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,9/10,"I was completely mesmerized by this film, not only from the filmmaking aspect but also the view into a lifestyle I didn't even know existed. Living in a big city, I see lots of homeless people and often (erroneously) believe they're all drug addicts or mentally ill. But this showed a whole different picture, a group of people who prefer to live a nomadic lifestyle. It was mesmerizing and very moving. And Frances Mcdormand Is brilliant.Definitely not a movie for everyone. No big dramatic storyline, no car chases, no special effects."
NOMADLAND,26 December 2020,10/10,"I Saw This Movie At 27th December 2020, This Movie Made My Day ~ And I Really Liked It. NOMADLAND ~ Just Take Your Seat And Start Your Roller Coster Ride With This Masterpiece ' Everything Feels So Believable, From The Intense Dialogue To How Each Character React. Beautiful Cinematography And A Fantastic BGM ~ Highly Recommendation!! Must Watch ~ This Movie Will Win Oscar For Sure ‚ù§üòô"
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,10/10,The writing was very beautiful and the directing was perfection with her own editing. To whoever finds this movie boring truly doesn't love the art and craft of film.
NOMADLAND,7 July 2021,9/10,"Big screen really did justice for this one.I really love that this kinda slice of life movie won best picture Oscar this year.It may not be my favorite of nominees but it really deserved it.Combination of amazing, fun and touching scenes.With beautiful cinematography.Characters feel'd so real.Because they mostly are.So peaceful."
NOMADLAND,7 April 2021,8/10,"Viewers won't find any action or digital decadence in this film, it won't be a blockbuster (even by 2021 standards, though it would be a great film to see on the big screen), and it will likely be divisive among those who watch it. What viewers will find is a sprawling tale of solitude, introspection, the need to socialize, and the yearning for ""home"" in lived souls.Frances MacDormand's performance is truly inspired, and while I wouldn't necessarily see the need for method acting in a film of this style, it feels very much like a method acting performance. The cinematography and art direction are masterclass, and truly capture the feel of their locations, particularly of being on the road (even though there is little screen-time actually ""on the road"", most is usually at camps or on location). Of course, the direction speaks for itself as this film speaks volumes in both its silence and in its splendor.Some of the most affectionate moments, however, are moments spent in company. While this is very much a tale of solitude, it showcases that by highlighting the power of company, and the power company has to make someone feel alone. Likewise, it shows the power being alone has to make someone truly feel alive and free.Without saying too much as to spoil the film, I will conclude by saying that those who consider themselves introverts or those who feel like they are torn between needing others company but wanting to keep distance, this film is for you. It's also for those who feel like they want to break down their social confines and live freely (while this may be different from person to person, the titular ""Nomad"" life is rather popular in American modernity). It's also a great film for people who love expressive cinema (this film can cut deep depending on your disposition.)A film that is truly a touch above the rest and a modern classic: 8.5/10."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,7/10,"It's about loss. Loss. Loss. And more loss. It's brutal. It's well done but I had to fast forward before I jumped off a bridge. Was hoping the end gave me something...but she chooses to stay living in her loss apparently?? Even though she had a choice. Lord...I'm looking to get an RV and two friends today told me ""you have to see Nomadland!"" Um...kind of wondering if they hate me??? Or forgot that I've had way too much loss in the last year. It ain't about RVs! My go's that was depressing."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,5/10,"Feels like a documentary - depressing, no plot, but mildly educating with an insight into a different life. Meh, it was meh - undeserving of the Oscar, probably would not have achieved any awards had it not been due to the lack of material due to the pandemic."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,6/10,"Without doubt is this a great looking picture, like a curated selection from a landscape photographers port folio. Frances McDormand shines, and blends among non-professional actors. An entertaining journey, though an aimless one, couldn't help but feel a little empty by the credits. Don't expect much more than a pretty slice-of-life flick."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,9/10,"Food, music and movies come in wide varieties. The reason being not all people are alike. I completely understand why many found this movie unappealing. Slow paced and based on a rather uneasy subject matter. I'm not one of those people. I absalutely loved it. I'm a simple person who finds simple things appealing."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,5/10,Overly long and exhausting to watch.Depressing see how someone is trapped in a cycle of what amounts to self sabotage and trying to hold onto a past that isn't coming back.
NOMADLAND,2 June 2021,5/10,"How the hell did this slow nonsense win any oscars, let alone beat picture?!!! I like FM, 3 billboards, Fargo - great work. But didn't get the BA nod for this one, a bit like how Casey Affleck won for MBTS over RG in LA LA!!!! Bonkers!!!! Can't believe we've gone from Parasite to this in the space of 12 months. Don't feel obliged to watch this because of its awards haul, otherwise you'll be left wondering, and maybe wandering too, how?"
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,3/10,"After all the hype, I was excited to finally rent and watch this movie on Vudu recently. But, we were sorely disappointed. First, it's ""Pseudo-documentary"" nature is spoiled by the filmmaker's choices of what to put in, and what to leave out. I can only say, this leaves us with only the filmmaker's perspective on reality. There is no ""Balanced"" view as to who these people are, why they are out there and so on. We only see scattered segments from REAL PEOPLE, but we have no idea if they're acting or reading script.Second, I paid money to watch a film of an Oscar winning actress take a dump in a bucket in the back of her van? Are you kidding? That's just gross, and completely unnecessary. After the short segment of the woman teaching ""Bucket etiquette"" you'd have thought we wouldn't have had to deal with that.Third, there is a poetic sequence from one of the real people where she describes a scene on some river where she comes upon tens of thousands of nesting Swallows, with their nests on the cliffs overlooking the river and the river being so still, that she feels like she's flying amongst the birds as their reflections are in the water seemingly under and all around (as well as over) the folks in the kayak. Like I said, very poetic. Then, later in the film, the filmmaker attempts to capture this in film and does one of the most miserable jobs of it I saw in near the entire film. I actually saw no good cinematography in this movie at all.If you've ever traveled the desert, and seen a sunrise, you'd know the colors that you see are UNBELIEVABLE, and they did an entirely lousy job of capturing that as well.Since, in this movie, we don't know what's acting and what's real, I have to give it an overall score of 3/10. My wife and I both hated it and were sorely disappointed with the ending. The actress achieves ""Closure"" without redemption. All too important these days is the satisfaction of our own ego without achieving any real answers as to the meaning of our overall existence. If you set out to find meaning (what I thought this film might be about) but only find some satisfaction for your bruised ego (healing of your wounds), then you have sadly missed the entire point of telling a story.Just my opinion."
NOMADLAND,29 August 2021,2/10,"If it was done as a straight documentary, it might have been interesting in a niche sort of way to see how some people live. Instead it's a typical series of scenes strung together, most of which are dull and pointless. The question I had was how would this be any different if Francis Mcdormand had stayed in her house and tried to fight to keep what she had and watched as it was all slowly taken from her. Is it somehow more poignant watching her eat a bucket of KFC in her van as opposed to her eating it alone in her kitchen? Or watching her huddle in her bed because they turned the heat off on her? So maybe she has to take a dump in a bucket, but I gotta say there are plenty of times I've been in the bathroom and wished I could crack a window. Or watching her do laundry at a laundry mat; got news, we all have to do tedious things and it's not more meaningful just because she's houseless. I mean if you don't have a washer/dryer, unless you're Chris Farley living in a van down by the river, which I guess she kind of is, but unless you're beating your clothes against a rock, then yeah, odds are you're using a laundry mat, and it never occurs to me when I see people at the laundry mat that they must all be living in vans down by the river.While I respect her, part of the problem was that I never felt I was watching anything but Francis Mcdormand. So yeah, I watch her doing jobs like cleaning a toilet or bagging potatoes or working a restaurant, but that's something millions of people do every day with no fan fare and certainly not until the director yells cut and they can hurry back to their god knows how many million dollar and completely paid for homes where they can sit in a soaker tub with a glass of wine while their husband rubs their feet and tells about the next movie he's planning to do. So whether she does or not, the fact is she hasn't had to clean her own toilet probably since she's been a working adult.Another problem is that half the time it feels like an extended tail gate party or a vacation. I mean there's a choice whether you want the regular chili or the vegan option and extra hot peppers or cilantro; so one question was who paid for that, one person or were they all expected to chip in? Then she goes and floats naked in a stream, hugs a tree, goes on a nature hike with a guide, looks through a telescope like she's at the planetarium and visits a zoo. Okay, great, but that was better than my last vacation.The point is if that's her choice, great, good for her, but I really have no reason to care. And it is a choice. She's offered an extended stay, maybe for the rest of her life, by three different people and she says no every time. We find out that David Strathairn can go live with his family any time he wants. And even the real people in this movie, one takes off because that's her version of living life to the fullest, another because she has terminal brain cancer and a third because he lost his son. I'll be honest, none of that makes it more meaningful because of where they are in life. There's plenty of tragedy in the world and most people aren't able to drive off even if they wanted to. Because some people lose a husband but they still have children to take care of and some people might lose a son but they still have people who depend on them with special needs or an elderly parent.And the notion that they're somehow closer to nature, I gotta be honest, I don't think driving around in a van and sitting outside lots really counts. I don't see a lot of Crocodile Dundees here, going walk about in the bush and trying to survive on nuts and berries and what they kill and knowing which snakes are poisonous but still good eating. Strathairn gets sick and the next thing he's in a hospital getting major surgery done; so what, does he have insurance, and if not, how was it supposed to get paid for? Mcdormand's van conks and she immediately takes it to a garage. You know, as opposed to looking for used parts and maybe seeing if one of the others can help fix her car or at least go on Google to find out how to do it herself. Speaking of which, besides still finding time to do shots at a bar, and buy animal crackers, she has a cell phone for crying out loud. I mean, just having the hardware doesn't mean it actually works, so what plan exactly is she on and how exactly does she pay for it; more specifically, how and why does she even have a smart phone? Yeah, real survivors here.So we get commentary about the evils of a money based, corporate system, but it felt more like a speech someone had rehearsed. Now I have no love lost for corporations, but does anyone else find it just a little ironic that Frances gets a job with one of the biggest corporations ever, owned by one of the richest people ever? And no doubt this company prides itself on being a disrupter, which basically means it has put more people like her out of jobs than it will ever hire, a company that has helped destroy brick and mortar and seeks to do that in every possible industry it can, in the name of gaining market share and all with a smile.Finally, when Mcdormand is in trouble, I guess we find out why she needs the phone, it's so she can call her sister. At no time is it ever indicated that she contacts her for any other reason, like maybe just to let her know she's doing ok or even still alive. Oh, but when she needs money, then yeah, no problem. Again another little speech on the wrongness of real estate and mortgages, then onto the money. What ticked me off most was her big thing that she'll pay her back, as though that's the only thing. No, it's the fact that she's in need now and her sister comes through for her. And this is right after she basically insults her, yeah, I could live here, but I think you're kind of a b*itch and the entire idea of spending more than five minutes here makes my skin crawl, oh but thanks for the money, I'll pay you back. But of course only Frances knows what it means to have empathy or pride or dignity because her eyes well up when people she really wants to be around tell her their sad stories. Forget that her sister might have feelings too, that maybe it would make her feel good to help her sister; no, instead she's just a sugar daddy who swallows her own pride because she knows how important it is to Frances to pay her back, as though that's all it is, just a loan, like she's nothing more than a bank machine. I would have loved instead of acting like the money was coming out of her monthly shoe allowance, if she had said to Frances, yeah, you're my sister and I love you, that's why I'm helping you, but guess what, that money just came out of our kids college fund, or guess what, we had to take out a pay day loan ourselves because we can't cover it until the end of the month. But then I guess that would ruin the whole point, that only people like Frances have money problems or are worthy of respect or empathy. Got news, not even close."
NOMADLAND,28 July 2021,7/10,"The film is unique. It captures a sliver of this life style. It touches on many people who live this way; some by choice and others, not. The film goes wide trying to incorporate every angle but fails to go deep so I was left feeling a bit disappointed. There are some poignant moments and beautiful cinematography. Overall, a thought-provoking film."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,8/10,"I love movies like this. The world needs to be explored but we just stay put in one place most of our life. The characters here took the decision to be on road due to various reasons but that life style. At least I think we didn't see many saying they wanted to do it as their first choice. But whatever the nomadic life style offers so much but there is also the problem of being alone. If we can look beyond the loneliness there is a lot to explore in this work before we depart. I don't think this lifestyle can be followed anywhere else in the world. At least I haven't heard of such a lifestyle in India. That way America offers so many options to live your life. There are some general questions that remain like how can we sustain such a life style by not having enough money? Does temporary jobs help you with that much money? But I guess there are people who live like that which says it is possible.The movie also reminded me of David Lynch's A Straight Story and other movies like Wild, Tracks etc.I can keep watching these movies."
NOMADLAND,14 September 2021,8/10,"Chloe Zhao is able to create quite an immersive portrayal as the lead character adjusts to the nomadic way of life. As she drove through those exquisite scenes, I also reached for my car keys but was immediately made to realize the hardships that such a life entails. The movie does not probably advocate towards one lifestyle over the other but rather focuses on the people living as nomads as it captures the exquisite as well as the ugly. In a way the lead character is also learning to live with those choices as she gains skills to take on this new lifestyle while also making the sacrifices needed to live with such freedom."
NOMADLAND,21 March 2021,7/10,"Frances McDormand puts this film on her back and carries it with another sensational performance. With excellent direction from Chloe Zhao, this is just a beautiful film from its cinematography to its powerful stories. She perfectly demonstrates just how important community is and conveys a sense of isolation and loneliness for our main character, Fern. The music is also wonderful yet subtle, almost like a comforting hymn.Even the supporting cast was great, and their stories were truly moving. The supporting cast are all real nomads telling their real-life stories, which adds an extra layer of realism, but also begins to feel like a documentary. Hopping from person to person, story to story, doesn't really make for a cohesive narrative. It's basically Frances McDormand hanging out with a bunch of nomads and them filming those interactions.This film is not for everyone. There's a lot of empty space of not much happening. In other words, you'll probably be bored since it's completely character-driven and the pacing can be slow. It felt as if we were eavesdropping on some random person's life, which didn't really make for the most entertaining watch.But after coming across some impressive behind-the-scenes facts, I developed a greater appreciation for the film. Filming took place across 7 different states over the course of 4 months. Frances McDormand actually worked several of the jobs shown in the film, and she immersed herself so much into the nomad life that employers were actually offering her work. Ultimately, good on them for going above and beyond what was needed to tell the story.This is still a solid movie with another incredible performance from Frances McDormand but just expect it to feel more like a documentary-styled film."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,4/10,"I am a big fan of Frances McDormand - would watch anything featuring her.In sum, the movie is about melancholy and apathy. Beautifully shot and thoughtful performance but to what purpose? Emotional piano music swirls all around while we see a woman living in tough conditions. Sadly, for me, that's all there is in the movie.Highly recommended as treatment for people with insomnia."
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,1/10,If it wasn't for listening to a commentary track along with this movie i probably would have turned it off and watched something else when i got bored which was in the first 10 mins. Movie seems to go on forever even while doing other things while just listening to it.
NOMADLAND,18 May 2021,7/10,"I'm not sure if I get the hidden meessage from the movie. The movie pace is extremely slow and the line seem ordinary. But the beautiful and stellar scene did made me felt peaceful and how insignificant human could be.I wish everyone can not only afford a house but a home. That's the place we can settle down, so for our heart."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,6/10,"Slow paced, semi-touching movie that would be too boring to watch without Frances McDormand. She ""is"" the movie and she's fantastic as always but this movie will only appeal to her fans and those who like meandering films without any sort of plot. There is literally no structure at all, it feels as unstructured as the life of a nomad which I hope is the point. I should have seen this at the theatre because it's really hard to stay awake watching it at home. I think it took me about 5 attempts to finish it. Not that I wasn't enjoying certain aspects, particularly McDormand, but I would find it boring if I was actually in the van with her so watching it on film is not a good time for me. I really dislike this slow paced pretentious filmmaking of today that the critics love to rave about yet audiences need smelling salts to stay awake to watch. You can feel how hard it's trying to be high brow by using the lives of the low brow to accomplish it. I'm not saying it's bad, I enjoyed the quiet performance of McDormand, I think she's one of the greatest actors alive, but award winning direction? Best picture? I just don't get it."
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,10/10,"This movie, though it reflects the time and place where it happens, is really about a type of person who is timeless, and the main character who is one of them. It's about people who want something different from just about everyone else you know -- to live on the road rather than settle down. Yes, some of the characters may be poor and dispossessed, but this is not the emphasis. They often have other options and resources; the main character is offered a place to live four separate times during the movie, but she's looking for something else in life. It's really refreshing, since it's a theme that isn't explored much in movies.Frances McDormand brilliant in the role. Many long shots of her alone and quiet, which might be boring with another actor, are engrossing and loaded with subtle story elements. Her character, Fern, is not a loner, but she doesn't mind being alone. She's social and friendly, and is well liked by all she meets (not to be confused with her character in 3 Billboards). Fern's motivations and character are revealed slowly -- her sister's assessment of her personality, the reason she stayed in Empire after her husband died, her inability to stay put under a comfortable roof where she is loved and wanted.Almost all the other characters are non-actors, and they aren't asked to do much more than to be themselves and tell their stories. And it's so effective and real, that you might forget you're watching a narrative film rather than a doc. What they all have in common is a philosophy of a community of nomads who meet each other again after a month or a year or years; who help and teach each other; who never say goodbye, but rather ""see you down the road,"" even for those who have passed away."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,7/10,You're thrown right in and its hard to figure as you go. But acting is great. Hard to feel great from there. Frances. One of the greats. Other amateur actors probably better in supporting roles. Oscars may come down to who'd you lose to. Jaws. Raiders. LA Conf. Saving Private Ryan. Its bad of late. Argo underated movie with history that has much relevance. Where are the good ones otherwise.
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,7/10,"I like most anything that Frances McDormand is in. Fargo's still my all time favorite. In this film, she plays a widow who's world has disappeared around her after the only employer in town of any size is forced to shut down. The town evaporated as a result, but Fern hung on until it made no sense to stay any more. So she modified her utility van into a living space and set off in search of....something. The slow pace made the two hours seem longer, but the story isn't boring and takes some interesting turns."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,5/10,"I love Frances McDormand. Why she chose to make this bleak, dreary film is questionable.
There isn't much acting in this so much as her character traveling around the country in a broken down van doing odd jobs for money. She meets others doing likewise. That's it. That's the movie.
I kept looking at my watch thinking this has to end soon, and it didn't.
I gave 5 stars only because Frances is in it."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,1/10,"First in-theatre movie since COVID started. I was suspicious of the 1 hour 45 minute runtime, but now realize that this stinking carcass of a script couldn't carry itself over the two-hour mark. There's no story here. No arc. The character ends up in the same pointless spot in the end as she started from in the opening shot. No real tension anywhere. Might as well label this a documentary. Skip."
NOMADLAND,30 August 2021,6/10,"Movie 'Nomadland' is written and directed by Chlo√© Zhao with an Hollywood actress Frances McDormand. This movie is based on the book by Jessica Bruder. Movie is about a woman named Fern (Frances McDormand) who becomes a nomad and she will start to travel and work in several companies. The movie guides us through the story of Fren and her past.This movie got three Oscar awards.Movie is unique for its theme of script. Script will slowly introduces us to the protagonist Fren, what she is doing, her past etc. Movie is in some scenes londer and lifeless. Script has a problem with introducing us to many characters and then you have a problem remembering the names of main characters, except for Fren. In some scenes the words are just said by some characters but the words do not have any life, any meaning. Ending of this movie could have been written better. Story and the rest of the screenplay is pretty good. Some shots are unnecessarily filmed and useless. This movie is about travel and about the life of the main character Fren, so you can't expect any elaborate scenario. Scenes are beautifully shot, so the director of photography Joshua James Richards did a very good job. Edit is very good except for one scene. Locations are very nice and interesting. There are good performances of actors too. Frances McDormand is very good in her role.I recommend this movie, but don't expect something special.6/10

NOMADLAND,10 October 2021,7/10,"Nomanland is a movie directed by Chloe Zhao. It includes Frances Mcdormand in its cast as a protagonist apart from her the other cast members are not famous.This is the first movie I have seen from Chloe Zhao. The movie tells story of an old woman portrayed Frances Mcdormand who loses everything and embraces nomadic lifestyle. She lives in a van and works lower degree jobs to survive. As an advantage of this lifestyle she meets lots of new people and becomes friends with them. It tells a simple story in a simplistic way. I think it is one of the good movies of 2020. Actings were good especially Frances Mcdormand gave a solid performance. Adittionaly, I want to say one more thing about the ending, the ending seems so straightforward but I think it really fits the story so you if you can think about deeply it is pretty good briefly, it is a good movie from a bad year(because of the covid-19 pandemic)."
NOMADLAND,16 April 2021,1/10,"If you want to know a movie how could be boring
pls watch nomadland."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,7/10,"Ive seen too many movies that start out with such a wonderfully unique dynamic and then slowly fall into the same cliche dramas we've all seen 1000 times. I know a lot of people like this since so many of us don't want to sway from whats expected but I found it disappointing that it would go that way. Still a great movie and worth watching but could have been way better if they would have just stuck to the vibe they created in the first half. Personally I think the production companies might be the reason for this since they want a ""Hollywood ending"" so I really shouldn't be surprised. As far as acting Frances McDormand was fantastic."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,7/10,"It's unfair of how I feel this movie will be treated. It won an academy award, so now all these people will watch it and come out of it and go ""that was boooooring"". Because this isn't a movie for the masses. It's a movie that is challenging because it comes from the perspective where you are interested in the subject. If you hear the plot and think that sounds boring, don't watch this movie. This movie is all about Frances McDormand and the nomad culture. If you don't like that don't watch it. The problem is that it doesn't interest a lot of people, but they will watch it anyways and dislike it. So whatever comes of this movie on imdb, its BS.The strongest elements of this movie would be the story. It's a simple story - Fern loses her job and after taking some part time jobs she meets with a group of nomads who give her a new outlook on life. It's actually a surprisingly funny movie with lots of unique characters. I always like a movie that has varying and different scenes and locations that all work with a central theme, and thats what this story does. Now, it is based on a real story, but the way the script incorporated elements was because of Chloe Zhao. It's apparent that Chloe Zhao is a fantastic director after watching this. I haven't watched any of her other works, but she seems to get great performances out of this film. There are also some standout scenes from a cinematography perspective, especially an astrology scene. The editing and lack of music (excluding some scenes) creates a minimalist vibe that encapsulates realism. There are some scenes which escape this realism for deliberate and effective purposes, but overall it has a documentary aesthetic.And yet, this is what I don't like. I appreciate that the movie goes all out for this documentary style. Yet, often it takes me out of the story. Often, characters talk more like their being interviewed than being conversed to. It's hard to describe exactly why, but its the way in which Zhao has characters act. It makes every conversation feel real, but adding that with the way cameras replicate documentary style footage, we get the impression that its trying to be a documentary sometimes, even though it isn't. The big problem is that that often takes us out of the experience. And a large problem for me, which I think many will identify, is that realism isn't that great. I really hate indie movies that try to portray some basic story as realistically as possible. You know how real life is to someone looking from the outside? Long, and boring. That's the art of film, using cinematic language to convey emotion. And don't get me wrong, this film understands this. There are scenes where the piano kicks in and there's no dialogue that effectively convey emotion. Yet there's enough removal of this where it does drag the movie, and to which I can't love it.In the end, while I personally don't love this movie, and you might not personally, it is undoubtedly a good movie. Should it have won the Oscar? In my opinion, no, there were better candidates, but there were also worse. Ultimately it's a movie with a distinct voice that while I don't think deserved the Oscar, I'm glad it won it anyways."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,8/10,"I watched last night. The night before I watched ""Blood Simple"" for the very first time. Of course I've seen most of McDormand's other films in Between.My conclusion is that Frances McDormand has honed her art to become a national treasure. She is now one of the few actresses that I will see a film just because she is in it.
Comedy or drama... matters not. She was as good in the Odd Ball ""Burn After Reading"" as she was in the more dramatic ""Three Billboards.""The untold story of America's Economic Nomads and their stubborn desire to remain independent was expertly displayed in the vignettes Zhao captured of Fern's life.McDormand's costars include a number of real-life nomads. But hard working pro David Straithairn turns in another stellar performance as McDormand's shy love interest.McDormand's ""Fern"" was at times a wide eyed tourist of the natural splendor still alive in the vastness of the American West... only to in the next scene to be brought low when a earnest auto mechanic suggests she sell her ""home."" Laying bare the precariousness of her lifestyle and economic situation.I felt like a voyeur watching this film.
It was a privilege to be allowed to watch.NomadLand may get McDormand a third Oscar.
With ten films eligible for nomination as best picture it should earn a Best Picture nomination but I'm not sure It can win best Picture."
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,9/10,"A most profound, compelling and stark meditation on grief and salvation on the road in modern America. Yes, it's depressing and moves at snail pace but that's a necessary intent. As a result I find myself constantly contemplating the movie and its meaning - as well as my own meaning."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,5/10,"""Best Movie"" could mean a lot of different things;
stunning visuals (does not apply here),
a great story (could be but if it is anything more than just another road movie I missed it),great actors (anybody of the cast did anything unexpected?) or at least a
great message (meet you on the road),
The plot plays with some.of the big social problems (2008 financial crisis, loosing jobs and homes) but in the end doesn't hurt anybody politically because anything comes down to personal and private problems and friendly neighbours and the spirit of early settlers."
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,3/10,"As a big fan of McDormand, I watched the film with great interest but was left hugely disappointed.While the overall sentiment of the film is entirely honourable and the backdrops are breathtaking, the film plays out more as a documentary with a ponderous, plodding storyline revealing little more than the message that it is possible to see the beauty of this world if you just go out and look for it. This notion alone could easily form the basis of a classic movie but it doesn't transpire.The film does pose some interesting social and moral questions, especially the country's treatment of the elderly but over time the storytelling becomes tedious and predictable.When compared to McDormand classics such as Fargo and 3 Billboards, this is a relatively lame affair which again calls in to question the motives of the Oscars voting panel.It's an interesting concept, and McDormand is always instantly watchable but the end result is as dreary as the town of Empire."
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,1/10,"I must qualify this review with the fact that I left my wife to each other alone after 45-50 minutes, I couldn't stand it any longer.I had no sympathy for the character, and the movie did nothin to explain the hardships of the economic situation in America.We didn't get any explanation of how she got into the situation, ok the factory closed but did she not save a penny in all the previous years, what did she spend her money on?Nor did we get an understanding of how hard the nomadic life can be. Trials seemed to be overcome with mundane scenes.When we see the Amazon signage I expected this was where we'd see exploitation or tough conditions that humans can't put up with, instead we're shown Amazon as a benevolent and happy place to work, even for old people, with ""great"" money - that's not what any free speech media will tell you, unlike a movie that had to get permission to film there first!I was genuinely waiting for her to be fired as she wandered around the Amazon warehouse doing bugger all work!Burst tyre, resolved quickly, I get that we see here that the community all help each other but we didn't really see any hardship, even the freezing cold night at the gas/petrol station we didn't see her freezing or struggling, in my opinion this is where time should have been spent showing how cold and difficult it is. Instead it wasquickly on to another dull and slow scene wandering around looking at things."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,8/10,"What a great and beautiful story. Portraiting life, struggles, love, family and a magnificient scenery of USA.Frances McDorman makes a solid and great portrait of Fern.Loved everything in this movie.The moderne nomad lifestyle, the hardship and struggles some People face in life, but the strong mindset to keep going, keep living and savning the memories of their loved ones.Beautiful movie."
NOMADLAND,9 February 2021,9/10,"This movie is simple, beautiful, meaningful and feels right. The directing is on point and Frances was made for this role. The movie leaves a special feeling, may show you a way of life very different from what you know and makes you think about life in general. That's what amazing movies should be like"
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,8/10,"Good different... if you want action packed drama and fireworks, probably not the movie for you. I found it very enjoyable, never knew about this lifestyle before, and although I hear the movie glamorized it a bit, still learned something new. Loved that most of the "" characters "" were real people not actors, which made it more authentic. Frances is as usual outstanding !"
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,9/10,"Still don't wanna write in Mandarin, because some people who speak this language are full of verbal attacks and lack of politeness and cultural knowledge. In culturally deserted place, you will only wait to die silently. Try to leave early, go to a free land, create your own art, and create value that belongs to the progress of human civilization."
NOMADLAND,2 October 2021,9/10,"I read so many of the reviews in which the reviewer panned the movie, characters, and director that I Wished We Could Reply to their Reviews. People who don't have that keep moving, see new things, and merge with the earth drive simply cannot understand what this movie and this lifestyle is all about. Poverty or income has nothing at all to do with this drive, this need. Those with little live with little, and those with more live with more, but they all live for the next deer, mountain, cactus, ocean, river, lake, moose, hummingbird, or live oak tree they see. The restlessness that Fern has always felt resides in many of us, and the ability to assuage or eliminate that need, that drive varies as much as the resources available to those afflicted. Fern lets us know that she has always felt this connection to nature but was seduced by the system and her love for a man and succumbed to the situation, but she was still the nomad within herself. I am a nomad. I have the means to rent or buy and put down roots, and I have tried to ""fit in,"" to ""connect"" with my adult children and my old friends, but there is that within that NEEDS to see a new horizon, a different lake, an untrekked trail. When we are in the last decade or two of our lives, the writing is on the wall. We have worked, we have loved, we have failed, we have tried, and we have struggled. If we cannot follow our hearts, our souls, our purposes, our loves during this final act of our lives, then what will it all have been worth? Fern made her decision and has finally come to know and accept herself. The only sadness is that it took so much denial and tragedy for her to find her."
NOMADLAND,30 December 2020,8/10,"Whatever you've heard about the film is true, not overemphasized or anything. It deserves all the praises it's getting.
Zhao's film is a powerful character study of different kind of freedom fighter; a journey of self-discovery, a live lived on your own terms. She literally established a ethereal connection with American wilderness, with its wide-open landscapes and skies which speak the language of stark loneliness and also of freedom.
Yeah it's a road film, but a remarkable one, a sensational work of poetry. Zhao perfectly balances both sides of the film-its aesthetically pleasing side and also the intimate side of this emotionally absorbing drama. The exquisitely photographed landscapes, the brief yet intense friendships among the nomads and the farewells, the journey of finding oneself- everything is captured beautifully through Zhao and McDormand's collaboration.
Zhao actually succeeded to portray the devastating side of life on road through minimal romanticism which helped her comment on the political angle of these economically-draining situations of country. Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi's score make this drama more emotionally striking, make you feel a part of this.
But above all, Zhao cast a major actor for the first time in her film, guiding Frances McDormand to an astounding performance of melancholic solemnity, so natural that it becomes really difficult to separate her from real-life nomads. Don't know somehow this performance reminded me Harry Dean Stanton's performance in Paris, Texas.
Overall, Zhao's powerful poetic drama establishes herself as an exceptional talent. With Joshua James Richards' cinematography and Zhao's peerless filmmaking place 'Nomadland' one of the greatest humanist dramas, a unique portrait of outsider existence- a love letter to those unforgetten explorers who set their own trails and to the progressive energy of nature."
NOMADLAND,1 July 2021,9/10,This is a study about self in difficult times. The decision to be 'lonely' or 'singular' in a world obsessed with the plural! Superb acting along with superb cinematography.
NOMADLAND,8 January 2021,6/10,"Everyone here seems to love the movie, with good reason. This movie is an artistic masterpiece. With the gorgeous cinematography, stunning soundtrack, this is probably the best directed movie of the year. Chloe Zhao creates such a mesmerizing atmosphere, it's very easy to get sucked in. The lead performance of Frances McDormand is as good as her performance in Three Billboards.Being said that, I would have loved to say I liked the movie as much I admired it. First of all, there is very little plot. Most of the movie relies on the interaction of Frances' character with different characters, one after the another. While some are good, others not so much. This makes the movie uneven. It worked in Into the Wild, but not much here. More times than I care to admit, I was bored and waiting for the film to end."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,4/10,I'll say it too; this is incredibly overrated as is Frances Mcdormand. I would have much preferred a straight up documentary about modern nomads rather than this odd mixing of real people and actors.
NOMADLAND,15 April 2021,8/10,"""Nomads"" of the ""Nomadland"" as the title of the movie refers to is a tribe of wonderers who live with almost total detachment from the burden of material ties. Those material attachments can be your house, your belongings and even your human relationships. It is a way of life, a monastic shedding of all excessive ""worldly enrichments"" either by choice or by circumstances, and when life is reduced to that level of existence, it can be lonely like an island at times. This film is an actress show piece and much like ""Joker"" was for Joaquin Phoenix, I am quite sure ""Nomadland"" will most likely do the same in honoring Frances McDormand for she was absolutely riveting. To quote from ""Ecclesiastes 5:15"": ""As he came naked from his mother's womb, so he will return as he came."" this is the bare fact of existence and the movie puts you right in the middle of that statement as a reminder."
NOMADLAND,31 August 2021,1/10,"There is no storyline in this movie. The woman character just keeps moving here and there, with some random scenes thrown in between. Not sure why this got so many awards. Western people really need to improve their taste in movies."
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,1/10,"Sorry, they lost me when they showed Amazon as a benign place to work and when she answer ""How's the pay?"" with ""Good or great."" Amazon let them film there, so I guess they had to cozy up to it. If Amazon paid their workers a living wage, so many wouldn't be homeless. (And Bezos should be paying taxes, but he doesn't.)"
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,6/10,"I don't understand at all how this deserved best director, it was okay, the main character seemed unreal to me, like as in no emotions, the advertisements quote people as saying what a great lifestyle, and although I'm sure some people like it, when you lose your job and have no place to call home, and struggle to find work, then live in a van because of it, there's nothing romantic about that, in a way this film is more exploitative than compassionate, the director did another movie filming native americans who weren't actors either, guess that's her thing, anyway, it's okay if you don't fall asleep during it nomadland... yawn"
NOMADLAND,25 May 2021,1/10,Mediocre and boring movie at best.. many good ideas that went nowhere and some other pourly done.. only the main character was nearly perfect ..but she always is outstanding..but even that doesnt save the movie from being repetitive and without strong meanings other than the ones forced in the surface. Maube the 1 might see. As harsh..but i only rate for 2 reasons..i give a 10 if i think is a movie worth seeing or a 1 if think u should not spent time on this one.
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,,"It took me a while to engage with the film, but like life, it happens while you're not looking. Other films come to mind here, underpinned as so many of them are, especially now, in this place and time, by loneliness, and loss, and the quest for something you can't quite name. You're trying to outrun something, and you can't, and at the same time you're looking for something, unwilling to admit you'll never find it. We're suspended here, in this brief space, desperate to understand it and find meaning in it, and like the poet said ""Time doth little more supply than to look around you and to die."" We understand, many of us, that all of life is compressed into those moments, and the weight of it often bears down on us and makes us sad. I never watch a sunset that I don't realize that one day I'll go with it. I started thinking about that, leaning against the trunk of a pecan tree in my grandfather's back yard, in the twilight, when I was about eight or nine, watching the sun falling towards the horizon. I'll think about this film in the days ahead. If you watch it, and you should, you will too."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,6/10,"It's an okay film. Kind of confusing in the beginning. After about 15 minutes I thought it was just going to be a docudrama and almost turned it off. It does continue to evolve in that theme but with a little more development of Ferns character and background. It was refreshing to see Mr. Strathairn have a role.Ms. McDermott is a great actress but to receive the Oscar for Nomadland? Really?Not a whole lot of dialogue in the film and her natural demeanor greatly lends to the character. I've seen Viola Davis in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" and there's a whole lot more character there to draw on Ms. Davis talent. It's a flashback to the Out of Africa - Color Purple debacle in '86."
NOMADLAND,23 September 2021,2/10,"Filme esquerdista chato, verdadeiro Big Brother.Boring leftist movie, real Big Brother."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,6/10,"I love slow-burn philosophical films with transcendent visuals (I actually enjoy recent Terrence Malick films?!) so everything I heard about Nomadland built my expectations very high.. but honestly it didn't live up to the hype. By the end I didn't really feel anything. McDormand is great as always - but this is far from her best work. Willing to give it second watch at some point though, just for those beautiful skies.Chloe Zhao had awards thrown at her from every ceremony on earth; but I think this no way the best picture of the year. Even just counting films where the main character lives in a van - 'Sound of Metal' beats it. I actually found this to be a step back from Zhao's first film 'Songs My Brothers Taught Me' (whose few awards you can count on 1 hand.) That had a narrative with momentum.Very intrigued to see what Chloe Zhao will present with her next film. Nomadland to blockbuster superhero film is the most bizarre switch-up imaginable."
NOMADLAND,5 August 2021,8/10,This is a very well made film that has a fantastic performance by Francis mcdermott she is very good in the film she is super believable in this. All the characters are believable the acting is very good the movie is very well directed it's pretty good. It's not a film that I will watch again I don't think it's a pretty sad story people being homeless. Overall its a very good film I i think it's even a great film it's not A bad film at all it's definitely a good film. Is it a masterpiece no but it's definitely worth your time.
NOMADLAND,16 March 2021,9/10,"My husband & I saw this movie with Frances McDormand. We enjoyed it very much. McDormand was born to play the role.
The book, of course, gives a lot more details about the lives of these mostly older people who were tired of fighting for the ""American Dream"".
It works to present them all as kind, generous people. I'm sure there are many, but also many criminals, misfits and psychopaths living this way (on wheels)."
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,7/10,Maybe I have seen films with the same poke in the heart but this is definitely a strong contender for Best Cinematography and Best Actress at the Oscars.
NOMADLAND,16 April 2021,9/10,"It remind me a lot of The Revenant 2015 because of his cinematography, soundtrack, great directing and acting.I personally love when the situation of the leading character (in this case ) is very deplorable, sad and at points deppresing but still Fern (Frances McDormand ) keeps looking for happines and a better way of spending following years .It leaves you meditating about the people¬¥s lives, it opens your brain to more diversity of people (excluding races but lifestyles ). The movie is very silent which again i personally like, i like that chlo√© is not telling you what to think or feel, she makes you create your opinion about this.These two women Frances and Chlo√© are very talented and this is the amazing product of passion and talent in what they do.Finally I understand if people find it boring or pointless. It is a very observant film but the non actors and frances performances kept it very watchable."
NOMADLAND,1 April 2021,2/10,"Funniest movie of 2021. Couldn't stop laughing. On top of that you have car chases, incredible martial arts battles, and great gun fights. Almost non-stop action. Also the ladies will love the romance story. A movie for every one!....Just kidding. Bored the hell out of me. Sooooo slow. Watch if you want but you might want to drink a pot of coffee or two before hand. Just sayin'...."
NOMADLAND,11 April 2021,8/10,"Nomadland was released in 2020, and tells the story of Fern, a houseless nomad who lives in her van, to which she can travel the country and relive old memories, as well as create new ones. Going in to this movie, I was expecting yet another unoriginal slow movie about living without technology or a home; this movie really surprised me. This film really takes you on a journey, and can teach you a few lessons about prejudice and life itself.Chlo√© Zhao is a master in directing, and if she does not win for cinematography and direction at the academy awards later this year, then something is definitely wrong. Her shots are so beautiful, with a unique use of wide shots and colours. Zhao also wrote the film, and while most people associate good writing with complex themes and different characters, this film is quite the opposite, it's a simple story of a fellow traveller and the people she meets along the way; and the writing is of the upmost excellence.Frances McDormand is amazing as Fern, she really moves the story along. While this film is a little slow, the film reminds you that it is intended to be slow, because life moves at fast pace, and yet is still slow. This woman lives one day at a time and over the span of just an hour and forty five minutes, we get to see her grow as a person over the span of a year, meeting new people, and finding the morals from the past.Overall, this movie is a great watch and I'd highly recommend, if it's your thing. If you can't appreciate small beauty and need flashy action sequences to keep you interested, then this movie isn't for you.I'm giving Nomadland a 8.5/10."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,7/10,"This is a good movie and I liked it, but I don't really think this one deserves the Best picture Oscar. I mean, 2019, Parasite, 2018, Green Book, 2017, The Shape Of Water. Nomadland is good and that's all. I really think Trial Of the Chicago 7 ns Mank deserves the Oscar more than this one. Anyways, it is a good one, just a good one."
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,7/10,"Great as a documentary but not very great at film. There's no story as such, it just shows the nomadic way of life and living. Best picture of 2020?.. Certainly, not."
NOMADLAND,15 January 2021,8/10,Watching this film will make you question modern life.
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,5/10,"Well, I had left a review, but after looking at all the other reviews that were pro-Nomad, I was horrified. My opinion is that the thrust of this film is not about people who choose to be nomads, but people who are forced into it. This movie is very, very sad. I give full props to Frances McDormand, who has had the courage to film this."
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,6/10,"Great acting, but the directing and production was all over the place. Odd pacing with uninspiring photography and a script where the many, many lows weren't balanced by the highs. Some possible storylines weren't expanded. Interesting idea but no climax. It didn't really go anywhere and felt unfulfilled and unsatisfyingly."
NOMADLAND,11 October 2021,3/10,"A very minor film that won very big awards. Why? Who knows.Another production featuring an unidentified, unseen narrator, who throughout the film thinks we are blind, that we did not see people do things, like lighting a cigarette, opening a door, sitting down, get into a car, but feels she has to Tell us, ""He puts his hands in his packets and..."" This after you see the guy do exactly just that. What does the narrator add? Certainly not new information we would not otherwise have. Very annoying gimmick. Totally unnecessary. When the voiceover would start, I would hit the mute button. This is an Oscar winner I will never watch again .I gueds the Academy voters felt they had to give the awards to a person of color. Not to take away from the director's skill, of which I know nothing.I thought Kelly Reichardt's First Cow was superior in every respect. I really liked it. Had never seen one of her flicks before.. Marvelous story beautifully told. Emotion. First Cow touched me. This film did not.This film is so dull. It is documentary-like, about people who live the van life. I kept thinking, Americans live like that?I hope Academy voters have the fortitude to cast their votes for what they like, not for what the woke folks want them to like."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,4/10,"That's all I can really give this movie, it was shot well. I get it's a character study, but they could have put a little more effort into the story. The parts that were meant to be the story seemed very forced and unrealistic, like the whole thing with her sister. I usually like Frances work, but just acting like a normal person doing normal things (aside from the whole living on the road) just isn't really a difficult acting job and doesn't deserve all the praise. The 4 is strictly for cinematography, because this would have been better if it were just a straight documentary with a real nomad as the main character."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,9/10,"If the car is our body, then our soul is the driver. And then road is life.Some wait a lifetime for a destination - and never get on the road. Others embrace the journey with all it's unknowns and detours.In this movie - the analogy extends to Fern and her van - as she rediscovers herself in a new life outside the confines of what she's known for most her life.I loved this movie. It's soundtrack, it's cinematography, it's pace and the details of life it chose to concentrate on.Frances M is fantastic. Stoic and warm. Quirky and tough. She truly is amazingStand-out scenes for me were the swallows, the star-gazers, the young man by the fire and the father and son playing the piano together.This movie replenishes ones emotional empathy, and reminds us what makes us human. Each other."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,8/10,"One of the saddest hardest watches I've had in a long time. francis mcdormand owns the movie though david strathairn is as always wonderful, his face can tell a story alone. Looking at the people in this, some not actors you can as someone living in Europe but who worked in the States when younger you can begin to understand what happened with the Trump and all the demonstrations, violence that has engulfed its middle aged people. So much was promised, so many worked so hard, so many had nothing to show for it. Visiting New York and L.A. a few years ago I was staggered at the number of homeless people. They have just been tossed aside, a lot of them worked, payed taxes up until the mid 2000's and then it just got pulled from under them. This film in a way tells you what happens when only the dollar matters, human beings are nothing, they can import young, willing kids who will work for next to nothing. America, the land where only the rich can afford to live, where the working person gets the life force squeezed out of you and then your just tossed away, theirs a kid from Mexico who will do your job for half the price. God help us if thats coming to Europe"
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,8/10,"Deep, disturbing but also cathartic look to post recession America through the impossibly expressive face of this great actor called France McDormand. Essentially a road movie around the yearly teajectory followed by fellow nomads and a concurrent, revelatory emotional journey for the heroine. Great, if a little bit tiresome because of its realism, movie on every level."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,9/10,"Its one of those movies that lingers and makes you think about the characters for a long while after ... not least because a vast majority of the characters featured are really truly living that life. It also makes you re-assess priorities .... consider minimalism ... and ask questions that matter in life - such as - the true measure of happiness and how our acquisitive tendencies help/not help to fulfil that.The film itself is shot beautifully featuring stunning cinematography across some the most iconic natural landscapes that America has to offer. I can see tour operators dishing out 'nomadland' tours for foreign tourists in the not so distant future. Add to that Frances McDormand's faultless performance and you can't go wrong with this film. Finally, its very hard to make a movie with no real plot or a really small one at that - and Chloe and her team have managed to keep me riveted till the very end despite that. I don't normally rate ten stars but this comes close to it."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,7/10,"My thoughts on this film:
I can see how this movie is not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. I think, if you have even a remote interest in a nomad lifestyle, life on the road, extended road trips in campervans, then you would like this movie. It certainly shines a spotlight on a very small and unexplored part of society. There are actually people out there, in this day and age, who live in vans and travel around, working in different places. Who knew? And how exiting! And how lonely and intriguing. Why would someone do this? I get it, I'm adventurous, but how desolate and maybe even a little depressing. That lifestyle is certainly not for the faint of heart. You have to wonder about the mental health of some of these people, but that's in all walks of life, I suppose. And I think, in a way, that a lot of nomads are scarred in some way, and that's why they keep moving, keep trying to find themselves or something.And then there's the protagonist. Who is she and why doesn't she let people get too close to her? My only really complaint about her character is that they could have given her a little more personality.Ah, the cinematography. Simply stunning.The ending was less than satisfying.Overall, I think it was a lovely movie. I certainly thought about it for a long time afterwards. I don't feel it was best picture award-worthy, but I'm not an Academy member, so I've no say in the matter. A very solid 7 out of 10 IMDB stars from me."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,6/10,"Thanks to NSW government's dining and discovering vouchers I eventually get to enjoy this Academy Award winning movie in cinemas after a good few years. And in admiration of its winning three of the heaviest Oscar titles I have to say it is a very revealing although somehow overrated film that depicts the almost subterranean and invisible population in our world.Nomads, together with the homeless, are no new concept in our community. We either see them or hear of them in various ways, via different channels and by any means. Yet we know so little about their lives. It is all too easy to assume that they are problematic people who don't work hard to afford to live in concrete buildings. Yet this movie proves otherwise. A lot of them are decent but probably different people from us, maybe a bit eccentric - to use a word from Fern's sister in the show. It is through this film that I come to understand that going nomadic is in some way, to some extent and by some degree by choice. The fact that Fern (Frances McDormand) not once but twice rejects the offer of staying home permanently with her sister and a former fellow nomad proves so. It is fair to say that we are all creatures of habit and once we get used to one pattern it is very hard to adjust to the other especially when you reach a later age. What strikes me is that Fern cannot sleep well on a real bed inside a house and eventually sneaks into her van and feels secure in her own comfort zone.The mental health problems among nomads are an area of concern too. This population, cut off from the mainstream society, undoubtedly develops loneliness, helplessness, fear and anxiety. Dying cancer patient Swankie's conversation with Fern and fellow nomad Bob's revelation of his suicidal son serve as strong arguments. Yet nomads develop some kind of bond among them. Support yourself and help one another. Goodbyes are not final. That's what I have learned. We may bump each other again sometime down the track, and somewhere down the road.With all the goodness mentioned above this show, however, lacks A-listers, which could have been a lackluster. Yet McDormand manages to up the ante, which proves to be a success. She particularly focuses on challenging figures such as Fern in this film and Mildred in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).Having said that this film comes nowhere close to winning such big awards due to its inert plot and flat story. Artistic features of this film are kept at a bare minimum, which gives the feeling of flying no-frills Jetstar instead of full service Qantas. And I agree with other reviewers that this is somehow a boring movie. As a person of Chinese background I was somehow caught off guard that Chinese born Chloe Zhao won the Best Director which set high expectations on this show. And this finally proves to be a bit of disappointment.Perhaps we should focus on the positive note on this overrated film and wish the nomads well. The uninspiring ending script somehow reveals the soul of this movie. That is, ""Dedicated to people who had to depart. See you down the road."" Yes stay safe fellas.Just before I wrap up, the melancholy did linger around for quite some time in my mind just like a black coffee whose bitter taste stays on the tongue even after being sipped. Perhaps this is where the success of this movie lies in."
NOMADLAND,22 January 2021,8/10,This won't be everyone's cup of tea but I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't want it to end. Quite a dark film in parts but uplifting at the same time. Some of the scenery is awesome - makes you want to become a nomad for a little while.
NOMADLAND,8 July 2021,3/10,"I really don't mind a slow film with little action and lots of meaning, but unfortunately despite McDonald's amazing acting, this film really doesn't go anywhere (which, is ironic, given the title...)Regrettably, I had to give up halfway."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,10/10,"Beautiful, but sad. Depressing, yet uplifting. Emotional, but detached. Slow and engrossing. Quite simply, a masterpiece."
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,7/10,"This was a good docu-drama. I will grant that. But it did not deserve an Oscar, let alone 3. Even Charlene Swankie's performance was much better that of Frances McDormand. A lot of BS is shoved down our throats in the name of Art but when good for nothing people (critics) and Academy members join hands in such efforts, the result is 3 Oscars for Nomadland. I am disgusted."
NOMADLAND,28 May 2021,1/10,"After all the hype I decided to give it a go , it was so dull and boring I nearly fell asleep . I'm not really sure why it's been so talked about. So disappointed !"
NOMADLAND,24 July 2021,10/10,"True, deep, touching, thoughts provoking. Beautiful on any parameter."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,4/10,"I found it boring and hard to watch, how it won any awards is beyond me."
NOMADLAND,16 March 2021,9/10,"It's slow. It's VERY slow. But that's the way a story like this is supposed to go. Frances McDormand emotes just as well with her expressions as her lines. Although it plods; the viewer is able to forge an understanding of Fern even though it takes ninety minutes to delve a little further into her backstory. This is a story of loss and a desperate desire to witness the world on one's own terms. One may not abide by or agree with the lifestyle portrayed in this film, but as a story it is raw and uncompromising."
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,3/10,"Slow moving , boring plot. Wish they would have added some excitement"
NOMADLAND,10 January 2021,5/10,"It was interesting to watch, it had some moments of feeling real, the desperation and loneliness of not knowing where you belong after a life of hard work. I had a feeling some of the people were not actors but real life life nomads. The look in some of their eyes and the way they expressed themselves was honest and real, the rest of the cast (meaning the actors) were just ok as far as I am concerned, the guy from Glengarry Glen Ross who got taken by Ricky Roma and lied to by Shelly ""The Machine"" Levine before Spaceys character blows it, is equally annoying 25 or so hears later as the male friend/love interest. There are lots of scenic shots that are beautiful and if you've been to a few will instantly bring back memories of road trips and travelling roads from your past. It even has Pee Wee Herman's Dinosaur from Big Adventure, he makes another entrance after 35 yrs. Personally I would rather watch a real documentary over this, the Train Hobo Documentary Long Gone (I think?) from around 2004 and the doc on the Homeless people living in the underground of N.Y were a couple that come to mind, if I remember there might have been a couple with dogs living underground with puppies, crazy.
Long story short, watch for the scenery, I'd rather watch Fargo if I wanna connect with Frances, didn't appreciate 3 Billboards much either, boring and depressing but revenge was sweet."
NOMADLAND,16 October 2021,3/10,"Not the worst movie, I watched.But seriously best picture really?Every other movie that year was way better, so I don't see how it won except maybe with cinematography."
NOMADLAND,6 January 2021,8/10,It's wonderfully odd what memories are capable of and where it can take you. A group of ppl who found peace only in running each had its own hunter but all fighting together. I kept feeling that they just wanted their time to end without suicide and the best way was to be a traveler and I figure that someone else can find a scape in settlement. It's a good movie and yet again McDormand proves that there aint a character she cant perform
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,3/10,"They should have called it ""Lost"". There was not much story and the direction was horrible. I love Frances and even got Hulu so I could watch this. This is the worst film I ever saw her in. It was so depressing I almost hoped her character would kill herself in the end. So disappointed. I wanted it to be good. I know the area where this was filmed and have met people like this that they portray. Shame. Bad film."
NOMADLAND,5 September 2021,8/10,No there is no plot no good guys and no bad guys. It is the story of how people live this life and how they support one another and develop bonds. It is more akin to a documentary. Warm movie very well directed.
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,8/10,"There's a difference between a slow movie and a boring one. Nomadland is definitely slow, but I didn't find it boring at all. It's a deep dive into a lifestyle that most of us will never know, but many will only know. Powerful film, all around, although I would have liked to know more about Fern's character, specifically why she chooses to stay on the road after she has at least two opportunities to live under a roof. We can assume she has adjusted and enjoys the nomad lifestyle, but... does she? That seems debatable."
NOMADLAND,9 September 2021,9/10,"There are way too many negative reviews about this picture but it is noticeable that most of the reviews and its criticism are just mostly that it is boring or forgettable or no plot. To me, this is my favorite film of 2020 and I was overjoyed when it won Best Picture, it restored my faith in the Oscar, that a small-scale independent arthouse film with simplistic and minimalistic production could win major awards.The cinematography is mostly consist of natural lighting but the tweak about it fits the mood of the movie so well. This atmosphere of wandering, meditativeness overcomes our collective unconsciousness, it helps us the audience to sit right into the world and perception of Fern. The genius directing of Chloe Zhao is commendable, especially how Terrence Mallick-esque the style it, I wouldn't be surprise if Miss Zhao drew her inspiration from Mr. Mallick. Somehow, Chloe Zhao found the absolute perfect way to tell the story and paint the world of the nomad.The acting. It's unbelievable how believable all our characters are in the film. Frances McDormand made me feel like I wasn't watching an acting performance but I felt like watching firsthand a nomad. The heart of the film for me is Swankie and her monologue, it maybe to me, one of the most emotional moments in any films ever. Sometimes I think about Swankie and I'd smile. The second moment that hits me is the raw and honest conversation with Bob Wells at the end. And that's what everything about this film is, very raw, emotionally raw.As for how ""boring"" this film is. What on earth do you expect the story of a nomad's life is supposed to be told? With dramatic heaving scenes that makes you basked in suspense? With riveting thrilling storytelling? With exciting and roaring undertone? No, this is the life of a nomad. Telling it in any ""exciting"" and ""non-boring"" ways would criminally betray the realism of the story. I heard some criticism about how at least Chloe Zhao could make the film less boring by adding narration by our main protagonist. That again, would hugely betray the integrity of the story's realism. What do you think, after losing her job, house, and husband whom she adores, that a person's mind are going to be? A reservoir of poetic thoughts and insightful observations about life? No, it is numb and meditative as it can be as she goes through processing her past and ease into a healing odyssey. We the audience are behooved to see the world through the eyes of Fern in that same light. Why rely on unnecessary exposition while you could you utilize on visuals storytelling? Why wish the movie to spoon feed you with a narrating guide while you could instead watch it unfolds yourself? If anything, verbal exposition would completely and utterly destroys the movie. You don't watch Nomadland coming out of it saying, ""I ENJOYED it"" or ""that was FUN"" because it is not meant to be ""enjoyed"" or ""fun"". It is meant to be a study that provokes thoughts in you, and it's meant to be a poetic portraiture that stimulates a feeling in you.To me, the negative response to films like Nomadland shows me a lot about the modern take on cinema by contemporary viewers. When you go and see a movie, you subconsciously (not consciously) expects something INTERESTING that can wow you, we always expect deep inside that ""gee whiz"" factor in our prejudgement of a film. Our minds are too cluttered with underlying unconscious wants for a film and that disappoints us when a film can do much more. Films like Nomadland should continue to be produced and filmmakers like Chloe Zhao must be seen more and more because they defy what society expects in a film. A piece of cinematic art does not have to cater to the audience's likings, it adheres to a higher form, and that is artistic values. It is the job of the filmmaker, like any artists, to tell their story for the sake of their artistic command, not to cater to what the audience wants. Quentin Tarantino once said when his debut film Reservoir Dog was criticized by his producer for being too bloody that no one would want to watch it, ""This is my film, I made it for me, I don't care who watches it"". This same mindset must perpetuates in the film industry and audience like me will rejoice and celebrate the creative freedom that filmmakers like this brings.Lastly, I would also say that I love Nomadland due to a personal reason. The film makes me feel like I have lived this life before, the color, the journey, the encounters, the lifestyle, even though I haven't.Thank you Chloe Zhao, I watched this film by pirating it since I couldn't go to the cinema but after watching it, I paid for the film and bought it fair and square to give Chloe Zhao the money she deserves. I will defend this movie against any criticism out there even if it's the last thing I do."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,9/10,"I tried to watch this movie a month ago and couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. But tonight my wife and I were talking about the Academy Awards and I mentioned it to her. She wanted to see it so I gave it another shot. After 30 minutes we both wanted to turn it off because it's very depressing, but we stuck with it and thoroughly enjoyed it. In a weird way it's actually uplifting. Kudos to all the actors for a terrific movie."
NOMADLAND,20 November 2021,8/10,"With beautiful people in a beautiful landscape (love me some South Dakota!) Could be a heart wrenching film on corporate abuse of seasonal workers (and it is that) but it is more of a heartwarming tale of resilience, friendship, and non-conformity that tugs at the soul of anyone who wants to give into their own wanderlust. McDormand is a real gem and the local ""characters"" are just wonderful."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,1/10,"Was Captain Kirk not available? He could have really livened up this bore-fest. Maybe a few green Orion slave girls too, and some tribbles. Think of the worst episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation that you have ever seen. This is worst than that. Much worse."
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,8/10,"Chlo√© Zhao did a great job with this movie, the cenarios, the story, everything is incredibly beautiful. And Frances McDormand is great, taking us in her journey through laughter, pain, happiness, heartbreak, a trip in search of some kind of closure in a life filled with solitude.The main character doesn't care about money, or a stable job, or friends. She's just holding on to memories of a happier life, that is her way of grieving.Nomadland is a showcase for how sometimes people just need to wander from place to place in search of something that can fill the void of what they lost."
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,10/10,"What? No sex...no swearing...no violence...no drugs ...no anger...how could anything be worth watching with none of those things? But I watched Nomadland anyway and at the end I said out loud Wow!!!You have to understand that this film is not for people whose social circle is just bobbing around the shallowest end of society's pool. It's not for people who have the attention span of a 2-year-old.Nomadland is for those special people who have lived awhile and experienced terrible loss of some kind and who have found a way to survive. It's a movie about an independent, self-reliant woman who is alone but not necessarily lonely.Nomadland is bleak, austere and melancholic at times but it is never boring.Nomadland is a glimpse into a world few people see and will ever live and that alone is reason to watch it...if there's any justice in this universe Frances McDormand will be remembered at Oscar time. WOW!!"
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,10/10,"Watching this movie made me so aware of all the things I've yet to do. The beauty I overlook and disregard, the days that melt into one another without realization of sunsets lost. Whether it's by choice, circumstance, luck, or tragedy..Whatever you call it, the layers sometimes become so complex and so dense, before we know it life itself has happened. Is happening. Do we merely exist as feckless wanderers? Almost unaware of time passing or do we become active participants living and breathing the moment we are existing in?This is what this movie meant to me. Fern took something inside of me and made it feel real; the courage to overcome fear and step into the vast unknown and embrace it. Watching the road stretch out into the mountains of the great American west, seeing it all so raw for the first time was transformative. It felt like I could close my eyes and be there..windows down and wind in my hair..arm waving in time to the subtle soundtrack of a favorite composer and pianist of mine, Ludovico Einaudi. Like I too could take tragedy and find beauty in it.This is the lovely escapism I found in Fern. A film that let me glimpse a life outside of my own chronic illness and feel free, uncaged. And for that, I say thank you. To everyone involved in this film, I wish you could have seen this through my eyes. It was blurry at times thanks to tears, but it was beautiful. So very beautiful."
NOMADLAND,16 March 2021,8/10,"Nomadland tries to outline what a nomad's life looks like in the USA of the XXI century. Moreover, since the main character is a woman, it shows how a lot more strengths and courage she must summon to overcome all the difficulties of such life in comparison with men: doing physically demanding work; being on her own and counting only on herself to defend herself and her scarce but dear property; learning fast how to mend her car, upon which her survival is so dependent, etc.Needless to say, that all these activities must be displayed in a very genuine manner, and that's what Frances McDormans demonstrates: she plays as if the whole action was indeed a part of her own biography - so lively and authentic. Further so, the whole movie feels very natural to the degree when it appears like an encyclopedia for those planning to become nomads or unexpectedly facing such circumstances. Apart from its authenticity the movie is just staggeringly beautiful featuring breathtaking views of the USA's nature from distinct climate zones and seasons.Finally, the work also portrays people and their social interactions while being in the wild nature of American roads: how they spend time together, what discuss and help each other, how remember one another. This all gives a great deal of hope for human beings: we are still a communal species; we cannot only take but give as well, and that together we are capable of coping with every mess in our lives.However, the movie is not for everyone. Slowly paced narration and lots of contemplative scenes might scare some spectators used to more actively told stories. On the other hand, it's a good choice for those willing to empathize and jump into the emotional world of American roads, landscapes and their eternally moving real inhabitants."
NOMADLAND,17 September 2020,10/10,"Frances is just catwalk entire the movie, which is good"
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,8/10,"Loved this movie. Frances is as always amazing.
Great story about freedom. Very poetic."
NOMADLAND,14 February 2021,8/10,"""Nomadland""
Following the economic collapse of a company town in rural Nevada, Fern (Frances McDormand) packs her van and sets off on the road exploring a life outside of conventional society as a modern-day nomad. ""Nomadland"" features real nomads Linda May, Swankie and Bob Wells as Fern's mentors and comrades in her exploration through the vast landscape of 'The American West'
A sweeping panoramic portrait of 'The American' nomadic spirit set on the trail of seasonal migratory labor, ""Nomadland"" is a road movie for our times, now doubly relevant and resonant in this moment of redefinition and change. We see the grandeur of 'The American West', from 'The Badlands' of South Dakota to 'The Nevada Desert', to 'The Pacific Northwest', through the eyes of 61-year old Fern. Fern is a woman who has lost a husband and in fact her whole former life, when the mining town where she lived is essentially dissolved. But in her process, she gains strength and a new life. Fern finds her community in the nomad gatherings she attends which include Linda May and Swankie (real life nomads who play themselves), closer companionship with Dave (David Strathairn), and along with others she meets on her journey. But most importantly, in nature, as she evolves, in the wilderness, in rocks, trees, stars, a hurricane, this is where she finds her independence. The film incorporates non-actors and have them be themselves in the moment, then Fran has to somehow be herself in the moment as well, because she couldn't know what they're going to do. That's why the film has so much of her in the character. It's a way to make practical things that you need, things for bartering on the road. A big part of Fern's evolution is learning to live with nature. Living in a van, she becomes increasingly more exposed to nature, it's beauty and hostility, it's ability to replenish and to heal. The sound design is very important to the film and is tailored to the very different specific landscapes Fern travels through. The film keeps the sound design true to the soundscapes of the places where Fern finds herself.
This film is based on the non-fiction book 'Nomadland: Surviving America In The 21st Century' by Brooklyn writer Jessica Bruder. The book is a work of investigative journalism and each chapter has a different topic. Half of the book focuses on nomadic living, and the other half is actually undercover reporting. Men come and go, cities rise and fall, whole civilizations appear and disappear; the earth remains, slightly modified. The earth remains, and the heartbreaking beauty where there are no hearts to break. We sometimes choose to think, no doubt perversely, that man is a dream, thought an illusion, and only rock is real. Rock and sun. We've always been deeply drawn to the open road, an idea we find to be quintessentially American; the endless search for what's beyond the horizon. The film captures a glimpse of it, knowing it's not possible to truly describe 'The American Road' to another person. One has to discover it on one's own.
The film uses the classically male/'Western' genre tropes to tell a more universal story of triumph over adversity and the will to survive and adjust one's dreams. There's been this promise made to the baby boomer generation, that if they just did 'X', 'Y', and 'Z', it would all work out by the time they got to retirement age. Clearly that didn't happen and isn't happening. The safety net has ripped, and many people are now falling through it. It's like 'The Titanic's' going down. And this situation dovetails with the tradition of rugged American individualism. Many of these people who are finding themselves forced into this sort of life are discovering an independence and a new sense of themselves. Beholden to only themselves for the first time in their lives. It's inspiring, complicated, of course, in the way that so much in America is so layered and complicated right now. These are people who are redefining 'The American Dream'. The film grapples with this idea of 'The American Dream', and seeing it from a fresh perspective. ""Nomadland"" enters this world, explores a unique American identity; the true nomad. Being a 'Nomad' is a choice, not a circumstance.written by Gregory Mann"
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,8/10,"You have to seriously ponder if the laundromat all over north America or elsewhere like 7-11 not exist at all, how the life of a nomad would become even tougher. There are maybe too many needs that would be the essentials to live as a nomad in America, first, you got to have a still drivable car, better a van, not bicycle to make your nomad life possible. Then comes the Paper money, no matter how little, at least you can afford to fill up the gas tank, do the basic repairs of the car. Then toilet paper, even you could solve the natural calls in the wildness, you still need it to wipe clean after it. There are more essential things to mention, but I think LAUNDROMAT is also a must for your nomad lifestyle. If you got a car that could provide you with sleep needs, you could claim that you are a nomad, not a homeless. Therefore, you need the convenient laundromat whenever you need to clean your daily wears inside out. The laundromat would be so important and critical for a nomad but not for the homeless. That's why we have seen this nomad woman spent lot of her time in the laundromat awaiting her clothes to be washed, cleaned and dried.
That's also an essential scene kept appeared in this quite dreary film.Anyway, if you could still boast that we Americans are living in the richest country of the world after you've watched this film, you are either really rich or, you're just a complete moron."
NOMADLAND,12 June 2021,7/10,"I'm not sure how I feel about this movie.I definitely enjoyed it and liked the story overall. Zhao did an exceptional job and McDormand gave a powerful performance.I'm not sure how accurately it portrayed the people who follow or had to follow this type of lifestyle and I guess that's why I'm not sure of my feelings.Nonetheless, it's an out of the ordinary movie!"
NOMADLAND,12 August 2021,7/10,"My sense reading the other reviews here is that people ascribe way too much meaning to this film or are upset it was soooo slow and seemingly pointless. There is no attempt to delve deeply into her previous life. The the focus on day to day menial tasks and relationships that are simultaneously warm and at the same time ephemeral seem to be quite realistic to me. The only insight into her soul comes at the very end during a very short soliloquy where she says that she ""stayed for him"" referring to her husband and the way she felt imprisoned by lower middle class living-planted in one place. This is also shown in her wistful description and satisfaction over being the last house in her town and that her back porch had a vista view of absolutely nothing as far as you could see. Instead of a deep philosophical display of angst and a lost purpose we get the only look into who she is through the soliloquy and by the way she walks through her desolate former town and walks through her old empty house and disappears into the vast nothingness out back that she viewed (with deep longing) her whole adult life. This part of the movie explained the rest of the movie by making it obvious (to me) that she was drawn to the nomad life instead of driven to it."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,8/10,"#nomadland is more like an experience rather than a film, it's contagious and flirtious....getting on the road is the perfect solution for this corporate chaos we created , I fee the 70's zipsy era is coming back, back to the review.It's a straight forward ,Frank narration, can be hard on impatient viewers but it's what it is frank and true.
The performance in this film cannot be creat by the best artists around this all the living people with their lives and evidence.Ones again #francesmcdormand just lived it through .This movie will give some people deja vu of #intothewild movie these kind of movie will give it ,because it's the surrel experience that cannot be altered for entertainment.A peace born out of chaos .#movies #moviereview #movienight #nomads #nomadland #nomad #gypsy #roadtrip #van #travel .P.S.Only for people with patience."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,4/10,There is nothing special about this movie just boring drama with no msg.
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,8/10,"I wanted to see this movie because of Frances McDormand and all the accolades associated with this film. It's more like a documentary. My husband fell asleep meanwhile I was hoping Fern would take a chance on Dave. But I guess it was more realistic and Fern just wanted to drift along on her own. I suspect from what her sister says she was always a bit odd or
independent. Fern and her husband moved away from family in the earlier years.People are like the character she portrayed. Some people just dont particularly like mainstream although Fern had no choice after her husband died. Not a happy movie but I like Francis McDormand and her brave, raw performance."
NOMADLAND,26 May 2021,7/10,"Boring is perhaps the biggest insult you can give to a movie. And this movie is just that. Boring. Beautifully filmed and acted. And that's about it. 45 minutes in and I could barely catch up on what was happening. Because it was too fast? No, because it was way too slow.Perhaps my brain is just too small to understand these films? I don't know."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,8/10,"Despite it has not a great plot, its intensity, emotional depth and, at the same time, quiet, stunned me.Amazing Chlo√© Zhao and Frances McDormand.The Academy Awards are richly deserved."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,5/10,"This movie has more to do with depression, grief management and mental illness than it does with the nomad life. I thought it was well acted and well paced for the subject matter... which as I said was really depression, grief management and mental illness. You might feel at least two of those three after watching it."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,10/10,"No. 1. It's a movie
No. 2. It's a very good movie.No. 3 It's a very different movie
No. 4 THAT is what I like about it.No. 5 There were no explosions, no computer graphics, no super heroes
no zombies and nobody had their butt exposed.It reminded me of the Ma Joad and family hitting the road during bad times.I could feel for these people. I did not judge them.I enjoyed watching their story. Skillfully done.I will watch it again."
NOMADLAND,20 July 2021,4/10,"I watched this expecting to love it like everyone else seemed to, but I really didn't.I'll start with the good. The movie looks beautiful. There are so many shots in this movie where I was pausing the movie just so I could look at the shot longer. The acting is solid and I loved how they used actual Nomads as some of the actors. It gives a sense of realism that you wouldn't get with professional actors. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. Now the bad....The characters are dull. The main character is okay but basically every other character is just boring. This is mostly due to the fact that 75% of the characters are only in the movie for about 10 minutes before disappearing.They try to show the life of a Nomad but I felt like they showed all the wrong things. They literally have a 40 second scene of Fern taking an explosive crap. How was that necessary? Instead of spending time putting sounds in my head that I'll never get out, spend time showing actual things Nomads do and not just how they use the bathroom. They do show a good amount of things Nomads do and how they live, but they almost always choose the wrong things to show.The story wasn't the best either. It was simple and interesting enough to get me invested, but once I got halfway through the movie I just got bored with it. Nothing really happens and it's just a bunch of things happened. Other movies do this as well, but those movies always have a moment that makes the build up pay off. With Nomadland, the build up goes nowhere.Another thing I noticed is that they rarely go into depth on why Fern is actually a Nomad and how she feels about her husband's death and having to leave her home. They explain it and mention it a couple of times but they never go into depth about how she feels. They had potential for good character development but completely waste it.Nomadland is a beautiful and simple movie, but it's boring story and shallow characters make it hard to finish watching."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,8/10,"This film navigates some of the same thematic and conceptual terrain as movies like Wendy & Lucy, About Schmidt, Into the Wild and Wild. The escape-from-a-normal-life-to-discover-oneself narrative is a tried-and-true one, which has been explored many times over the decades, both better and worse than Nomadland does it.So the idea itself isn't original, but the ""freshness"" that Chloe Zhao brings to the table here is that she sheds light on a specific subculture of people at a specific location that actually exists in the United States in large numbers. Fern's story isn't unique, and that's what Zhao is trying to tell us here. In its own way, this nomadic existence is just as systematic as living in a house and working a 9-to-5. There are support groups, RV camps, community meals, even a Youtube guru to guide Fern and her peers through the whole process. Some even maintain regular jobs. I observed the popularity of this way of life first-hand when I lived for three years in Las Vegas, Nevada (the same state that much of this film is set in). You don't even have to leave the city of Vegas to notice the impressive number of HUGE RV parks strewn throughout. Even within the city limits, along Boulder Highway at the southeast end of Vegas for instance, there are not one, not two, but seemingly about 10 different RV parks, and they all seemed almost full. And those only contain the people who navigated into town and decided to settle there. Outside Vegas along the desert highways you can see more RV parks scattered around. That vast desert area of the nation truly is a ""nomadland"" for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of people, many of them entire families. They have their own shops, markets and bars that cater to them.Fern repeatedly says during the movie that she isn't homeless, merely houseless. At no point does she ever think of herself as homeless, and neither should the audience. The families living in the actual RV parks don't call themselves homeless either. For them, and for Fern, this is simply another way of life, and a completely valid one. Like Fern's sister, and like the lady with her two daughters that Fern runs into near the beginning of the movie, our own judgments on such a way of life depends entirely on the preconceptions we ourselves bring. Zhao depicts the material without editorializing, as if a documentary crew simply decided to follow McDormand/Fern around for awhile. By the end, we have to form our own opinions on whether it would be for us or not.Let's discuss the style, which is the best thing about the movie. Zhao's technical filmmaking is brilliant here, and if nothing else, even if the movie itself isn't the most moving or entertaining, at the very least she did deserve winning Best Director. She edited the film herself as well (for which she was rightly nominated), and the rhythm and pacing are meticulous from start to finish. The cinematography is consistently beautiful, and the use of music excellent and tasteful. All of those audio-visual factors combine into a lyrical, poetic, meaningful work of art that was obviously put together in very careful fashion.The script and structure are interesting, and for some viewers it will work completely, while for others it may be disappointing. I mentioned that this is immersive in a docudrama sort of way, as if a documentary crew just followed the protagonist around. But it's more than that. It's like this documentary crew didn't want to tell the viewer any background information about the character or her life, and didn't want to use any extraneous narration or hold the audience's hands. We just jump right into the plot as Fern loses her factory job, and as the film moves along, crucial details only become apparent to us almost in passing. Even though this is indeed a movie centered around conversations, the storytelling itself is show-not-tell, and that's the most impressive feat Zhao performs here.Frances McDormand herself is sensational, well deserving of her Oscar by completely embodying this fragile individual as she navigates a new, late, unexpected chapter of life. I said that this was almost like watching a documentary, and a large part of that is due to McDormand's naturalistic performance. If it wasn't for the fact that the actress has a really unique look, one could easily forget that they're watching a professional, and instead following an actual Nevadan of middle-age who was recently laid off. The character of Fern teeters ever-so-carefully along the boundaries between optimism and despair, loneliness and independence, surety and doubt. Every moment you see her face, you can tell that a million conflicting thoughts are probably going through her mind. McDormand's eyes and body language speak multitudes.So what held this back? Well, it simply wasn't quite transcendent to me, not as deeply poignant as the hype led me to believe, or that the writing seemed to be leading towards. When I think back to the film, I can't put my finger on anything I would specifically change. But even though the filmmaking here was immaculate, the overall experience still felt dry to me. I think Zhao was attempting a sort of profound epiphany when Fern decided not to stay with Dave and his family, remaining a nomad instead. But when she made that seemingly crucial decision, I didn't really feel anything. Because of the way she was performed by McDormand and written by Zhao, I never had any questions about whether she would stay with Dave or not. It was quite clear by then, during the whole movie really, that Fern was never going to be tied down to one spot again. So what exactly were we supposed to feel when she hit the road near the end? It wouldn't be such an issue if Zhao presented this segment in the same matter-of-fact tone as most of the film. But instead, the director seemed to want that part to be the cathartic peak of the film, evidenced by the way she used such evocative editing and music as Fern drove away. But since there was no suspense leading up to Fern's decision, I wanted the movie to get those scenes over with, and move on to Fern's next experience. What I'm saying is that this movie was predictable, and while not all movies are required to be unpredictable, a deliberately paced drama of self discovery should be. If a filmmaker is going to ask us to be patient and follow along with our full attention, leave us some questions until the very end, anything to keep our interest in the narrative. Unfortunately, about 2/3s of the way through the film, we already pretty much know how it's going to end. There is no danger of death, and Fern is never going to settle down again. The conclusion plays out exactly like we knew it would: she continues her journey through Nomadland.I have a feeling my opinion might improve upon further viewings, so I'm open to a rating bump in the future. This seems to be the type of movie that will age well, a script that will work better a second and third time."
NOMADLAND,8 August 2021,4/10,"So, was this boring, plodding movie actually nominated for an Academy Award? I was expecting something really good and instead felt like I wasted 2 hours and $7. I couldn't help but compare this movie to ""Into the Wild"" which is a far superior movie and in some ways almost seems like a crossover. The kid the main character runs into a couple of times in ""Nomadland"" could be Christopher McCandless, the tragic young guy who dies a lonely death in the wilds of Alaska.I really didn't care about the main character in this movie. She seemed like a bit of a moron. If you haven't seen ""Into the Wild,"" skip this boring, dragging, overrated piece of crap and watch that instead."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,10/10,Frances proved her brilliance yet again is this feel-good travel genre cinema... must watch for travelers out there or who wants to travel ... this movie is gonna stay in my mind for few years ... one of a kind... makes me smile and look at my life in a different way
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,1/10,"Okay, so Hollywood is going to fix Anti-Asian bias in the US by giving this film Two Oscars?? But this story of aging, white Americans who have ended up living out of vans and campers wandering around western America made no sense until I realized it was made for Chinese audiences. I was wondering why all the nomads vehicles were painted white and found that in China the color white represents death and decay; Chinese wear white to funerals. Hence all the white vehicles of the elderly nomads would make sense to Chinese viewers while most of us westerners wouldn't notice. Would have to translate reviews from Chinese papers to have a clue as to what this is really about, but it certainly isn't the reality of homelessness in America. Its some sort of an art film dream state...Have to get the directors commentary blue ray..."
NOMADLAND,10 March 2021,8/10,What a beautiful movie with exceptional direction and performances. Great acting. Amazing soundtrack with soothing composition. And the stories of different characters is simply brilliant.
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,10/10,"The atmosphere of this film just stays with you for a long afterwards. It is just a wonderful story with flawed characters & showing older people living a different, transient kind of life. There is happiness & heartbreak along the way. The cinematography & music is hypnotic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Highly recommended."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,5/10,"So Golden Globe winner, Academy Award nominee, artistic, visionary, blah, blah, blah. Its the same old sh... It is everything but entertaining. Its Roma in English. Maybe I just don't get it."
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,6/10,"I loved Chlo√©'s previous film, The Rider.
But this movie tries to be more of the same without succeeding. All the time trying to be liked. With eternal moments of sunsets and sunrises. The Rider is much rounder and without professional actors.
I think this movie is being given more importance than it deserves. Only by who distributes it. A great filmmaker that unfortunately the industry is wanting to eat. Not for nothing does the media overrate this movie. Chlo√©'s direct future in the Marvel universe. A shame She had become someone to follow. A beautiful example of a new cinema that is much more human than the trash that Hollywood is subjecting us to.
A huge loss for auteur cinema that is sorely lacking."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,4/10,"It was clearly not a year for quality films if this was rated best picture!To put it plainly; Slow, Uninteresting and Weak.I'll always appreciate a movie with depth and meaning but always hope to see a balance of entertainment, this failed to satisfy either category.Not worth the watch and quite frankly, makes a joke of the Oscars."
NOMADLAND,3 April 2021,9/10,"Nomadland has a simple premise and delivers on it.It gives you as the viewer, a fairly intimate insight into the life of people who got crushed by societial expectations and the global economic recession. Every nomad has a different story, trying to find themselves in the ambiguity of life - where most of them didn't have another choice but to depart and live in their van.I loved the scenery and the raw power of being connected to Nature. It's about living the simpler life, even though it's more difficult at times.It challenges your perspective of freedom especially in these lockdown times. Are you ever truly free? Or are you constantly limited by ""the human condition"" and the boxed life you identify with? There is no one true answer, and I guess it depends on your perspective."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,9/10,"It's a real entertaining. If you like this movie means you having a really good taste in movies, this is not for all."
NOMADLAND,30 May 2021,7/10,"Well you get what you pay for.I like that actrice ( actor Ok!? ) from Missippi Burning and have not seen her much since then in fact, she seems type cast as tragic.Some great performances no doubt and thought provoking which makes a change."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,3/10,Why this won the oscars I find difficult to see why .However the sound track is great. Perhaps I'm missing the point. Is America the richest country or the poorest.
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,10/10,"Nomadland
The wonder of this movie is the journey the main character goes through. It's about why matters in life, and certainly there is a strong Zen philosophy about happiness.The story reflects and questions what is important in life: comfort, possessions, control, security, jobs, needs, depth of relationships etc in order to be happy.It deals with the way we see and manage loss, our attachments and suffering through the eyes of Fern the main character and the people she finds in her path.It's a visual ride between the movement and stagnancy of life and how we decide to look at it: as tragedy, a blessing; or perhaps just a road to travel.This is an amazing opportunity to ponder about our purpose in life, what we do for others, how we adapt and surrender our ego, our real beliefs opposed to social constructs and religious beliefs.As well the unity with nature and existence, being true to oneself, and our respect to life and the universe.The nomads, these seemingly outsiders who move around, a culture and life outside the standards, show a very vast world outside the centralized cookie cutter lives we are used to see and experience.Poetic and smooth, deep and true without the need of gimmicks or special effects, a wonderful story, magnificent cinematography , and pure fine and honest acting."
NOMADLAND,17 May 2021,5/10,Jk! It isn't! Zhao's direction and the cinematography is stunning. McDormand is good. But... Nothing happens.
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,8/10,"You probably already know this if you are reading this review, but Nomadland is about a widow who lives in a van and struggles financially to continue living in her van without turning to friends and family for financial support. That is the plot of this movie from beginning to end. If you can enjoy that plot for what it is, then you will love this movie because of the lush cinematography that really brings you into that world. If you are looking for something more than this bare outline of a plot, you will be disappointed. It's not like there is a bank robbery or murder to serve as a major, climactic plot device other than this woman's struggles. The movie progresses along through a series of subtle plot reveals that highlight the realities of someone living this type of nomadic lifestyle. Appreciate this movie for what it is, rather than depreciating it for what it is not, and you will enjoy it."
NOMADLAND,8 April 2021,6/10,"As a fellow van-dweller and film freak I don't want to critique this movie to death- because this is exactly what the film industry needs more of. But I can't help but to feel that this film was a bit one dimensional. It's kind of like the storyline of ""About Schmidt"" meets the temperament of ""All Is Lost"".I love the idea of exposing the world to vanlife and how, as Steinbeck best put it, ""they wanted to go, to move about, free and unanchored, not toward something but away from something. I saw this look and heard this yearning everywhere in every states I visited. Nearly every American hungers to move."" ""Into The Wild"" has captured that feeling the best, for different reasons, but the silence of ""Nomadland"" often felt forced or uninteresting. The existential problems she was facing were so internalized. Perhaps like ""All Is Lost"", this kind of movie may just not fit the rhythm of my emotions, because clearly people have enjoyed both.It was halfway between wanting to be a documentary and a film. Making the non-actors deliver lines was often transparent and discount Lubezki seemed to have left the camera rolling while McDormand often forgot to stay in character- or perhaps she was still in character but the influence of snakes and alligators to evoke emotion from a rather expressionless character always felt inauthentic. It was an interesting experiment, I'm so glad it was made, but I'm not sure if Zhao's predictable beat editing (as well as the inattention to trimming heads and tails of clips) gave the viewers anything other than what they expected."
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,5/10,"I thought this movie was going to be very good initially, but it never really shares a point or significantly interesting purpose throughout the story other than this is what it must be like to live in a van down by many rivers. The bm scene too was just unnecessary & it being real & spontaneous just makes it all that much more pointless.I'm usually that guy who generously scores above the averages for most movies, but for this & Minari to be the more acclaimed of movies (personally don't understand how either have a higher score than ""News of the World"" or ""The Little Things"" to me, meant more & is placed far higher in comparison to this movie. Then again,a year in a pandemic, how many good movies can we expect to spend $20 & watch at home?"
NOMADLAND,30 June 2021,8/10,"Its not exactly a jolly film :) , it dwells in & is embedded in small town, half empty america, and the struggles there-it, in, for those living by choice or lack of as drifters in the hinterland of the economy, eeking a way through, but freer than most, It was well acted generally, the lead actor felt awkward at times, but her character is awkward, so I guess thats fine, this underlying tone plays on the idea, that some don't choose relationships, instead they clutch to the sadness in their lives and commune and drink too deep of empty places, the sorrowed sunsets that speak of a life faded and the draw & mystery of misty liminal dawns, and in the end, those who are drawn to keep moving, somehow become captive to that moving, and cannot be pulled back into relationships and love or the socialised norms. Money and its lack is felt, but its not the purpose of their existence, something else unattainable, is always calling in us all. The film is generally disquieting but moving, life in the small lives led on the peripherary, we so want people and these characters to be happy, but we know thats not how it is, or can be for everyone. And how they have to handle the inevitable lone end ... with grace. American backwater poetry."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,8/10,"Beautifully directed and acted, well deserved Oscar winning performance from both lead and director.Powerful and thought provoking."
NOMADLAND,18 July 2021,8/10,"I don't think this movie main theme is nomadland.It is about life with PTSD or after something bad happen, and how everything becomes meaningless.And the only cheers you can find in nature, animals.Last music and car moving to the wild are very powerful.Good movie, but if you didn't experience real pain morally you probably won't get it."
NOMADLAND,21 June 2021,1/10,"When ""Nomadland"" came out, there was a lot of Oscar buzz about it being ""fantastic"" and ""amazing"". I saw the trailer and it felt like it was focusing more on the scenery instead of the story. I saw the movie and it was so boring. Frances Mcdormand deserved her Academy Award in ""Three Billboards"". But for this movie? The studio or her husband bought it. She showed little emotion in the sad scenes, there were way too many tracking shots that dragged the film which felt more like a student film than an actual movie and it was the most boring movie I ever saw since ""2001: A Space Odyssey, Arrival and The Last Airbender"". I know Cartoon Saloon's ""Wolfwalkers"" wasn't nominated but that should have got Best Picture and Spike Lee had way better direction in ""Da 5 Bloods"". All I can say to Chloe Zhao is don't mess up Marvel's Eternals. This movie is not giving me a lot of hope that she's the right director for an anticipated movie of this year. In conclusion, it's boring. Don't watch it. It was just waste of film and Viola Davis was so snubbed for ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom""."
NOMADLAND,6 July 2021,7/10,"It's literally a love later to America, I loved that movie so much. Chlo√© Zhao really did a good job capturing ""nature's emotion"" you literally could feel the connection through her eyes and having real life nomads acting they own self was just genius plus having Frances McDormand acting her through this masterpiece was just a wonder to watch. It open our eyes in a whole new world we maybe didn't know existed and makes us think about our work system how we're being used from the day we can work till the day we can't without even be able to earn a proper retirement.One of the thing I liked most about this movie was the going with the flow lifestyle, paying attention to all little details just to find some hidden beauty and all the relationship you get to experience was just wonderful it reminds me of Into the wild which is a movie I really liked too...see you down the road!!!"
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,6/10,"I really really wanted to love this film! Francis McDormand is a phenomenal actress in everything! The fact of a movie revolving around someone losing everything during the recession is powerful. Throughout the movie I enjoyed the performances and idea of the film, because this really happened. Unfortunately the movie is way too slow and honestly boring to invest in for myself. My parents love movies like this on a daily basis and I decided to watch it. We all looked at each other in disbelief because we felt mislead. Only thing great in this film is the actors. See it to see it, but seriously this isn't the best film or anything it could've been so much better! I don't understand reviews lately, they're completely off!"
NOMADLAND,12 April 2021,10/10,A sole searching look into the life of a women dealing with being on her own traveling from place to place in her campervan making friends and struggling with loneliness and life in general!!
NOMADLAND,26 August 2021,6/10,"I heard they are planning a prequel where Fern still has long hair, where the camera is not so shaky and there is actually a plot.Looking forward to that one!"
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,10/10,An excellent film when sometimes less is more important tells the story of the nomadic existence but with a lot of beauty tells the story of an woman in an RV roaming around the USA. But very well directed and acted. There's a little bit more to it than this but watch the film and find out for yourself.
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,8/10,"A film that does not try to do anything but point the lense at real people living real lives. They are the story. Promised so much by the American dream. These wholesome, hard working people, chewed up and spat out by a country that lost its way. Greatest country in the world, yet so many people are just about getting by. Wonderful performance from FD who is so authentic, and believable as always.I think It's always worth remembering that despite many countries having truly repulsive governments representing them (I certainly include the UK in this). That there are some really nice harmless people on this planet that never had a chance.Film won't be too everyone's tastes obviously. But if you have an active interest in the world, and don't mind watching films that make you think/reflect on the real circumstances of others, then this one might be for you.What's the film about? Socialism being the only way we can dig ourselves out of this mess clearly."
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,7/10,This movie definitely does a good job of immersing you in the world of being a nomad. One of the best things about it is the performances it gets from the real-life nomads who are in this movie. What's interesting though is that as it goes on it is less about this nomad life and more about one person's grief from losing her husband. It was very frustrating at times watching Fern say no to opportunities at a more stable life. I did like the fact that no one in this movie was a bad person. There are moments where you think something bad will happen but it doesn't. Everyone is looking out for each other. It's not the type of movie I would watch again but it's worth seeing once.
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,9/10,"Frances McDormand is Endearing as a Wandering Nomad Displaced by the American Recession: ""Nomadland,"" directed by Chlo√© Zhao (""The Rider""), written by Zhao, based on the book by Jessica Bruder, follows the story of Fern, played by the once again brilliant, 2-time Oscar-winner, Frances McDormand, a woman forced to become a Nomad after the losses of her job in 2011 at a shut down factory in Nevada, her home, death of her husband and the town she lived in wiped off the map, all painful misfortunes, the results of the American Recession. Fern buys a van, which she customizes as her new home, and wanders the West in a constant search for work, including taking a seasonal job with other Nomads boxing packages at a large Amazon distribution center. The beauty in Chlo√© Zhao's direction is her ability to play on realism by mixing actors in the film with non-actors who manage to give equally gritty performances. Joshua James Richards, Zhao's Cinematographer, is truly an artist, capturing the breathtaking landscape of the American West, using his camera to paint an alluring palette of the stark Arizona desert, ominous mountains, long, winding, cold and lonely roads, powerful Pacific coastline, the Redwood Forest and glorious sunrises and sunsets."
NOMADLAND,13 June 2021,4/10,"I agree that this movie has something to watch till the end. Even if some part is too slow, some part is too boring.. but ok, I watch it till the end.Picture is somewhat beautiful in some part, but it cant be compare with other movie with great view, it cant even compare with national geographic
and the storyline, is so slow pace.. slow till.. hey nothing in this movie at all, I didn't learn anything new in this movie, anything.After all it take 3 oscars? Omg.My opinion 4/10."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,8/10,"Based on Jessica Bruder's non-fiction book on vandwellers in the US, Nomadland is, at first, a bleak landscape of white, mournful snow as Fern (Frances McDormand) loses her husband and job at the US Gypsum plant as the 2011 economic recession comes uprooting livelihoods, lives, and towns in its wake. In one fell sweep, she's lost all she'd accumulated so far, all the material possessions that, in their familiarity, breed security. It's a funny thing about how we construct our physical and emotional cocoons around the things we possess. It's a deep, stirring construct that transcends the cold business transaction behind it all. We pay for our houses, fill them up with things we need and more often, with what we don't. We construct our memories and nostalgic albums around these physical paraphernalia. And when we lose our loved ones and our loved possessions, that sense of security is upended, as we're sucked into the tornado of helplessness and directionlessness. Where and how we land is incumbent upon what we do when we're up there in the ruthless spin-and-tumble of uncertainty, no bearings or support to guide us any longer.Fern lands as hard as anyone would. All she knows is Empire, Nevada, is no longer economically viable, and what guides her is the compass of the next meal and of survival. Stashing away those physical belongings, including her late husband's clothes in a storage unit, selling most those emotional-security bonds off which she buys a van, she drives toward a that's one of self-discovery and for us, an eye-opening treatise on the concept of homelessness and the accompaniment heartbreak and hope. Writer-director Chlo√© Zhao creates a ruminating docu-style drama as Fern enters the world of vandwellers. It's a world inhabited by run-down folks who've lost all the sheen that life once had to offer and are now covered with the scrag and dust of the road that's both a lifeline and an unending tarmac of struggle and self-reliant living. Using real-life dwellers as the cast (including Linda May, Charlene Swankie, and Bob Wells) to color the initial snowed-in canvas, director Zhao shifts to warmer climes and tones, even as the hand-held camera work offers hand-holding hope in the kinetic lives of itinerants, a world where everyone retires into their own van-homes at night, retiring after slogging away as temps and contributing to the cycle of economic recovery. And there's the bitter irony. Cogs in the capitalist machine, Zhao's houseless (not homeless) get by, as they build those emotional blankets for others, every online click-to-order an emotional catharsis for all of us who stress-shop to distract ourselves.And yet amidst it all, Nomadland offers fire-camp sparks of hope. There's a community out there, a well-knit family that's made pretty much the same choices off a list of hopeless ones. Where do you spend your next tranche of money? The mortgage or fuel for your van? Your insurance or the next supply of canned food? And Frances McDormand channelizes all these questions, their uneasy answers, and the grit and grind of such a life across her face. Her mouth can set to a firm fight, droop just that bit, the lines that she can move with a twitch or cast in tragic despair. Her Fern is on an expedition self-discovery and affirmation, one that she probably began much before her current world unravelled. Of what she wants from life and what she wants to get from it. Does she settle into another willow of security that fellow-vandweller Dave (a fantastic as usual David Strathairn) offers so tantalizingly? A glimpse that she gets into what life could be again. Familiarity, as she knows by now, is a seductive and heartbreaking devil.Fern's journey is almost spiritual at one level, that of self-discovery, and director Zhao stirs you with her take along with composer Ludovico Einaudi's solo, poignant piano pieces. And as all transcendent roads go, her path involves deterging as she embarks on this peripatetic venture that's as much physical as it is of the soul. At various stages in the movie, McDormand bravely goes through three allegorical stages of cleansing onscreen. She urinates the first time, in a furtive, embarrassed way, by the road, having just begun her travels, anxious and uncertain of what and who lie ahead. Later, inside the van, she takes a dump, cringing the next moment at what's been stewing inside her. And finally, stark naked, much like an enlightened and lightened spirit, takes a dip in clean, flowing water. She knows what it means to be bound down by emotional plugs and holes. She's also calculated the price of being alone."
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,3/10,"One of the worst movies Ive ever watched. If there is a prize this movie deserves, that would be ""The most overrated movie of all time"". Just because Macdormand is the wife of Joel Coen, doesn't mean that she deserves an Oscar for this role."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,1/10,"Overrated garbage. It seems only dull movies are awarded Oscars. Nothing happened in this yawn-fest. Save your time, and avoid. Go to YouTube and watch vlogs by real people that live in vans instead. Or, watch a documentary, but this movie is just nothing. Worthless nothingness.This movie lacked a story. No beginning. No middle. No end. No creativity. Just a woman living in a van, being boring doing nothing."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,7/10,"This movie is done in a biographical/documentary sort of way so we see things through the eyes of a nomad played by Frances McDormand. We learn a lot about experiences of nomadic people and their culture and sometimes we forget we are seeing actors portraying characters because it captures a lot of mundane realism. We also learn from others who relate their experiences about having to to deal with day to aspects of life most people take for granted. This movie does feel a lot like fellow nominee for best picture ""The Sound of Metal"" in a lot of respects but I think Nomadland wasn't executed as well because it seemed a lot more apathetic. We get a sample of Life as a nomad but there is really no story progression to speak of which does leave an unsatisfying feeling. So watch this movie for the experience, just don't expect a particularly interesting plot."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,"I finally checked out this movie with all the Oscar buzz (although I heard of it before because my father read an article about it) And I can what that buzz was about. This is definitely an more unique and different movie in a good way. As you follow on this journey with this woman Fern,and her nomadic lifestyle and the nomadic community (as well as slowly finding out of fern's past) Big standout was actually while I knew it was a scripted movie it still feel very real! I don't know it was the way it was shot (drama film but in the style of a documentary or a very well made homemade movie) or the fantastic acting from the actors, their interactions and their speech make them seem like real people in real situations. (Then again then also used real nomads so maybe some of it was real). The movie is overall more on the slow side but it's not boring either it's still an interesting story and world to follow. Good movie and can't wait to see what Chloe Zhao does with eternals now!;)"
NOMADLAND,27 May 2021,1/10,It was just boring ahe took a dump in the van and i paid ¬£20 for me and my wife to watch this. Seriously it is the worst film ever.
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,9/10,"Is Nomadland a shift in consciousness of the Hollywood elite, after a year of the ""austerity"" of empty theatres? Or is this flick just another blip of the Academy Awards to show the suffering masses ""we care""? Only time will tell if we'll see more of these doses of reality, instead of the usual portrayals of the average American living in mansions stuffed with every sort of over the top luxury. I hope the popularity of Nomadland starts a trend towards realistic social commentary films, but part of me thinks this movie is predictive programming as a warning to all us Boomers who think we'll be able to relax in our retirement. Is Nomadland slow and depressing? Yes; and guess what? It's supposed to be."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,6/10,"This movie was made fifty years too late it seems. Hollywood is usually fifty years behind, though. It's actually based on an article from Harper's fifty years ago. As for the movie, this should have been one of I liked very much, but it had too much DIY (Do-It-Yourself). You'd think the audience for this movie has never left their house to know how to live ""on the road"". I've had experiences like this, but by backpack, and all over the world, hostel-hopping, farming, sleeping in a park for a week with friends, and it's tough, but also fun, just depending on how you feel at the moment. I never knew or cared about ""Bo"" - we don't see him in the movie, and it seemed like a way to bring in sentimentality/sadness to a situation that didn't need it, and was probably interrupted. I would have liked to have seen more conversations from Blinkie, Linda, and Bob, who must be non-actors, because they were not only natural, but they reminded me of people I know. I'd think ""Cool"", and then the 60-second conversation was over. I never liked Jason Statham - he seems to always play a creepy-kinda guy who just has an unlikable face... I would have lied to know more about the main character, and would have probably been better not to re-do the Amazon job scenes, etc... It might have been a good to see the not-so-community oriented ""tent cities"" all over the country, too. Pretty soon, we'll ALL be working for Amazon in some way, and we ARE the product. Social media isn't free, but some of the nomads found it useful and if that's where the people are at, you don't have much of a choice.Frances is good as usual, but the movie seemed to take 30 minutes of good movie and make it almost 100 movies. However, I guess I'm glad this won Best Picture, because people should know about struggle, which I'm sure they do, but that it's probably more common than just the undesirables. I liked that Statham's and Frances' character didn't ""bang"", because it seemed like the way it would have gone. It might have been cool and been expressive if the young man and her had a one-night stand to show a more instinctual nature, and the depravities of the road, and if two people can do something so they can both have one of those free pleasures in life, why not, but I praise on not including any, too. It was good the sister wasn't cliche, supported her, and mentioned how she was emblematic of the pioneers, those who sought a new frontier, when man meets a new idea which is probably impossible staying in one place, which is something I seem to prefer now, but there's too many reasons and not enough space to type this all out.I give it an extra point for being a movie I actually I didn't turn off like the last handful of movies from my beloved 1930-70s preference, or ever thought about turning it off. I'd say this is a pretty accessible movie; a majority would probably like this, I don't see too many extremes, where people say it's their favorite or the worst movie they saw, but I do like looking at the extremes on the user reviews on IMDB... I also liked it a little more after lighting up a pinner, because the movie is reflective and moderately paced, maybe too slow for a casual viewer.I must say, if THIS is the best movie, I'm definitely not watching the others. I guess I'm glad it won, because for me, the movies made in my lifetime aren't unique, lots of bad writing, too much thought into commercialism... I've seen many movies like this, but if you DO like this, check out ""Harry and Tonto"", ""The Straight Story"", or take a trip yourself... ""Paris, Texas"" is another good movie."
NOMADLAND,4 June 2021,1/10,"108 minutes of poverty tourism, plain and simple. Slow, boring and pointless."
NOMADLAND,20 April 2021,3/10,"I've been a fan of Frances McDormand for a while now, and she turned in wonderful performances in Primal Fear, Fargo, and Three Billboards. After watching the preview for this on Hulu, I was intrigued. Then I heard the Oscar hype, and figured it was worth a go.About 45 minutes in, I'm not sure what I was even watching, beyond a woman who worked at Amazon and lived in her van. There hadn't really been stakes established. The blend of acting and ""acting"" was horrendous, and made even worse by the overall pacing.I really wish I had more good to say about this, but it was not a good movie. It wasn't entertaining, I didn't care about any of the characters, there was no humor, there was no action, if there was drama it happened long after realizing I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters.Frances McDormand's acting was even kind of flat, which was a surprise. If I had one good thing to say about this movie, I'd say the cinematography was pretty good.I often enjoy a good ""slow burn"" movie, but this was not that. There was literally no story here. This felt more like a poorly edited documentary than an actual film.I do not understand the Oscar hype one bit."
NOMADLAND,5 August 2021,6/10,"I watched this movie in not the best shape of myself. I went out of the cineme even more depressed. ALl the scenery is beautiful, but this loneliness, despair, ... this is just crushing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is in low mood or lonely, I do not think this can help. I am glad that I watched it, but I would rather not, if I knew."
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,9/10,It showed me a different perspective of living and surviving.
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,8/10,"Where will we find our happiness? Where will we leave our loneliness? Is creating a family along the lines of the ""american dream"" really a reason to be happy?I believe that what the film wants to go through is exactly these questions. We may not be prepared to accept what is not common, which is not casual for us. Why be a nomad? Why be a nomad by choice? All these questions only the protagonist can answer and maybe she doesn't even know the answer. He just appreciates the fact that he goes aimlessly somewhere, for no reason and that's fine... And that is exactly what the film wants to go through, it is her choice and it is all right to want to live like this.A great movie to think about our lives, to think about what make us happy, what do we have to leave behind to move on. Certainly not a movie for everyone."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,4/10,"Make a pretentious film without a story and critics will call it poetic ...
I would love to see a good documentary about this subject. Nomadland feels like someone forgot to edit in the filmmakers narrative in a documentary. I was so bored watching it."
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,9/10,"""Home is just a word? or is it something you carry within you?""
I'd love to start my review with this quote, it sends all the messages the movie has tried to send.
The movie talks about a woman who has lost her home, husband, job and everything actually and she decided to go on a journey to live the nomad life and the story goes along to see her trials for redemption, redemption from loneliness.
And the movie pointed to very important topics like capitalism and how it makes people waste their whole life doing something and literally die without doing anything they wanted to do and not enjoy a second from their lives.I really loved how the music started and ended in a specific time, I tried to figure out what is the right expression to tell and I ended up with ""The music was talking"" it was speaking Fern's emotions and asking questions then answering at the end of the scene.An essay won't be enough for me to tell you how much I loved the cinematography. actually seeing the sky of the American West is enough, I felt the beauty of the nature of the American West from my home in Cairo.Frances McDormand's performance was a real A class one, she is stunning -as always- and it won't be a surprise if she won her third Oscars with this performance.
and by talking about the performances, Are those people actors or they're just real persons who live this lifestyle I would be surprised if I know they're actors, and if they're then Chapeau to the casting choices they mastered their roles.But there was something a little bit confusing for me, the movie was slow-paced and that's not what confused me, I was confused with the rapid development, there were some scenes that are just going the camera with Fern's walks or something then cut then Fern in another place with different people. and that's all I hated about this movie."
NOMADLAND,29 December 2020,6/10,"I love the non sequiturs of Kelly Reichardt, so I'm fine with not much happening in a movie. I don't need bushels of plot.But, despite, McDormand's brave contribution, I didn't think director Zhao hit the mark. For me, the pro actors didn't quite mesh with the real folks.You could run the movie in reverse, it wouldn't make that much difference, such is its neutral tone and low affect throughout.A drifter movie that just drifts. Nowhere near as good as American Honey, which is holding up as one of the great American drifter movies of this century or the last."
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,10/10,"The personal state of mind when watching a movie is also important in determining the positive or negative experience about it. The advice for this work of authorship is that of a serene approach without expecting more than it is. Nomadland could be translated as nowhere where the opposite is everywhere. The reference therefore involves people who no longer have their own land, their own house forced to survive a continuous pilgrimage. This phenomenon occurs not only in those corners of the earth where per capita incomes cause hunger and misery to suffer, but it also occurs in those places painted as happy islands. The exploration of this territory highlights the conditions relating to the attainment of this status such as the loss of family support or a job, terminal illnesses and counter-current thoughts, contradicting modern ethical standards. At the helm of this analysis we have a talented young emerging director assisted by an excellent and veteran actress as usual in a complete state of grace who describe this martyrdom revealing the most intimate side of these unfortunate lives but at the same time endowed with immense generosity arousing in this way strong emotions mixed with anger for the absurd impotence and indifference of the current Western society towards them. A film with excellent photography, beautiful editing and a sensitive soundtrack. Current and recommended."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,7/10,If your not the patience person u cant handle the screenplay for that long.
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,5/10,"This is a tough one. The first half, virtually nothing happens. There is a little- no make that TINY- plot in the 2nd half. Mostly it's Frances McDormand driving around, working menial jobs occasionally, talking to other nomads & gazing at views. I disagree with those that say she is an adventurer. She's a widow who desperately misses her husband & is only on the road because he died & then so did her ""town"". It's a quiet film. Frances did a great job & makes you feel things. But overall it's just very very sad. - The music, particularly by Ludo E. Is lovely."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,1/10,"Literally nothing happens. The ""movie"" is someone filming a really boring person who drives around and never does anything interesting. There are no ups or downs, no excitement or sadness, no conflict or resolution. This is absolutely the most nothing film I've ever seen."
NOMADLAND,24 May 2021,8/10,"A film that must be seen in the cinema.I arrived with zero expectations.I could see it on Disney + but I waited for the cinema.In fact, I'm happy with it.It should be seen in the cinema with the big screen.The beautiful shots in a fantastic nature.A fantastic and realistic tale.Oscar DESERVED!-Antonio."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,5/10,"...but unfortunately it isn't. What we get is a lazy story told a million times - about grieve, acceptance & letting go. Even Sound of metal did it better.I can't figure it out why this move got Oscar(s!). It feels like a student film.McDormand, while she was awesome in Three billboards,
her role in Nomadland just isn't worthy of Oscar."
NOMADLAND,13 September 2020,9/10,"A great Francis McDormand performance, gorgeous cinematography and a compelling story make for a great character study!"
NOMADLAND,25 July 2021,8/10,Great acting and very emotional screenplay! This is a movie that you must focus to the little things to see the big picture...8 out of 10 for me.
NOMADLAND,19 February 2021,3/10,"If you have seen the trailers, you have seen the movie. Yes, there are more scenes and David Strathairn shows up doing his usual humble,sensitive, beta male routine....and people drive around and share stories.....and...so what? As pointed out earlier, France McDormand's character chooses to live this way. She is depressed, morose,unavailable and happy swimming along in her perpetual melancholia. Its just not very....interesting. Or compelling."
NOMADLAND,19 May 2021,6/10,The view and all was Great. But I guess I was unable to vibe with the character. Sorry.
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,8/10,"Those final words onscreen perfectly encapsulate the emotion of the film. It's not for everyone; you have to put yourself in the way of Fern: losing the husband that everyone in town revered, there's no way to continue living while moving beyond the situation, except in the comfort of those in similar predicaments. The final chat with the gentleman describing losing his son brought a tear to my eye. The duality of the memory to never forget combined with only being able to move forward in life. Frances, as usual, was fantastic. And the cinematography was simply first rate."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,8/10,"Frances McDormand as Fern blends expertly amongst the real life nomads she is portraying. And the people around her, telling their own stories, deliver authenticity and pathos.There are moments in this movie where all of the buzzing thoughts in your head, the urge to pick up your phone and scroll idly through social media, are completely eliminated. You feel the majesty of the landscapes, the power of memory and the pain of loss that drives Fern ever onwards.It's philosophical, introspective, and delivers a timely social message without a soapbox. It is gorgeously shot, and Frances McDormand delivers an incredible performance."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,5/10,"It was watchable and well acted but it was devoid of purpose and aimless , I kind of guessed the ending it was like a never ending story with no point, I actually felt sorry for her family who would naturally be concerned for her. Good advert for Amazon though."
NOMADLAND,13 September 2020,9/10,"This film left me speechless. Words cannot capture what a beautiful, unique, touching, reflective film this was. I have not seen a film I loved this much in a long time.Frances McDormand is a genius. She blends into her role so effortlessly that you hardly feel as though you're on a journey with a fictional character.The cinematography is stunning, and all of the actors are perfectly cast. Everything - from the music to the editing - is a masterclass in the art of filmmaking.If Nomadland does not sweep up at the Oscars...something is wrong with the world.Find a way to see this film! You won't regret it"
NOMADLAND,2 July 2021,9/10,One of the few movies that has the ability to make a lingering effect on one's mind. Thanks for making a movie like this. So beautiful and so profound about life's ultimate goal.
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,10/10,You need an actress like Frances McDormand to bring flavor to such a simple direct narrative. This is a movie about something but it is more about a mood. It is about loss and the loss of love and home and about one form of living in our troubled times. It is a lovely film and make me want to see Ms. Zhou next and completely completely different film for Marvel Eternals.
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,4/10,I love Frances. Her latest films are political. Homelessness or whatever are so blatantly political. Move along Frances. Used to be good .
NOMADLAND,7 January 2021,1/10,It's a very slow paced movie. There are countless scenes in which I thought were dragged out for too long and should've been edited out. I actually took my eyes off the screen and started checking my phone at times -- that's not a very good sign!I don't think there was a real purpose or end goal to Nomadland other than showing us a person going from one dead-end job to the next.
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,7/10,Great film! Lovely cinematography with an interesting story about something I didn't really know about or knew was a thing. I thought the story was directed and portrayed wonderfully and intimately. I'm actually glad I watched it because I learned something new from it and got a different view on life.
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,2/10,"If you are the type that think everything in life that is depressing should be turned into a ""dramatic"" movie, then this one's for you. What is depressing is the ""coat tailing"" that this movie exploits, and no doubt the main actor and others made millions off of, meanwhile the real people in the movie are living very hard and difficult lives."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,7/10,The best part of the movie is where David and tay strathairn play the piano together. Frances is world class. Amazing acting all the way around. It's definitely an art piece of a movie. A poem in its own right. Do not go into this if you're already feeling down. I watched this to forget about what was going on in my life and I was just reminded of all the things in my life that really suck.
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,6/10,"Let's get the obvious point out of the way first: Frances McDormand is a national treasure. She may well be the ranking American actress, and she conveys an ""everywoman"" aura that is almost hypnotic. The lines on her face, a limitation for many actresses, are an outstanding feature for her.Now, as for the movie: As many have observed, there's scarcely a beginning, middle, or end. We're told how Fay got to be on the road, we see a handful of interactions with others, we get some gorgeous cinematography, and repeat; and repeat again. Life isn't half-bad for Fay and the people she encounters; as bad as it gets is a flat tire or a ""helpful"" friend inadvertently breaking a beloved piece of china. Somehow, there's money to pay for more serious problems. Other reviews have summarized dozens of ways that the life hinted at here is actually far more harsh than we see.In many ways, this plays as the first episode of a limited TV series about being on the road. In my humble opinion, despite the gorgeous sunsets, such a pilot would not have been picked up.One final thing, and perhaps my biggest problem - it's sometimes referred to as the ""observer effect."" In a movie filled with dozens of ""real"" people, the interior of a real Amazon, and so on, I found myself constantly wondering about the crew hovering on the edge of the screen with lights and cameras and a director. It really took me out of the movie. Apparently, it worked for the amateur cast; there's a story on the Internet about one of the amateur leads being really moved by hearing a sad story from Fay; once the scene ended, he was stunned when McDormand reminded him that she was acting, and everyone described in the story was actually alive and well. I guess it's great that Ms. McDormand is such a great actress that these real people believed her in real time. But for me, I wondered how real people could melt into being characters in a movie."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,5/10,"This movie got oscars based on the GIMMICK of using real people to tell their ""living on the road"" stories and intermixing this with a few professional actors. It basically has no plot, no drama, nothing actually happens. Slice of life movies can be okay, but this one is nothing special. The gimmick of mixing real actors with real people telling real personal stories is heavy-handed and jarring. My wife was complaining of some of the people's acting being so wooden (before we knew some of the people were not acting) and halfway through, I told her, ""it is almost as if they grabbed real people and mixed them in with some actors""). The fact you have to break out of your investment in the movie to wonder about the jarring inconsistency in delivery of lines, in tone from drama to documentary, is a fundamental flaw. It is like that movie Dogtown that got critical acclaim for having no setting (like ""Our Town"") but in reality the lack of any setting was just jarring. They do not remove distraction by removing setting, they create distraction. Jarring gimmicks are poor film-making."
NOMADLAND,30 January 2021,3/10,"It's ok. Interesting more than fun to watch. Good acting, specially by the several non profesional actors like Linda and Swanky. However, I think it is massively overrated. It is good for what it is, but it is not an award winner."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,8/10,"I wasn't going to write a review of Nomadland, until I saw so many reviews describing the movie with words like ""boring,"" ""pointless,"" ""aimless,"" and phrases like ""lacks any story,"" and ""nothing happens."" No, this movie is not boring, pointless, aimless, or lacking a story. And a lot happens during the course of the movie. If you are capable of patiently allowing this movie's charms to work on you, you will be rewarded by a unique experience by watching this movie.Frances McDormand puts in a pitch-perfect performance in which she seems not to be acting, but seems to actually be Fern, a woman who has lost her husband and set out to lead a nomadic lifestyle through the American west, moving from one seasonal job to another. As she moves from place to place, she learns the details of living independently, with occasional assistance from fellow nomads and others who understand her way of life. She also meets people from many different walks of life, all with their own reasons for living on the road, and all with their own road to travel down in life, which will take them in and out of Fern's life at times that are not predictable by Fern or by the viewer. We share her pleasures in learning how to live this life, in making friends along the way, and in the small comforts she is able to afford with much effort and some luck. We also share her troubles in losing friends, trying to maintain and hold on to her meager material possessions, including her vital customized van, and in her attempts to fit into a more stable life, with relatives or friends who want to share her life on a more permanent basis. There is much drama to be enjoyed - and suspense wondering if she will give up her lifestyle and learn to change, at the entreaties of various people who invite her to stay and put down rootsAnyone who tells you that nothing significant happens in the movie, because they perceive Fern to be in the same position at the end that she was in the beginning, is simply not capable of grasping the beauty and significance of a movie that shows us events unfold as they would in real life, without quick edits and easy resolutions of problems that are not easily resolved in reality. Yes, there are valid criticisms from people who would have liked to have seen in the story more of the hardships and dangers of the real nomadic life, but I believe the story presented is a rich and meaningful one that gives the patient viewer many insights into the joys and hardships of the real nomads - many of whom portrayed major characters in the movie. For that real glimpse in to a life many of us never would have seen, otherwise in such depth and in such detail, this is a priceless experience.The cinematography and direction are perfect for the subject matter - with scenes unfolding as if they were not edited at all, including unpleasant sights and sounds that are allowed to linger, as well as the many shots of the beautiful sunsets and mountains. The loneliness of the nomadic life is highlighted in many scenes, as is the camaraderie of the road and open vistas. And the performances of McDormand and David Strathairn are worth the price of admission alone. Conclusion: if you only have the patience for the violent revenge fantasies or insipid romantic comedies being churned out of the production companies these days, and you need everything spoon fed to you and tied up with a happy ending in order to enjoy a movie, then this is not the movie for you. If you enjoy realism and a glimpse into the lives of people you might actually encounter some day in a way that will touch on broader themes about your life and how you live it, you will find this movie very rewarding."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,7/10,"This is a nice movie with some touching moments. But it cannot be comprehended by people who have most of their life still ahead of them. I would say you have to be at least 45 years old to understand it, or better yet, feel it.The movie is somewhat slow, of an artistic kind, and I would expect it to win best film award on various festivals but not to win the Oscar for best film despite its Americana theme. Frances McDormand got a lot of praise for the role but I would say its a kind of generic role for her. In a way similar to Three Billboards.What I didnt like is that its not realistic. Mostly everyone and everything is nice and philosophical while in reality the world is filled with greedy, selfish, cruel, violent, shallow, addicted, unhappy, etc. People all around us. Also, the life of someone without means is difficult and unpleasant in many aspects."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,10/10,"Last few scenes explain why we watched previous scenes. 1 big star for the concept.0.5 big star goes to the Actress.0.5 big star goes the team (director, cinematographer etc).8 stars to magistro Ludovico Einaudi. He did most job."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,8/10,"I think this movie speaks to my generation. Time, life experience and the reality of time remaining are well documented."
NOMADLAND,22 August 2021,6/10,"I was engaged and moderately surprised. I had expected it was going to be another America-sucks treatment of people down on their luck. It isn't that. It's unusual in that there are no car chases, no gunfights, no bad guys preying upon the nomads, nothing jumping out at you.Realistic? I could not say. However, I think a corollary of the Heisenberg principle is in effect here: the presence of the observer alters what is observed, making an accurate description impossible.Frances McDormand does well; she certainly has the look, which is devoid of any particle of glamour. And she is asked to portray activities that no actress who won an Oscar ever previously had to portray."
NOMADLAND,16 October 2020,8/10,"Last year, Toronto Film Festival's People's Choice awards winner was Honeyland and this year's winner is Nomadland which has deserved undoubtedly. Real people real lives story whom they have to endure harshness of the obstacles of life in their older ages. Somehow, they never say final goodbye to each other and sometimes see the others down the road within time. One of the finest film of 2020 with beautiful score, cinematography. Rating: 8 of 10"
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,2/10,"This movie casts light on nomadic people who are at the end of their rope in terms of improving themselves and their circumstances.In my opinion nothing uplifting, intriguing or clever is gained by this insipid affair.It is truly painful to watch such an immensely talented actress as Frances McDormand cast as such a slattern. (Look it up) üòè"
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,6/10,The real people in the movie were the most interesting part and the heart of the story. I feel like Frances McDormand didn't do much to warrant any accolades.
NOMADLAND,25 July 2021,1/10,"One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Just because the subject matter is interesting or challenging does not mean it will lead to a good movie. This is a bad movie, no real story line, endless closeup shots of Francis McDermott simply doing nothing. She may be a great actress but in this movie she is wasted. It reminds me of the sort of movie that would result if you asked a film student to make a film with simply one cameraman following someone around for a few days who was doing nothing. In my opinion the Oscars simply got this wrong in voting this best picture."
NOMADLAND,30 March 2021,8/10,"Professor Scott Galloway, in his book Post Corona, writes that we do not have capitalism in the United States. We have cronyism, which he calls the worst of all worlds, a system that benefits no one but the CEOs of large corporations while hurting everyone else. Capitalism must rest ""on a bed of empathy,"" which it does not. In modern America it rests on its own immorality.We've seen our economic system's failures during the pandemic, and we saw them during the Great Recession. Chloe Zhao's Nomadland could have been set in 2020 as well as 2011, as the failures of America's economic system wiped out jobs and mortgages and pensions and even entire towns. Based on the nonfiction novel Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century, the movie follows the character of Fern, who leaves her hometown after her husband dies and the town's sole industry closes down, becoming a vagabond living out of an old van.As Fern moves from job to job and place to place across the modern American west, she meets some people who want to be nomads, particularly retirees in their RVs. Zhao treats the movie's nomads (many of whom are real-life nomads) gently, even admiringly. They are latter day cowboys. Not all of them are there by choice, though, and Fern is not, as becomes painfully obvious several times, particularly when her van breaks down and she learns it will cost more to repair than it is worth. She turns to her sister, who lends her the money she needs and also offers her a place to stay. The two had never been close, and Fern realizes that cannot be a long-term solution, so she declines. Later, she is tentatively romanced by handsome and kind David (David Strathairn) who offers another housing opportunity, but she is still mourning her late husband and by now sees nomadic life as permanent for her. As to the jobs she picks up, they are menial and short-term, the best perhaps being seasonal work in an Amazon fulfillment center. The pay was minimum wage, there was no hazard pay or time off, and the retirees who were used like slave labor at such facilities often met with accidents; Fern's aspirations can never grow beyond merely fixing her van and proceeding with a life without a bathroom or a kitchen.Chinese-born Zhao is clearly influenced by the American director John Ford, particularly by The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Like Ford, she uses the physical beauty of the American West as an ongoing backdrop to her story. For Ford, though, at least in his Western films, that physical beauty suggested the future promise of America. For Zhao, decades later, it is a metaphor for the broken promise of our country. At one point, in a particularly scenic spot, Fern and David do some hiking. ""Find anything good?"" he calls out to her. ""Just rocks,"" she replies. Like the Joad Family in The Grapes of Wrath, she--and some of the nomads she meets--are displaced by economic misfortune: the Joads by the Great Depression and the nomads by the Great Recession. The Joads lose their home and head West for a better life. When they don't find it they have to keep moving from one migrant camp to another, sometimes meeting other travelers they have met before. Fern treats the search for necessities like a circle, and comes back to certain places and certain jobs in a circular pattern.In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Wayne's Tom Doniphon is a rancher in love with Hallie (Vera Miles). He is adding a room to his house in anticipation of marriage and children. Hallie, though, falls for the lawyer James Stewart and the promise of a more civilized life ""back East."" Doniphon likely could have turned his attentions to other single women in the town of Shinbone. Even the portly, cowardly sheriff (Andy Devine) has a mistress in town. But Tom Doniphon only loved one woman, and when he lost her he burned down his ranch house (while Fern's husband dies and her house is taken from her) and then he turned to alcohol, later to die forgotten and alone. Fern, like Doniphon, just didn't have it in her to start another romance. That is why she resists David. Doniphon's character is such that he can no longer live in ""normal"" society--in houses with families--and neither can Fern. In effect Fern ""burns down"" that possible ending to her story.Most influential, though, is Ford's The Searchers. That film contains one of the single greatest shots in the history of film: Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), after years of searching for his niece who was kidnapped in a Comanche raid, finally returns her to her home. She enters the small settlers cabin, and then other family members enter, while Ethan stands alone outside. Like Tom Doniphon, and like Fern, Edwards is a man displaced by civilization. His bravery and fortitude were necessary in settling the American West, but those same qualities also made it impossible for him to partake of the resulting civilized society of homes and families. John Ford films Ethan from inside the cabin while Ethan stands outside, framed by the doorway. In another moment, Ethan turns and wanders away, a man no longer with a mission, nowhere to go and nowhere to stay. Chloe Zhao duplicates that shot at the end of Nomandland. Fern, in her circular wandering, has arrived back at the house she once shared with her husband. The house is empty. The town is deserted. She leaves the house and stands outside, her back to the camera, framed by the open doorway. After a moment, she trudges away, back to life as a nomad.Nomadland has won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice awards for best picture and best director of 2020. It will likely do the same at the Screen Actors Guild and Academy Award ceremonies. Even so, I can't give more than eight stars because Chloe Zhao was, well...too nice. She pulled her punches. She might have depicted more clearly the horrors of working at an Amazon fulfillment center, for example. Fern, the character she and Frances McDormand created, is too stoic by far. Only a couple of times do we get to see how events are affecting her emotionally, and this might lead the viewer to think things aren't too bad when, in fact, they are. She comes to accept her new life, certainly, but it was an emotionally darker road to get there than we see in the film. Were the director's choices affected by Chinese culture? Is a female Chinese-born director going to use a lighter touch than an American male director may have used? I hope that is true. There has been a clamor for more diverse voices in filmmaking. With those diverse voices should come diverse perspectives we can learn from. Zhao has a long career ahead of her. She is already at work on the next MCU movie The Eternals. We'll have a chance to find out."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,4/10,You can have sympathy for the characters and the subject as a whole. But there's not much of an interesting story here.
NOMADLAND,10 June 2021,8/10,"Nomadland frequently shows a reflective Fran (Frances McDormand), gazing into the distance during the dull blue light of twilight. It is a poignant metaphor for the passage of time after someone leaves our world, but their afterglow still rests and lingering, gentle and peaceful over the plains of our lives until their memory expires into the dead of night. As Fran traverses the American west in her camper van, the majority of characters we encounter are real-life Nomads who share their stories of loss or futility, making the sentiments ever so much more bittersweet."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,8/10,"Paul's Movie Reviews
""Nomadland"" 2020
Currently in theaters and streaming on Hulu, Chloe Zhao's depiction of an American sub-culture offers an eye-opening character study starring the always wonderful Frances McDormand (Fargo, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri).
Based on the non-fictional account of the same name by Jessica Bruder, the film chronicles the ""workamper"" movement, loosely organized legions of temporary employees travelling the states to fill largely seasonal jobs.
One will think of the depression-era ""Oakies"" and hobos, who rode the rails to pick-up work wherever they could find it.
I first became aware of these folks after reading two magazine articles in 2017. The first was about how Amazon hired multitudes of nomadic temps for its distribution centers. They worked ten hour shifts at $11.25 per, plus overtime. Grueling work for the AARP gang, walking miles every day on concrete warehouse floors.
The other column focused more on victims of the Great Recession of 2007; retirement aged citizens who sold everything that they had left to purchase RV's and travel the country. Many were unfortunate participants in the ""upside down"" housing mortgage debacle, while others lost their life savings in the stock market crash.
The real stars of Nomadland are actual worker-gypsies turned actors. They include Linda May, who was the focus of the original book. Also, Bob Wells the workcamper guru, whose ""Rubber Tramp Rendezvous"" weekends provide training and survival techniques for attendees and Swankie, Frances McDormand's ""Fern's"" 75-year-old best friend.
Although the film plods along slowly, it is never boring. It is Zhao's second-best outing; the first being the widely praised ""The Rider"" from 2017. The Chinese born director is gaining a large following and should be watched for her future endeavors. I recommend that you see both movies."
NOMADLAND,3 January 2021,6/10,"The genre of this film approaches, but fails at, social realism. Why can't working people afford a house, or an apartment, even a rented room, or medicine, or good food? Why do these general conditions of want exist? A facile try at an answer is proffered early in the film, then abandoned - that we are at fault for our condition because we have voluntarily accepted the ""yoke of the dollar"". You were born, the dollar got here before you, did someone offer you a choice? ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings"". So what is poverty then, a character flaw? There is a system we all live under. Do fish ever wonder of us if we realise we swim in an economy? It works. It works for the right people, it is unbroken. It is not a mistake. Is cause and effect no longer operative? This film works as a minimalist slice-of-life, never broaching the why. It presents a cleaned up version of the condition yet tells us nothing of the pathology.The film offers sentiment in its stead; of good works, charity, and the golden rule. (All suggested as a proper way of life by the victims for other victims to follow). Now operative is a more contemporary golden rule, ""Them's with the gold, makes the rules."" You have likely tried to suss this all out. In future, ask yourself this question: Who is the economy for?"
NOMADLAND,5 February 2021,5/10,I found this motion picture rather slow and somewhat boring.
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,7/10,"I had not looked up any background on this movie before watching, except that there were non-actors. When Swankie made her amazing, moving speech about the swallows, my immediate thought was, if she's an actress, she is way better than Frances McDormand. I could watch that speech over and over, it is so beautiful and mesmerizing how she does it. I don't understand the rave reviews about McDormand in this case. Whereas all the real nomads maintained this cheerfulness and positivity about them, and had such nuance in their expressions, the two actors, McDormand and Strathairn tried too hard to be wooden and expressionless, as though that is what ""real"" (or poor) people are like. I don't think McDormand really dug into a background for her character at all. It might be dulling to live in a remote mining town; but choosing to be a nomad also takes some spark of character and determination, which we see in the real nomads. The movie was so fascinating to watch in the first part when we met all of the nomads and see their way of life. Then it goes downhill after that when it mostly is the actors, who look like they're acting. I applaud McDormand for recruiting Zhao to do this movie. I wish she had tried to reflect the mindsets of the other nomads more. The real people and landscapes are wonderfully shot by Richards. Worth seeing. I hope Zhao does not get corrupted by Hollywood and will go back to her indie way of shooting."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,5/10,"Nothing really happens. There's a lot of beautiful shots in the film (which are more palatable for women than they are for men), and the drama is a slow burn- or almost no burn.All the characters are good and necessary to the story. The humor works.The music works, but I don't remember it.I enjoyed learning about how people live as they travel in RV's across America, but I could've gotten a shorter version of it from educational YouTube videos or a SHORT FILM.I enjoy the commentary on home ownership and like that people can rethink if investing in a suburban house is still a good idea.It's also useful to think about how the self is defined when a person is traveling all by themselves. What is identity at that point?Overall, pretty good, a little overrated, and still should've been shorter... a lot shorter."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,8/10,"I unexpectedly saw the movie Nomadland on February 26, 2021, on a 65"" flat screen so it was close to a theatrical experience. I was somewhat drawn to this movie by the recent publicity and buzz surrounding it, including early reviews, but also because (1) the location shooting was done primarily in desolate locations in Nevada and Arizona, (2) part of its subject matter is late 20th Century (post-1975) and contemporary (post-2008) economic dislocation, downsizing, and desperation; and (3) the no-nonsense, hard-nosed protagonist played by veteran and near icon Frances McDormand. I wondered if it was anything like the memorable 1988 movie Bagdad Caf√© (filmed in the California desert near Barstow), and would it bring back 50-year-old memories I have of a 1,000-mile roundtrip camper trip I went on in December 1969 with my dad, from Los Angeles to Hoover Dam, Nevada, and the Grand Canyon, Arizona (to take a switchback mule ride between the rim and valley floor). Nomadland very much reminded me of both.
I knew Nomadland wouldn't be a walk in the park - that it would likely be a serious drama on the contemplative side - and it delivered in spades as such to the point of being relentless and a couple of times in the 2nd half of its 1-hour and 47-minute run time I yearned for the scenery and dialog to lighten up a little! Is Nomadland a movie about death, dying, funeral homes and cemeteries? No, but it felt like it at times.
Nomadland could be described as a modern-day Grapes of Wrath, following itinerant laborers around the country in search of economic survival but it's deeper than that. Nomadland not only doesn't pull punches, a few times it lands them when you're not looking in terms of frigid temperatures inside vans and campers, the chalk-in-your-mouth feeling using public bathrooms, and how people relieve themselves without access to a private toilet (that subject was bound to come in this story and Nomadland deals with it without flinching).
There's a lot of Frances McDormand staring into the distance in Nomadland but it's not gratuitous - she ALWAYS has a lot to think about, including a few very specific bumps in the road. At one plot point she is (and we feel) vulnerable as the engine in her converted van fails to turn over one morning and a local mechanic diagnoses the problem and gives her the bad news. She (and we) hear the unbearable amount of the bill and know the jig is up - until she pulls a rabbit out of a hat by borrowing money from a semi-estranged relative.
It turns out the protagonist in Nomadland has a family background and old and potentially new family members who feel loyalty to her and worry about her. That, dear friends, is probably the fairy tale part of this story that doesn't match the reality for most nomads. But as you would expect in a project this serious, even the home environment that's available to her is fraught with ambiguity and emotional snares and Frances retreats to the familiarity of her van that's parked in the driveway.
Nomadland includes at least a half dozen emotional highlights involving peripheral characters, which adds to its richness. Characters who might be off-putting just outside your personal space but are disarming as they reveal their personal story and humanity. I felt haunted by a heavily tattooed young drifter who turned out to be as sweet as they come (he fled his home in Wisconsin). What about rescuing someone like that for a short time? (The answer is probably bad news for several reasons).
I would give Nomadland 8 out of 10 stars but also be wary of recommending it. It's not for the overwhelming majority of moviegoers who are looking for action, romance, superheroes, musicals, or familiar stories about people like them or that they know. It's an art house film for sure. Containing no sex or violence, it's almost PG. Emotionally, it's R for sure."
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,3/10,"Oh, come on, come on! A litany of woes, misery and sad memories does not a story make. No story, no real action, no character growth, no revelations and only a minor resolution - boring. Me thinks this is another example of The Emperor's New Clothes (like the critically acclaimed but extremely poor ""La La Land""). Frances McDormand is a topflight actor (I try to see everything she does) but this was nowhere near a star turn (almost any actor can do a 'sad stare'). If you want to see Frances at the height of her considerable powers watch ""Fargo"" or ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (with ""Three Billboards"" you get the bonus of seeing Sam Rockwell put in a fantastic performance). Sorry, this movie is a waste of time."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,3/10,"I gave up watching after half an hour, which really could've been compressed into 5 minutes, instead we see her gazing into life's vicissitudes here and there and we're supposed to read her mind I guess. This isn't a movie it's a PBS documentary, it's just missing the narrator's voice."
NOMADLAND,13 June 2021,3/10,"Again I am exasperated by the disparity between praise lavished on some movies and the experience of viewers. This movie is very tedious. It shows the day-to-day life of McDormand the nomad. But it presents her with very few opportunities to stretch any kind of acting muscle; for the most part she's just a person going through the motions. A couple times she's sad and occasionally angry but those scenes are brief and fleeting.We learn very little about any of the other characters, most notably Strathairn's character. He is a nomad but has a family and home to return to. All we get is that he doesn't think he was a great father. And?The other characters, real nomads, offer the occasional pithy words of wisdom which have about as much impact as a greeting card slogan because we know so little about them.The film offers very little insight into the circumstances that drive people to become nomads or the challenges, logistical and otherwise, of that lifestyle (yes, we get it, you have to pee outdoors and you sit around campfires). I'll add that it depicts these people as universally benign. I suspect that not all of them are and paying some attention to that would have been interesting."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,6/10,When I say not really a movie I mean it's more a well acted documentary/ travelogue. Some nice characters and she is good as usual.
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,4/10,"I am one of those people who live on the road by choice, and have done so for 10 years.I felt as though this movie did not paint a true picture of folk who are houseless, but NOT by choice. Their day to day struggle was only touched on. Safety, security, health, food, fuel costs are all issues faced by these good folk every single hour of every single day.The raw close ups did make you feel every emotion and the scenery was beautiful, but the movie didn't hit the mark for me. The camaraderie with fellow travellers was spot on. We all help each other out, no matter the circumstances.I would be very interested to hear what other permanent travellers think of this movie."
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,4/10,"Tough to watch this ""almost Documentary on these disconnected travelers choice
of lifestyle.
An honest reflection of the human spirit that you can ""make lemonade"" out of brutal truth !
long pregnant pause................................................. for all to reflect.
was the mainstay of this offering."
NOMADLAND,19 September 2021,7/10,"This movie wasn't quite what I thought but it was interesting.I assume Fern was still grieving her Husband and her own life, but at the end I got the feeling she was ready to move on. If you get pleasure from being a Nomad fair enough but very few seemed happy. I know in this modern world it can be hard to be happy. There is a line said by Valeria in Conan about taking life by the throat and making it give you what you desire. That's what Fern needs to do. No one should settle for drudgery."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,3/10,"This is as pompous as a piece of art with a single down brushstroke that happens to cost millions. The cinematography isn't anything special or unusual at all. Many shots are simply repeated and the overuse of weak sunsets are just corny gimmicks to mask the lack of any defined plot of substance. The wide angle POV van shot is the only decent shot in the film. This is a long drone of boredom. Yes, there are a couple of reflective conversations scattered about but to spread those over a feature length? A movie should be entertaining if a human is to spend 2 hours plus of its life sitting and giving it its full intention. Not sure I trust the Oscars anymore after this. I only pay to be entertained, nothing else. Russell.. no I was not entertained much at all here mate."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a story that is all too familiar across the American landscape: people with skills, long work experience, who have suffered some bad breaks, struggling to scratch out a living to support themselves. Menial job followed by menial job, these inadvertently transient people criss-cross the country, making momentary connections, always looking for that next seasonal gig. It's a rootless existence that really brings into stark focus ""what is life all about"" without overtly asking that trite and cliched question.Frances McDormand and David Strathairn give sutble, powerful performances as ""two ships in the night"", working these forgettable jobs.There may not be much story to the movie, but the character study is fascinating and sad. I'm sure there are people who enjoy living this sort of life, I just don't know any of them.When Frances McDormand's character delves into her past and makes a physical return to a significant location, the loneliness and depth of loss she has experienced becomes very real for the audience.The movie is worth seeing. It's melancholy. It will make anyone who sees it very thankful for whatever level of stability they have in their own lives."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,2/10,"This thing won an Oscar and had the Cannes award for one reason only -- its extreme PRETENTIOUS ARTSINESS appeals to the Perrier-swilling la-dee-dahs that make up the judging panels of these venues. It tries to scream ""Hey look at me, I'm such a deep and cool and avant-garde movie, you too can be deep and cool and avant-garde by identifying with this garbage."" It's really nothing but a depressing hour and a half look into the lives of misfits and dysfunctional people who just want to wallow in their misery or bad luck, and won't do anything to pull themselves out of it. Just constantly feeling sorry for themselves, or enjoying their rotten luck like the masochists they are. God forbid they should just pick themselves up and get on with things, no, they have to constantly pick at scabs and let their dreariness refresh itself endlessly. This is one of those toxic movies that make you feel like crap when it's over, you feel like you've been poisoned and you want that hour and a half of your life back, you wish you never watched it. Like when the main character turns her back on a nice home and a relationship, and a family, and chooses to sleep in her filthy camper on her filthy mattress --- well, more power to you, but too many people like her is why my heart doesn't bleed anymore for a large proportion of the ""homeless"", that part that chooses that lifestyle."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,3/10,"The acting, cinematography, and music score are outstanding. Just wish their had been a good story to go along with all the fine performances."
NOMADLAND,20 May 2021,7/10,"Here are instructions to watch this movie as a profound experience:Watch it without researching anything about the background of this movie. (Don't even focus on the awards and nominations.)
You'll probably find it slow, melancholic maybe even boring. That's ok, keep watching.Now pay attention to the credits and read the trivia section here and then the page of this movie on Wikipedia. Now read interviews with the supporting actors (e.g. Bob Wells).Now realize what you have just seen..."
NOMADLAND,29 October 2021,8/10,"Slow, beautiful film about the forgotten people on the borders of US society. Loved the meditative, melancholic atmosphere and the way the film showed compassion towards its characters without sliding into pity or moralization."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,1/10,"OK I wasn't expecting a Coen brothers extravaganza but this docudrama never got started. I understood the premise of the situation but it was so slow and had no direction I was just bored as none of the plotlines went anywhere. It was Louis Theroux without the interesting characters or gallows humour. Once again this Oscar bait written, directed, produced, acted by women has let them down. Like everyone else I so wanted to love this film but there was no lasting memories, unlike 3 billboards that you'd happily watch again, when the credits rolled I just thought 'is that it?' Filmed in a desert, the scenery matched the storyline - plain, flat, boring, lifeless.."
NOMADLAND,26 January 2021,6/10,"I want to start out by saying that I had some serious reservations about watching this film but I came out pleasantly surprised by it.First, the good. The acting and directing were excellent I think Francis McDermott was meant for these roles. She does allow for her inner ""Three Billboards"" to come out and it's hard not to see this her in a continuation role as the same character. That said, it fits the movie very well. Cinematography was also excellent and set the tone for the movie itself.Now the bad. It's an unrealistic film all around. I can understand how a group of multimillionaires find it hard to understand or relate to a situation of poverty, homelessness and hopelessness (despite seeing it around them daily). The acting is not the real problem here but the writing and producing are more likely the culprit.The life Francis' character leads was seemingly unhindered, free'ing and uncaring which is not even in the slightest a realistic version of how life truly works in those situations. Maybe if you're wealthy and taking a vacation in poverty while roaming the country. But, that's not even remotely how things work and this film becomes a cliche of how the upper echelon thinks the lower echelon live.In short, it's worth a watch as long as you realize it's a complete work of fiction and you're not likely to identify with the characters as their lives are also a complete work of fiction."
NOMADLAND,19 May 2021,10/10,"Great movie with ups and downs, great acting and beautiful scenery. I would watch again, loved it!"
NOMADLAND,5 April 2021,1/10,"Watched this film for a full hour before I realized this is really just a dissertation about people who wander around the US looking for work and not murdering anybody. Until that time, I was hoping the Francis McDonald character would turn out to be a kung-fu serial killer at any moment, or at least a bank robber or some such. But no.... this film is nothing more than an accurate reflection on the plight of the American drifter sans murderous agenda. Were it not for a few bright talents, the film would be utterly useless. Linda May and Swankie are the breakout stars of this film, delivering performances that are beautiful and brutal. While either of them could have overplayed their natural sexuality and titillated us with a Mrs. Robinson/Dowager Countess-meets-Stiffler's Mother approach, but these women put their vanity aside and chose an understated, natural acting style that reveals their characters' humanity and makes us feel like we're watching real life. Thespians of lesser acumen would have made inferior choices, but in the end, these actresses contributed a significant degree of gravitas to what was otherwise a film without meaning or evident trajectory. In the future I hope to see Linda May and Swankie in more action-oriented roles.The performance of Bob Wells is the film's other saving grace. Wells plays the handsome and charismatic, long-haired cult leader who brings the nomads together for their annual bacchanalia. Wells avoids the usual clich√©s and delivers his performances without hyperbole, which makes his character all the more chilling. The Bob Wells of Noman'sland is a messianic figure whose on-camera persona exercises minimalist restraint, leaving his excesses to our depraved imagination. Our desert caravan megalomaniac fantasies are left un-filmed... and thus safe from the puritanical reach of Hollywood censors.Perhaps the filmmakers intentionally avoided any semblance of plot or storyline to guide us through the journey of Nomadlandia. Perhaps Nomadlands is meant to be an abstract nihilistic journey into The Great Nothing in The Middle of Nowhere. Maybe the film only has meaning if watched under the influence of powerful psychotropic medicine, or perhaps it was not intended for an audience of sentient beings, or it may have been filmed to provide background imagery for those dying in a hospice setting to give the dying hope that whatever awaits them in the other world, they probably won't be pooping in a bucket. Then again, maybe it's just a documentary about driving around and doing nothing, which isn't very exciting. If I wanted to watch bums I'd drive over to my daughter's house and stare at her useless children until the police make me leave."
NOMADLAND,10 March 2021,5/10,"I don't know why this movie is important !!
The movie is so boring I wonder why the screenplay is nominated for many awards
This movie is documentary more than drama film
The only positive point of the movie are the great cinematography and directing and of course the leading of the great Frances macdornamd"
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,6/10,"Seriously Not worthy for Oscar, But Climax is Too Good, not a must watch but if you want to know why this movie got an Oscar and also for that Neat Climax, yeah you can watch this..."
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,4/10,"Lured by all the hype, and by my appreciation for Frances McDormand, I watched this movie with good expectations. I was utterly wrong.I realized that this would have been a trainwreck when, after ten minutes of super-slow nothingness, I was treated with a piano ding-ding in Ludovico Einaudi's style (actually, I later discovered that it's really by Ludovico Einaudi - good for him, but another sign of unimaginativeness by the filmmakers). After half an hour of random (gorgeous) landscapes, ""Moviemaking 101"" close shots and no signs of a plot whatsoever, with a supposedly deep line haphazardly thrown in every now and then, I had already checked three or four times how much screen time I still had to endure.At that point I fully realized what kind of movie this is: a sly, insincere film, built on purpose to please the American critics. A very boring movie that takes two hours to tell you that maybe you should drop everything you have and live in a van, mostly to forget a random stroke of bad luck that somehow hit you in life. How poetic!Someone must have thought: hey, why don't we remake ""Into the Wild"", but with a fashionable actress (undoubtedly very good, I don't challenge that), in the American West, and with even more shots of wonderful landscapes under a color-pumped sunset? It will certainly win the Awards. And so it was."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,10/10,"Chloe Zhao's superb Nomadland examines her protagonist's life compassionately and artfully. The aesthetic reflects reinforces the tone, which honors the characters' suffering, joy, weakness, and strength. The cinematography, performances, and pace are so forthright that it feels like real human vulnerability.The overall result is a cinematic treat that distinguishes itself effortlessly, rewarding viewers for being vulnerable with the film."
NOMADLAND,26 January 2021,4/10,"This movie's portrait of the nomads are people who choose to live that lifestyle. Just one harmonious community of people who want to live life to the fullest. When the situation hits rock bottom, there's always some family members to turn to and they're back on the road in no time. Unnecessarily glorified the nomads lifestyle.I may be cynical but I believe most people became homeless or ""houseless"" not by choice but by the circumstances and they each have a story to tell. Why can't someone use these materials to tell a story and raise people's awareness on the subject?I really wanted to like this film, but unfortunately, it just didn't live up to my expectations."
NOMADLAND,8 July 2021,10/10,"This film is so important to me. I think it has universal themes that will resonate with most people on the planet just now. The story is Fern's, and ours. Every frame, every word, every sound, every direction - every heartbeat - is so meticulously done. Frances McDormand's third Best Actress Academy Award was so well deserved I cried - just one more to go... A subtle epic, this really is a masterpiece of our time and perhaps the most deserving Best Picture Oscar winner of all time."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,4/10,"Having been following Francis McDormand's career since I can remember, I was looking forward to this film. Especially when I read that she also produced this. Alas, COVID-19 pandemic meant I had to wait for Disney + to release it in my country... (the incredulity of this very fact is spectacular!)Well, this film has been such a disappointment for me. McDormand's underplayed yet poignant performance aside, this film seems to miss fire on all levels and accounts. It had such a potential for self-reflection and self-evaluation, yet it did not deliver for me.I feel that this is due to the economic elite, (see Hollywood's multi-billion dollar entertainment industry), attempting to be self-reflective on the American society and on those who have nothing...This has been plagued with emotional and sociopolitical tripes of gigantic proportions; vis-a-vis, clich√© after clich√©; stereotype after stereotype, the film attempts to inculcate to the viewer the vastness and depths of the characterisation on screen. Yet it fails to deliver for me.Perhaps the film's themes and leitmotifs cannot transpose onto an international market; especially as the world still tries to get its head around the catastrophic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; perhaps this endeavour is aimed at a US-specific audience / market only."
NOMADLAND,17 March 2021,5/10,"I watched for an hour but it was clear the movie had zero plot. Just randomly following the lead character around doesn't make a plot. Even an hour in, there wasn't anything that grabbed my attention or made me want to look forward to what was coming next. It's a film that hasn't decided whether it wants to be a documentary or a feature film.Even with only one main character, I felt no connection to her. No highs or lows - kind of like living a boring life with a 9 to 5 job where you have nothing to really get excited about."
NOMADLAND,2 February 2021,10/10,"Many reviewers found that the rough life of nomads in the US has been idealised and that the movie does not really show the daily hardships they endure.
I agree. But the movie is about something else. The main character, the great Frances McDormand, is not happy but it is resilient. She is not a good person in particular but can be kind and warm to others and kind and warm to herself. She lives her life unfazed by the hardships she has to endure and that have sucked most of the vitality or feelings out of her. She is not capable to settle down, not capable to fall in love, not capable to make friends or laugh or have a good time. As if ever since her husband died and the town that she lived in disbanded her soul has been taken away as well.The movie ends with her visiting her former town and finding her empty home. It looks less hospitable than her tiny van, where she spends all her life. But the empty house might be also a metaphor for her heart, her soul, her body depleted of all energies. Fern- what a lovely name - does not really live as a nomad. She merely lingers the vast American plains, surviving and resisting. The movie is about resilience, is about injustice and hardship. It shows all these in the most wonderful way."
NOMADLAND,22 August 2021,9/10,"It might have been partly due to my state of mind and my environment, but this movie really struck a chord with me. I watched this on a lazy Sunday with the time needed to really take it in. It's what my wife and I call a ""day in the life"" movie. I love Francis McDormand in everything she's done and she was as good as ever in this movie. I felt like I was along for the ride in her van, taking in her life, her struggles and her growth. I highly recommend this to anyone thinking of leaving behind your typical life of chasing the almighty dollar."
NOMADLAND,11 January 2021,3/10,"1. Nomadic people are real by choice, & not by choice
2. Nomadic people, are MUCH smarter than the lead character.
They would prepare as much as possible, before they set out.
If they had a vehicle, they would not set out, without a spare tire, jumper cables, antifreeze, oil, tow rope, matches, water, food, decent tires, etc.
3. Nomadic people, wouldn't go anywhere without a map, or route, or destination pre planned.
4. They'd try to not go way out on long stretches of road alone.
They'd either become nocturnal, & stick to small roads between towns, & sleep during the DAY, among other vehicles parked at length, such as at hospital, airport, tourist destinations, beach parking, and grocery stores, etc., or keep to large highways, that have rest/truck stops, where driver's are allowed to sleep at night. They'd go to a different place to sleep every day, as to not be spotted.
5. They'd try to be as presentable, as possible, so as not to stand out as homeless, or a vagrant. The main character, had noticeably unkempt hair, like she didn't know combs were invented.
6. The lead character, was gruff to everyone, but people still wanted to interact with her. That wouldn't happen in reality.
7. The lead character seemed to have several options, but rebuked virtually all of them, seemingly for no reason.
8. van dwellers, do have to use buckets as toilets, but it didn't show what they do to get rid of it, out in the middle of nowhere for days.
9. how did she power up her phone & power drill?
10. in the giving away scene, most nomads wouldn't keep that amount of stuff, in the 1st place, because any storage space, is needed for vital stuff.
11. a nomad, would not choose to sleep in the frigid cold, if they had a warmer choice.
12. They wouldn't leave a lot of stuff in storage somewhere because thy might not make it back to get it, after leaving. They'd either take it with them, or have others keep it safe for them.
13. most nomads don't have someone, to ""borrow"" large sums of money from, to borrow or payback.
14. if your van dies, you lose everything. Most nomads don't have thousands of dollars for emergency car repairs, nor anyone to ""borrow"" from.
15. In this film, she was never really unsafe. In reality, females traveling alone, are usually propositioned at least once on their journey.
16. The RV gatherings, really do happen, if you join an RV club, such as Escapees. Quartzite, used to be a gathering place for nomads, until a large group, demanded the local government provide services (water especially), then the local government, then subdivided the land into lots, and mass parking was prohibited, as far as I know.
17. even after meeting the lady with Cancer, who might just drop dead who knows where, having to ""borrow"" thousand of dollars, being stranded with nothing, getting sick, & tending the sick, being invited to settle down, she chose to supposedly keep driving into the unknown. That defies logic.
18. she seemed to survive, but not really embrace the actual lifestyle."
NOMADLAND,4 January 2021,9/10,"What Chloe Zhao and Frances McDormand have created in 'Nomadland' is simply breathtaking and beautiful. This is truly the best film of the year and what a film it is! I consider myself quite emotionally inept but this had me tearing up over the littlest details of life - never overdramatised, always human and touching. The Academy better be handing out statues for what would be an incredibly deserving winner."
NOMADLAND,30 August 2021,7/10,"I understood her financial and housing situations as being background.The loss she carries is deep. You can feel it and see it in her eyes. I understand why this movie got a lot of attention and awards. It made me feel and think about love and loss, too.About the other stuff, like being houseless by choice, I see the point people make. She indeed could have taken different paths and made different choices. Maybe better ones. That's a constant in all our lives. But I felt empathy for her and I understood her. I couldn't point the finger and say she was simply wrong, you know?Either way, not a fantastic drama, but a good one. It touches the harsh reality of a lot of people regarding jobs, money, housing..."
NOMADLAND,4 March 2021,6/10,"Certainly not deserving of the accolades it's receiving from the hive mind critics. Give a critic a blank canvas and they will rationalize it as genius. The cinematography is excellent, the story is simple and straightforward and Frances McDormand plays the same role she has played for the last 26 years (so either you like that or you don't). The ""real"" nomads clash horribly with the actors and are very easy to identify given how uncomfortable they are on camera. Supposedly this makes Chloe Zhang a genius to blend professional actors with genuine nomads, but in reality it breaks the forth wall more noticeably Jimmy Fallon winking into the camera during a failed sketch.The parts that worked were the call to nature, the big questions asked of American capitalism and the crushing expectation of the American dream. All of that was interesting but this movie only raises questions and has no interest in seeking answers. I didn't find it particularly sad so much as banal but I think that was very intentional.I am left wondering at the end of it, was the movie glamorizing the restless wanderers or showing that their choice to live without roots was just another way of running from the inevitable pain that life doles out? I think it intended the former but actually implied the latter. Worthy of a watch, not worthy of any major awards."
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,4/10,"I understand that the pandemic has created a slow year for film, but that is not an excuse to allow a subpar film to win best picture when there were other better options.A melancholy film about a nomad being homeless but not truly homeless, and yet I felt nothing, no emotions, but the urge to go to sleep.Great acting from Frances McDormand could not make up for this disappointing film. I admire Zhao's attempt, but let's hope the Eternals does not turn out to be snoozefest.It WAS a very beautiful film packed full of sunset shots, but if I wanted shots of the desert I would've put on National Geographic."
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,6/10,"The acting was great. The attention to detail in the directing was great. The adventurous views and scenic shots were great. It's just, somewhere along the line you have to start telling a story. This movie simply didn't do that."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,9/10,"This is a haunting thought provoking film of what happens when life falls apart and for various reasons people become houseless. Not homeless for their home is a van, RV, car. It is not an idealized high class RV but tough living.What makes this film so amazing is it is part film and part documentary. Many of the characters are not actors but real Nomads featured in the amazing book Nomadland. I checked the book out of the library after watching the film. Now I want to watch the movie again. Just a real thought provoking film. Highly recommended."
NOMADLAND,17 September 2021,4/10,"It's not that I'm too simple-minded to appreciate artsy films, because I love me a slow burn. But this just wasn't the great film that people made it out to be. The story certainly could have used a little edge, the pacing was painful, and they made some very odd decisions with the cinematography. Not a bad movie, but certainly not a best picture."
NOMADLAND,31 December 2020,8/10,"It's been too long since there's been a film of this calibre. Absolutely one of a kind through and through, just give Frances McDormand the well deserved Oscar already. This film taps in to something special, it's an artistic gem. The sunrise scenery shots are STUN-NING."
NOMADLAND,22 April 2021,6/10,"This is an interesting film that allows you to join the protagonist in her journey through the USA where she meets different types of people. I like it because you can learn the pros and cons of the nomadic life. I didn't like though the completely absence of meanness. Suddenly, all these nomads are good persons, helping each other, gathering and singing around the fire. Evil is everywhere and no community is perfect so the movie is unrealistic. In any case, it is a nice movie."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,2/10,"I really wanted to give this a chance but there was absolutely nothing redeeming about this film, not one character, or plot line.I'm shocked and curious about how this has good reviews."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,1/10,"Dear Lord... where to start. I love McDormand but that ain't enough. I dont quite understand where this film wants to take its viewer. Hard reality? Never feels like it, all too serene. Advert for alternative life? Nope, that dont work either, unless eating burgers by the minute and crapping alfresco are your life's ambitions.As for the music.... oh that damned soundtrack was like Richard Clayderman on speed, it is constant and annoying, trying to fill the void of the images blandness by adding more bland into your ears. The whole thing is all syrup and made up reality, nothing happening and lines that are soooo cliched.. I could have wept had I not been yawning so much.I love slowwwww movies, love'em. But they have to move. Just a little bit. Like there's a point to make?? This was just watching nothing. Could have seen a 5 minute montage of deserted landscapes, inside a van and outside and a picture of McDormand looking out soulfully. That would have been 1hr43 off my life saved for better use.Imdb asks whether a review contains spoilers. Would be hard in this case to find anything as spoilers.I am guessing this will be a film that will be forgotten very quickly."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,3/10,At all. The entire time. Ever. Like for real. Nothing happens.
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,4/10,"And admit that you watched this bc of Frances McDormand. You knew what you were getting yourself into before you started watching. They hit ""record"" on the camera and asked an incredible actress to do her thing...""Just walk out there and cook and we'll capture it.""People who liked ""The Florida Project"" in 2017 will love this movie and find a heartfelt meaning.But it just isn't for me."
NOMADLAND,20 December 2020,6/10,"See those images of Frances McDormand walking thru a bleak sunset landscape? There are dozens and dozens of those shots. They make up the bulk of the film, as if the makers were thrilled with ""Days of Heaven"" and it's minimalist photography. But that film at least had two characters to interact for a story to develop. This film is basically a solo effort where we are to get character, motivation, inner thoughts all from McDormand's face in closeup. This could have been a ""Grapes of Wrath"" type of film, based on its subject matter and milieu. However, you know what motivated the Joads, but McDormand's character offers very little insight as to what drives her"
NOMADLAND,17 May 2021,7/10,"Frances McDormand is always highly enjoyable but this film falls short of some of her best work (such as 3 Billboards).The cinematography and music are wonderful, but the story falls a little short.It feels like the film wants to be a thought-provoking, wanderlust inducing epic, but it is too shallow and too slow for it to be classed as such.Good, but not great."
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,9/10,"I really appreciate movies that prompt me to think and manage to stir my emotions without telling me what I'm supposed to think and how I'm supposed to feel. So I really enjoyed Nomadland, and I think you will, too.The characters are relatable and admirable, and their stories are simple and believable. Almost every character in the movie (either fictional or real-life) reminded me of someone I know in my own circle of friends and acquaintances. The pace of the film is perfect, keeping you engaged and always moving forward, but also allowing for some personal reflective thought along the way.I was inspired by the clear but not overly-dramatized themes of courage, perseverance, independence, and adventure. The relationships in the movie - with their subtle tension and unmistakable but guarded affection - inspired me to invest more of my time in cultivating more meaningful relationships with the ones I love.I think it's worth a couple hours of your time, for sure."
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,9/10,"Who are you? What defines you? What makes you who you are?Is it your job? Your marriage? The place where you have spent the last 20 years living?Who are you now if all these have gone away just like that?This is a movie about grief and searching. Grief over loss of husband, loss of job, loss of residence and loss of self-identity as you have no idea who you are anymore without all these defining elements in your life.In this process of grief, you slowly search / find / develop a new life story of yourself. In the movie, the main character did so by hoping onto a RV and traveling across the American West. In the journey, she takes on part-time jobs to sustain basic needs. She meets people from all walks of life, who have also experienced setbacks and are trying to figure out what life is in their own way.. This might seem insecure or unstable to many people's eyes. But sometimes, this is what we need in times of change. With new experiences, and with reflections and having a talk with the little voice in your heart, you begin to look at life from a different angle of view. The new you begins to emerge.This is what this movie is about. Not a sad story that makes you feel life is terrible or unbearable, amidst losses of all kinds. It describes the loss and find process in a tranquilizing, peaceful and calming way that makes you think, ""yes, this is what life is all about"". Creating your new self over and over again.That's why we are never alone. No matter what our own story was, is and will be, we are all travelers of life that continuously seek the meaning of who we really are. If we are willing to open our hearts, we will always meet people who are willing to share, to embrace and to accept us as we are and gives us that little candle of light that keeps us going in our very own journey."
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,9/10,"First of all, Nomadland is a very slow paced, character-driven movie. It is surprisingly deep and emotion and it is this emotion, along with Frances McDormand inspired performance, that keeps you hooked to the screen.Having done my share of travelling and bonfires, Nomadland reminded me a lot of those times and I believe everyone who has had the oppurtinity to travel and sleep in the open will relate to it.The directing is truly amazing, every shot was carefully planned and the landscapes are gorgeous.To sum up, don't except any suspense or twists or secret meanings. This is just a simple, yet beautiful movie about Fern and his journey."
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,5/10,Beautifully shot and well acted but really not so much character drive as platitude drive
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,7/10,"Careers are for fools
Houses are for inmates
Assets are for idiots
Money is a cruel taskmasterHOMES, in whatever shape or form are for the wise
And happiness is the only real measure of successThere's a bit of everyone in this film, and for some its tantalizingly close / possible - me included!But for many it's a dream that is unachievable due to of self imposed 'chains' - careers, house's, assets, money etc!...and, yes, there is 'No Last Goodbye'....out on the road!"
NOMADLAND,31 March 2021,10/10,"What a beautiful movie. The directing by the talented chloe zhao, I hope she wins for best Picture and best director.The feelings i got through the whole movie was something I never experienced in a movie, things that makes you think of you life.And again another amazing performance by frances mcdormand."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,1/10,I don't know why I forced myself to watch more than an hour of a miserable women life
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,7/10,"I've waited nearly a year to venture back into a movie theatre. Nomadland was the film I felt I needed to see on the big screen. Before heading out to the AMC movie complex, we considered the possibility that there might be an issue with seating restrictions due to Covid. As it turns out, we ended up having a private showing of Nomadland on an Imax screen.As a fan of the book and national parks, I was looking forward to this film. I think we all have a bit of nomad in us. Who hasn't thought about how nice it would be to hit the road and see the country? The truth, of course, is that the romanticized view of this lifestyle doesn't always jell with reality.This film captures the reality:The crowded RV parks
The seasonal part-time work
The negative impact on your health due to poor sleep and dietWhat was missing for me was the grandeur of nature. There were a few scenes that captured it. There just wasn't enough of them. I felt the film needed to show more of the beauty.There are tradeoffs in the nomad lifestyle. The film spent too much time on the hardships without showing the flipside, like waking up surrounded by nature.Still, I give the director credit for making a film with a limited cast and a mostly ad-lib script. Frances McDormand held the film together. Was it Best Actress worthy? Is this film worthy of a Best Picture nomination? I would say that the answer to both is probably yes, but I believe that there are better films and performances out there.Speaking of better films. If you want to see a movie that captures the grandeur of hitting the road, I recommend the Netflix documentary Expedition Happiness: two people, a dog, and a retrofitted bus."
NOMADLAND,13 March 2021,1/10,"I couldn't watch the movie without taking breaks from watching it... It is extremely boring. I watched it mainly because Frances McDormand is in it, and I also like David Strathairn as an actor.This film is Extremely Boring."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,7/10,"A very well shot and very well acted meditation on a lifestyle only a few of us could actually do. And....that's about it. Yup. The acting is incredible as one would expect with this cast. However, I must give a massive shout out to the non-actors in the film. They gave some of the best performances from non-actors I have ever seen. Francis McDormand is great as always. David Strathairn is great as always, when the film actually wants him to stick around and be apart of the story. Filmed and edited like a Terrence Malick, Nomadland focuses majority of it's time and energy on its striking cinematography shots, rather than focusing on telling a compelling story. The fact is I wanted to hear the REAL stories from the non-actors, instead of following the FAKE story from the writer, producer, and director of Nomadland. At an hour and 47 minutes this film is 20 minutes too long, and dare I say is lacking in substance. The dangers of living as a nomad? Certainly there has to be many. How strangers see this lifestyle when in public. How does Francis McDormand constantly have gas money?....Amazon does not pay that well. The things we should see more of were instead replaced with knowing how McDormand's character goes #2. The pacing of the film is very slow. Sadly, it gets boring about an hour in. The director is also the editor and does not know when to cut out any of her cinematography shots. Where as Terrence Malick'a Tree of Life used a lot of environmental cinematography shots to create mood, and a great sense of wonder to the film's spiritual awe. Here it feels forced and added just to increase the film's runtime. And to also look pretty. I will admit, I am being harsh. Nomadland is a very good film, but even I have to admit to stretching this positive review. In a 2020 year where great films were strongly lacking, I feel a little more compelled to give this film a little more credit than it truly deserves. Any other year, this film would've been overlooked, and rightly so. It is a good film, but that's about it. In a year without much competition, a basic good film like Nomadland will be hailed as best overall...when in reality...it isn't."
NOMADLAND,22 March 2021,1/10,"As someone who dabbles in van life, I was really looking forward to this movie. It ended up making me feel depressed and bored. I wanted so badly for Fern, the main character, to have a purpose or undertake a large adventure in her van. I would have loved to see personality in any of the characters but everything and everyone was just so sad. Sad music, sad scenes, sad, sad, sad. Not much of a plot or story. Just blah. I really don't have anything good to say about it."
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,7/10,"It's a realistic film that shows how difficult life on the road really is for people like Fern, without showing the false idealism of travelers in a RV that could very easily have been shown. This film is reminiscent of ""Into The Wild"", another fantastic film capable of changing our outlook on life.
I don't even need to say that Frances McDormand's performance was absolutely impeccable and may well win Oscar for best actress in a leading role this year. I liked Chlo√© Zhao's style of directing that fit the film like a glove. The purpose of this film is not to grab the viewer on the screen, but rather to show how difficult it is to have Fern's way of life.
7/10"
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,9/10,"From start to finish, every element in the movie are detailed so perfectly. The film focusses on how capitalist system forces the people to buy, waste, and spend everything they earn, which becomes a vicious cycle. However, Fern decides to take the role of an ""outsider"" and rejects this idea of obeying the system. As a ""houseless"" person, Fern only takes what she needs from this capitalist system and does not give back what she earns. In that way, ""Nomadland"" is a brilliant movie showing the viewers that there is a way out of this cycle, that ruins people's lives and forces them to be as wasteful as they can be."
NOMADLAND,30 May 2021,4/10,"I'm sure there are some good things about this film, but I found it so dull I began to resent it more and more, and was unable to appreciate the good bits."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,10/10,"20 minutes into the movie and I was already in tears, I get all these negative reviews, this movie is not for everyone, but I felt and enjoyed every second of it. It is well-acted, well directed, the cinematography is amazing, and the dialogues are really powerful. The movie overall is a true masterpiece in my opinion, but I say it again, It's not for everyone."
NOMADLAND,28 November 2021,3/10,Hmmm well I was disappointed. Could have been good but very dull. I get the subject but the main character didn't seem to be enjoying the Nomad life. Or have any affinity with it so why would I as a viewer be interested?! The other cast were much better and truly embraced their life path.
NOMADLAND,8 April 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is not your typical intro-climax-conclusion film, so not everyone is going to enjoy it's realism-style of approach. That being said, it is still an emotionally riveting experience.With this film, it seems that Chloe Zhao is trying to provide an ambiguous observation. She is not telling you what to think, and so it can be hard to follow at times. For what it is trying to do, it is, for the most part, successful.8.5/10."
NOMADLAND,14 July 2021,,"Best Director? Yes.Best Actress? Yes.Best Picture? No way, give it to another nominee.But i think it won just because of Ludovico Einaudi, his masterpiece that fits so well with the tone of this movie. So lucky for Nomadland, I doubt if wasn't him."
NOMADLAND,4 March 2021,10/10,"""Beautiful"" is the only word you could use to describe this movie. I know that a lot of people are going to call it boring or structure-less, point-less or that it doesn't have a plot and it's just events that come one after the other, but those are people who don't understand it. You might ask: "" Why am I bringing this up?"". Because I know that this is for most people this is the first movie by Chloe Zhao that they see and all those negative reviews might influence the way that they see not only this film but also her other work, and wile yes it might have some not so entertaining moment, boring is a word only a extremely ignorant person would use ( to be more clear, only a person who didn't understand the film and it's segnificanse would use ). Let me clarify : let's take a agreed upon ""good"" film like Titanic ( I am aware of the fact that Titanic has been considered ""controversial"" in the past few years and wile I have not picked the side I'm on just yet, neither of those things will stop me from proving my point,so we'll let that slide), so Titanic has rising action and forbiden romance , and it's clear from the very begining that it's doomed to end in heartbreak . So , in a word, Titanic makes you feel emotional, Nomadland does something way harder (and way less done especially in film) , it explores emotion, deep,raw,real,human emotion , but not just emotion, human expirience as well. This as I mentioned is something way less done and way harder to do, and there are those few directors who do it flawlessly , Chloe Zhao being one of them, and for that reason alone she should be considers of the greatest directors of all time and understandeblly all of her films (not just Nomadland) should be considerd masterpieces.*just as a side-note,sorry for any spelling mistakes I might have made, English is not my native language*"
NOMADLAND,14 January 2021,6/10,"It wasn't good
Poor output
There is a weakness in the performance of the actors"
NOMADLAND,9 June 2021,4/10,"The plot is quite shallow and nothing else compensates for it. Except for the visuals, everything in this film was a let-down. Good acting with a bad script, Dull movie with a slow speed."
NOMADLAND,11 July 2021,8/10,"Great work but not deserving of an academy award, they've lost touch with what people see as great films. Its become so political its no wonder less and less watch the oscarsBut them aside, the film is very documentary but original, feels like a road trip, camping escape. Some lovely moments, but I find the film is confused as to what it really wants, so its experimental."
NOMADLAND,26 July 2021,5/10,"Nomadland had some interesting moments, but I found it, in general, to be boring. I know that others really like it, but it just wasn't what I like."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,2/10,"As more than one reviewer has suggested, with just a few nudges the film could have easily been made into a documentary. No real need for someone with McDormand's capabilities, just about anyone can stare into space for half the film. No real point to the film and minimal entertainment value. Don't waste your time with it."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,5/10,"Before I watched this, I cynically thought that there would probably be a LOT of shots of Frances McDormand gazing over a desert horizon at sunset. Check! McDormand is so naturally appealing in her roles, she was this movie's only saving grace; well, there was some decent cinematography too. It did have a hypnotic quality, but none of the dots really connected. Did she have a sense of growing pride at her independence? Did she come to appreciate relationships more than she did in the past? How did a greater appreciation for nature liberate her -- and from what? Who knows? McDormand basically seems pretty bored with the life she's leading in the film -- so the viewer is too, at least this one was."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,2/10,"What's going on with the people who decides the awards? This movie is nothing special, I was super excited but the excitement vanished after 15mn. Good note could be a ok documentary."
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,6/10,"Ok, so it's well-directed, Frances McDormand is always good, and the other actors do a good job, too. But all in all it really doesn't amount to much. The dim/dreary wintery lighting and tones are supposed to help set a mood but that's a little obvious and gets old after a bit. Is everyone so blown away by this movie because they never thought about how so many people live, in various ways, around the fringes of our typically middle income, middle American, middle of the road way of life? Truly? Maybe so, in which case a hell of a lot of people need to wake up. In any case I think this is a mildly enjoyable and interesting effort that will be forgotten in not too many years."
NOMADLAND,28 August 2021,9/10,"I waited to watch this, I'd seen the reviews and waited to watch, I enjoyed it
I think age has a lot to do with it, being 55 and knowing life not always will be favourable to some retirees, it can be their way of life in the end
Having real life people involved, was wonderful, it's tough, but they love their love
FM was great, and in this time of what is happening around the world, life is precious and if these people in real life can still enjoy some normality then they are in the best place, they can social distance and life unrestricted."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,3/10,"I've seen worse, but this movie is pretty low on the totem pole. You can take a 10-20 min bathroom or food break without pausing and all you've missed is more of the same-a woman that goes from job to job to make ends meet, while making temporary friends and engaging in meaningless chit chat about any and everything under the sun. This is more like a BORING documentary than a drama. To call it a drama is an insult to good drama flicks and if you like documentaries, don't waste your 2 hours on this one."
NOMADLAND,13 January 2021,10/10,"It is a movie dedicated to those who seem to be outcasts for others. But in reality it is about those who intentionally choose their own way of being. These people have a variety of feelings, such as loss, grief, or loneliness. Nomads are certainly not mad at someone or something from their past but rather supportive and compassionate to those who lost their path. Although they might say that a vehicle is their home, their true home is within, thus everywhere. What unites all of them is what every one of us is eager to get - freedom.If you want to take a peek at how a human's life could look outside standards of living imposed by the majority I'd definitely recommend watching this picture."
NOMADLAND,21 July 2021,4/10,"The movie is simply nothing. It begins, a lot of cut scenes, beautiful scenery and sunset, and it ends. No story. It doesn't touch the dangers faced by homeless people. Just sadness and apathy."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,10/10,"The people in this film made me feel so grateful, and the naturalistic approach to this film deepened my appreciation for Cinema. This work of art is a masterpiece that every American should watch."
NOMADLAND,9 July 2021,4/10,"Another type of situation where feminists / women director are praised just because what they are.Also you can't say this movie is bad, because people will tell you ""go watch spider man, this movie is for grown-ups""."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,9/10,"This is a simple film with a simple story. If you want something overly complicated then don't watch this movie. The life of a nomad isn't complex, so there is no need for the film to be. This is a story about life and the relationships created. And most of all, this is a lesson to us all."
NOMADLAND,18 February 2021,10/10,"This is a very beautiful and moving movie. You get to have a peek into the journey of this woman's life as a ""nomad"". Its very subtle, but intensely moving. It's a very real movie. They dont leave much out. I think it depicts this way of life quite well, and the story and writing itself is beautiful. I do think it directs the story of this woman, Fern, through her experiences along her journey, as if the journey itself defined her in some way. And they couldn't have chosen a better lead actress to play Fern, Frances Mcdormand doesnt ever disappoint. Her performance was flawless. To top it off, the score was very beautiful too. I think the music led the theme of the entire movie, and helped direct Fern's story/journey.
I think its definitely worth a watch, for sure. It's not your typical movie...you arent going to get alot of action or drama...mostly unique subtleties that really sets this movie apart from many others. However, it is not a dull movie. There are these very funny moments in the movie that just make you laugh hard, and then there are these very sad moments, that you make you tear up. It's an experience, for sure, a very ""real and full of life"" experience, and one that shouldn't be missed or taken for granted. Because it's the small things about this movie that makes it so beautiful and unique. Just take some time from a long busy day, and watch this movie...it will move you, make you laugh, cry, and feel things you haven't felt in a long time, I'm sure. Take a chance, and watch this beautiful, moving and unique movie."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,8/10,"Not my type of flick, no action, violence, intrigue, but I liked it a lot. Austere beauty."
NOMADLAND,12 January 2021,6/10,"You can see that the director wanted to transcend with a deep film, based on characters who feel a deep wound, etc, etc .. But something should happen throughout the film, something more interesting beyond seeing the depressed protagonist wandering around.
One thing is true, she is great, it was the only reason to see the movie and as far as that I do not regret it."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,9/10,"Having read a number of the (particularly negative) reviews, I am astonished at how few people understood the heart of this movie. It is ok if you weren't engaged, though simply say that.The movie is about loss. All the stuff that happens ie. Living in a trailer, roaming around the country meeting strangers, being financially strapped and not having stability, meeting people you connect with & might have a future with, and even having a loving family that wants you stay with them -- that's all noise.When one experiences loss & displacement like Frances' character, you become a little numb. Sad. Eternally weighed down and trapped in the past. You are stuck. You feel a void that won't be fulfilled by the things most normal people feel fulfilled by. Good things may come by, though they arent enough to fill the void. Or perhaps they are, but they are too afraid to to be open to the possibility of it being real. You fear another loss. So, your nomadic existance is a better bet, than taking a gamble on something better only to experience a new loss. Not everyone will handle it this way. Some may find fulfilment of their void by helping others. Others will find other ways.The fulfilment from this nomadic lifestyle is borne out of having no expectations of anyone or any place; so, there is little chance or further disappointment or pain that can be felt. There is a freedom and release in knowing and feeling this. This becomes clear towards the end of the movie.This story and her character is a hard one to connect with, and for those that do, its a daily battle whatever their life. For those that don't connect with the character, its a blessing. In a way, if you didn't get the movie it probably also means you are one of the lucky ones not to have experienced real loss."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,1/10,"I don't see the point of making movies like this,it dragging and depressing and boring and works like sleeping pills.
I gave it one star because that's the bottom place in IMDB rating and I couldn't go lower ,I am sure great critics who always race to get ahead of each other's may have different ideas but you know what do not waste your money and time."
NOMADLAND,1 July 2021,2/10,"Wow this movie was really helpful against my insomnia I soon grew tired of watching it and frankly I really can't understand why it was awarded. The members of the jury seem to be afraid of giving a prize to a funny , brilliant movie. Frances McDormand and her Steinbeck-would be interpretations are boring and repetitive !"
NOMADLAND,15 August 2021,4/10,Seriously. I can't even craft a witty response to tell you how uninteresting this movie is. They missed the mark. This is basically about a lame lady that walks around and does mundane jobs and has pointless small talk with mundane people. If you want to know what this movie is about just film yourself everyday but when you go into your house just turn the camera off. Waste of time. I gave it a four because it isn't even worth hate watching.
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,5/10,"Sorry, but the movie is...boring and strange. It's overrated, to be honest."
NOMADLAND,10 October 2021,9/10,"Your reaction to this film will likely depend on your own values. The individuals shown in this film have come to where they are through personal and financial loss, and must perform sometimes degrading, low-income, seasonal jobs to survive, while contending with pity, incomprehension, and even anger from those still within mainstream society. Yet their lifestyle is a conscious choice. Most of the ""performers"" in the film are true nomads who have made this choice in real-life.My husband considered the film depressing, because he could not bear to live in the conditions lived by the people in the film. What he, and others, saw is a film about a woman forced into a ""homeless"" nomadic lifestyle by economic hardship, scraping by. I found the film uplifting, because in my view, this film was about a lifestyle choice being discovered and eventually embraced, despite the pressures from mainstream society to return to their fold."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,3/10,Just a few conversations. The only thing that can be rescued it's the incredible and fantastic music by Ludovico and the good photography.
NOMADLAND,16 July 2021,2/10,"I'm glad not to have paid to see this and that I didn't waste time, since I saw it on an airplane.The director, who showed so much promise describing America, with no-name actors up until this film can be described only as a sell-out. And so early in her career.Another sell-out is the huge product placement is so blatant, it almost goes without mentioning.Think, large ecommerce company.Nice photography backdrop and camera work for depression, poverty and homelessness."
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,7/10,"If you're not into art movies, do yourself a favor and don't watch Nomadland. All in all I liked the movie. My only critique is the length of the movie. It should have been 15-20 shorter."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,6/10,"I was looking forward to this movie, just to be disappointed by a slow moving film that kept going in circles with a main character who's facial expression hardly changes for the nearly two hours it lasts. There aren't really any spoilers to give away.The film is not deep, and it's not very moving, actually it's rather forgettable.It shows a drab side of the US, populated with sad people of varying mental sharpness with occasionally beautiful landscape shots."
NOMADLAND,24 July 2021,4/10,I fell asleep. No character development and overall nothing really happened throughout the entire 1hr 40 mins.
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,6/10,Someone living for 30 years on the edge of a town way out there and working at a factory doesn't know how to fix a tire! Sorry the whole story if you can call it that is contrived with a sloppy script. If it wins Zhao owes it to her cinematographer partner Joshua Richards.
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,9/10,"Honestly just an exceptional piece of art. Frances McDormand is amazing as always and hits her tones so well. The most emotional and breathtaking moments were when the light was shone on other talent. Swankie brought me to tears with her monologue. It was so captivating and so emotional; so raw. This film is a great look into the lives, beliefs and dignities of people who choose to live without a house."
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,9/10,"Tender, heartwarming and sad at times but full of joy in others. Captures the most beautiful and modest moments in life and takes pleasure and understands the importance of small things and also the profound impact that connecting with nature has on us as human beings. The people we meet in life have all lived full lives and sometimes we maybe take that for granted, it's nice to take a minute to really think about things in life we can maybe overlook. I think this film did a good job of that."
NOMADLAND,9 August 2021,5/10,"I was looking for this movie. I admire and follow Frances McDormand since I saw Fargo. She loves playing complex, unhappy characters, but this one was too linear. Also there is no plot and everybody seems to get on well with everybody, which I am sure it is not the case in nomad world. Maybe all it is too subtle for me and the movie does not resonate with pragmatic, down-to earth people. Therefore this movie can make one think and understand oneself better. Last but not least, I loved the sceneries. Therefore, even If I consider it overrated, I would say that it worth seeing it."
NOMADLAND,27 September 2020,7/10,"Sometimes it takes an outside viewpoint to give us true perspective. We don't really know ourselves until someone pulls back the veil and shows us our true selves, and often... we don't like what they show us.It took a gifted filmmaker, who also happens to be a Chinese National to once again show North-Americans a little nugget of our history that we might not know about, but also might not enjoy hearing.Chloe Zhao, who is set to tackle Marvel's Eternals next year is one of the most subtle and grounded filmmakers of this generation, but she is also an impeccable story teller, and she relies not on large budgets or huge Hollywood names to tell these stories, she relies on authenticity and human connection. The juxtaposition of going from her small, personal stories to the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs to be addressed; it's akin to helping with your cousin's taxes for years, and then suddenly being asked to head a Fortune-500 company.Zhao's Nomadland, based on the novel by Jessica Bruder is the story of a forgotten part of the Boomer generation. There are those in their 50s, 60s and perhaps older who just can't afford to retire. They need to work to survive, and they need to keep moving to work. These Boomers are lost because the little industrial-driven towns they've lived in for years weren't meant for the modern world filled with those aforementioned Fortune 500 companies. Mines shut down, mills shut down, factories shut down, and it ends up killing their town.The film itself is basically a documentary, which is no surprise to anyone who has seen Zhao's previous work, most notably 'The Rider' in 2017. Zhao finds authenticity in using real people, not actors, and the stories they tell... are their stories. There's very little fiction in these films, which once again lends itself to the realness.Casting the only two actors in the entire film, the brilliant Francis McDormand as the main character Fern, and the equally brilliant David Strathairn, seems to be Zhao dipping her toes into the enormous sea she's about to dive into with Marvel. The two performances, however, are unlike anything these two actors have done before. They are almost non-existent in this film, and that should be taken with every ounce of positivity. They are not McDormand and Strathairn, they are Fern and Dave, and sadly, these characters are lost members of their generation, but certainly not lost on the audience even if they take a 'backseat' to the message of the film. The actors blend into the roles so beautifully, they seem like you've probably passed them a million times without noticing. McDormand even took embodying Fern to a fantastic level of commitment by working, sometimes for months, in the odd jobs that Fern has to work throughout her journey. There is nothing but legitimacy to every action McDormand performs, and every choice Fern makes. You believe everything.This is such a brilliant way to use these actors, because, ultimately... it is not their story. It's so rare you have a film where the characters are both 'moot' and yet compelling. This speaks to Zhao's ability to tell a story using all the tools at her disposal, and sometimes that means your character or your Academy-Award winning actors step back and let everything else in the film do the talking. Using the real 'Nomads' in the film, rather than actors, once again just adds that previously mentioned legitimacy. The feel of the film can be a little surreal, as it does feel part fact and part fiction, but it is unlike so many films out there because of it's focus on true experience rather than spectacle or imagination. What is truly surreal is how Zhao can find such a unique balance in everything she creates, it is a deft touch that very few filmmakers have.The only real downside to the film is that it isn't overly imaginative when it comes to conveying the story. This fits with Zhao's focus on realism, but the cinematography and story beats were all quite safe. There was no flair, which can make the story drag a little. The uncompromising performance of McDormand and the heart of the story is what drives it. It will be extremely interesting to see what Zhao does with Eternals, which will ironically could a very formulaic story that will require much more filmmaking flair.Nomadland, as mentioned, is unlike so many films out there because of its uncompromising nature. There is nary another filmmaker out there with the type of laser like focus of Chloe Zhao. The story itself may be specifically about one generation, but because of the amazing connection to its characters, and the empathy Zhao and McDormand craft, it will speak to anyone who has felt they were a part of a lost generation. And that... is the largest cinematic universe.Nomadland is scheduled to have a wider (yet probably limited) release December 4 2020.Grade: (B)"
NOMADLAND,5 October 2021,10/10,"I'm so glad I didn't read the reviews before watching this gem of a movie. Connecting with people on so many levels. Real people, real problems, real emotions.Living life on your own terms. It had it all, with superb acting, stunning cinematography and a realistic representation of human connections. It connected with me, I hope it will with others who are genuinely interested in how we might learn to see life from different perspectives and be respectful of our fellow travellers through life."
NOMADLAND,19 January 2021,9/10,"There are 4 reasons you should watch this movie:
1. a good story
2. Frances McDormand
3. the national parks
3. Ludovico Einaudi's piano music (literally, I'm still listening to his soundtrack right now!)
This movie is inspired by Jessica Bruder's book Nomadland. The main characters are the so-called ""workampers"", who live in their vans and are always ready to depart for the next job or destination. Unlike the book, the film does not talk too much about the economic background, such as the impact of globalization and the great recession (2008 financial crisis) on US people. Instead Chloe Zhao (the director) told a compelling story on the emotional journey of Fern (Frances McDormand), a working lady who just lost her husband, her job (US Gypsum), her town (Empire, Nevada) in 2011. She started workamping, met many interesting people, recollected her memories, and made her decisions to keep moving.I guess it is always hard to change our current status and to leave our familiar friends and homes. Sometimes we are forced to depart, otherwise it will need a lot of courage. No matter how you deal with it, a hole is likely to be left on your heart. Sometimes we choose to depart, because the burden we carry is too heavy to be forgotten. I guess this is what Fern learnt on her journey, and it makes me feel sad and simultaneously inspired.I have always adored Frances McDormand after Fargo, and more so after 3 Billboards. She is a perfect fit for this strong and restrained figure.I wish this country can offer more to these workampers, who are the true victims of the great recession and globalization."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,"If you find peace in mindfulness, beautiful scenery, and gentle, nuanced meanings I believe this is a film for you. So many are reviewing this film badly, I have to ask myself did they not read the synopsis or watch a trailer beforehand? The usual films Hollywood produces en mass for a public so clumsy and incurious, entertained by big colourful characters and noise will find this film flies straight over their heads, so they get angry because it didn't entertain them in the way they're used to being spoon fed. This film is a snapshot of someone dealing with life in a quiet, reserved manner, and I enjoyed taking 109 minutes out of my life to slow down and watch their very personal journey."
NOMADLAND,11 June 2021,10/10,It's a homeless movie. About people in the us of a who has no where else to go and about Amazon the shipping company. & about making a living in this strange world we live in guy's.
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,10/10,"Since the p-demic I've watched at least 3 movies a week and this is easily in the top 5 movies. This is people's real life. They literally have one foot in the gutter, and their head barely above water but they are searching for happiness not capital which is becoming more and more elusive for each subsequent generation since the ""greatest"" generation.
If you can't relate to loose concepts of freedom, liberty or never really had to think too deeply about economics, you probably won't think too highly of this film."
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,3/10,"Wow, probably the most pointless movie my wife and I have seen for years, as we left the movie theatre we had a couple say things like ""that was different"""
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,1/10,"This is the most boring movie I've ever seen. There's no point to this movie, yeah this is a movie about someone's life but that someone couldn't be more dull. So she lives in a van. This movie is so boring and I would never recommend!"
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,5/10,"This movie is pretty well shot, and the music is fine, but unfortunately it left a very bland taste in my mouth. After the first 15-20 minutes go by, nothing interesting happens. There isn't anything special, or interesting about this movie. It's flat out boring, and it's hilarious that this won best picture."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,4/10,"I couldn't figure out if Fern was living in her van by choice or by circumstances or maybe both. The pace was so slow, it was hard to keep attention. However, the subject matter was different than anything I've seen before.Frances Mcdormand is her usual amazing self and the scenery was gorgeous.This winning Best Picture in a year that was so awful and odd seems fitting somehow."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,7/10,Sometimes you get homesick and suddenly have the urge to explode in a bucket.
NOMADLAND,11 December 2020,10/10,"Happiness is relative. These Nomad's take care of each other like a family - But not being able to retire, working hard after working whole life is sad. Houseless - not homeless they say but i don't see much difference. The dead towns in middle of America is so sad."
NOMADLAND,8 July 2021,8/10,"Loneliness. Relationships. Home.These are some of the themes of the movie. I liked it. But I won't say I loved it or it penetrated straight into my heart. Maybe it will get better with time and re-watches. Or maybe I'm too young to completely relate to it. Looks good, with great frames and colors. Nomadland will meet you down the road."
NOMADLAND,22 November 2021,6/10,"Her taste in films is much different then mine. She said this movie was Brill. Yes it was a very good look into the world of self sufficient homelessness. A very real detailed look at the homeless struggles. But there was something celebratory of victim hood aspects to Nomadland. Im glad it won awards, but it just wasn't my type of movie."
NOMADLAND,25 July 2021,8/10,"I liked this movie but I can see it's not for everyone but many people who're getting into their senior life, and for one reason or another, has to make some life style changes (like me). It was a beautiful movie in so many ways with beautiful scenery and beautiful people, captured. The social issues that forced many of the people portrayed to live that lifestyle was very discreetly made, but still a strong statement in the film. If we live in a city we probably all see the homeless living on the streets, Nomadland showed the ones who although in similar circumstances had choosen to live and survive a lot better and in a much more dignified way."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,8/10,"It's about grief loss and not belonging. The people she met along the way, their stories that maybe puts things into perspective. What's important is not stuff. At the end of the film - It's dedicated to the ones who had to depart. See you down the road."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,10/10,I cried a lot. It shows how life can enjoy. I love it.
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,1/10,"This is a nice film. Well directed, filmed and acted. I can believe that the situations are true and many people will relate. Saying that, it's not particularly emotional, it's not really uplifting. Nice film yes, awards no. Best film? No way. Most hyped films turn out to be rubbish, add this one to the list."
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,10/10,"This is just a beautiful heartfelt movie. If your 18yrs old it might not be your cup of tea. If your in your 60's like me you'll love this. I'm tipping this for best movie,best director & best actress in the Oscars"
NOMADLAND,12 June 2021,8/10,"The movie looks beautiful and the music is beautiful. It tries to be an art house movie so badly and it worked. The story is touching and the actors are playing absolutely magnificent. I don't mind it being a slow movie, but something more could have happend or some more things about the life on the street could have been shown in my opinion."
NOMADLAND,19 January 2021,10/10,"It is a very sad movie.
I really felt its sadness in my heart."
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,9/10,Some movies stay with you tucked in. They will return to you at times to offer you strength or alleviate pain or offer a kind word. You can rely on it. This will be one such movie for me. Otherwise its a very slow movie that will test your patience.
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,10/10,"Frances McD's amazing yet wholly natural ability to mesh with this world communicates it to us seamlessly. The real-life characters accept her and share themselves with her - and of course with us - in a very real way. Frances allows us to fall in love with them as naturally as her character does. And as naturally as they fall for her. The addition of the Stathairn character is a brilliant add to Fern's story that shows how clearly we get to see what he, sweetly, misses. ((I won't add a spoiler here.) It makes me want to see them in more work together. This is a treasure of the American story."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,3/10,Watched because of the nominations and recognition from critics it's received but wow please don't waste your time with this movie . It has no storyline at all!!
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,6/10,"This is a grossly overrated movie in the film history.This movie is close to a documentary film than a drama, it has no structure, no story, no plot, no character development, it is too long and too boring and it is an average movie.Alfred Hitchcock once said, what's drama, but a life with dull bits cut out. This movie is full of dull bits that I was thinking about to stop watching it half way through, and I was keeping asking myself: ""when it is going to be end?"""
NOMADLAND,21 November 2020,8/10,"I saw this movie at the Stockholm International Film Festival 2020 and I really liked it. Frances McDormand is excellent as Fern, a woman who has lost everything and has more or less been forced to a nomadic life style on the road. Everything feels so believable, from the sparse dialogue to how each character react. Beautiful cinematography and a fantastic score makes this a big recommendation!"
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,3/10,"The acting is great. The rest of it is amusing and interesting for people who've never lived on the road. I lived full time in my van and traveled the West for almost 15 years and this movie depicts just a small fraction of the ups and downs and ins and outs of van life. The hardships and challenges of real van life were almost completely ignored, starting with the fact that our heroine enjoyed the luxury of ""shore power"" or being able to plug into outside electricity all of the time practically. Without, you can't run an AC, excessive heat being one of the most debilitating factors in van life. It's much harder to keep cool than it is to keep warm. Then, being constantly kicked out of parking spots and neighborhoods, the cops banging on your door always in the middle of the night, strange people rocking, kicking, hitting, spitting on, throwing food and paint on, and just generally disturbing the van at all hours. People break in, damage the outside, leave threatening notes, stalk and follow you. I have a big black dog, Bee, my faithful friend and traveling companion always with me. Looking ferocious but actually is a sweetheart, Bee is the perfect guard dog. I traveled and worked around the West as a horse wrangler and guide, chef, caterer, restaurant hostess, Gardener and landscaper, Italian faux finish painter, dog groomer, Executive Assistant, and caregiver to the elderly or ill for almost the entire time I lived in my van. My van life was 100 times more eventful and intense than that depicted in this movie. The only thing I DIDN'T do was go to an RTR. Which I do regret since the first ones, I've heard, were great for sharing DIY solutions. But I tended to avoid people, much less the crowds, so... In any event, they should have come to me; I could have given them a much truer depiction of real van life than this watered down one. ."
NOMADLAND,21 April 2021,3/10,It was a total snooze fest whole time waiting for some meaning or revalaztion but it was just a sometime in the life of movie that didnt go anywhere.
NOMADLAND,22 June 2021,4/10,"I don't understand how this deserved an Oscar
Boring boring boring."
NOMADLAND,25 October 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is a movie that touches in many dark themes: inequality, poverty, loneliness, grief yet you still get a feel good sensation at the end of it. It's a bitter sweet experience that encapsules the experiences of some north american workers that happen to be down on their luck. The movie portrays the fallout of the 2009 crisis and its dire consequences over the weakest links on our society, the menial job workers. The protagonist, after losing her house, her husband and her community ""decides"" to live a nomad life. And I mean ""decides"" (between quotes) because she has no other viable option that wouldn't make her a inconvenience to her family or friends. So she picks the cheapest possible option to maintain her independence and autonomy: The nomad lifestyle.The movie worked for me on two levels, individual and social (macro and micro).On the individual level, the main character called ""Fern"" has to deal with the lonely life of a modern nomad, that searches for seasonal jobs scattered all through the country. The liquidity of her personal relationships is evident through the movie, since people on the road are always coming from or going to somewhere, but still she manages to link up and maintain a bond with other people.And here is where the movie gets sweet from the almost only bitter experience. The relationships that Fern gets to experience, are nothing but immensely positive. Even though all the people that she finds during her travels also are in deep turmoil over present or past experiences. In that aspect the movie feels like a Dickens piece of literature. Even though these people seems to be in unfortunate economic conditions their heart are always on a good place. They are funny, happy, moral, helpful people. Against all odds, the humanity, in a micro social level prevails. And it does it beautifully.On the macro-social level, the movie certainly explores the horrors produced by modern day social-economical developments. You can't help but ask yourself: Is this moral? Is a 60 year old woman in deep need to retire see herself obliged to work and live in a van in order to get a better retirement deal? It's certainly feels immoral and tragic.The cinematography of the movie is superb. The director uses mainly natural light and records using a wide lens (which seems to shown the main character even smaller in the screen) focusing mainly on the ever changing scenery resulting from the nomad lifestyle. The director's recording style will eventually immerse you in the scenes and provoke a distinct fell of universal awe.Intimate, beautiful, and deeply humane, Nomadland is certainly worth a watch!"
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,7/10,"Modern day cinema tends to focus most attention into attracting audiences -- creating ""trailer"" movies (movies to entice but not necessarily fulfill). Films falling into the aforementioned group still include huge successes, but a lot of the time the story is the only thing going for the movie. Might as well read the script and one would have the same experience. However, ""Nomadland"" swings opposite of that description.Nomadland is no doubt a technical achievement. The beautiful blues and purples within colour palette aligns with the melancholy tone. Cinematography is smooth, crisp and gives the feeling similar to a documentary -- it's personal. Chloe Zhao projects this movie to the highest level it could possibly be synthesized... but it is only an 8/10. One would not necessarily grow bored during this film, but story-wise, it is decently bland. Fern (brilliantly played by Francis McDormand) has a very emotional character arch, but the change isn't drastic enough to become overly memorable. Paired with a story uncomplimentary with a synopsis, it is provided with a limit in entertainment value.All in all, Nomadland is brilliantly made and an enjoyable film. What is lost in narrative is made up with technical achievements. Cinema should incorporate more of Nomadland's style in future work but provide a nice balance with production and story such as the previous Best Picture winner: Parasite.8/10."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,1/10,"The most boringest film I've seen
How the hell did it win best picture."
NOMADLAND,21 November 2020,1/10,"If you're not from US then it is really hard to connect to this movie. I really like Frances but in this movie... Sorry, but there was no story. Rated 1 to balance it a bit down."
NOMADLAND,17 June 2021,8/10,"I think those people who don't like this movie because they didn't understand the subtle details and simplicity. Its absolutely beautiful movie, cinematography is amazing, those scenes from south Dakota to Nebraska. The best thing I like about this movie is the direction by Chlo√® Zhao. Its a wanderlust movie. Those who love travelling and hit the road would absolutely love this movie."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,1/10,What is with all the high reviews!? This film lacks everything. The film just goes to each character and how they lost hope and/or how they are trying to find it. That's it... Nothing moving or engaging about this film. I only put it on due to all the acclaims and it just shows the film industry is fake and they just hand out awards to anyone. She is a good actress but I wouldn't give her any awards from this.
NOMADLAND,6 October 2021,1/10,"Conversation between whoever made this movie and whoever paid for this movie:""I have an idea for a movie""
""Cool, what's the plot?""
""No plot!""
""Ummm, ok tell me what you're thinking?""
""We get Frances McDormand and follow her around some caravan parks and nice scenery""
""Oooh, I like Frances, she was great in Fargo""
""I know, people love her""
""Ok, what's the story?""
""No story! Did I mention it has Frances McDormand?""
""Yeah, but what else?""
""Nothing, like I said, no story, no plot, just Frances""
""Ummm, ok what do you need?""
""Frances McDormand and a couple of caravans""
""Do you think people will like it""
""Who cares, with Frances we might win an Oscar!""
""You really think with no story, no plot and just Frances we really could?""
""Sure, it's so ridiculous it just might happen""
""Ok, here's a big bag of money from my many big bags of money""
""Great, thanks, see you at the Oscars!"""
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,3/10,"It felt like a mixture of a movie and a documentary with the non actors and natural filming locations. The story never really went anywhere, I just felt like I was watching desert people do desert people stuff, so I just stopped watching the movie."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,9/10,"Excellent film, great acting and a very well-directed film. It shows a different ""America for the Americans"" The scenery blends with the solitude and loneliness of the people; but at the same time they enjoy their life."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,1/10,In the words of George Constanza 'It's about nothing'
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,9/10,"Acting is superb and deep. A simple story of pain and loss but with so much humanity to it. Cinematography is excellent and gives time for the locations to sink in. Can't compliment this movie enough, best movie of the year hands down."
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,3/10,I felt nothing for the main character nor empathised with her. I waited and waited to feel something but felt nothing till the end. I began to wonder if Frances Mcdormand was suitable for the role as boredom crept in within minutes into the film. None of the characters including Fern stood out to me. I found the plot not only lame but the treatment of the film a bit slack in terms of development of characters. Some of the acting by the non actors was great and that didn't go unnoticed but that's all that stood out for me. I really don't mind slow films if they have interesting characters and backgrounds. But unfortunately I found Nomadland just did not tick the right boxes for me.
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,7/10,"All I will say is, throughout this watch you'll keep thinking to yourself ""how is the acting this real?""
A lovely film."
NOMADLAND,3 June 2021,10/10,"Francis mcdormand was great as always, writing was amazing i'm really looking forward to seeing what Chloe Zhao does in the future because her directing is great!"
NOMADLAND,9 July 2021,5/10,"A reminder of how far the industry has fallen. There used to be epic movies released every year or even every month. Now, we get the woman cop from Fargo dirt poor living in a van. Maybe she'll find a boyfriend. That's it. That's the entire movie. Sweeps the Oscars. And they wonder why no one watches anymore.I can see why it won though. There is a deep gaping lack of systemic analysis. The people in charge love to talk about symptoms and never about the disease. Why is Frances McDormand living in a truck? Capitalism, of course. A handful of billionaires made a trillion dollars during the Covid pandemic while more and more of the rest of us can look forward to also living in a truck. Nope, not going to talk about that, just this fantasy of rugged individualism. Thanks, I'll pass."
NOMADLAND,22 March 2021,7/10,"Nomadland is one of those movies that look and sound like an Oscars bait, the ones which play on the audience's emotions, and trick them to think that they're deep, but in fact, they're nothing but pretentious, except this one really hits home. I wouldn't say it's mind-blowing, but I can guarantee that you can go into it without being afraid of coming out and not being mesmerized by at least some of the stories that pass you by during 100 minutes of the movie.What I'm surprised though is, among many nominations Nomadland got this year, it didn't get one for its soundtrack. It definitely has one of the most beautiful and effective soundtracks I've heard from all the movies last year. Many of the sceneries in this movie are extremely marvellous and vastly melancholic. But when they play the scores, the music just shoots that marvel and that melancholy right to my heart. Then with the melodies, my eyes start taking off to a sightseeing trip that they didn't expect to be able to capture or to memorize that much detail.Nomadland is a slow movie, it's not very exciting, yet it doesn't lack the ability to captivate the audience, and that's usually a sign of a quality movie. Being a nomad is a tough way of life, but it's cerlainly not insuficient of peaceful moments. In fact, there's plenty of it, and this movie did an excellent job of exhibiting that peace. It's a soothing tale of the nomads... Or isn't it?"
NOMADLAND,14 July 2021,2/10,"Let me start by saying that I am not a movie snob and I love movies of all genres; and given that this film won best picture and featured Frances McDormand, I had high hopes which were subsequently smothered like a damp campfire. Ms. McDormand is an American gem; however her talents were clearly wasted in this poor excuse for a quasi docudrama. The movie is not just slow, but can only be described as being monotone in all aspects - dialogue, pace, scenery, etc. Top it off with a wholly unsatisfying non-ending, and you'll be asking yourselves why did I waste my time watching. A straight documentary on the history of Empire would have been vastly more satisfying. A shameful waste of the talents of Ms. McDormand."
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,5/10,I can see how the movie tried to make me cry. However main charachter didn't allow me to do that. Flat and underdeveloped.
NOMADLAND,13 March 2021,2/10,This is the most depressing movie I've seen in a long time. Talk about escapism. Avoid at all costs.
NOMADLAND,25 May 2021,6/10,Lady sh!#s in a bucket in a van.....oscar winning sh!#
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,4/10,"I have traveled via an RV thru most of the places the movie is set. I thought I would find it interesting. But the movie is just not that good. The acting is blah. There is almost no story. I feel like this movie is a bandwagon movie. It came out on hulu so it is different and people want to like it. If this had come out in the theater, it would have just been another B/C movie. I think people want this movie to be more than it really is. It is just a basic movie."
NOMADLAND,23 July 2021,5/10,"Double dull. Tedious to the hilt. I really don't understand the hype, or the awards."
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,9/10,"A story about a woman who has lost everything, that's the description. She's lost everything in the Great Recession and goes on the road, living out of her van. She is living a life of solitude and finding a new community. That's what you think it's about, but that's not really what I found at the heart of the story. She lost her house, yes, but what she really lost was her soul mate. The person who was her anchor, her tether. She lost him and his love, and if she can't live there, with him, then she can't be anywhere. Her van is built with her memories and some of his things, and it is all that she had left of him and their life together. So it is a manifestation of all that they were and all that is left of him. It's really a story of love and loss, healing and the journey we all go through. And along the way she meets others going through the same thing she is going through. Kindred spirits who understand each other as no one else really can."
NOMADLAND,18 April 2021,3/10,"I watched this with an open mind and was patient. Thirty minutes in my patience turned into utter boredom. Perhaps this story would have made for a decent blog post or article but it didn't work as a movie for me.There is one nice scene when one of the nomads opens up about his son's suicide but that scene comes toward the end and does not contribute to the main character's story arc (which is almost nonexistent).It seems like this movie only got traction because it deals with a political topic (homelessness), it features a prominent actress, it was written and directed by a female, and because not many interesting movies were released in 2020 due to the reaction to covid.Again, the movie itself is a bore. The main character is miserable and depressing to follow. I recommend watching something else. Into The Wild is a good alternative."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,6/10,"Nomadland would have been great...if there was a story, if it had a plot etc. Very well acted, feels totally real. But are today's filmmakers really gonna get away with telling stories without actually telling stories? And win Oscars for it? There used to be a time when Oscar's went to movies that the critics liked AND the audience actually watched. To me, the lack of story makes a 9/10 movie into a 6/10. (When you write a review here, you are asked if it contains spoilers. Well... in this case that would be impossible, because there's nothing to spoil since the movie has no plot XD. But apart from that, very well made movie.)"
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,10/10,"The movie was beautiful, powerful, sad and very much a reflection of our current and coming times. I almost lost everything in the great recession. My life hasn't been the same since then. I was awakened to the realities of my own existence. I experienced many of the same feelings while watching the film. There's a sense of redemption, recovery of one's self which is often lost in the pursuit of empty desires. I find it wonderful that most of the actors were actually van nomads. The authenticity is like watching someone in their private moments. It felt a lot like a documentary with real emotion. Frances McDormand shines and she just makes this movie for me. I feel like she's telling something of herself here as well. I'm not sure anyone else could have created such an endearing character."
NOMADLAND,30 June 2021,7/10,"I admire Frances McDormand, and I've started this movie twice and haven't been able to finish it. It feels so depressing, hopeless, and full of despair I just couldn't keep going."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,6/10,Good acting. Good storytelling. Slow moving motion picture.I don't agree at all with the Oscar win for best picture. It shouldn't have been nominated.
NOMADLAND,11 April 2021,10/10,"A thoroughly beautiful film. Wonderful attention to the little details of life, along with a reverence for the really big things in life. Would like to see more films like this getting made."
NOMADLAND,27 September 2020,10/10,"Wow. What th did I just watch?? An exemplary masterpiece and a compelling centerpiece. I was fortunate to watch this at the NYFF Virtual Cinema. The entire film was immensely peaceful and sentimental; it touched my heart and reminded me that life is short, precious, and full of adventures. I could really sympathize with Fern after the adversities associated with The Great Recession she endured prior to the film's events. Frances McDormand astonishes us with her tender performance, which should not surprise us all. Chloe Zhao has crafted a marvelous screenplay that reflects her brilliance and faithfulness to its source material. I think it was clever of her to cast non-actors/genuine nomads to give insight into a nomadic life. The score was really beautiful. The stunning cinematography shows us the aesthetic nature and appealing beauty of the American West. This film is bound to be in the spotlight during next year's awards season. And I truly hope Chloe Zhao makes history as the first Asian female director to win Best Director at Academy Awards.Nomadland is a film you must see. Period."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,9/10,"If you're looking for action, look elsewhere. If you're interested in learning about a character with an offbeat lifestyle, watch this."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,9/10,"This is a moving story about modern day nomad people - people who are constantly on the road; sleeping in RVs; traveling across the country for the next temp jobs; and meeting and bonding with other nomads over camper events.Along their journeys, their paths may diverge. Some, like Scankie, choose the road as the last stop of life, which can lead them back to the best part of their memory. Some, like Dave, choose to return to conventional life-style, finding themselves now capable and actually enjoy living under a roof, surrounded by families and friends.For Fern, nomad might be the only life style that can provide her real joy, comfort and security. By her sister's account, Fern may have been a nomad by nature, as she had chose to leave home and travel on the road at an early age. She used to settle in Empire, once a company town, with her late husband for decades, before the town was forever closed and her husband's gone. Now she just can't fall sleep in a warm bed in a comfy house. She always wants to make sure she's self-sufficient and self-sustained. It's hard for her to get a temp job, but she'll take whatever is available. She rarely asks for help unless necessary, but is always willing to give an extra hand to those in need. Nomad is a way of living that fits her the best, where she can find comfort and ease, where she can continue to mourn and remember the love of life.I would think this movie is one of the most competitive contenders for Oscar best picture this year. Beyond the fantastic storylines, acting, and shooting, the movie is also thought provoking. I paused a couple times to discuss the Amazon scenes and how corporate decisions and international trades disrupts average people's lives. They are the invisible hands that push the nomads on the road."
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,1/10,I had really high expectations for Nomadland. What a major disappointment. There was only a few emotional moments. Bob Wells moment was so moving. Actually Wells and the rest of the nomads were fantantic. But Frances McDormand was a stuff board. The story was disjointed and boring. I have worked in this creative field for a half a century and this production was extremely amatuer. I don't get the award buzz for this movie.
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,9/10,"There were at least two pieces of dialogue that made me tear up, and I think that the people who are liking this film can relate to that. Maybe the people that don't like it do not have anything relatable to the characters or situations. I personally thought it was brilliant, meaningful and deep. I feel bad for those that did not like it."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,3/10,"Fell asleep. Nothing happens, no explaining. Its just a movie about a woman travelling where literslly nothing interesting happens."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,10/10,"My son and I were moved to tears, more then once, because the collage of ultra-short scenes, the round story-telling, the characters, the life... gives such richness and love and respect for humanity. I don't need a story to be told or a clear view or meaning. This was more then enough to travel along for a short two hours. Wonderful, peacefull, meaningful!"
NOMADLAND,17 May 2021,2/10,"I can only think that no other films were made last year to enable this terminally dull film to scoop Best Picture Oscar, among other awards.It has some beautiful solo piano on the soundtrack, and the cinematography is impressive in places; hence two stars.In a nutshell, almost try two hours of my life I'm never going to get back."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,7/10,"My advice, ignore all 10 and 1 star reviews. 10 stars are supposed to mean flawless. 1 star should mean the film did nothing well, not script, acting, direction, cinematography, etc. Very few films fit either category, yet most films reviewed have plenty of both, including this one.If you like action movies with car chases and buildings blowing up every 12 seconds, you will not like this film. I fail to grasp why any such movie fan would even give this film a shot. Yet many did, and predictably gave it 1 star, calling it ""boring,"" when it's clearly not going to be an action-packed thriller.You learn nothing from reviews that imply it's one of the worst films in the history of the universe, nor from gushing reviews that think it's among the best.If you're fine with slow ambiance, gritty reality, careful composition, and interpersonal relationships, there is a lot to love in this American journey. The real people do a good, and sometimes excellent job.Still, this film does none of these these things flawlessly. The relationships and character development do not go very deep. This could be seen as understandable in a film about a nomadic lifestyle. But it still detracts from the experience.The visuals, while often beautiful and well thought out, are not consistently so. This might be called an art film, but it's not quite one of those in which every shot is meticulously composed.Finally, the lead character is so standoffish, especially to the one who reached out to her the most, it's hard to feel what drives him to continue extending his hand.Still, if this kind of film appeals to you, you will most likely find this example entertaining, thought provoking, and emotional."
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,9/10,"Melancholic, nostalgic, meaningful...yet disturbing! A real roller coaster of emotions. Great cinematography, superb directing and amazing acting. No need to talk about the storyline, this film is so worth watching.Wonderful work from Chlo√© Zhao. Modern cinema at its finest."
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,10/10,"It's contemplative and emotional, yet happy and peaceful. Heart-wrenching, yet hopeful. I went into it completely blind and I highly recommend doing the same. Researching afterwords made it even more powerful."
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,2/10,I wanted to see this since it won so many Oscars. WHY WHY WHY??? If this is the best of Hollywood in 2020 films. Then that era is OVER. This is the death of Hollywood. Sound track is the only thing I give it 2 stars. Oh please. What's up next year? Entire film with all the players in masks?
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,5/10,"I thought this film was worth a watch, as most Oscar films are. I wanted to see what the Nomad lifestyle was all about, and I think it checked that box. I was hoping to be immersed in an interesting plot that made me think, and it did. It definitely made me feel very lucky to not be in the situation of the people in the movie. They seemed happy living a very basic lifestyle, and I have seen this reflected in my own life. Some of the people with the least seem the happiest. However, this seemed to be a movie that wanted to be a documentary. It just didn't have enough there to be a good movie in my opinion. There is a complex formula that makes a good movie, that involves great acting, interesting characters and an unique and unpredictable story. I found the acting OK, but the characters were very bland and common. They were far from interesting. I had no idea where the story was going, but I didn't find myself terribly interested in finding out either. The story crawled from start to finish, and felt like eating stale bread with nothing on it. Not for me."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,7/10,This is a film about how to turn your pain into something beautiful.
NOMADLAND,22 April 2021,6/10,This film was one long ending from start to finish. I give 6 stars for Frances McDormand's sustained performance with basically no script. What on earth is all the fuss about? Couldn't wait for it to be over over over...! The maudlin piano music was the worst.
NOMADLAND,14 July 2021,9/10,"In a realistic and unmannered fashion, Frances McDormand portrays a woman who begins living in a van after losing her husband, her job, and her house during a recession that devastated her small town. The movie presents a compassionate but unvarnished view of grief, community, death, and the nomadic lifestyle of many financially marginalized people in America (some of whom are more challenged than is depicted in this film). The movie is filled with beautiful cinematography and people, and will elicit a variety of emotions in viewers."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,,"Did this movie really win the Oscar? Ahahahahhaa. I do not believe it. Good pictures , good actings , good movie but , is it enough for Oscar? Absoloutly not!!!"
NOMADLAND,20 May 2021,6/10,"Amazing acting, camerawork and music but Nomadland suffers by not having any real revelations or story development. To be blunt, the movie could have ended at any point and it would have felt just as disappointing as the final scenes were. I can't say I disliked this movie since I was invested in the main character and the pace was comfortable enough to keep from being boring, but the anticipation of some kind of punch or conclusion was ultimately not fulfilled."
NOMADLAND,8 November 2021,1/10,"This may be the most worthless movie ever nominated, lest awarded an oscar. It may also be the worst movie of McDormand's career. It goes here: ABSOLITELY NOWHERE. It's characters growth/positive change/learning ability is: NOTHING WHATS0EVER! Have traveled in an rv trailer and been to places, met people like these. Th movie is absolutely worthless - you need read no further pseudo-intellectual or ridiculously pretentious reviews."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,1/10,"What is it with Hollywood these days with not only creating a mediocre movie, but then hyping it up and giving it oscars.I have never been so bored watching a film with a slow and poor story line, one dimensional character(s) and quite frankly a very dull performance by everyone in the film.Really not sure what the hype was for, but honestly this is probably the worst film I have actually seen in 2021, long, dull, boring, depressing and do we we really need to see the lead sitting and relieving herself in a bucket, what did that 30 seconds add to the movie.Not worth the hype."
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,10/10,"The direction, cinematography, acting, writing and production moves filmmaking in a new deep way. It's a film that captures life and stays with you."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,10/10,"Wow, just wow this movie is amazing it really is I can't put into words the emotion I went through while watching this movie from tears to elation for the struggles and bitter triumphs that Fern goes through. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen."
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,5/10,Ya it is what it is. Oscar worthy? Perhaps for direction and cinematography. There were such great movies that were nissed this year I think if this wins it sums it all up. The public no more about movies than the Academy. Not the first or last time. Jodie Foster was taken out so says enough.
NOMADLAND,26 October 2021,4/10,"How this won best picture, I'll never know!It was very well shot, but didn't win best cinematography which it was also nominated for. This is all it has going for it.Incredibly boring. Literally nothing happens of any note throughout.Avoid!"
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,6/10,Great Frances McDormand. Poor scenario and dialogues I am afraid. I had greater expectations.
NOMADLAND,29 March 2021,10/10,"Meditative at times, a full appreciation of this movie comes from an openness to the reality of individualism. This is not a tale of an ""every-woman"" but rather one woman's story. To confuse is as anything else is missing the point of this beautifully crafted film."
NOMADLAND,18 May 2021,9/10,"I am a big fan of Frances McDormand - I will watch any film that she appears in so I was looking forward to ""Nomadland"". I was not disappointed. I cannot understand the negative reviews. It shows a different America to that usually showcased. David Strathairn also puts in a superb performance & I liked the fact that non actor nomads appeared in it. The cinematography was excellent too. I would happily watch it again but definitely on the big screen as recommended by Frances McDormand in her Oscar acceptance speech, so that the sweeping landscapes can be seen in all their glory."
NOMADLAND,14 March 2021,,Beautiful acting. This film felt very realistic and moving. Someone living out of their car is not a good situation by any means. This film shows how fearful someone can be when living inside a car. The woman is distraught over her husband's death and not really able to move on. My only complaint is that the story could have moved forward just a slight bit faster. But great film otherwise.
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,4/10,"It was just ok. Promising Young Woman was a far better and innovative movie.Maybe I just couldn't relate to this movie and would have got it more if it was about the traveling community here in the UK. For me it's a US indie movie for people in the US, it doesn't travel that well."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,5/10,A simple yet deep story of a woman searching for what she already knows.And never once does she land super fast onto the ground with one fist smashing said ground with that one eye brow up.....
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,6/10,"There's no oscar quality anymore. He should have bought a ""sound of metal"" this year.The nudity in the film was extremely unnecessary."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,3/10,Think the movie is supposed to make a statement but can't really figure out what it is? Unless it's the fact that some people like to drive around aimlessly in a van.
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,3/10,"Keep moving. There's nothing to see here. And that's the whole point.Nomadland tells a story of folks left behind by society. To us conformists, sadly, their stories are not worth telling and not worth taking the time to hear. The film drives home this point in truly stunning fashion. I remain jaw-dropped after having spent 108 minutes.Chloe Zhao delivered the message despite lacking a plot. An Oscar well earned for her excellence in directing.This movie also won Best Picture, literally meaning there was no better film released during the covid-19 pandemic. With regard to that I issue a deep warning: The emperor has no clothes."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,6/10,"We all know what the film is trying to say but its just boring it should have been classed as a documentary. Nothing against Frances but getting an Oscar for this is ridiculous , the other nominees were far more deserving."
NOMADLAND,13 July 2021,7/10,"Acting is good, but plot is a bit empty, seems watching from afar instead aomong real life."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,5/10,"Boring
I suggest you watch an episode of Back Roads which has actual real people in it and only takes 30 minutes!"
NOMADLAND,23 June 2021,9/10,"First of all, I would like to thank and really appreciate Frances McDormand for the mastery and art of cinema that she offers, in this film, which I did not find, even for a moment, as boring, but I watched it with gratitude and confidence that it is something special. Excellent depiction of the places that attract you with its magnificence, with the passion of Frances McDormand to visit it and live the life of a traveler with the conviction that it is the best way for her life. In short, this film took me on a more than wonderful journey represented in getting to know the lifestyle of this group of American society."
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,1/10,"I was hoping for interesting characters or at least interesting relationships among them. It is hard to understand a movie that doesn't have that, or a plot, or a message. It gives some idea of grief, loneliness and voluntary isolation but nothing more than that. The result is a stream-of-consciousness type of movie where consciousness is rather numb."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,7/10,"If you are the type of person who would skip all the sad and troubling parts of Into the Wild and just wish the whole movie was about Chris McCandless going to cool places and hanging out with quirky people, this is the movie for you. Gone are the abusive and enabling parents. Mental illness is replaced by an honest and brave character and oh yeah, that whole bus thing doesn't happen. This isn't to say this is a bad movie. I actually really like the not sad and troubling parts of Into the Wild.For those who like the use of real people in the movie, just just actors, if you haven't seen it you might want to check out Land and Freedom."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,7/10,"I love the way a lady described the wedding ring on Fern's hand: a ring means it never ends, so does her love for her husband.""What's remembered lives"", I thought Fern would not explain this nomad life in the movie, but she did. Her whole journey on the road is endorsing her husband's existence , since they have no children.For those who know what it likes to mourn for long, they won't find it boring. It's a nice try to portray pain in depth. And for those who ALWAYS try to find an answer in a movie, she did moved on, okay?"
NOMADLAND,18 May 2021,9/10,"The history of modern nomads, affected by the great crisis of the United States in 2011, forced to walk and live in a van, without having a fixed job. This is Nomadland, a beautiful film, with punctual and objective criticisms of the way the American economy is managed and the impacts that it has on the neediest.Frances McDormand, the actress who plays the main character in the film, Fern, conveys the most varied feelings possible: sadness, happiness, purity, humanity. Her vicious cycle of clinging to the past shows how complicated the lives of these ""modern nomads"" can be. Away from his children, homeless and steady, and the older ones affected by poor and inhumane retirement. Frances delivers an incredible role, leaving the viewer feeling sorry for her concern about her condition. The secondary characters do their part well, convey emotions, tell stories, use stylistic marks and reflections to show the harsh reality of life. Chlo√© Zao delivers impeccable plans and makes her work an unforgettable art. The photography and editing also manage to be impeccable, following the great direction of Chlo√© Zao. In addition, it presents an incredible argument, adapting stories told by real modern nomads, whose stories would be forgotten if the film did not exist. The soundtrack is simple, but effective and translates everything the characters feel and the moment the film portrays.Despite its slow and monotonous rhythm, especially at the beginning, Nomadland delivers unforgettable art, with moments that make the viewer cry or think about the life he leads and his future. Nomadland is a beautiful film, both technically, as in argumentation and acting. A work worthy of an Oscar and worthy of the attention of all those who like a good film.""Dedicated to those who left.See you on the road. ""Nomadland - Chol√© Zhao
9.5/10."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,5/10,The movie is just about fern traveling no story and really boring nothing special the filming and the music is good by the way but neither the movie nor the director didn't deserve an oscar at all oscar is long dead to me.
NOMADLAND,2 July 2021,1/10,"This is by far the worst movie ever recieved an oscar, and one of the worst movies I've seen. Boring, boring boring. Plain acting, desastrous cuts.. Story?? This was an oscar because of quotas.. I waited the whole movie for the oscar-reason.. Nothing there.."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,4/10,I didn't hate this film but I didn't really think it was great either. There are a few interesting exchanges between some of the characters but not much in between that needed to be there to move the narrative forward. I usually love these type of films but I found this one boring and don't understand all the praise it is getting as so many films like this are made every year but never get any publicity. The marketing machine behind this one has obviously done it's job.
NOMADLAND,15 August 2021,1/10,"Slow, boring, depressing, makes no sense, she takes money from her sister but won't accept a place to live and would rather live in a van and poop in a bucket? And we are supposed to understand and sympathize with this?"
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,3/10,"Nomadland is one of the most useless films i've ever seen in my entire life. There is no story, no character development,no emotions. I thought that the Academy with Moonlight and Shape of water had reached the highest level in terms of overrating movies, but this is awful. The movie begins, Fern met random strangers, the movie
ends. SERIOUSLY? THIS IS NOT CINEMA."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,9/10,"If you need constant stimulation this film isn't for you. If you want to just switch off then again this isn't for you. This is a film about the struggles of being human from the highs of meeting new people and feeling part of something to the lows of needing to but struggling to leave the past behind. It's not a film with loads of plot and it doesn't need to me, it's a film that requires you to think and reflect all while enjoying some gorgeous cinematography."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,5/10,"Usually a great movie worth an Academy Award has a scene or two which you remember. This movie didn't. It is ironic ""The Revenant"" which was up for the Academy Award but didn't win had multiple scenes which makes me want to watch it over and over. That in my mind makes a great movie."
NOMADLAND,28 January 2021,,"I believe that all bad ratings are given by people who just never traveled and did not feel these subtle details that are shown in the film.
The film shows very accurately and vitally the fact that the spirit of adventurism and freedom lives inside the main character.
There are no secret meanings here, even dialogues from different people about the philosophy of life are just part of the ordinary life of any person. Deep down, each person can decide and control the balance of their future and the right to make mistakes."
NOMADLAND,1 October 2020,,"Doesn't the film need to be at least three hours long?Jokes aside, I love both filmmakers. But when, in God's name, are we getting a proper trailer?"
NOMADLAND,3 March 2021,8/10,This movie is beautiful in so many ways and tells an interesting story that you never hear about. It was really realistic and great acting! It was slow throughout and I know it was meant to be but there were times where I lost interest. But still recommend.
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,8/10,Stunningly beautiful scenes. Frances delivers as always.
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,5/10,This movie is actually quite bad. The main character is unlikeable and clearly has Depression and an Avoidant Attachment Disorder. This makes her extremely boring and unsatisfying to watch as a character.It portrays the Nomad lifestyle as a lifestyle for the desperate and dispossessed. Whether or not this is an accurate portrayal it is totally uncompelling.
NOMADLAND,26 May 2021,7/10,"'Nomadland' directed by Chloe Zao,who is also the director of the upcoming marvel movie 'Eternals' is the story about nomads and how they spends their daily life after the economy dropped in 2011. Frances Mcdermond plays the lead role of 'Fern' and she has done a fabulous job. Nomadland may not be the best movie of this year (although it received Oscar for Best Picture) but still it's a beautiful made film and goes deep into exploration of a life of a nomad and the way Chloe Zao contrasts the life of a nomad with a normal human life. The visuals are breathtaking to watch. My issues lies with a slow screenplay which often at times turns out to be pretty boring to watch. But still 'Nomadland is a beautiful film made with a lot of attention to detail."
NOMADLAND,10 July 2021,9/10,When life dosn't give you lemons. Drink water.I love movies like this... It makes you think about your life and the lifes of the people you love.
NOMADLAND,11 August 2021,6/10,"This is one of those movies where you feel like the crew is following someone across the country without any scripting, nothing exciting ever happens! Because our lives aren't exciting most of the time. This is basically what happens in nomadland. There is nothing exciting or intriguing that's gonna unfold, it's just Fern going around RV parks jumping job to job just to get by. I wish the movie depicted a more realistic image of these road travelers, about the risks, the assaults, the burglaries; instead we see Fern eating well, paying for gas and finding jobs easily. I think the point of this movie was that people get on the road because they try to escape an event that changed their lives, so they start new lives as nomads. But you'll see through the movie that it's a pretty sad life that nobody would want. The only thing that made this movie bearable was the performance of the actors who seemed like they didn't even realize they were being filmed, their performance was real.Anyways, this is a movie that I wouldn't recommend."
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,3/10,3 Oscars - what for?Best movie: Well it its pretty much boring showing ugly people in their ugly vans living an ugly life in an ugly landscape.Best Director: Seriously? Every student could have made this movie without efforts. I wonder how much did it cost the made this movie. Probably 10.000 bugs would have been enough.Best female actor: Well best courage for showing off ugly in the most boring movie of the century for sure.
NOMADLAND,18 March 2021,6/10,"...but it's no more than a motion ""impressionist painting"" rather than a motion ""picture"". Maybe that's what motion pictures are supposed to be in the first place, but I don't buy it. There's documentaries for that. I need a story, with an arch, with a plot, maybe a twist or two thrown in the mix... you know... a movie in its traditional sense. Call me old-fashioned, but this is far from being the best film of the year."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,8/10,I'm so glad I ignore many of the critics I read before watching this movie...This is a simple but strong vision how we must enjoy the simple things in life. The Oscar for best movie it's well deserve...
NOMADLAND,17 January 2021,3/10,"Not for me it's like a Documentary.
Sad, slow, and boring"
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,10/10,"Watch the Matt Foley motivational speaker
sketch from SNL and Nomadland back to back and you'll see what I mean."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,9/10,"This is a very beautiful piece.. wonderful film made..
what i learnt from this film is everyone is finding their own shelter in life for living.. and also need a peace in life when it doesn't gone well..
then everyone should to move on from the past, don't live in the past.. coz life is so beautiful!~ there's so much possibility when we go out and live our life truly.."
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,2/10,"If there's any movie that lives up to the title of the most over rated movie of all time, this would be it!Never felt so bored watching a movie before! No story, no character development , nothing. Geez such a waste of time trying to sit through this."
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,,Mcdormand is outstanding but the movie is worse oscar winner ever.
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,5/10,"Frannie is always great to watch on screen. And I loved the sort of strange quasi-amateur acting from all the nomads. But the Amazon thing is a really problem. I was watching the Ten Commandments and it occurred to me that Amazon and their factories and the way they treat their employees is not that different than the way Pharaoh treats the slaves. And Nomadland makes Amazon seem like magic happy land where everyone gets a prize! Also the structure of the movie and it's sameness of pace don't really make for compelling cinema. I like slow movies, I like long takes and I don't need action. But this movie's arc is a flatline. Like a layer of fondant on a cake. Like an ice rink after the Zamboni machine has gone by. Blank and flat. Not horrible but not earth shattering or even remotely moving."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,1/10,"This is possibly the most over-hyped movie I've ever seen. The film doesn't reward you for sticking with the character, from start to finish it gives you NOTHING in the way of emotion, character development, plot or even a reason to care about what we're seeing on screen. The movie meanders from scene to scene, its dull, depressing and boring... it feels way longer than its already overlong 1hr 47minsFrances McDormunds 'Fern' is irredeemable, borderline unlikable and supposedly the heart of a movie, that itself has no heart. Why is she working poor when her husband of 26 years had a decent job and she was a part time teacher? Unexplained. Why does she prefer to live in a van when she has at least 2 decent offers of a good alternate home? Unexplained. Why are we expected to care about her situation when shes actively not helping herself out of it? Don't know. Why does she have to be cold and emotionally distant to the only relatable characters that appear in the movie? Annoyingly, you will never know.Avoid."
NOMADLAND,18 January 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is the story of a woman who has lost her husband and job after the great recession and now lives as a nomad, working different jobs at multiple locations. This movie reflects and touches upon poverty in America especially people who are unable to secure their retirement or wanted to live closer to nature. For the initial part, the movie feels like a documentary with actual nomads telling their stories. That's the uniqueness of the film that it blends stories such that we are unable to identify the difference. This is a very well directed and crafted movie, Chloe Zhao has done some great work and might become the second woman to earn the best director Oscar.Nomadland is in a way transcendental like Into the wild and informs us through sufficient consciousness about the lives of nomads in America. However, the film mostly revolves around the character Fern, a woman who has lost a lot recently and thus decided to live as a nomad. We see this world through Frances McDormand's performance, one of the most subtle and intriguing performance. Fern is such an amazing complex woman, someone who can be restless to a degree that feels self-sabotaging but on the other hand incredibly warm and open with many people.Fern doesn't think that she needs to be redeemed or to be saved, and Chloe Zhao doesn't push the film in an attempt to make us feel pity for her or sorry for her either, while also somehow never underestimating the loneliness and sadness of her situation. This film through its Cinematography, visual narration, score, and performance creates consciousness in our minds about being present in the situation or being part of those stories. And that is why this is one of the best movies of the year."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,8/10,"Incredible acting, cinematography, and music ...but I didn't get a clear idea what Fern wanted...or any strong learning or transformation.
The scenes, each poignant and very engaging, are episodic in sequence...string together with 'and then'...'and then.' The unfolding slice of knife kept me interested every minute...but I would have extra-enjoyed knowing what Fern wanted (besides survival) and seeing her learn and change a bit more.
There is a place for episodic vignettes, and this is high among them. I just think there were some story opportunities missed."
NOMADLAND,4 September 2021,1/10,Nothing really happened. No particular story. Generally depressing. Don't waste your time or money.
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,7/10,"There are years where it is difficult to choose the best between so many good options. 2020, due to covid, was a atypical year where it was dificult to find movies to fill up the categories. Nomadland is a good movie and a good story but still not oscar worthy in my humble opinion."
NOMADLAND,18 April 2021,2/10,"Didn't watch because the trailers were boring.Her deadpan signature acting that's predictable.And I am disgusted with all the award hype around the exploited fantasy land of being ""house less"" real hardships facing our elderly in a debt driven economy that tips me off straight away that book to script is another cinematic shortcut that flaws the book's hard truth."
NOMADLAND,30 August 2021,7/10,"""Nomadland"" is an intriguing blend of fiction and documentary movie. The film's mood is fairly quiet and seemingly un-dramatic (in its literary sense), with beautiful cinematography. Perhaps at times it might scratch the surface a bit more and try to be less glossy, but it's no doubt insightful to watch -- especially in a theater, where there's nothing to distract one from full immersion."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,8/10,"A bleak film in many ways but beautifully shot, poignant and escapist."
NOMADLAND,24 July 2021,9/10,"The movie for me has two layers.The literal one, is a despiction of nomads life in the united states. Centering specially on the challenges of people forced to this type of life.But there is a deeper layer which shows how in a way nomads aren't so nomad as they think, and we as a society can in fact be more nomad than we think.Nomads as shown in the movie come around to the same cycles. The protagonist mind is always on the same place, and in a way become sendentary in her own world to the point that sleeping on another house and staying in only one place becomes unbereable.And on the other side the rest of people, sendentary as we label ourselves, are actually driving our own safe place(rv) through life wandering from place to place meeting and saying goodbye to people we meet on our road. Our safe place,our rv, is the baggage we have in our minds, all we need, our deepest thoughts, our joys and sorrows.When the movie ends, she continues on her road, just like everyone else."
NOMADLAND,12 May 2021,4/10,"I was expecting more. Why? Because of the Oscars. I was expecting something unique, exiting, different. But after this experience I started wondering the whole basis of giving nominations to movies.But if we set aside the Oscars, what is the problem with this movie? Well, it's not really a movie. It feels like a slow documentary with few professional actors. There's no plot, no development. Just a lady in a van going from place to place and listening to monologues of actual nomads.I would take away the actors, add Louis Theroux and call it a documentary."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,9/10,"2020 most anticipated film did not disappoint. I liked it. All those seemingly uneventful series made an interesting harmony. Like a gentle whisper of perspectives, yet still powerful to inspire deep thoughts. And of course, Frances McDormand!"
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,10/10,"Watch this, reflect on your life, be brave. I dare you."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,5/10,"It states all the core themes within the first thirty minutes of the film. The ideas of family, poverty and and living free from the ""tyranny of the dollar"", and transitioning to golden years of ones life are all addressed in the first thirty minutes. I do applaud Frances McDormand's acting of practically becoming homeless as method acting. The cinematography is occasionally breathtaking as it blends visual poetry with practical documentary working. The application of actual unprofessional actors is always a plus and works in a particularly good manner here.However, for those who care about well structured plots, this film features a particularly meandering story as we float from job to job, state to state, from homeless camp to homeless camp seeing the lives of the less fortunate. McDormand's character, Fern, never has to particularly confront anything due to the fact her character has been already completed before the movie began. She is only occasionally confronts the past, but even then, Fern has already decided who she wants to be and she is never changing nor deviate from that character. This, in part, creates a plot that never actually tackled anything, rather it just shows how a certain group of people live.From an Aristotelian perspective, it's ideas are important to its target audience of Baby Boomers, but I don't think if it effectively delivers its themes of Marxism in a manner that is receptive to the anxieties of the generation. It is often too slow, I feel, for this to have any great effect on the majority of its target audience. As intimate as we are to Fern, the viewer can feel fatigue watching her story."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,3/10,"I adore Frances McDormand, but I couldn't even make it past the first half-hour of this slog. I don't need an action-packed plot, but if you don't have a story the characters and relationships had better be compelling. Even McDormand couldn't bring life to this script."
NOMADLAND,12 March 2021,8/10,"I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Paul Winer in all his glory at The Reader's Oasis, his bookstore in Quartzsite, AZ. He played a little boogie woogie on his piano for me! What a character! I bought a book and he signed a bookmark and took a photo with me and my sister!! I was sad to hear of his passing last year.
This movie is really familiar to me in the places and people. We have a place at the river and we love the beauty of the mountains, desert, river and skies!!"
NOMADLAND,23 April 2021,7/10,Just great and.We are alone while we are not alone.
NOMADLAND,28 October 2021,8/10,"Tough film to watch but you still love it and feel happy to enjoy it while you get sad thinking of how tough is life, typical perfect performance from Frances with top quality casting which makes you feel that all those old actors are telling their own true life stories."
NOMADLAND,19 February 2021,4/10,"This film can be summarized with two emotions: Melancholy and apathy. Yes, we get to see a beautifully shot and thoughtfully acted piece of film, but what is it actually trying to tell us? As the audience we get flooded with emotional piano music while we follow a woman living in precarious conditions, meeting different people on her way. Sadly that's all there is to this movie, and it could have been so much more. There is no character development, we don't get to dive deep into the personality of anyone shown on screen, there is no controversy, no asking ""Why?"", no meaningful dialogues whatsoever, no anger, no sadness, just melancholy and apathy."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,4/10,I'm sorry...you just can't make a whole movie from 'atmospheric' shots. It's dull. Nothing happens. It's the usual pretentious load of drivel that wins the Oscar.
NOMADLAND,17 May 2021,9/10,"Read the reviews on here and it's a typical mix of ""I know better"" and oneupmanship. I am not an American, I am not a nomad and I don't need unsubtle story lines to stimulate my intellect.Beautiful scenery, superb acting and a film that engaged my partner and me throughout. Loved it."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,1/10,"It's truly beyond me this won not one but three Oscars. The only way this would deserve the ""best movie of the year"" Oscar is if it was the only movie made.Every second I kept asking myself what the hook is in this story? Why do I keep watching it? Well, the only reason I finished it was because it won the Oscars. I still can't believe I wasted my time watching this. It's a movie with zero entertainment value.Frances McDormand is certainly a great actress, but there was barely any acting in this movie. This was an acting part just about anyone could do-just some emotionless, dull lines with blank expressions.There is no actual story. No real acts. No climax. I have traveled to over 50 countries and love the nomad lifestyle. This ""movie"" somehow managed to make the lifestyle sad and boring.This movie is more like a documentary, just a boring one. I wish they would have made it a documentary researching the lifestyle instead. That way, it would have been more interesting.I'm happy for the director for her Oscar, but again, this could have been directed and acted by anyone straight out of film school. Nothing happens; even the camera angles are boring.I wanted to turn it off after watching a minute but somehow managed to finish it because of all the awards it won. Don't waste your time, and certainly don't pay anything to watch this.I could make a more interesting and entertaining movie by clipping together my travel videos from all over the world. Unfortunately, nobody would watch them since I don't work in Hollywood, and I'm not an Oscar winner like McDormand - this movie probably got noticed because of her."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,3/10,"1st one for Frances
2nd one for the music
Last one for some beautiful picturesIs there something else in this movie??"
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,8/10,"What a beautiful film, masterfully acted and directed"
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,5/10,"There are two scenes which could be really intense, but they are suppressed completely, maybe the director has her own style of storytelling, it is a good movie for sure, but just not attractive enough, honestly I won't strongly recommend it to my friends and family."
NOMADLAND,6 April 2021,4/10,Too much empty walk.... lowkey boring. Kinda good acting. She changes her job too often. WTF is she doing... why does she have a problem with living in a house. Beautiful nature shots. She's kinda crazy. Xd.
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,1/10,If it wasn't for the remarkable Francis this would be another movie that you forget after you've watched it. The story is... ok. But not very true to the life of real nomads.
NOMADLAND,14 August 2021,6/10,"This movie is burstfull of great acting and wonderful environments. But I found it kind of dull and boring. Usually I enjoy slowpaced and well acted films, but this one did not do it for me."
NOMADLAND,7 January 2021,6/10,"Just because Frances McDormand is in a movie does not make it de facto great. Yes, as usual it's a pleasure for me when she's on the screen. However, once I settled in, enjoyed some great scenery and started to get into the story, I realized there wasn't one. I watched it through and did enjoy it somewhat. But as it got towards the end I found myself frustrated at the lack of any point whatsoever. Maybe this made a great book (I didn't read it), but as a movie it was more of a coffee table book full of pretty pictures and not a lot else."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,3/10,Had a hard time staying awake watched it three times. Beautiful scenery and panoramic views the story line was slow and hard to keep me interested.
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,1/10,"Waste of time and money, boring.No story only journey.I'm the only one who could see the whole movie no one could ."
NOMADLAND,4 June 2021,8/10,"I got the feeling that I need to be American to understand why the best picture Oscar but you can easily see the best actress and best direction Oscars throughout the film.It highlights a bizarre community, at least to us, but they're still humans with the same emotions, motives and desires just different ways.Frances McDormand does a great job. It's nice to see a female protagonist who is portraying her character as a human being with nothing to do with the clich√©s of femininity.Despite being too American, it's still a very beautiful well written, acted and directed movie."
NOMADLAND,27 December 2020,9/10,"Nomadland is a new film by Chlo√© Zhao whose previous film was an excellent drama. The film's protagonist is a middle-aged widow, Fern, who starts a road-trip in the mid-West after the loss of her husband. Along the way, Fern makes intimate friendships with other nomads who have their stories to tell.This is a poignant, and utterly moving film. Frances MacDormand captures Fern's grief and sorrow, as well as her warmth and inner strength. During her trip in the mid-West, she reveals herself as a feisty independent woman who prioritizes freedom over the domesticity of life. Fern's definition of nomad life as 'houseless' not 'homeless' is a testament of this quality. The depiction of Fern's friendships with other nomads is heart-warming and uplifting. It is captivating to observe each nomad's life story and their openness to share their stories, the bond created by their stories, and to witness how Fern gains strength and finds herself again though these friendships. Her encounter with Swankie, a terminally-ill senior citizen explores the notion of our life choices. Swankie chooses her nomad life as a way to end her life with freedom.Actual nomads are featured in this film, and this authenticity adds an extra layer to this film. The film makes us experience the beauty, freedom and gentleness of the nomad life, and evidently demonstrates to us that Fern's nomad lifestyle is ultimately her choice not by outside forces. This film also makes us wonder if her nomad life is not emerged from the loss of her husband but from her free-spirit which has existed from her childhood - probably Fern was always destined to reach this Nomadland."
NOMADLAND,2 January 2021,9/10,"Depressingly realistic portrayal of a disturbingly increasing segment of our society. The human connections are quite beautiful, but the ""economy"" aspects are so disturbing that any lingering illusions of the ""American Dream"" will be hard to maintain."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,1/10,"If only I could get back the time I wasted watching this.. I don't even want to call it a movie, I wouldn't even call it a documentary.While i do think Frances is a great actor (3 bill boards) this was just lacking..many things most importantly a plot.I to only watched as I heard all the hype leading up to oscars.It certainly didn't deserve best picture, promising young women certainly had more to give."
NOMADLAND,30 May 2021,10/10,"Very deep, warm, emotional and philosophical movie that grows from sharing, caring and helping each other, things that give life it's meaning and purpose. The majestic landscapes are paralleled with the grooves and shapes of faces and facial expressions of emotions and mindscape."
NOMADLAND,26 July 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is like a poem about life and death, spiritual and material loss and the universe. It is also about hope and faith. It is also ultimately a road movie about searching and healing. It is about everything. I have personally never seen a more magnificent and epic movie."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,4/10,"I was interested in watching this film to see the different circumstances this woman went through. I loved the friendships she developed, but everything fizzled out and seemed to repeat. Maybe if I had been willing to invest the next 35 minutes of my life to see the end I would have been enlightened, but I was not willing to take that chance. To those of you who love it, LOVE it! It just wasn't for me. :("
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,9/10,"Chloe Zhao's work in this gem is masterful--truly a unique talent and vision. One feels immersed in the world of Fern and the ""nomads"" she encounters along the way in her directionless, heartbroken existence. Many details are authentic, raw, and convey mood and the grit of these folks and the world they inhabit.Not surprisingly, turns out the nomads are real people and not actors. I suppose this is part documentary/part drama movie. Being incognito as the downtrodden widow Fern, McDormand is unrecognizable as the Oscar-winning actress to the nomads, and so, in their mutual interactions they are brilliantly aligned and relatable to each other. McDormand spends much of the movie sympathetically listening to their poignant stories as she struggles to make her way in this uncharted new world.The film masterfully stays away from the inherent politics of the situation--how capitalism leaves many behind in the dust and how these retired gig-workers/nomads have had one tough break after another, exacerbated by the existing social structure. It is enough to simply experience the lives of these elderly nomads through their collective charisma and toughness. This movie is obviously not for everyone, but if you are the kind of person who empathizes with humanity on multiple levels, this film will leave on imprint on your soul.P.S. The nomad ""Swanky"" is unforgettable."
NOMADLAND,5 March 2021,10/10,"I should say for the record that I loved this movie dearly, in a way that happens perhaps once a decade.I read the description, saw the always-great Frances McDormand was in it (is there any better actor living today?), and sort of knew this would be a movie I'd like.McDormand delivers (because of course), and the excellent David Strathairn's here too, and he, like McDormand, is always an actor who will pull me toward a film just because of his involvement with it.Much must be said of the pitch-perfect performances, Chlo√© Zhao's gentle, masterful touch, and all of the nomadic storytellers who fill out this rich yet lightly-plotted examination of rootless Americans constitute a film which will hold up well to multiple viewings.I can watch Frances McDormand walk though landscapes pretty much for hours, and there is much of this. Her character is somewhat guarded at times, but we're watching the wheels turn, wondering about her specific emotional state (which is why, at times, when she does show her cards, it's particularly satisfying and thought-provoking.) We know she's carrying pain, but events in the movie disabuse us of the notion that this is the sum total of who she is. Pain's a part of it, but it's not *just* that.This is a slow, meditative, quiet movie, the sort of which few are made anymore. I imagine a certain sort of person would be bored. I was rapt.We follow this itinerant character, Fern, around the American West, as she lives out of her van, meeting other nomads in similar circumstances. Her husband has passed away and her time on the road has actually changed her such that she has problems sleeping in standard buildings anymore.We hear people's stories. We watch them take jobs to earn some scratch. We look at deserts, abandoned homes, and rivers.At first, I thought the movie would simply focus on her spiritual damage. Well, loss like that damages us all, but reading the story as just that cheats her of her personal agency and strong will: she has opportunities to get off of the road and chooses not to. She owns her own life and she asserts her right to it, like she does to her cigarettes.At times I was reminded of movies like Easy Rider, Two Lane Blacktop, Vanishing Point, and even Paterson. This is a road film par excellence and as a fan of road films for decades (I collect them), I cannot recommend this highly enough.It may be a generation before we see another like this.Strongly and enthusiastically recommended."
NOMADLAND,15 April 2021,6/10,"I am not a fan of this type of films. I must say that it touched me by showing how many people live, lived and American culture. I believe there was a little more to the story, perhaps depth in certain parts. A good movie to show in class."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,1/10,"I am shocked how this film won Oscar. This is documentary not a film. There is no story, no script it's out of mind what's going on. Completely disaster."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,8/10,"It's difficult to appreciate for non-Americans or non-nomads, but still a masterpiece. Its relaxed structure and melancholic tone feel novel in films. Reminds me of Greek mythology, Chinese supernatural legends, and Studio Ghibli."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,10/10,"Just beautiful. An uplifting but sad film, beautifully filmed and acted. Made me want to go live in a van and that is so not me!"
NOMADLAND,26 May 2021,1/10,I can't find no script no scenario no story and NO PRODUCTION what a waste of time.
NOMADLAND,6 June 2021,6/10,"This movie was boring for me, I'm not saying it's bad, but it's boring, this movie is for the older audiences or for the people who actually live in their vans or in the nature."
NOMADLAND,7 November 2021,3/10,"While I understand the draw to this movie, I felt that there were multiple parts that could be cut. This movie was NOT Academy Award Material. The camerawork was good but that is about it.This board me so much that I had to stop the movie and come back to it 3 days later to be able to say I had finished it."
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,5/10,"+ Acting was superb
+ Very believable and realistic characters
Storyline was very blandSlow paced, boring at timesNot much happens in the film, certainly nothing exciting."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,10/10,A cinematic experience I really enjoyed with all my heart. Among the 3 Oscar winning performances by Frances McDormand this is the one I loved the most. Well done Chlo√© Zhao. Can't wait to see Marvel's Eternals.
NOMADLAND,5 June 2021,1/10,"This movie sucks, if you wanna watch a old woman take a diarrhea dump in the back of her van (House)... then this movie is for you. Apparently it stinks soooo bad that she opens up the window/vent/fan to purify out her van. It was kinda funny cause somebody was knocking on the door/window of her van while all this was happening. Dont watch unless you wanna see a old woman taking a dump. Its gross."
NOMADLAND,5 November 2021,1/10,"A pretentious film made by the priviledged and wealthy, glorifying homelessness to appeal to other priviledged viewers who have no grasp of real life and the struggles of the displaced. Beyond the beginning of the film, after the ""plot"" has been established, the story completely evaporates. Character development is non-existent, conflict and conflict resolution are non-existent, and the film legitimately goes nowhere despite the theme of living on the road. The main actress, although a perfectly fine talent, has seemingly NOTHING to work with to make her character likeable in any way. No rationality behind almost any of her decisions, absolutely zero personality, basically ruining any relatability the viewer might experience with the character. If you're a pretentious hipster with no real life experience that finds genuine amusement in watching a homeless-by-choice middle aged woman with the personality of a brick take a series of diarrhea dumps into a bucket, this Oscar winner is for you."
NOMADLAND,18 April 2021,6/10,"I'd like to start by saying I actually enjoy slow films but the films theme and pace simply bored the hell out of me Mcdormand acted well and Chloe Zhao's directing is spot on but the film simply didn't appeal to me.Not much happens, very little drama and for someone who's homeless not a lot of bad happens to her. What I mean is, I know Mcdormand's character is recovering from grief and is homeless but other than a flat tire or running out of gas there isn't any real obstacles to overcome.I'd say this is one for the critics, from a viewers perspective rather boring but for a critic I imagine there's a lot to talk about :)"
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,1/10,The movie had possibilities but went down the path of unrealistic for a 60 year old woman who had a chance to hook up with a man who actually liked her and would of been a suitable companions for one another in their latter years. They should of taken it down the path of intimacy where it would of normally led as opposed to avoiding it as they did. Taking off as she did without so much as a good-bye was totally out of the norm as well. The movie was a disappointment.
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,9/10,"There's not much plot in this almost-documentary-like film. But from the first frame featuring Frances McDormand's weathered face to the last, it's a riveting and deeply poignant look into a facet of American life not widely talked about.The film centers around a woman named Fern who was unrooted by the complete evisceration of her town in the Great Depression of 2011. When we first meet her, she seems to have settled into an annual cadence of seasonal gigs that keeps her on the road - I.e. a ""nomad"" - packer at an Amazon warehouse, campsite cleaner, burger flipper at a dino park, rock picker of some sort at a quarry...To the conventional eye, her camper van (well it's really just a van) existence seems devastatingly bleak. But Fern is defiantly not a victim. She finds deep connections and genuine moments of joy with fellow nomads.Our natural inclination to pity can't help but evolve into curiosity and wonder - especially after we learn that a ""normal, stable"" life is actually within her grasp.
Why she refuses to abandon her nomadic ways is a question the movie doesn't answer. We are left to wonder if it's what happens to people so deeply traumatized by loss that the only permanence they dare hold on to is transience. And it's only fitting this tale of transience is set against some of America's most devastatingly beautiful but lonely landscapes.No one will be surprised by Frances McDormand's amazing acting here (reminiscent of Three Billboards Outside of Epping). What's more effecting, however, is the way Chloe Zhao weaved a cast of non-actors' authentic voices into Fern's narrative. This blurring of fact and fiction adds so much gravitas and makes this a depressing but timely and necessary look at a collective American hurt locker."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,1/10,"You have a character that is broke and the movie really never explains why. Her husband would have had a union job at 3M, they didn't have kids. She was a substitute teacher without a degree? Where did all the money go. She meets with her sister who says she is an adventurer, yet she lived in the same town for 25 plus years in the same house. Maybe instead of trying to make her look like a saint, they should have studied someone who is self centered and never saved for the future. Or just blame 3M, which is the lazy way out."
NOMADLAND,7 June 2021,7/10,"I had heard lots of good things about this film so decided to rent it and watch. I will say, it kept my attention throughout the entire running time, beautiful scenery, and - contrary to some reviews I have read - I thought the professional actors and the amateurs meshed quite nicely. Those things are what prompted me to give it seven stars as a rating. However - and this is a big however - this is NOT a film I would choose to watch again. For me, the down side was the lack of at least a thread of a plot. The film meandered too much for my taste. I felt that too much time was spent on the lead character in scenes that were either unnecessary or that failed to move the film along. Clearly not enough time was spent exploring at least a few of the other characters in depth. It seems like zero attempt was made to explore the nomad life of those that had no choice but were forced by economic circumstances rather than through some noble attempt at a life of freedom. The film I think would have been better with fewer extraneous scenes like the main character floating nude in a river and with more scenes exploring the lives of the other characters with a bit more depth. In my opinion, the director missed a great opportunity here to come up with a ten star film."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,6/10,"What if yor kid loves hot-dogs and strawberry ice-cream. Will you mix it together and be surprised that ""the best food ever"" is rejected ? Something similar happened to ""Nomadland"" . It starts like ""The graphes of wrath"" but suddenly turns into ""Easy Rider"" . The acting is flawless and you can see a lot of nice views. But nothing else."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,7/10,"It's fine. Was it life changing meh not really. Does it have rewatch value? Honestly no. I do agree with the gripe of the pointless gratuitous nudity it truly was unnecessary and if the point of it was for the character to feel at pace could have very well have gone with a different shot! We get it she's in water and it's supposed to make her feel at peace. I have to give the film credit it was really different for what it is and the cinematography is really quite good. Though i do think this film winning best picture was a mistake when all the other films nominated in the category were far superior. I feel I gave it the score it deserves. It isn't mediocre, but it's pace and it's story with no plot leaves quite a bit to be desired. With no resolve for our main character it can tend to leave the viewer feeling as though it was all pointless and the 2 hours spent were for nothing and that's the biggest fault with this film."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,2/10,"I've been doing the #vanlife full time now for 6 years and absolutely love it! The freedom is priceless and in fact I love it so much I have one van in the USA, one in Australia and one in Europe right now. This movie was very depressing and boring. The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because the acting was superb. I really did not see a plot to it and when it all of a sudden ended, I was like WTF...that's it?"
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,2/10,"While I watched this movie, i actually thought I could have directed this nothing moving thats getting this amazing buzz...we see the main character meandering around homeless ect...it did absolutely nothing for me..very slow moving and nothing to the plot, went nowhereland"
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,6/10,"Agree with other reviewers that what I was really missing her was character.At the end of the movie, I still did not feel like I knew who the main character was or what her motivations were. As another reviewer said, it led to a lot of ambivalence during the watch because I did not really know this woman. At times I felt sad for her given how hard her life seems, but at many times she seems to actively choose her lifestyle and push others who want to change her away and so then you feel less empathy, but still discomfort as again, the whole movie is bleak.I felt like I got to know some of the peripheral characters more than the main character. I think we could have learned more backstory and/or motivation and/or just general personality through ""quiet"" moments (since the movie was slight on dialogue.) Those moments were unfortunately just not there. As others said, again, probably would have worked better as a documentary - let us see the depth and personality of the people featured."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,10/10,"The film appears and is shot rather plainly, but that's where and how it got you hooked. I watched it twice and both times it shook me.It may be a film about life as a nomad but is NOT a documentary afterall. So any failure to depict the lives of other or all types of nomads shouldn't be expected here. Rather, it is a film about life, about losing someone, about unable to let go, about the forlorn feelings, all very complex and hard to define as one.McDormand certainly deserves the win, she acted as if she IS Fern the character that makes one lapse info thinking it is like a documentary. The other characters and their respective lives brought depth and dimensions as well."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,5/10,"Ok, that might have been the tankful of Ros√© on an otherwise dull bank holiday weekend, but I couldn't get the hook. Beautifully shot, whimsical, melancholic...all good things in my opinion. Some interesting stuff on itinerant working. But unlike, say, Into The Wild (which I saw last week for the - shock! - first time) this seems a bit lightweight, and the characters never really seeming to develop. That's not to say we don't understand them - Frances McD's opening scene carries a weight of acting that gives us more insight into her character in 10 seconds than many films do in two hours - but they don't seem to go anywhere. Which is ironic given the title.Having watched another Oscar contender a couple of weeks back - the brilliant Sound of Metal - Nomadland seemed to have committed a crime."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,3/10,"Too long to tell almost nothing. If you see 30 minutes, that's all.It doesn't deserve an Oscar."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,Amazing journey as a nomad. The lonely life the freedom.
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,2/10,"Nothing of importance happens in the 102 minute runtime. I felt nothing but boredom throughout most of the film. The main character Fern is an older lady living in a van. That's the whole movie. The closest to anything interesting happening was when her van broke down and it was gonna cost a lot to fix. But then instead of it getting interesting from there, she simply asks for money and the drama is over. Seriously feels like flipping through PBS channels at 3am. The imagery is nice sometimes but there is no story whatsoever."
NOMADLAND,9 June 2021,5/10,"I love Zhao's other notable work, The Rider (which also relies on amateur actors). However, the difference is that The Rider has an important story to tell. I cared about the characters. Moreover, it actually has a plot (imagine that).None of the characters in Nomadland gave me cause to care very much about what happened to them or their fate. They are all volunteers. If this is intended as an examination of an alternate lifestyle then it is one characterized as people who, for the most part, have made some terrible choices.The appearance - at least to me - is of a director trying to show everyone how clever she is. She may be. She cleverly bored me to death."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,3/10,"It can be way better, it feels like nothing is happening in the movie."
NOMADLAND,27 May 2021,9/10,"I don't really know what the negative reviewers expected to see but let me tell you, a movie doesn't have to have a big climax or a shocking plot twist to be good. This movie is simple, heartbreaking and human. The music by Ludovico is superb as always and the portrayal of the protagonist conveys solitude, humanity and need for (but also fear of) human connection is emotionally layered and beautiful. 100% would recommend."
NOMADLAND,28 June 2021,1/10,"Fair enough: life on wheels, trailer parks, poverty, joblessness, The Grapes of Wrath of today. Well, the bad news: it's NOT. Good intentions plus heartbreaking monologues plus close-ups of the good actress's face don't make Art yet. Well, let's put into concoction an angel-like characters plus complete absence of racism, foul language, alcohol - granted. But still not enough to fill the void of 100+ minutes. Ok, let's make the actress urinate, and even defecate, with all appropriate sounds. The viewer can plug his/her ears, if something. What else? Let's give panoramic views of nature, launch clouds at sunset. Well, enough for now: the viewer is gaslighted to believe that this particular movie is something that it is NOT."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,4/10,"This was without a doubt the most boring movie I've seen in years. I feel like I deserve applause for watching the whole movie. The whole movie I was thinking; when will the story begin and then it ends. There are better more exciting ways to spend your time, like; watching paint dry."
NOMADLAND,30 March 2021,7/10,"I have always found it easy to distinguish between movies that NEED to be seen in the cinema and those that don't, those that can just as easily be enjoyed on the small screen. This was one such movie...Of course there were some good things about the movie - for the most part, the acting is excellent and the cinematography is breathtaking - but compared with Leave No Trace, which covered very similar ground and actually had a story that eventually left you somewhere, it is a MUCH poorer film. Why this has Oscar nominations and Leave No Trace didn't is a mystery to me.What do we know about Ferne at the end of the movie that we didn't know at the beginning? Nothing. Why did it take us two hours to get there? 30 minutes would have been enough..."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,5/10,"Tbh, I am encouraging myself to watch this because of McDormand. I was curious about nomad. If I come to choose what nomad movie you would like to watch twice, I might be choosing Tallulah, which I never put in my favorite movie. I still could watch Tallulah till the end, although I give the 4.5 rating.I understand about showing the life of nomad in such simple, deep, and close to nomad conversation; as close as the common people talking. However, the performance of McDormand (if you expect to be portraying about common people), seriously. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is way way way much better. Or what else, if you want to talk about the common people life. I will choose Roma.It is just a main course you can't finish. It's maybe lacking something, but as a common people who enjoy watch film; both commercial and festival, I can't really enjoy it until the end, tbh."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,7/10,"...like this movie tells you something. I've never been houseless, but have been close, and think this is a very romanticized version of life on the road. Show us their hands, so dry their their knuckles are bloody, filthy under the nails. Show us the altered and crazy people you'd meet out there, because you most definitely would. I feel like the people who love this movie live in a world far removed from the world depicted here, and that anyone working just to scrape by would not find this entertaining at all."
NOMADLAND,14 June 2021,1/10,The story didn't have a point of view which made it excruciatingly dull. Would have been a better documentary as at least it could have explored some of the issues that led to the failure of capitalism.
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,8/10,"It's interesting that Fern's personality, the seemingly meandering story and realistically slow pace of this movie mesmerized many people and disappointed many others. If the viewer simply allows Fern to be who she is, wounded, withdrawn, selfish and egocentric while also engaging, thoughtful, hard-working and compassionate, but always on her own terms, they might appreciate the film more.She is not drawn simply to fit into a narrative like many roles. She is the story and the backdrop of her journey is her meander through the pathway of seasonal work in this fantasy of nomadic culture that does exist but is really much more perilous, much more tribal, and much more ungenerous in real life.I loved this film because it did not plant Fern in a world of politics, racism and misogyny, classism and judgement. It ignored those realities so we could better get to know Fern and the snapshots of the people that influenced her after her life was shattered by her husband's death and her town's demise."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,3/10,This is one of those pseudo deep movies for a generation of dummies who easily impress with hard life stories and inner feelings of heroes on the screen.
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,10/10,"I don't see how anyone could watch this movie and not be completely mesmerized and stunned by its beauty and story. Francis McDormand gives an incredible performance, as always, but it was the rest of the cast that really gave this movie its believability and vision. It was a movie that I was drawn into, and that rarely happens. It was brilliantly directed and was enhanced by the incredible cinematography. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. Anyone with an ounce of creativity, lust for travel, and sensitivity, will be drawn into its spell."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,8/10,"Read about the awards this film has received so thought I'd give it try. Its beautifully shot and acted. It seems like the cast were actually living the film rather than acting it. Some lovely analogies on life and the nomad society was almost presented as a religion . I did find it quite depressing and found it difficult to like the central character. Although the argument about why we spend all our lives in dept and only have a few years mortgage free before we die , was good one. All in all thought provoking, focusing on those who choose not to, or are forced to live on the road. Over all I did enjoy it ."
NOMADLAND,25 May 2021,5/10,One of my favorite actors is Frances McDormand and yet again she does an amazing performance. Everyone did in this movie.Sadly I've never been more bored.I'm 31 and I felt like I was watching a movie with my parents as a kid. Just waiting for something interesting to happen. It never came.
NOMADLAND,25 August 2021,1/10,"Since it received Best Picture and Best Actress I thought I'd give it a watch. It seemed like a documentary wrapped up in a film. It was mainly McDormand going around and talking to actual nomads. Even that in itself could have been interesting had it been written better, also there seemed to be very little acting coming from McDormand. The story was not good, the movie plot seemed stalled, it was just all around BAD! It was a VERY, VERY hyped up movie."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,1/10,I could only bare half an hour of this movie. And son was the only one in the theatre. They would not have recouped air conditiong costs.I think the world wide gross also shows that the public is not fooled about its Oscar merits.
NOMADLAND,30 July 2021,5/10,"This was clearly a PC choice (like Zero Dark Thirty). Slow, not much story, cinematography pretty good. Just didn't make it. The real theme not made very clear until a lot of film rolled by. Not a great endeavor."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,3/10,"It is one of those movies that u just wait to end, but it never ends. Pointless story with no real meaning. Me and my wife hated it, it ruined our movie day."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,10/10,"Fern's journey to herself is discovered on the roads of America. It could be the story of so many of my generation. I recall the news reports of 2008/2009 when so many retirees lost everything and either had to go back to work to survive or failing to do so were homeless. Chloe Zhao brilliantly reflects one woman's story, as well as her friends, on film. It sent me on the hunt for her other two films. I look forward to more from young Chloe."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,3/10,"Woman's van breaks down and she gets annoyed about a man dropping her plates....the end. I think there have been much better performances for best actress so a little shocked with that. Not sure what this was all about, no depth, nothing happens."
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,7/10,"I liked it, mostly because of the great acting by Frances McDormand. Would describe the movie as a sequel to Sean Penn's 'Into the wild' but a very realistic one."
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,10/10,"Beautiful film. So real it feels like a documentary. I was wondering about life, death, nature, and our place in it. And wondering about those who fall through the cracks and are forgotten, or just don't make it. Really appreciated this."
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,1/10,"Nomadland is all hype. It's not a good movie. It's not even an average movie. It's not even a below-average movie. It belongs at the bottom. It's a movie about people who has no home, traveling in moving van, buses or trailers. But the movie has no where to go. No plot. No heart. Nothing. A one star out of ten is too generous."
NOMADLAND,27 November 2021,10/10,"I was very over by this film, to some extent it tells the other side of the story, the tragic human side to 'The Big Short'. The people are shown making the best of limited choices and retaining their decency and humanity. It is humbling."
NOMADLAND,20 October 2021,10/10,"I see that movie almost 3 months ago as a acting point of view:-ANALYSING FOUR THINGS AS AN ACTOR:-Behaviour of the Character - Is the behaviour of the Character is very dumb in her life and their trying to live the society without home and the SO CALLED SOCIETY. They started to live in her Van with the limited facilities. In her life happened very crucial things as an actor. I was seen view things in the character face without any dialogues actor says all the thing's. I was really connected to it. WAHI GHAR HONE KA MATLAB YE NI HAIN KI SAB HAIN HAMARE PASS KUCH NAHI BHI HOTA HAIN, SAB HONE PE!!Behaviour Change's - Time to time and moving the story behaviour changes in the character like starting the story character her very lonely feeling in her car after the story moving character behaviour changed like in shopping story somebody ask to it ""TO LIVE WITH MY FAMILY"" and the character behaviour changed that is the beauty of the actor and the last seen They go to friends house and the her friend has to ask to live with me and circle has the life circle started again and character behaviour is the change. WELL PERFORMANCE MA'AMInner Space Or Outer Space of a Character - Both character space's are changed smoothly and giving lot of things in a camera. In a jungle they danced and feel the nature that's the seen is improvised."
NOMADLAND,23 February 2021,7/10,"While I found parts of this movie dull, I can't help but admire the shots of the scenery. It was absolutely beautiful and just that alone made me enjoy the movie.I enjoyed this movie not only because of how beautiful it was but how it showed me a different life and the reality for some ""homeless"" folks. Fern is a brilliant character and is probably a character most people can relate to.If you are on the fence about watching this movie, WATCH IT!"
NOMADLAND,25 February 2021,5/10,"If you are looking for a slow pace movie with wonderful scenario, it's something for you. But for me this movie was just so boring and I didnt feel the need of supporting anyone in this movie. Just kinda blame for me."
NOMADLAND,8 October 2020,9/10,"Nomaland It was a wise move on Zhao's part toeventually include some suburban homes, whereFern and Dave have relatives ready to help. Theymay not have ideal choices but they both havealternatives to life on the road, options they haverejected. One of those family members, trying tobe kind, compares nomads to pioneers. That istrue enough, but as the bracing Nomadland reveals, it is also too simplistic a view for today'sUS, with its ageing population in a devastatedeconomy."
NOMADLAND,12 September 2021,1/10,"A movie should be based on a storyline, not a diary of scattered events here and there for God sake.I didn't get what was the real struggle of the main character of living in a home, why she chose that kind of life, the movie started and ended at the same point, just a woman's day that repeats itself over and over again without any point.I would not recommend it, I was counting the seconds till the end came at last."
NOMADLAND,8 March 2021,9/10,The writing and acting and filming are great and I loved it. But yehh it is a little bit slow but if you like drama you'r gonna love this movie.
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,10/10,"A must watch for many reasons. Frances is amazing, but the non-actors are amazing as well. As someone who works in the ""van life"" industry, I was really touched by this movie."
NOMADLAND,15 August 2021,10/10,"I enjoy a wide variety of films, but I have always enjoyed art-house films, so this is an automatic win for me. On one side their is the gorgeousness of the cinematography, but not engaging in the same way it would in an action movie, for example. There's hardly ever roaming camera movement, which may offset younger audiences who are more used to action adventure movies. But I would consider the camerawork engaging. The eye lines are near perfect, and the performance, like the camerawork, isn't engaging in the same way a blockbuster movie like star wars is.And While star wars is one of my favorite movies, and a great example of what cinema could be, I do, by a razors edge, like this film more. It's the journey, and character arc of the protagonist, Fern. This film never loses it's impact. But what is the arc?If you say nothing happens, I would imagine your simply not engaged at what is happening. I have seen a chocking number of review stating that Fern had no arc, which could only come from a lazy audience. It's not wrong, being lazy while at the cinema, but this film is not made for that kind of audience. I know lots of people who state they like art-house films, but then when they watch one let get on their phone, or fall asleep. This may come from a mindset that liking at-house films make one more intelligent, and because of that ""I need to like art-house films, because i'm smart."" Liking a certain type of film doesn't make one smart.About Fern as a character, she is not in a good spot. Not just in the 'normal world' but internally as a character she is unstable. She also turns down the opportunity to stay in a house, and lives as a nomad by choice. And weather or not the films depicts that part accurately I don't care. So many physicists could nit pick star wars for being unrealistic, but that doesn't make it bad. Overall what Fern needs at a character level is to stop remembering and move on, make new memories. And it's here that was get the theme or moral argument of the film.Most of the information is told to use near the end of the film, but it's all shown to use at the beginning to. Fern kissing at certain blanket and looking at old pictures of a man both clearly show her husband is dead. Fern obsessively gluing old broken dishes that belonged to her husband, again obsessed about the past and constantly remembering, and only remembering.Overall, this film is engaging in an artsy way. The film is all about show don't tell and orchestrates it perfectly. If you an art student, or someone who has a deep love for art-house cinema, you will adore every shot of this film as something you could put as a poster on you wall, because it's such a beautiful shot. Not just a great film, but one of the best. However if your average viewer is likely going to see this as a good (not great) film."
NOMADLAND,19 April 2021,4/10,"Where to start? I expected too much from this film, since Frances is extraordinary and I loved her in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.Nice cinematography, nice music, great directing, great interpretations, great potential to be a GOOD film....but.... Where is this story we're all craving to be moved by?? Even the synopsis is more exciting... Maybe too much... That's why I was expecting a lot more.Slow, zero attachment to the character due to the lack of story, boring. The movie is literally like watching a 2 hour long music video."
NOMADLAND,23 March 2021,,I don't understand why people are liking this.. or maybe it is just not my taste to enjoy such movies.. infact I thought of it more like a documentary.. I skipped in between because there was no plot... And it ended where it started.. no value added..
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,10/10,"I hope for these categories to be nominated. The cinematography: imagine all the natural weather conditions, times of the day, and all the indoor and outdoor shots. The lead actress: Ms. McDormand went inward into the character and plainly without pushing, expressed feelings at every moment with her movements, voice, and her eyes. The screenplay: every piece of dialogue has meaning, nothing wasted. The music: it moves with the story and carries the senses. The director: so smooth, so much ease yet so much heart, so much fun and so much to feel, to realize, to understand and to agree.
It's a total win for the audiences who watch it."
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,8/10,"Definitely one of the crudest movies that show the genuine reflection of loneliness and identity. Adding the wonderful shots of the landscapes, the film achieves to put ourselves in the shoes of Fern. Make us feel that we are going through the last stage of our lives and decisions are not relevant anymore. The very touching stories increase a feeling of powerlessness about the uncertainty.Anyway, the film transmits a helpful message about reflecting and take control of our actions day by day."
NOMADLAND,12 March 2021,10/10,A perfect movie with the best detail and honorable if you want to watch just a movie. The movie will be nomadland
NOMADLAND,2 July 2021,10/10,"Just watched Nomadland and so impressed with it. I'm no professional movie critic, but as a person who lived for a year and a half recently as a nomad (but in a small, old RV) this movie was right up my alley.Having experienced the nomad life personally, I think nomads will have a different and more positive take on this one versus people who have never experienced it. The moments in the movie where you are just in the right place at the right time to witness a natural phenomenon - and it could just be a big field of blooming sunflowers, or a blue sky and no one else around for miles wand all you can hear is the wind - that's what made the nomad life so great.Zhao did a beautiful job with the script and the end result. It's so refreshing to have someone make a movie on this subject and do such a wonderful job of it."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,10/10,"This is the first film that resonates strongly with me. The soundtrack and the scenery are shocking, even though the picture is so quiet. I saw it and finally felt unprecedented loneliness and sadness. Decided that there must be a road trip in the future. This film deserves so many praises and awards."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,9/10,"This film is a true work of art, it represents the feelings in every moment and the settings are beautiful, incredible performances and cinematography."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,4/10,"This movie was well acted and provided a look at the people in America who aren't really looked at: the restroom cleaners, Amazon packers, short order cooks, etc.I didn't know what to expect (at first), but then realized that this movie was going to be a gritty insight of people in the shadows, how to cope with loss, what is important in life, and end of life issues. It's certainly not upbeat, but that's not really the intent of the story. I wouldn't watch again, and wouldn't recommend anyone see the film, but wouldn't dissuade anyone away from seeing it. 4/10."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,4/10,More of a documentary. Not a movie for Friday or Saturday night.
NOMADLAND,19 August 2021,9/10,"I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, since I gave it a 9, but it didn't deserve best picture.I love what Chlo√© Zhao with casting actual nomads instead of real actors, it made more realistic than it would've been. Also I do think Frances McDormand deserved the Oscar, what she did didn't feel like acting at all, it was one of the realest performances of the year, if not the most!Also great cinematography and a solid script.All though I do think this movie deserved: cinematography, actress and director I don't think it deserved picture. There was a few other movie that I liked more.Anyway good movie, not for everyone!"
NOMADLAND,6 October 2021,9/10,I've never actually watched this movie yet but im planning to so i cant wait.
NOMADLAND,14 August 2021,1/10,This film was amazingly awarded many different types of accolades but I hated every second of it. There was no joy in watching this depressingly bland film. Whoever came up with the idea for this film needs to be 'struck off' from the writer'guild or associated body. Deplorable sums this up.
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,1/10,"I saw ""Peter Rabbit 2"" the same week. Flopsie, Mopsie and Cottontail were more entertaining than the whole cast of ""Nomadland""... Watch the bunnies' film instead."
NOMADLAND,7 February 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is among these films, extremely rare ones in these times, that leaves you watching credits at the end and thinking about your life, similar experiences, questions and that suddenly you start clearing your house/mind/present/life.
It asks a huge question: ""Does the loss give you strenght or weakens yourself?"" or ""How was your life in general?"""
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,10/10,"First off I just want to say what beautiful cinematography this was. The landscape of the United States never looked so impressive. I don't understand this need for this bread crumb trail for a story to be told to you. The nomad lifestyle and the day to day living and the meeting people along the way, that's the story. No disrespect to the Fast and Furious franchises but if you want loud things that go boom or some intense story they have those films. This one did a tremendous job."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,9/10,"If you like a movie to be entertaining and dramatic then you probably won't like this. If you appreciate film as storytelling, you probably will.This movie is quiet. Not literally (although it can be), rather you have to really pay attention to what it's all about. I'll admit for the first 1/3 I was wondering when the story was going to start and it wasn't until I was halfway through that it dawned on me. You know how most movies you watch and then never give it a second thought? This was not that.Yes, the entire movie is watching Fern travel and live in a van, meeting various people, working different jobs etc. I hesitate to say it's entirely about loss, because you're never really quite sure if she's running away from or towards something. I believe pain and fear initially drive her actions; she clearly experiences great pain over the life she lost with her husband, and she seems scared to consider living within four walls again. But that lifestyle also seems too restrictive for her, and the way she lives now is freeing, stripping away all the noise, leaving her experiences to be so innately human.""Mum said you're homeless, is that true?""
""No, I'm not homeless, I'm just houseless""Absolutely worth a watch."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,10/10,One of the best movies I've watched recently. Highly recommended to watch it.
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,9/10,"If one film is worth to be titled as the best film of the year 2020, it's Nomadland. This is a type of film we need of more: intimate, beautiful, human. Aesthetic without a single drop of kitsch. A film about real life, real people, real values, and feelings of loss, that inspires you to live, love, and appreciate those things that are most important in your life. A film to remember and live by."
NOMADLAND,11 January 2021,5/10,"Nothing to see here...some good acting but dull storyline, irritating characters, yawn"
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,10/10,"I might not give this movie 10 stars twenty years ago. But today it deserves even more than that. Hollywood mainstream productions are moving further away from making movies as an art form. We almost forget that a real movie is more than scripted computer games. It can be as beautiful and powerful as a poem, like this perfectly executed art work by Chloe Zhao."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,7/10,"For like 75% of the film i was like ""whats the story?"". And then at the end i was like ""oh, good story""."
NOMADLAND,1 March 2021,3/10,It begins. It goes nowhere. And it ends. Went home and forgot about everything but the waste of time.
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,5/10,"Sad film, all the time, ambient, characters, film shows good start but later is too long and too dramatic."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,6/10,"Hard to explain what I felt about this movie, especially with all the critical acclaim. Yes, it's beautifully shot and yes, it's well acted. However, it is light on story and too quiet to steer emotions. I'm glad I watched it but I was honestly bored while doing it."
NOMADLAND,18 June 2021,6/10,"Essentially this is a lifestyle flick with a character subplot. It's easy to see what inspired the director and writer and it certainly wasn't the characters she created but the ones she found in real life. Should have just opted for a documentary. As it stands, you spend the whole movie torn by the two movies Nomadland wants to be, never fully succeeding fully in either."
NOMADLAND,6 September 2021,3/10,But where's the beef? It's a lesson how to film beautiful locations. That's all.
NOMADLAND,18 June 2021,9/10,This is one of those movies that makes you think. Where did my life go ? What ever we chased under systemic instruction was pretty futile if you don't accept who you really are. The need for freedom and the need for belonging are both real and combined with the growing lack of intimacy this superb film is a compelling watch. Loved it.
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,10/10,"It is about grief and pride and independence. It is poised. It is about love, and life after love. It is about community and wilderness and freedom and family, and life away from family. It is mostly about older persons trying to get by, and despite their challenges they look out for the younger folks too. It is unfiltered and utterly heartbreaking and life affirming. I cried 3 times during this film, and it still touches me. Many of the characters are real, and you can feel this, and while watching it I hope for the main character to find new love and peace."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,5/10,"Maybe in 2019 my review may have been different. But honestly, watching one depresive character after another for 2 hour, was hard not to feel like them, cranky and miserable. I think these are special times with special needs and we deserve better.That been said, I have travel across 54 countries, pooped on wost places than a bucket and never felt sad, just joy, like those very brief moments when she is in nature. Every day I travell I get that joy, and sometimes it's with less than 100 bucks a month. So take your gloom to another year and give humanity something more uplifting during a pandemic please! I have to go, still haven't finished watching all the Jerusalema challenges. Now we are talking ;-)"
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,3/10,Totally overrated. The film is just boring. I think the story could have been much better written for the big screen. A snoozfest.
NOMADLAND,27 May 2021,9/10,"If you want to feel the ineffable emotions you felt when you played the first 10 minutes of Stardew Valley, this movie as a whole is your wish fulfilled."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,4/10,"Being from Arizona, seeing Quartzite was a pleasant surprise and I am quite fond of the American southwest and this film did really do the location justice. I think the shots were beautiful and simple, but that's about where my praise for this movie stops unfortunately.My main question is why there was so much... well nothing. Scenes watching Frances (who I love) just living out her day in a manner that is although realistic, doesn't really provide any meaningful substance to any commentary that can be had on the nomadic lifestyle or those faced with homelessness. It's a shame that it felt like there was such little dialogue in the film as that seemed to be the only part in which I felt the film meaningfully conveyed anything, and even then, it was surface level with nothing significantly profound.The pacing and plot of this film also felt just, random really, and in a way that didn't give me any sense of adventure, just made me feel like there was a real lack of direction.The ending... yeah that was just not good. Nothing profound, interesting, or rewarding. Due to COVID-19 we all understand why the film industry had such slim pickings this year and I think we will look back at ""Nomadland"" as we do at ""A Beautiful Mind"" the ""least-worst"" of the bunch."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,3/10,"I am really wondering about such movies which are overrated and even awarded. It's ""describing"" the scene in very depressing and some scenes are disgustimg without even convey the message in inspirimg way."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,8/10,"""I NEVER SAY A FINAL GOODBYE. I ALWAYS SAY I WILL SEE YOU DOWN THE ROAD"". And the tears start rolling down. This one sentence sums it all up."
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,8/10,I thought the film had some great emotion showing a woman without a home. Frances is great as always. The story moves a little slow at times but it is necessary to show the true emotion of the film. My only gripe is it showed a little too much of her life before the storyline kicked in place. But great film!
NOMADLAND,9 March 2021,9/10,This film is highly emotional and hits at home for me closer than most. Having lived in a car myself I completely understood the serious situation that Francis had gone through. Homelessness is a major problem but so is living in your car. And the fact that it's hard to find a place to park in the city without being asked to move is another issue. My only issue is I felt the story could have moved forward more quickly. Cinematography feels very indie which is a good thing. It makes everything feel raw and almost like watching a documentary. I didn't even realize David Strathairn was in this until the end credits. I expect this to go on the Oscars watchlist right away!
NOMADLAND,11 July 2021,3/10,Best part of The movie was the nice nature views of the Midwest.
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,10/10,"I never leave reviews, so don't be too harsh when judging me. The biggest reason I am now is because I live this life and it's pretty great.
The other reason I wanted to review is because someone said below that if Fern would have vanlifed right, she would have been happy. I think she was happy, though. Some people's happiness is quieter. Sure she was grieving and that's a process. But she had some really good moments in between, and it seemed like she met her people."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,8/10,"I was finally able to return to the cinema for the first time in eons to see the winner of the Oscars, the Golden Lion in Venice and the winner of another hundred awards around the world, Nomadland!Hot comments: beautiful, solid, with an interpretation of a granite McDormand, perhaps a little too didactic, perhaps with the desire to deal with too many themes, not favoring one supporting one, few mother scenes to opt for many small slices of life, many small situations full of looks, silences and a handful of words. A film of borders, inside and outside, closed and open, a film of internal and external places to seek and find, of circular paths that do not necessarily have to lead somewhere, of the outcasts of a society cannibalized by capitalism or new pioneers in the lands that are once again wild!"
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,6/10,"While the film is beautifully filmed and acted, I struggled to stay engaged. How is it that a movie set in contemporary America has few, if any, people of color. That's not the America I know or want to know."
NOMADLAND,7 March 2021,9/10,"Stick with this movie past the first documentary-style hour in which nothing seems to move the ""plot"" along. By the end of the movie, you realize that Frances McDormand's character is using her wanderings as a way to mourn the loss of her husband, but also as a way to push aside human connection. A sad movie - with a hint toward the end that the character Fern might have reached the ""acceptance"" stage of grief - with a wonderful, naturalistic portrayal by McDormand."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,5/10,"That's it. That's the most boring film I've seen in a long, long time. I get what the makers were trying to show but still it's so lame. The character goes from nowhere to nowhere for 100 minutes, take pleasure. Even my life seems more interesting and I do nothing at all."
NOMADLAND,2 April 2021,2/10,"I decided to watch the movie because of the rave reviews. 20 minutes into the movie, I kept waiting for the movie to start, unfortunately by the end of the movie, it never did start. Slow and boring. I only watched it to the end to be able to say I had seen the movie. It surely was not for me."
NOMADLAND,18 July 2021,4/10,"Not sure how this movie could have possibly won best picture over others like the ""sound of metal"" or the ""trial of the Chicago seven""."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,,"The scene that really hit me here was when the main character's friend was telling her what a great life she lived. She was so pensive about her death, being in her late age, and she conveyed it so perfectly. My life is coming to a close, and when I look back on it, the things that come to mind are these simple, quiet moments that no one else has seen. A simple moment where I was at the mouth of a cave, looking up, and the birds flew over and it felt like I was flying. As a nomad, we all experience moments like these without any other soul nearby, so sometimes it feels lonely not to share such an important, blissful memory with someone else. But that is kind of what being a nomad is all about. The quiet tree that falls without making a sound."
NOMADLAND,17 March 2021,10/10,"Frances Mcdormad as Fern is once again at her peak performance. I can very well say this movie is not about the life and times of nomads but altogether a different perspective about life far away from the concrete and corporate jungle. There are no complex things here, no double meanings, no politics, no religion, no race, just simple life and philosophies of ordinary people. There's a nomad inside everyone, even you."
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,5/10,I was disappointed in this movie as I was expecting a film about the underclass and instead found it was about hippies in old age.
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,10/10,"No one, but no one could have starred in this feature like Frances McDormand. It is so rich with life experience, with the showing of adapting in her own way to events out of her control. Just remarkable acting and directing. A mature feature far from action movies. So real."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,8/10,One of the greatest movie that I've watched so far. Too much great points to absorb for whom looking for the meaning of life. You may never enjoy watching this if you're such a person enjoy entertaining movies.This movie touches your soul...
NOMADLAND,15 June 2021,9/10,"I watched Nomadland last night, 15.6.21, on AppleTV. An empath, I loved the movie, for example that Fern insisted she was still married to her dead husband. That is the kernel of this entire ""on the road"" film, the impossibility of meeting up again. I understand the mix of professional and non-professional actors may be off-putting to some, but I liked it. I have published on Carl Theodor Dreyer, who worked with non-pros often and improvised a lot. Director Chlo√© Zhao, I felt, was doing much the same. I also liked that she edited her own film. Like an auteur of old. Frances McDormand is a great actor. I would watch her in anything. Her performance here is a tour de force. There is something I hated about Nomadland, however. Fern (McDormand) works periodically at Amazon. When asked how she likes it, she says only, she likes it and it pays well. The Amazon warehouse scenes feature prominently twice. Throughout the film, Fern smokes cigarettes, for no apparent reason. McDormand and Zhao are co-producers of Nomadland, along with several other people. They were responsible for raising money to finance the production of the film. The visual grammar of Nomadland suggests they may have accepted money from Amazon and Big Tobacco. To have done so would be the height of hypocrisy, particularly in a film about the new nomads who oppose conventional Capitalism. This is an issue of more than product placement. It pertains to evil: greed, corruption, and indifference to the suffering of others, Amazon warehouse workers and nicotine addicts."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,8/10,"Slow burn, which i liked. It's about a subculture of people who for different reasons chose to live in an RV or Van. It's a great story with multiple narratives. Main character is in grief and reflection whats has passed and what she wants moving forward. Great acting, great movie and as it turned out Oscar worthy."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,2/10,No plot or intrigue to discover. An overrated movie.
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,4/10,"Save your time and never think to watch
I gave 4 because the cinematography and the acting"
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,6/10,"Nice filming and great acting, but the plot was kind of empty for me."
NOMADLAND,22 April 2021,1/10,"It's NOT a measure of good health for people to adjust to a profoundly sick society.No one chooses a depressing life of poverty. Traveling without end, the nomads are ""not on holiday"". People DO suffer enormously from a system of rabid inequality, indifference, despair, hunger, cold, illness with no end in sight. Not one human being can solve dire circumstances given the paltry resources that is frequently offered in our country.The Myth - The idea that Fran would turn down a better life for the one she suffers. Really, now?The film's Legacy - callously overlooks the true portrayal of human suffering & poverty. The drama does not sell the films fabricated story.Waste of Time."
NOMADLAND,26 April 2021,5/10,"I'm not a movie critic, just a fan of movies (I know they're called ""films"")Well this wasn't a movie. It was a film. A dreary story of a dreary unemotional account of a homeless woman's travails after losing her life as she had known it.It wasn't poignant, sad, emotional, inspirational, thought provoking, or otherwise engaging. It was more of a documentary about people who have chosen by choice or more likely tragic circumstances, to live life in trailer park after trailer park.The soundtrack was especially dreary. Not sad, dreary. The cinematography was appropriately grey.This is a film to be watched alone, at home, and definitely not with a date. Otherwise, you'll both go home alone, mildly depressed but not sad, and quickly looking to go to sleep. Wondering what was the point."
NOMADLAND,5 June 2021,8/10,A movie about getting lost and finding yourself. Beautiful and makes you wondering about the mening of life. But some scenens are to slow and i sometimes lose concentration.
NOMADLAND,27 June 2021,9/10,"Watching Fren trying to live life with a past full of loss and adopting to her chosen path and all it's adversities is just wonderful
A feast for the eyes and ears."
NOMADLAND,16 June 2021,9/10,"For everyone that is saying that it's not true to real life: it's a movie. It's doesn't have to be. On top of that, I think the movie does a great job depicting all the different sides of nomadness. I found it a very honest en integer movie about a woman who struggles with her place in the world and the meaning of life. It's also a movie about a shadowsociety, a community that supports ""normal"" society by doing all these hard seasonal jobs. A society nobody sees. A society full of people, some of them damaged by life, that struggle with a lot of different things like loss and greef, health and money problems.For everyone that finds it boring because nothing happens: go watch it again because you're so wrong. You didn't watch it close enough."
NOMADLAND,16 June 2021,1/10,"A Chinese director aestheticizes the ruin of the American empire, as we watch a washed up actress wander aimlessly amidst a barren landscape that is perpetually sun-downing. This isn't an artistic metaphor so much as a 3 hour long exercise in humiliation. Rest in Peace America. What you reap is what you sow."
NOMADLAND,17 April 2021,10/10,"This is a beautiful film, subtle in terms of visuals, sound, plot, and character development.Fern is not a likeable person but I still felt empathy for her. Pulling off that trick shows the talent of the writer, the actress, and the director.As a Westerner, I love the respect shown for our landscape and our people. Usually, Hollywood (for lack of a better term) shows us as ignorant yokels populating beautiful but inconsequential flyover territory.Thank you, Cloe, Frances, and everyone else who made Nomadland happen."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,10/10,"She can be whoever she wants to be...captures the bust on a human level as well as camera work...best, ai know she reads her scripts because I've never seen a bad film of hers"
NOMADLAND,2 June 2021,10/10,"I remembered my travel adventures and meeting new people. Travel. You see new people, hear their stories, and say goodbye, or you see them again. This movie is lovely and reminded me of all the people I met while traveling and reminded me of every story I heard. The film is sad in some parts, but that's life in some parts."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,,"I decided to watch this because I was hearing it was really good and it was the best film of all time. I don't know why everyone is saying that this is the best film of all time, it's good but it's definitely not the best film I've ever seen. Sure, it's beautifully shot and Frances McDormand's acting is good but the film is mostly just a documentary without being a documentary. It's a good film with some really beautiful shots but it just felt like there was no plot involved in the film, it was just seeing how the Nomads live. I understand if people loved the film but me, I guess I just found it kinda boring. Only reason I'm giving this an 8 is for the cinematography and the acting."
NOMADLAND,2 March 2021,8/10,"A great film, its a travel inside the deep and complex human feelings, and others things like: love, wound, nature contact, society exclusion, nomadlife, money, and home.
It's very beautiful the subjective feeling that the photography offer too.
I recommend so much"
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,6/10,"This film is unique in that it simultaneously tells a story of a woman on a journey through a tough time in her life while documenting the lives of modern day nomads in the American West.I wouldn't say either film within this film is particularly moving, but the cinematography and music are very good overall.Frances McDormand serves as both the main character and the unwitting documentary guide. Her acting is understated and convincing, though this script didn't require her to show a particularly wide range of emotion. Her ability to express understanding and sympathy stand out. But in the end, I really didn't feel a whole lot of sympathy for Fern.Regarding the nomad life and the characters we meet, I got the feeling there were some hardships that were not fully explored."
NOMADLAND,26 March 2021,9/10,"I loved francis. And I know I can't expect random people to act well or something, but thats the only thing that was destracting. For the rest amazing movie, felt like crying the entire time, it was awesome!"
NOMADLAND,6 September 2021,2/10,"This film had a ton of potential. As we made it through the first half hour I saw so many different ways they could cover some significant issues involved with this way of living. Safety was stated as an issue with almost every character, yet you never saw Fern in any danger whatsoever. She went skinny-dipping by herself in the middle of nowhere. There is absolutely no way a solo nomad woman would ever feel safe doing that out in the middle of nowhere. In multiple encounters with solo men along the way there was never any kind of weird tension, even with the kid she traded cigarettes with. When her van broke down before the $2,300 repair the van magically appears in a garage with no indication of how she got from the road to the garage, yet in a previous scene with a flat tire we go through 15 minutes of excruciating detail about the tire. Again with the safety thing - how does a solo woman stranded on the side of the road get to safety?Another disturbing part about this movie is the apparent lack of information passed along to the actual nomads appearing in the film (one was surprised to learn that Francis McDermott was a celebrity, for instance). The ""have the whole crew live out of a van"" move feels a whole lot like poverty spectatorism and exploitation.As far as cinematography goes...how many scenes of a Francis McDermott smoking a cigarette while looking out wistfully across a landscape at sunset do we really need? If the answer is a dozen or more this is your movie."
NOMADLAND,10 April 2021,2/10,"This ain't fargo. Wow, what a over-rated one! Had high expectations before going in and only reason ive joined hulu but everything looked hazy and fake, fake acting etc by over the top closeup shots."
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,1/10,"If there was ever a time to not watch this movie. This is it. My wife forced me to view this movie masterpiece. 'Her words'
I'm still half asleep as I type this. The phrase at viewer discretion is advised comes heavily to mind. Let's hope they don't make a 2nd. Thanks for your time."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,1/10,"One of the worst movies I've watched. Waste of time. I can't believe this is up for best picture. Depressing, pointless. I fell asleep. I'm glad I didn't waste my money to see it at the theater."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,8/10,Nice to see a movie that wasn't full of action and special effects for a change. I don't believe that living in a van and being able to get jobs enough to survive would be easy for a single woman. Still it was full of interesting characters and the scenery was beautiful.
NOMADLAND,13 May 2021,6/10,"I enjoyed the very beautiful pictures. It's a good thing that nature is allowed to stand out as something enchanting and beautiful, especially in a country so much associated with narcissistic demands for attention, categorical thinking and violence.As we follow McDormand's journey we are invited into the lives of many different people. At times the movie feels almost like a documentary, engaging with the men and women of the real world. Adding to that kind of authenticity I noticed during the credits, that most of the characters appear to share the same name as the actors who portray them.But it is in relation to this topic of authenticity and of engaging with the life of the other, or perhaps in contrast to it, that I find the most interesting thing about this movie to be the protagonist's dilemma over whether to relate to others or not, and yet it is also the most unresolved and underdeveloped aspect of the movie.The protagonist's conflict over whether she needs anyone or not, whether she wants to relate or not, never truly crystalizes. She leaves a dog behind, she ignores or rejects the advances of David, she seems to be content with being on her own, yet she hesitates and pats the dog on the head, she enjoys the visit to the zoo with Dave. I wish that aspect had been taken further and been dramatized more.On a side note the heavy use of piano music was too sentimental for me, but other than that I really enjoyed the movie, and it was nice to be back in a real cinema with other people and a big screen :)"
NOMADLAND,4 May 2021,2/10,I felt like a nomad. Driving around without a clue.
NOMADLAND,18 September 2020,9/10,"Is the ultimate dream really owning sticks and bricks with a picket fence and a yard?
This movie introduces us to modern day nomads. Some have adopted the lifestyle as a result of circumstances while others made a conscious choice to live this life.
I was drawn in to Frances McDormands charactor of Fern, a women from a small town that has basically closed down as a result of the main employer shutting their plant. She decides to convert a van into a home on wheels and seek seasonal work in different places.
Along the way she creates a road family of other nomads, sometimes they travel together sometimes their paths cross once a year - but there is a sense of family that is built.
There are times when things seem very bleak and lonely for Fern, but she also has a sense of inner strength that is to be admired. She is not without options, but she chooses to keep living her life on the road.
I also think it is a wonderful addition on the filmmaker's part in chosing to include actual nomads to play supporting charactors."
NOMADLAND,23 November 2020,8/10,"This is my favorite movie of 2020. I think so far. Everything is fine. Game on top, voice acting class"
NOMADLAND,3 August 2021,2/10,"Directing in good, Music is fantastic, cinematography is on point but no character building sorry not a fan.."
NOMADLAND,24 January 2021,,"Beautiful movie, beutiful acting, beautiful music, beautiful emotion. I loved it. The music is amazing!"
NOMADLAND,8 August 2021,6/10,"The film had great acting from everyone. However, the thing that put this film down is the overall plot. Just a woman who travelled to different camps and meeting new friends, that's it. The cinematography was excellent and connected to the film very well. Overall, the film is overrated and I can't understand how it won the best picture in the 2021 Oscars over the films which could've won."
NOMADLAND,24 May 2021,1/10,"This movie should not even get a 1 star, I'm baffled how its won 3 Oscar's. There is no real storyline in here and no purpose. Would definitely avoid watching this!"
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,1/10,"Ludovinco Einaudi is an outstanding musician and he made a great melody ( Oltremare ), but the movie's story is empty and a waste of time even though the acting was pretty good."
NOMADLAND,5 January 2021,3/10,"NOMADLAND takes its time disecting the life of the main character who lost her husband and ultimately ended up as Nomad due to financial struggles. With little twists and turns, the movie was too bland. This was a message not a story and it was more suitable as a documentary, especially since the actors used were real Nomads. There was no lessons learned, no character growth and no climax moments. Also, the plot failed to make a connection between the death of her husband and her current status. He was rarely mentioned and I guess we're just supposed to assume she's broken because of his loss. Her financial struggles are also unclear and she seems to have lots of support from family and friends so I'm not sure what I was supposed to feel because at times it seemed like she chose the life and that's just the way things are for her and I'm not gonna get emotional about it."
NOMADLAND,19 March 2021,5/10,"With the nomads being real nomads you would have thought there would have been a little more insight into how these people came to be, but the film mostly shows scenery instead of giving a bigger back story to things making the arc of the film weak. The score was great but the hype of the film dies with boring dialog. This film had huge potential and a great actor but I feel like the way this film portrays is trying to give it a double meaning or some sort of meaning only someone with godly intellect would have to have to understand it. Would recommend it if you're stuck on an airplane with nothing to do. The only scene that saved this film was when one of the other nomads drops the plates. Don't know how this movie won an Emmy."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,1/10,"No storyline, you don't feel for any characters. Fern, the main character seem like emotionless or does not how to put her feelings in words.How can such a movie get Oscar ?"
NOMADLAND,11 March 2021,10/10,"A beautiful exploration of life, death, loss and grieve. A poem for the eyes and the soul."
NOMADLAND,13 February 2021,7/10,"Get new experiences and lessons. Fern met fellow travelers and learned road survival and self-reliance skills.After hearing that this film would be one of the strongest Oscar candidates, I was more and more curious about the film and it was quite entertaining"
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,10/10,"Slow, delicate, emotional story of a disoriented lady whose life was disrupted once by the death of husband and then by the death of her town. She spends her time roaming between short seasonal jobs while living in her van and hanging out with her fellow nomads."
NOMADLAND,19 February 2021,5/10,Not sure what's special about this besides the fact it's a struggle to be homeless living in a van.
NOMADLAND,22 February 2021,2/10,"While Frances McDormand is always great to watch she just couldn't save this movie. The storyline is exceedingly thin and nothing else makes up for it. I wish there were as many meaningful scenes of plot and character development as there were long drawn out shots of her walking aimlessly through the trailer park. Everything in this movie disappointed except for the cinematography. So many other movies dealt with the subject of the film better.....whether it be nomadlife, poverty, soul-searching etc. More than anything else this film is just unenjoyable. Period. The end!"
NOMADLAND,14 May 2021,1/10,Top 5 most boring films ever watched. The Oscar award was obviously fixed due to political reasons.
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,6/10,"1.van life is a choice, not always about income. So my statement has nothing to do with it.
But...
2. It seems to me, that although she is working, she is not making a lot due to her skill set / jobs available to her. But a huge piece the writer forgot is that her husband was working his whole life in sheet rock mine / as a manager, he made a living wage. As the widow she would get his social security benefits. This added money would not make her solidly in the middle class but it is big difference in lifestyle. Lazy writing is extremely annoying."
NOMADLAND,27 February 2021,1/10,"If ""Nomadland"" set out to create a bleak depiction of the stark reality of life on the road, it succeeded. The daily-life depictions of driving, eating, defecating, working odd jobs was a reminder of our own daily lives and the aspects of life we might wish to leave behind. Most of us are not Nomads, and if we were, I fail to see the appeal of such a life.Within the context of the film, there was little revealed about what motivates Fern to lead a nomadic life aside of loss (which we all experience) and just from a plot perspective her character could have chosen a more comfortable life with Dave. So, apart from perhaps wanting to escape her own life, this film plods along at an excruciating slow speed without apparent rhyme or reason."
NOMADLAND,6 March 2021,6/10,"This film is consist of documentary film + fragmented narrative + scenery tour, the camera seems to be taking us to travel with Fern to feel her feelings, but this experience is self-defeating in the character setting (old man living alone and widowed), and the director has too much to express the elderly's emotion, on the contrary, will make the audience resist, and the overall perception is far inferior to that of ""The Knight."""
NOMADLAND,15 March 2021,1/10,"Movies have characters, movies have beginning, middles, and ends. Movies have CONFLICT, sometimes A LOT of conflict. Problems to solve... What exactly is this? The new standard for being ""different""? This is a collection of interview-style vignettes -- parts of a greater nothing whole. So, what exactly is this other than the industry's attempt to give credence to female minority filmmakers?"
NOMADLAND,4 April 2021,8/10,"Nomadland is like a post-modern Frontier Western. It's all about loss, and the related deep life experiences (like a requiem). It fares on the boundary of a documentary, but with the astounding act of Frances McDormand as Fern.It is also an overture to a new mode of living, as a modern nomad, without belonging."
NOMADLAND,20 March 2021,2/10,"I get that this is an important story to tell but I was bored out of my mind. This thing is so overhyped, I don't know how it's getting the recognition it is. Overall, I see why it was made and what they were trying to accomplish but the only thing it did for me was give me an Ambien break because after 40 minutes I was sleeping like a baby."
NOMADLAND,24 March 2021,3/10,"Yes. The sights, the music, the shots, Frances--all wonderful. But a movie about a woman who we know nothing about, how she wallows in her own created and propagated pity party is pitiful. plain and pointless. I found this movie to be ageist and shallow. (And I'm young)."
NOMADLAND,24 March 2021,1/10,Worst movie I've ever seen.. The Room is Oscar worthy to this s***!
NOMADLAND,1 April 2021,9/10,"Grieves and losses are always there with your existence and become a part of your body, whatever you do and wherever you go, they're always there and haunt you and it's OK. Just keep in your mind "" we will see each other down the road where there are no losses and grieves'."
NOMADLAND,2 April 2021,1/10,"Nothing happens in this movie. A lady goes around and is depressed. That's it. There is no conflict or continuous plot. Despite what some reviewers have posted here, I have traveled and experienced many things. This film was still boring as $hit. I cannot understand how anyone liked it."
NOMADLAND,13 April 2021,1/10,"I usually enjoy wanderlust movies. So I had expectations for this one. What a waste! No one in this movie has a character. I watched ""My Octopus Teacher""- a documentary, around the same time I watched Nomadland. Even a real octopus (an invertebrate, a Mollusk) had a character, and was touching at every level. But Nomadlad, a movie (not a documentary), couldn't connect or reach most of the audience. It didn't evoke any emotions, except disappointments."
NOMADLAND,21 April 2021,2/10,"Despite being a huge fan of the lead actress, I found this movie to be as interesting as watching paint dry.I know it's politically incorrect and old-fashioned to prefer movies that have a plot (or at least thesis-antithesis that has worked since ancient Greece), but I didn't find quasi-documentary scenes of someone working at an Amazon fulfillment center very enlightening."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,2/10,I'm happy at the background of it's production and all but as a watchable film I think it missed the mark.
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,1/10,This movie is so boring. I want fell asleep watching this trash. They call this are. Give me a break. So overrated. This movie is an insult to American film industry.
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,4/10,"I can understand why some people like this movie. But for the average person it's a boring, pointless movie without a story. We couldn't finish it."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,2/10,"Summary, woman gets a van that she lives in, she works at Amazon, she gets cold, she goes south, she potentially finds love, she leaves love to go live in her van up north. There were no high points, the message was obvious, and the acting is overdone at times.2/10 - not giving a one based on the amazing videography throughout the movie and the director did make me feel like I was watching someone's true life. Too bad the life I was watching was a huge bore."
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,,"What ever happened to the black lady ""Deni"" in the movie!? Its not often we see black ppl do things like this."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,9/10,"This was a film about humanity from the viewpoint of people who live their lives on the road, mobile from one place, between seasonal and temporary jobs, relying on the goodwill of others and each other. It shows a tough existence, which may not be a lifestyle choice for people down on their luck or suffering ill health or mental health problems, grief and other stresses that lead to this path. But maybe after some time, it becomes a way of life that does become a choice.It isn't a documentary, although it features genuine nomadic people acting in the film portrayal of their lives.It isn't Die Hard, so it isn't action packed. But it isn't boring or a waste of time either."
NOMADLAND,30 April 2021,1/10,Well filmed and great acting. But what is the point of the storyline? There seemed to be no beginning or ending and a very slow long middle. She was clearly very lonely and miserable and continued to put herself in that position despite being given lots of opportunities to change her life around. No idea why she kept on going. Very depressing.
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,2/10,"Don't waste your time. The film begins... goes nowhere, nothing happens and it ends."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,1/10,Imagine all the money invested in producing and viewing this wonderful story.. Imagine that money being spent to help these people instead of using them for entertainment!America is sick and dying and I only hope she passes peacefully in the night.
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,10/10,A couple of actors and a cast of real people. Breathtaking.
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,10/10,"Nomadland is closer to a moving painting than a stage play on screen. The acting and directing all focus on creating a loose, free form emotional portrait of the subjects and their lives rather than creating tension and drama using a traditional narrative, which is fine for many people, but for those looking for the value crated through narrative will be sorely disappointed. A lot of great movies use this stylistic choice; Inside Llewellyn Davis, The Revenant, and A Serious Man all forgo a traditional plot and use the techniques of film to immerse us into the character's lives. Also like Nomandland, a lot of people didn't like those films."
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,8/10,Nomadland is a reflective and thoughtful movie on loneliness and moving on from major life changes with the stunning landscape of the American West providing the perfect backdrop. The story moves slowly but surely and deserves the Oscar it got for Best Picture in 2021.Read more reviews on thebingewatcher(dot)in.
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,2/10,"I know, we are supposed to bend a knee at the altar of the intellectual elitism explaining to us the real meaning of life as an art form, but give me a break! A fourth grade failing English student could surpass the idiotic philosophical dribble that tries to paint life on the road, by people who have never experienced the true life on the road. It is not romantic, enjoyable and hardly bearable to find yourself with no life, no family and no community at the end of a long life. This movie is tantamount to person with a Beverly Hills sunburn trying to depict life after suffering life threatening third degree burns in a devastating fire. Yes Hollywood sanctimoniously has paid tribute to the women in film; directing, editing, producing and starring. God Bless their collective guilt but do not drag my limited leisure time into the mix. I want to enjoy what I watch and escape from reality, not in their inability to understand the true reality, but an actual fantastical good feeling escape into the wonderland of Avatar or Shawshank Redemption. Save your tripe and tortured belief in women for your own self flagellation in the privacy of the Beverly Hills elite artistic gatherings in the self appointed guardians of our need to accept things that are above our ability to understand as golden and Oscar worthy; they are not! You see the reason I watch is to justify the expense of your rich gold gilded little nests and actually enjoy myself, before I head out to the real suffering that nomadland will truly inflict upon me."
NOMADLAND,11 May 2021,5/10,"I felt confused after watching this film. I did not understand the underlying purpose of telling the story or filming it. Was it a straightforward depiction of life on the road? No. It was too sentimental for that. Was it commentary on the unfairness of our society between the haves and have nots? No, because it really had very few ""haves"" in it and those who did have plenty were depicted in a purely positive light. It may have made me more aware of the lives of people who have had to resort to living in vans, and I appreciate that. However, I have been to those places in the movie, and there is more to them than the story tells."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,7/10,"I was not looking forward to watching this movie because I feared it would lack content and wouldn't be engaging. Unfortunately, I was incorrect on the first count and almost correct on the second. Just because a movie wins awards does not mean that it is a movie for all audiences.Nomadland (McDormand, 2020) tells of Fern, a widow who resided in Empire, Nevada, with her husband Bo, who worked at the Gypsum mine there before he died. When the mine closed, the company closed the town too, and by the time we meet Fern, the life she once knew is gone. We find her working at Amazon during the busy season that starts in July every year, and we follow her and her compatriots from job to job and campsite to campsite as they live a sparse existence in their vans or their campers. The term ""workampers"" is used to describe them as a group. The scenes in the varying workplaces that Fern migrates to were fascinating and lent a true-to-life feel to the movie.Fern's relationship with Swankie, played by Charlene Swankie, was one of mentorship. Swankie and Linda (Linda May) showed Fern the ins and outs of the nomad lifestyle. Watching the seminars given by Bob Wills at various stops along the work-migration route taught everyone how to be self-sufficient while building a bond within the group that was not unlike family.While watching the evolution of Fern's relationship with Dave, I was rooting for them to become a couple and live happily ever after, and I think Dave felt that as well. The chemistry between Frances McDormand's ""Fern"" and Dave Strathairn's ""Dave"" was palpable, but the viewer could feel Fern pulling back every time Dave tried to get close to her. It was like she was running from loss and doing her best never to experience it again.Frances McDormand does a great job as Fern, and I feel that she meshes well with the real-life characters in the movie. I found the use of actual nomads as actors made me appreciate the content more, as we as engendering empathy for the cast, and not just the characters. The movie was shot very much like a documentary with natural lighting throughout. The editing was sometimes very jumpy; there were very few match cuts used for transition, which was faithful to the documentary feel that the movie appeared to be striving to achieve.I was reminded of the Blair Witch Project (Myrick & Sanchez, 1999) many times while watching this film, especially when considering the marketing used during its initial run. Fortunately, the limited release in September of 2020 placed it just under the wire for awards consideration in the 2021 season. As a result, it garnered several awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Chloe' Zhao, and Best Actress for Frances McDormand. The film is a worthy watch, but it does drag at times, and it took effort for me to watch all the way through, but in the end, I was glad I did even though I didn't feel that the movie resolved much of the plot points past people dying, and relationships ending. It was in no way a ""happily ever after story,"" but then the crash of 2008 wasn't either."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,2/10,"I have no idea what the critics were smoking when they reviewed this film. I've honestly never been so bored in all my life. NOTHING HAPPENS!The cinematography is great but when there is NO plot what is the point.Don't waste your time with this film unless you enjoy watching paint dry or you're looking for something to send you to sleep in which case, this film is perfect.I'm off to bed now, night night. I don't think the movie is finished yet but I doubt I'll miss much."
NOMADLAND,16 June 2021,10/10,"Beyond any symbolic interpretation, ""Nomadland"" is a deeply human film.It is the story of Fern (Frances McDormand), a 21st century nomad, who, after leaving her family at a young age, has to find her place in the world after the death of her husband, Bo. But, nowadays, being part of the world does not necessarily mean having a house and being tied to a certain place (relevant are, in this sense, Morrissey's lyrics, invoked in the film: ""Home, is it just a word? / Or is it something you carry within you?"").As such, what is most impressing about this film is the way Fern relates to herself and to the world. And if all people have (or think they have) such great ambitions and want to achieve something to actually be proud of, the masterfully directed film by Chlo√© Zhao implies that it's okay to go through moments when you just don't know what should or could be your next step.The first thing to notice is the oppressive, somewhat suffocating atmosphere, which is given by a loneliness in (and out) of the crowd. It could be said, therefore, that the film resumes the romantic theme of human's confrontation with nature, in a more or less absurd time, as here, cyclically. And, somewhere, at some point, this series of life (as it appears in the Epicureans and in Indian mysticism) could still break, towards a worldly liberation, even before the relentless death.And the spectacle of nature, the only one that remains truly spontaneous in a world of planning, often illusory, is discovered as pure and in accordance with the melancholy of the protagonist (perhaps the strongest sequence in the film is that one of the New Year). Therefore, all the elements of nature are captured marvelously: the desert which is both fascinating and dreaded, the huge sequoia forests with the lonely bison, the crystalline mountain river and the sea with rough waves and, last but not least, the sky unleashed to infinity, a sky that's always changing, oscillating between the silence of a summer twilight and an unstoppable storm (images reminiscent of Turner's paintings). After all, the film offers nothing more than a great picture that leaves you breathless of what, in essence, is life itself.As for the soundtrack, I think that the choice of Ludovico Einaudi's compositions (""Oltremare"", ""Petricor"" and ""Low Mist"") brings even more charm to this surprising and sensitive film.Moreover, ""Nomadland"" is a film about those thinks that are truly important in life. Precisely, no matter how much some objects meant to you, such as a coat made by your mother or a set of plates received from your father when graduating high school, you have to learn to let them go. In other words, it's not the objects that should be valued, but people and their souls.One last remark is necessary: Fern meets several people on her journey, each valuable for her evolution - Swankie (Charlene Swankie), Dave (David Strathairn), Linda (Linda May) and Bob (Bob Wells). She remains a lonely woman among people, but she understands that she has to make one last journey before embarking on the road without a beginning and without an end: ""I maybe spent to much of my life just remembering"".It is time, therefore, for a new life."
NOMADLAND,23 May 2021,3/10,This is a film about life. Its real. Every day existence. Its boring. I stuck with it. But its two hours I've lost.
NOMADLAND,28 July 2021,4/10,"I really like Frances McDormand and was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I didn't like it much.Although I believe the abrupt cutting of scenes were to reflect her inability to attach to other people after her husband died - and visually mimic her reluctance to enjoy herself - sort of her ""remembering"" not to have a good time for too long - it, combined with the swift and shallow interactions with other characters, resulted in a story detaching the audience.Also - nothing really happened in terms of a ""story"" as such, which makes sense when reflecting her lifestyle - but that doesn't mean it has to be a film about it.Would she really say now to a new relationship with someone she obviously like after being forced into the nomad lifestyle? I don't think so.Bottom line, I don't think this is an accurate picture of US nomad life, neither of those who want it or those who are forced. But - I don't really know this."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,3/10,"This movie should come with the disclaimer that once you watch the whole thing , nothing will have changed or improved and the main character will learn nothing and continue to be alone on purpose even though there are people who love her .in a world where there is already so much sorrow , why make a movie so people can watch more of it as ""entertainment "" Pointless , I wish I could get the time back that I wasted watching it . I would hashtag this with sad, depressing, desolate meandering, worst ending ever."
NOMADLAND,25 June 2021,,"This movie presents a good philosophy of a 60 year old person. If you are 20 or 40 it might not make sense, but that is what this movie is about. You can see this soon."
NOMADLAND,20 February 2021,6/10,"It's just boring. Nothing really happens. Why did they make a movie out of this? I'll never see this film again. I thought I might feel like traveling after watching this. Not even a little bit. Also; not one attractive person was cast for this movie. It does not matter, I know. But it's like beautiful people were not allowed on set. I dare you to find one beautiful person."
NOMADLAND,3 July 2021,10/10,Marvelously directed and acted. Still waters run deep. Instantly one of my favorites!
NOMADLAND,22 August 2021,8/10,"If you disliked the movie, felt lost or bored or didn't understand the point, read the book. Jessica Bruder's deep dive into this nomadic community and all their personal stories leading up to this lifestyle, as well as her research on the conditions that led to it, will provide a lot more context about why you should care. And you'll be as pleased as I was that Linda May, Bob Wells, and Swankie were recruited to play themselves!If you loved this movie, as I did, but haven't read the book, please do. You don't have the whole picture. Chloe Zhao made a beautiful film and did an amazing job of making a human connection here, but she had to pick a lane. There are a lot of greater implications adressed in Jessica Bruder's documentary work, that deserve your attention, if you came to care about the characters you met."
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,9/10,"On a personal level this movie hit me at a point in my life where I got a 60 day notice from my landlord in a place where it is very hard to find good housing. Now, I am privileged and will likely find some accommodation, but the circumstances have made me feel the spectre of housing insecurity in a way I have been lucky to avoid thus far.For me, this movie is about two things. And many reviews here seem to think they contradict, but I simply think they run in parallel:1) Fern, who like many people in the US have suffered extreme economic and personal loss due to the rapidly changing economy. People who once relied on ""stable"" jobs and communities that sprung up around large companies. They worked hard, they did the right thing, and yet, one day their livelihood is gone and with that comes despair. Suddenly their once stable life, falls apart and it doesn't take much: the death of a spouse, drugs, inability to find new steady employment and they find themselves without a home.This touched my profoundly as it is an ever growing part of the American experience. You do what you're supposed to do and one day you find it didn't matter. All that sweat you put into your work and now you are left with nothing and no new marketable skills and just jump from one low wage job until the next.2) The nomad lifestyle. I see comments about how her experience isn't like ""true"" nomads or how it glamorized the lifestyle. I personally did not see that. I saw a mix of people; those who chose to adopt that lifestyle, and those who found themselves with no other choice.And yet, what they all have found is a community. They support each other, take care of each other. They commune with nature, they fit in the margins of a capitalistic society.Fern lost everything, she did not chose the nomad lifestyle, but in many ways it chose her. There are moments of beauty and moments of struggle. There's so much I could say, but this movie touched me deeply on many levels as it captured both beauty and pain so quietly."
NOMADLAND,2 May 2021,5/10,The most depressing movie I've watched in years!Maybe it's to close to home?If that's the best acting performance for a female in 20/2021..I'm definitely in no hurry to watch the other nominees.
NOMADLAND,29 April 2021,5/10,"The film has a point or two about life and what many of us go through.But it's really not well done. Yeah the acting is okey but oh man is it slow, boring and full of cliches.Into the wild is a much much better film about life and freedom."
NOMADLAND,4 June 2021,1/10,"Depressive, full of hopelessness and boring movie
Simply don't recommend it for watching."
NOMADLAND,6 April 2021,9/10,"Due to the economic downturn, Fern is chosen/being force to live in a van as a nomad. It's a meditative experience: The reflective music, the stunning cinematography of the nature and the story itself which is about questioning what is the ""right"" way to live (as if there is such a thing). We all need the time to sit down, watch this movie and think about our own lives."
NOMADLAND,8 May 2021,1/10,"I can't even be bothered to write anything, this film was so dull."
NOMADLAND,17 March 2021,3/10,"Many times films are painting the common life in an interesting way , but sometimes they can be banal and boring. This film is not for the majority. It is made for just a few. Fewer are the ones that actually enjoyed it, with the others just affirming they like it as to be in trend. If it just looks like a masterpiece, it doesn't actually make it one. This kind of movie it will not be remember by anyone."
NOMADLAND,9 April 2021,8/10,"A poetic exploration of grief and loneliness in a harsh and arid landscape that raises several questions about what it means to be at home and to be homeless. Are we really at home if the confines of four walls don't really help us grow as humans and are we really homeless if we choose to give up the safety of having a roof over our head and make a life out there in the desert? Issues like social security in a capitalist world and the intangible value of attachment have been expertly dealt with in this poignant work by Chlo√© Zhao. The film also brings to light the comforting capacity of community to support each other through the unforgiving winters in an industrial world that plague one's soul. It documents the resilience of a grieving person to rediscover one's purpose and hang on, no matter how hard the emotional and physical challenges be, in the spiritual hope of reuniting with the dear departed somewhere 'down the road'. It beautifully portrays the days in an ageing person's life leading to the long hard ride into the sunset and shows us how to embrace that ride, how to find sense and solace in this journey called life which everyone, ultimately, must undertake alone. As Jeet Thayil once said, 'There are no consolations of age.' Fern's days on the road, navigating the barren landscape that she inhabits is metaphorical of the very journey of life itself. Nomadland is an ode to the nomads and gypsies of the world for whom, home is a place away from home, somewhere on the road, out in the desert, closer to constellations and cosmic dust.-Bhaskar Bhagyawardhan."
NOMADLAND,15 August 2021,5/10,"Thanks to this movie I know how I get stuff from Amazon. I think some parts were taken from the movie Into the Wild, then rer-ecorded in foggy, rainy time, with old people put together with emotional but sad music and no ending. Probably would've been enjoying more if I hadn't seen better."
NOMADLAND,24 April 2021,4/10,"The movie goes incredibly slow. Frivolous dialogues, unsuccessful events, and scenes jumping from place to place ... In fact, even 4 points more to this film, I like main road movies and the leading actor has done a successful job. Totally disappointing as a movie. If you want to see acting and successful director, watch The Father. You can find the quality there."
NOMADLAND,5 May 2021,10/10,"Nomadland tells a story of a middle aged woman Fern (Frances McDormand) who was forced into a nomad's life travelling America in a van. As she meets other nomads (played by real life nomads) and experiences a Nomad's lifestyle herself, she soon faces the decision of her life.Masterfully directed by Chloe Zhao, the movie takes us with Fern on a journey of self-discovery and introspection on the backdrop of beautifully shot rural American landscapes. With intimate dialogues and acting, it tells a story very simple yet emotionally raw. It explores the primal connections we have with other humans and with nature itself.I believe everyone will find some resonance with the movie regardless our background. No matter if rich, poor, young or old, at sometime in life, we all need to ask ourselves: What do I REALLY want to do with my life ? This movie will make you contemplate long after credits roll."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,1/10,"I wonder if the people from the academy who gave an Oscar to this movie watched the same movie I did. I mean really, is totally unfair with the other movies with people who really tried and work hard to make a great movie, and then they have to watch how a movie about nothing wins the prize. What a shame!"
NOMADLAND,28 March 2021,10/10,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It talks about so many themes. The life of those that lost their job and struggle to survive. The vandwelling community. The ruthlessness of the world we have built. It also shows us the personal struggles of the protagonist and her state of mind. When I see this people, I cannot avoid feeling a bit of pity for them. But this film makes me reconsider my feelings. This people survive and thrive. The film shows us aspects of reality that we don't know, or that we know but we have become habituated to. And it does so marvelously, with a sense of poetry that appears in its photography and in its music. It shows us the humane in people. And that's a great thing in a film."
NOMADLAND,17 July 2021,5/10,Director was better off making a documentary with real life characters.
NOMADLAND,15 January 2021,9/10,"I find this movie by happening...An ode for solitude, loneliness and a hard to describe interior call for restlessness. A sad movie about the impossibility of finding he will to continue in the real world...
A touching message of quitting to comfort zone in favour of freedom
Recommend !!!"
NOMADLAND,6 May 2021,10/10,"How some reviews can say nothing happens in this film I cannot understand. So much happens. The lives, stories, landscapes, emotions.. I loved it. And the score is incredible. Hope you enjoy it as much as me."
NOMADLAND,7 June 2021,5/10,What a disappointment. I really enjoyed the book and was actually optimistic for those who chose to or were forced to become nomads. I loved Linda Mays plan to build an earthship and thought the movie would include the author's visit to the land she bought to build it on. Instead that was left out and several other stories added which made the story depressing. I also was surprised that working in the beet factory was not a part of the movie so that the experience could be visualized. If I were the book's author I would have been angry with how the movie so poorly portrayed her story.
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,3/10,"If you like movies with gripping stories that move along faster than paint drying, there is nothing for you here.While the acting is excellent and the filming picturesque it really doesn't stop you from falling asleep.Here the director has captured the essence of being alone on the road, basically long, tedious, lonely and ultimately boring."
NOMADLAND,11 April 2021,8/10,"While at first I felt sorry for Fern, as the movie progressed I began to see the choices she made were choices. Although many of her circumstances were beyond her control, she made the bear of them and found a way of life that worked for her. I'm sure many of the dangers and hardships were glossed over, but she seemed to be able to work when she wanted and warm enough to live how she wanted to live. Freedom and wide open spaces were mainly what she needed."
NOMADLAND,27 April 2021,9/10,"That's one of the reasons why we have films, is to experience what you wanna be on a certain world .. all of us want to be nomad with its fairy joy.. but here we did live an honest journey of what is to be nomad.. it is hard it is full of pain but never forgot its joy ."
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,10/10,"A really grand movie - the humans, the countryside, the music. Just lost my husband of 50 years - can appreciate the circumstance of being alone. The countryside has a life and a story of its own, plus, for me, so many beautiful memories of this beautiful country of ours - big, strong, eternal, with all of us little humans running around pretending to be important.
The music is unique and beautiful and very a propos
WELL DONE"
NOMADLAND,2 February 2021,2/10,This was very well done and the acting was very real. I felt very bad for the people of this town who had to relocate and for this character. I appreciated how she chose to continue this lifestyle even at the end because that is what she wanted. I appreciated a story about this kind of a character.(s) I have been extremely poor before for a decade and really related to many many things in this movie. So for me it made me depressed because it reminded me of all of those years when I struggled in poverty and had to find creative ways to live and pay for things and spent numerous New Years like that. I lived in that struggle but for me it wasn't a choice and it wasn't fun.
NOMADLAND,10 June 2021,5/10,I started to watch this movie with high hopes as it got many nominations and wins at the oscars-maybe that was the problem why it disappointed me at the first place. We followed a nomad woman who seemed to experiecence only cold in such poor conditions. We didnt get the hear the thought process on many things she has done such as leaving daves house. Still many great shoots and thanks to sad classical music we emphatized some emotions about what is going on.
NOMADLAND,25 March 2021,9/10,Well crafted in all aspects. My only complaint is a little overuse of non-actors in crucial scenes.
NOMADLAND,27 March 2021,3/10,Very boring.I don't recomand this movie to anyone.
NOMADLAND,28 February 2021,10/10,This is by far one of the best movies out this season. Francis McDormand embodies this character in a way I have not seen since 3 Billboards. The childlike moments in the beautiful west are stunningly gorgeous
NOMADLAND,31 January 2021,4/10,"I missed depth in the maincharacter.
I would have like a story line, there is none in this film."
NOMADLAND,7 November 2021,10/10,"This is a great movie, It's not a commercial one although it contains an oscar winner star.It is far different from new movies that depends on visual effects and graphics.This movie will change your mind about stuff."
NOMADLAND,15 April 2021,9/10,"Like Honeyland, Nomadland is pure magic, a masterpiece that draws you in, disassembles you into atoms, reassembles and throws out of the cinema changed, you are exiting like in a balloon, like in another dimension, eager to create ... Screenwriter, director and editor, Chinese Chloe Zhao created a world centered on Fern, a completely ordinary lower-middle-class woman who lost her job and habitat in a storm of market conditions in the completely ruined town of Empire in Nevada. Before that loss, Fern was left without a husband, she had no children, so all she had left in her life was a van. And a journey, an odyssey to the American prairie, a wilderness where he meets nomads, civilization scum, travelers, film naturalists, originals who bring themselves to life in the film. Fern (a possible derivative of the name of the main actress Frances McDormand) is a complex character, a woman who struggles with fears, losses and disappointments, forced to hard work in harsh environments, but a person who easily establishes relationships with characters she meets regardless of their origin, age or worldview. Empathy is the key emotion of this film, empathy framed by the fantastic camera of Joshua James Richard who equally powerfully portrayed the beauty of American landscapes but also the personalities of the marginal antiheroes that Fern encounters. Empathy masterfully strengthened by the music of Ludovic Einaudi."
NOMADLAND,20 June 2021,5/10,"The instrumental score is inspirational (Ludovico Einaudi), the photography, the performance of the artists in the main roles, the fact that it discovers an aspect of life that I did not know. For me it does it in a very slow way and alien to the inner world of the characters."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,5/10,Dramatic in a very boring way not good at all as a story. But no one can deny the art work of filming.
NOMADLAND,11 September 2021,6/10,"I cant understand the hype and the oscar nominations. Slow movie,boring. Good photography ,But i want watch a movie."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,6/10,"If you think Nomadland is a great movie you fit into one of two categories:1. You're either easily emotionally manipulated (i.e., you cry during hallmark movies), or
2. While you know New York (or fill in the blank here with your city> does not comprise the entirety of humanity, you need a reminder every once in a while that there's a whole world out there with different people and (what? really?) nature (gasp!).Emotional manipulation is easy - sprinkle in great cinematography, an excellent score, (you can probably stop there for most of us), but also throw in poetry, sprinkle in a few poignant stories from real people with close-ups of the always stoic Frances McDormand reacting to those real stories - shake, and voila! The producers and director of this movie-mentory, or docu-movie, or whatever, went to great lengths to make sure we knew most of the actors in this movie are not actors at all, but real people to get the greatest impact from their mostly sad vignettes. I'm glad they decided to not bite off anything controversial - glossing over the long shifts of an Amazon worker, and only very briefly showing the hard labor of a beet harvester (insert clip of Francis struggling to lift a bag of beets here) - but in a film of this type, where most of the heavy lifting is done by real actors, doesn't there either need to be some story arc or at least a small lesson? What they did beautifully is present the juxtapositioning of relationships and nature. Linda or Patty (sorry, they kind of run together for me now) gives a very heartfelt dialog about going to Alaska again to swim with the sharks (or something) before she dies and I'm thinking - OK, now we are going to get to the meat of this thing. Is she going to leave her friends and the relationships she's built to die alone in Alaska? But what I realized is - there really wasn't much in the way of relationships (at least shown in the film) for her to leave. Every time the camera dolly would follow Francis through the camp, we didn't see much human interaction. Sure, men would sit with pets on their laps, or someone would play the guitar, or people would sit staring into a fire, but nothing very meaningful from a humanity standpoint was going on. I would go to Alaska too! And this is where the film let us down. There's a sliver of a chance for great art here - a Wineburg, Ohio (Sherwood Anderson) opportunity to show the loneliness of people - a chance to cut the film to help us appreciate the family and friendships we have. I'm not saying that Francis had to end up staying with Dave at the end, but make us feel the emotional toll of that decision. Instead, they decided not to make any statements at all - to, I suppose, let the film ""speak for itself"". The problem is it does not."
NOMADLAND,9 July 2021,1/10,After 10 minutes I could not wait for this movie to end and I simply persevered with a little candle of hope it might get better. It didn't.
NOMADLAND,13 February 2021,9/10,"Frances mcdormand is excellent and she's backed up by a cast who I felt a connection too and wanted to know more about each one, a must watch, it won't be everyone's cup of tea but a great start to 2021 with an award winning performance from the lead actor, nice change from all the brain dead movies getting churned out and reality TV garbage that's aired day after day."
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,4/10,"Frances is an amazing actress to say the least and she delivers once again, no question about it, but the movie itself has nothing to grab it's audience by. It obviously shows the struggles of character's nomad life here and there but they are so weak. There is hardly anything at stake, I felt nothing to say the least. Same goes with the sob stories of people she meets along the way.Actually that is all there is to it, she goes along talking to people listening about their lives while the melancholic melodies in the background tries desperately to dig out some/any emotions out of me. One thing I would still say is that I liked the ending because it sits right with the character and makes me like her more. Avoiding spoilers, this is the best I can describe this movie. It has its beauty in some scenes, but overall, for me, it is a very ordinary movie which is massively overrated!"
NOMADLAND,15 January 2021,10/10,"This movie is dedicated for all who lost loved once.
See you down the road dad, I miss you."
NOMADLAND,24 February 2021,10/10,As someone who lived off the grid for a year in a half in the West I can say this is so well done. I had enough adventures to live a lifetime. I love Arizona the most and the scenes from the desert brought tears to my eyes. The directing is outstanding as well as the videography. David Strathairn is excellent as is Frances McDormand. A must watch if you want an idea of what living off the grid is like.
NOMADLAND,3 December 2021,1/10,"Let me write the only positive point first;
Getting familiar with a lifestyle in American culture and nothing more!It was more documentary rather than being a real movie."
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,8/10,"This movie teach us how to living, enjoy without family, home and money. Life is very simple and beautiful, so we must have enjoy this life.All character play very good role. Specially Frances McDormand do her best job. As a leading role she deserve it.AS a director Chlo√© Zhao do her best effort in this movie. She gives this movie 100% perfection.Cinematography is very strong. All places is very beautiful.Story is very realistic. This movie show me how the living, struggling, working. But they enjoy their life. They celebrate every moment, every place. They are alone but everybody looks like family. They help each other.This is Best Motion Picture of the Year. I like this movie, this is one of the best movie I ever seen."
NOMADLAND,29 May 2021,1/10,"And for everyone who thought this film is worth watching.The lady in the film doesn't have it easy, but the film itself is poor. The acting is poor, there is no story, there is no conflict, there is no character development, there are no twists, there is no drama, there is basically no point at the end of it. I didn't feel a single tingle of emotions in the theatre. It is just a woman living in a camper. That's it, that's the film.There are thousands, tens of thousands of better films out there."
NOMADLAND,9 October 2021,7/10,"It's definitely a slow burner. Very authentic but I have to say it didn't grip me emotionally. Interesting observation of a particular type of lifestyle, and they clearly made a conscious decision not to have any plot contrivances, which was welcome. The flip side of that is that there wasn't much plot. More a meditation on life, from a particular perspective. In that regard I don't think it added much dramatically to what could have been achieved through a documentary.I recognise I'll be in the minority with this view as it won loads of Oscars and is pretty much universally acclaimed."
NOMADLAND,4 June 2021,1/10,Catastrophically boring movie about nothing. Total waste of time. 1/10 is too high of a score for it. Just avoid.
NOMADLAND,12 June 2021,1/10,"Felt like a Borat movie, with Borat as a quiet Oscar-winning actress in disguise, listening to people harp on."
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,5/10,"During the movie, at the end of it, even the next morning, I was trying to answer the following question: what is this movie about? I don't know the book or the true story behind the closing of this American factory. I will admit, like many others I'm sure, the idea of seeing Frances McDormand's acting was extremely attractive (I admire her artistic skills). I do not know how much of it played into the marketing of the film (after all, McDormand is one of the producers). Then I jumped up to the next Oscar's ceremony, imagining Frances receiving the Oscar for actress on a leading role, the speech about how bad things have gotten, all the millionaire stars breaking in applause, some in tears, ""yeah, it's pretty horrible, look at the pandemic"", etc., and ""by the way, cocktails at the Ritz after the ceremony"". Now back to my question: well, the question generated more questions. Is it a movie about white privilege loosing the American dream? If indeed it is (99% of the actors are white; there's one black that speaks; and not a single ""Latinx"" even at the potato farm???), then there's a sense of ""look what they've done to us!"", which leads to the ""poor me"" syndrome. I wondered what a black person would think about the movie. There's definitively an interested juxtaposition of of the American factory of yore, and the new ""factory"": packing away goods, 99% of them made not-in-America, working like rats (but in a clean environment!). I would've liked seeing instead one of the two main supporting actresses as the leading role (both excellent performances). Frances was distracting me, wearing again the blue-collar garment, almost straight out of ""Three billboards..."". It's a tricky movie: first I loved it, and slowly started weighing on me. Nicely shot, although: empty highways, no cars anywhere, really? I think the movie forces the subject into the viewer, I found it a bit overdone. McDormand may get some slack, but she's not dummy, she must've known."
NOMADLAND,9 May 2021,8/10,"Cinematography at its best, showcasing one woman's journey of discovery contrasting the hope and strength of the people, the beauty of nature and the American landscape with the harshness of getting by when the American dream fades."
NOMADLAND,13 September 2020,8/10,"This is cinematic patience, a bare and beautifully drawn out experience that paces and feels exactly like the lives and experiences it portrays. The landscapes are stunning, the camerawork intimate and always thoughtful with its choices. The movie makes subtle, deliberate gestures, and it all culminates into something really special. Movies so plot-thin always must walk the careful border of disinterest - but honestly I could've watched another hour of this stuff and never get bored. It's hypnotizing in its own unique way, and I haven't really seen anything quite like it. (This is the vibe I wish Sean Penn's Into the Wild could've captured).8.5/10"
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,9/10,"I found the movie extremely well taken to share the life of a Nomad. Her mundane everyday, her challenges, her experience meeting people and her grief. The movie touches you to think about life, it's meaning and it's end. Loved it!"
NOMADLAND,20 May 2021,2/10,"Well acted, lovely scenery, and some beautiful music that suits the somberness of the movie. I can see why some would rate this highly. But for me, this was a tough movie to endure. Maybe that was the point. If that's your thing, enjoy!"
NOMADLAND,28 June 2021,1/10,"This must be the worse movie of the decade, its absolute junk from start to finish. I have no idea of why people might think great. Save yourself a hour or so and go watch paint dry!"
NOMADLAND,1 May 2021,7/10,"The stagnation can be felt in like Nuri Bilge Ceylan's films, in which pastoral elements are used frequently. Her story is a journey that actually takes the inner world but looks like the outer world where daily values like a having a property are questioned. Between these two lines, looks like the scenes with feelings of friendship, kindness and helping others are depicted with bright pictures, while elements such as corporate life and loneliness in the community are depicted with dark pictures."
NOMADLAND,28 April 2021,6/10,"I have seen this movie because it has won the best movie in academy , seriously this movie is overrated, it's one time watchable slow screenplay and If you are bored you can give it a try."
NOMADLAND,7 May 2021,2/10,Don't know what I just watched. No storyline. Feels like a documentary (but not as interesting). Frances McDormand was good but most of the movie was just watching her plod around (with nice sunsets in the background). So glad I didn't see this in the cinema.
NOMADLAND,6 July 2021,2/10,"Watching Nomadland is like watching a stream of beautifully shot Instagram inspirational quotes, very loosely put together to make for a boring, meaningless and at times embarrassing movie.There's no reason for anything that happens, and therefore no effect. Even a regular documentary has more of a structure than this film, and the weak attempt at the end to create a circular return to the beginning feels like the musical equivalent of a fadeout - it's what you do when you realize the song has to end but you have no idea how to do it. And indeed that's precisely the kind of music that was written by Ludovico Einaudi for the film - a succession of pleasant chords without reason not rhyme, that awkwardly fades in and out in a desperate attempt to be 'poetic'."
NOMADLAND,25 April 2021,9/10,I think this movie does a great job shinning light on the less fortunate displaced by the recession and depression caused by the rich like the big banks especially Wells Fargo or AIG. While some may make a choice for this lifestyle this movie shares the pain of one poor woman amongst other nomads as she tries to find meaning. I appreciate the real nomad actors who shared their life and their love to be free. We need to remember everyone should be treated with respect. Thank you Swankie for entering my life and making it more full.See you down the road.
NOMADLAND,21 February 2021,9/10,"This movie was so gorgeous to look at, that it made the subject matter a little more palatable. I've worked with many people making end-of-life decisions usually done in a hospital room in the most impersonal unrelentingly septic environment you can imagine. To see Fern helping Swanky And of course swanky helping fern was simply poetic and Beautiful."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,3/10,Not much more to say than how did she win an Oscar for that?!
NOMADLAND,16 May 2021,1/10,Almost 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. This is the most pointless movie I've ever seen. I kept waiting on the good bit and then it ended.
NOMADLAND,23 August 2021,8/10,The truthfulness of the story and the way the scenario could manage to keep it lean and evade the exaggeration in storytelling did capture me. The music and the scenes were in complete consistence; especially the wide angle captures alongside piano tunes added a lot to the poetry. FM is a real talented actor I could lately discover. Performance is top level despite her limited text in this movie. Congrats.
NOMADLAND,26 February 2021,3/10,"This movie was very depressing and was kind of preachy at times. The main character wasn't likable and I didn't feel any empathy for her. Most of the supporting roles we're real life nomads and they were more authentic.The cinematography is beautiful but it doesn't make up for the movie.The first reviews out are always gushing with praise, then the rest of us see the movie and the real reviews start to come out. They did the same with Wonder Woman 1984. Everyone ranted and raved about it and it was such a letdown. Same with this movie."
NOMADLAND,10 May 2021,2/10,"Nothing happensn, nothing to see here. Tota waste of time. 2 stars because of some of the good acting."
NOMADLAND,3 May 2021,6/10,"Great images, great scenery and pictures. Unfortunately the intentional lack of plot is not compensated with emotional depth, maybe because of the insufficient time dedicated to difficulties and hopes. It seems the director and the main characters filmed while sedated."
NOMADLAND,22 May 2021,2/10,"So the writer thought what is the best way to get people's attention? Answer is to play with their emotions and not just any emotions but with some of the most effective one's, that is sarrow and sadness.Everyone has experienced losses and pain throughout their life and it's kind of normal because it happens with everyone. Better way to deal with it to just MOVE ON. But this movie in a way tells audience to stick to the past !Personally this movie effected me very negatively. A movie should be fun to watch and it must lift you to the higher state than you were before watching a movie. This movie does the opposite.Very sad to see the quality of movies these days that the movie like Nomadland is winning oscar. It did not deserve it."
NOMADLAND,15 May 2021,1/10,"A struggle to watch. No story, no plot, no excitement, no purpose. You would think a movie like this inspires you or challenges your point of view. It does not. A couple of nice shots of sunsets and a river, that is all there is to it. You are well advised to give it a miss."
