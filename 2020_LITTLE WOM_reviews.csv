LITTLE WOMEN,20 April 2020,6/10,"I read through many of the reviews for this 2019 version of ""Little Women"" and noticed that most reviewers adored the film. Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.I won't talk about the plot...after all, there's a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn't think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,9/10,"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' has long been one of my all-time favourite books and love 'Good Wives' just as much. The story is just so charming and fills me with joy and emotion every time, all the major events are memorable, the major relationships beautifully fleshed out and all the characters are interesting and well defined, as well as worth relating to. There is no wonder as to why it is so oft-adapted (and generally very well).It is such a good story and the characters are so good that it remains timeless regardless of how many it is read and how often it's adapted. The latest adaptation, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, responsible for 'Lady Bird' (one of my favourites from its year), and starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep and Laura Dern (the four biggest names), is the eighth adaptation. And along with the 1994 film with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon and the 1933 film starring Katharine Hepburn it is one of the best. Some may not be totally enamoured with it as an adaptation, as the chronology is different and there is a lot of back and forth, but on its own terms it left me and my sisters totally satisfied.Will admit to not being completely grabbed at the start, with it being the worst case of the backing and forthing from Jo's point of view not always working. On the most part this aspect does work surprisingly well, but there were times where it was confusing and not always easy to tell straight away what was the past and what was the present and that was the case with this 'Little Women'.Although the acting is outstanding nearly all-round, for me Louis Garrel was somewhat bland as Professor Bhaer. The character is not the most interesting character in 'Good Wives' in the first place, but with his role being so small here the character felt very underwritten and Garrel doesn't bring an awful lot to it.These two problems are vastly outweighed by everything else and the best of everything else is fantastic. Three things are especially good. The production values are exquisite throughout, the costumes are evocative and the settings have a cosiness and charm that reminds me fondly of the period films of films from MGM in the 40s and 50s. The darker look of the present scenes contrast beautifully with the warm looking past ones. Just in case one is wondering, that is a compliment or at least to me it is. Alexandre Desplat is one of the best film composers working today and his score fits the film and the spirit of the story perfectly, the triumphant moments exploding with sumptuous joy and the emotional ones enhanced by the sorrowful-sounding orchestration. Ronan is quite sensational as Jo, one of her best performances to date in a performance that is sensitive and spirited.Everybody else, Garrel excepted and that was to do with the limitations of the role, also excels. Have not seen Watson better than here, epitomising sympathetic charm even in her desiring of better. Florence Pugh is truly excellent as and the embodiment of older Amy which suited her more than when playing her when younger. While criticisms of her being less convincing as younger Amy where the character is more petulant and spoilt it is not easy not making younger Amy too bratty (especially in the burning of the book incident), it is not hard to see as to why this has been a breakthrough year for Pugh. Eliza Scanlan is a very moving Beth, especially later on, while Laura Dern is a sincere and loving Marmee, Timothee Chamalet is a charming Laurie and has great chemistry with all four leads (especially Ronan) and no other actor for Mr Laurence has made my heart melt more than Chris Cooper. Streep is a very amusing Aunt March.Regarding the storytelling and character writing, 'Little Women' is a near triumph. The story is heart-warming and moving, although the chronology is different and sometimes coherence is affected the spirit and a lot of the major events of 'Little Women' and 'Good Wives' are intact and with full impact. The transitions from past to present and vice versa are mostly quite seamless. Loved the interaction between the four sisters, which charmed, amused and moved in equal measure throughout, while this adaptation is the best at including and fleshing out the triangle between Jo, Laurie and Amy. Jo and Beth's chemistry was incredibly heartfelt and for me the film's big tragedy was heart-wrenching (same with my sisters and everybody in the cinema in a packed auditorium male and female and of all ages), and having Jo's strength and struggles as a writer mirroring Alcott herself was a clever move and a valid one considering Jo was a personal character for Alcott. Almost all the characters are well defined, with strengths and flaws and how they dealt with their triumphs and struggles. Gerwig directs with great confidence and the script sparkles, the charm and poignancy of the story and Alcott's text never lost or jarring.Summing up, a great film and what a way to spend New Year's Day. 9/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,25 March 2020,9/10,"It's the classic American story by Louisa May Alcott about the March sisters; Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). During the Civil War, their father is away helping the Union troops. Their mother Marmee (Laura Dern) leads the girls in doing good deeds for the community. Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence (Timothée Chalamet) is the new boy moving in with his rich grandfather. The movie opens with young adult Jo trying to sell a story in New York City. It would alternate between the adult sisters and their younger teenage selves.I have never read the book although this is the fourth adaptation, among the countless versions, that I have seen. Greta Gerwig has changed it up and in the process, has given even more depth and more life to the characters. She has added to the theme of the story. She divides the movie into about half teenage years and half young adult years. In many ways, the romance between Amy and Laurie is given more space to grow. Saoirse, Florence, and Timothée gave the movie three great performances. They are backed by solid work from the likes of Laura Dern and Emma Watson. My only problem is the furnishings in this house. It's a little too nice considering that they give away so much to the needy. Overall, this is the best adaptation of the four that I've seen."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 February 2020,,"After brilliant versions, what to expect ? Beautiful costumes, fair atmosphere, nuanced performances. And wise, in final, ignore of chronology. And all is good first for lead actors and for the gifts to young Saoirse Ronan and Timotee Chalamet and Emma Watson and Louis Garrel to give their Little Women.For us, the brilliant columns - Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep, not ignoring Laura Dern or Jayne Houdishell . So, a nice adaptation. Not great, not memorable , not the best. Only beautiful. And polite."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 January 2020,7/10,"It's beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and I understand that in order to appeal to succeeding generations, any classic must have some point that the latest kids will find telling. Nonetheless, Greta Gerwig's efforts to make this appealing to modern, Fourth Wave Feminists by having everyone from Meryl Streep as Aunt March on down go on about the subservient position of women in this era, by having Saoirse Ronan as Jo March write Little Woman, and then get into an argument with the publisher, insisting that the character remain unmarried. This destroys the ending, but of course there are more important things,The actors are excellent, particularly Laura Dern as Marmee. Chris Cooper as Mr. Lawrence does not, alas, get his fake-ogre introduction. Despite the beautiful camerawork and acting, the flash-forward-flashback structure imposed on the movie and the modernist interpretation destroys the film for me. I'll stick to the 1933 version, and perhaps revisit the book."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,6/10,"""Little Women"" is a new 2019 film that runs for over 2 hours and, fittingly with the title, this is the most recent filmmaking effort by successful actress, but now even more successful writer and director, Greta Gerwig. Still considerably younger than 40, she is slowly but steadily turning into the most lauded female filmmaker from her generation, especially if we restrict this description to Americans. She may not have succeeded a second time with gettting in for Best Director at the Oscars, bit looking at the huge success with awards bodies for ""Little Women"", I am sure she isn't too sad about that. The latter also includes a screenplay nomination for Gerwig herself and from what I have read, the film definitely has a chance to triumph and get her her first Academy Award. It's maybe between this one and ""Jojo Rabbit"" with ""Joker"" being a potential dark horse. My money would be on ""Jojo Rabbit"", but we will see what happens next weekend. As for the other nominations, this film has no chance to win Best Picture, Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress. Pugh's inclusion for the latter was a bit of a surprise already, but having watched the film now, I believe it is not undeserving at all as her turn was among the best aspects this film had to offer. I am personally happy for her too because I liked her in other projects. Desplat may be a legend by now when it comes to soundtracks, but there the chances are also fairly slim. A win for Costume Design seems more likely and again the main opposition in this category comes probably from ""Jojo Rabbit"". So much for the awards and this was really just a slight reference that does not remotely reflect all the awards this film has been nominated for (and won). So it is not a surprise by any definition that this has turned into the most known adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel by now. By far. There have been far more adaptations than you would think, but maybe it needed Gerwig's take on the subject because she is a female too to really make a major impact. Then again, I prefer the idea that she is just really talented and that is why it turned out such a success.For Gerwig, it is her second collaboration with lead actress Saoirse Ronan in a row and as both have resulted in Oscar Lead Actress nominations for the Irish-American actress, we can expect there will be more movies between these two in the future. And not just because of that. What is at least as important is the high quality obviously. I think they made some really wise decisions with the cast here. Ronan is among the very best actresses from her generation. Watson has been there for a while too, even if the really big awards attention is still missing for her. In any case, she is a gigantic crowd magnet. Florence Pugh has joined the elite too with her recent portrayals and finally Eliza Scanlen I must admit I have not been familiar with before this film, but she is okay, does not have too much to work with though, not the material to really stand out the way her co-actresses do. The girls' mother is played by Laura Dern. She has one or two occasions to shine, but other than that, her character is also mostly there to propel the girls. She can live with that as she is pretty safe for winning an Oscar this year for another supporting performance. Bob Odenkirk I was quite happy to see here as I am a big Breaking Bad fan and also like his spin-off show. Shame he is barely in this one here. Chris Cooper is a nice addition as always and plays a truly likable character. Meryl Streep is in the very first scene and has 2 or 3 more scenes later on and there is some great presence to her character, even if she is not featured too heavily. This description applies to others as well.The one male character who is really a lot in this film is played by Timothée Chalamet. I don't need to say much about his background, do I? He has been everywhere recently. His frequent inclusion here is no surprise because his character's lifestyle, but even more so his relationship with the girls, is a major aspect from beginning to end. This especially applies to his scenes with Pugh and Ronan. With the youngest sister, there is no connection and with Watson's, there is only one scene when he tells her he finds her beautiful (even if he does not like her dress). I kept wondering throughout the film if he will end up with one of the girls. His somewhat final words to Ronan's character when she rejects him stay in the mind that she will find somebody else and he will watch because this is excactly how it happens at the very end when Garrel's character returns. Even if it was maybe not too easy for Laurie (Chalamet) to witness, it was still somewhat funny how he kept asking who this man was because he saw her being attracted to him. So no dark bummer ending here. Besides, even if the protagonist (Jo/Ronan) reconsidered her decision and wanted to be with Chalamet's character despite not loving him, it was all good the way it turned out because he seemed happy with Amy in the end and she loved him since day. You can see romance is really the key aspect here. Still, this is a film that will make you laugh here and there too. The audience in my showing loved the maid's statement about Garrel's character being so handsome towards the end. And the 2 minutes of hair struggles (how she sold them, what Amy says, how she cries over her lost hair, not over her dad) were funnier than entire 90-minute full comedy films. I loved it.Of course, in addition to that, we also get a great deal of drama, even tragedy. The latter especially refers to the youngest sister and her fading health. When we find out she died, it's clearly the saddest moment of the film, especially because right before that, things seemed to have improved considerably and we also see Amy around again, who had to leave earlier for a while because they had to avoid her perhaps getting sick as well. Still, it was these events that made the sisters form an even stronger bond. Of course, there are conflicts, not only about men, but also the ones all sisters have with each other. One is sad because she is not allowed to join the others to the theater, so she burns the protagonist's writings. But she regrets her act immediately after and apologizes. Still, as a direct consequence, the protagonist does not warn her about the ice not being too thick at the center of the lake and the younger sister almost drowns there. Some truly shocking moments, even if we sort of knew what was about to happen. They hug it out immediately afterwards. Now I just mentioned the writing. This is just one area in which these girls are talented. Each of them has creative drive: One is an aspiring writer. One is a talented painter. One is a good musician. And the last one (played by Watson) may have aspired to become an actress as we only find out through one quote.Maybe it is this creative force that for me resulted in the impression that every time all four of them were together on screen, you could really feel their energy in the room. This was especially true during the scene when we have the four meet Chalamet's character for the first time. The moment when we find out about Meg's talent (Watson) is also one that is very telling about Ronan's character. She says that her sister should leave with her and try to become an actress instead of staying with her man because she cannot see why somebody would choose a relationship over passion/talent, especially a woman. She played a very progressive character in these really not emancipated times of the Civil War. At the end, the central character falls for somebody herself, so she is not entirely against the idea anymore of her fictitious(?) character marrying at the end of the book. So she is about to have a marriage with somebody she adores (Garrel) as well as have a career to be an independent woman. It is possible. I think the way they combined her talking with the publisher with her happy romance ending was very smartly executed and edited. In general, this film shows amazing attention to detail at times.Still, I cannot say this was a perfect watch. Here and there I struggled a bit with it, but then again period pieces are not exactly my number one preferred genre. There is of course no hesitation for me in giving this film a thumbs-up, but nonetheless I shall elaborate a bit on what I did not like that much. It was mostly just minor moments. For example, I wondered why Streep's character was so worried about financial aspects as she was really rich herself and probably could have provided for every family member easily if it was necessary. What I struggled a bit more with were the jumps in time. I would have preferred chronological narration altogether. When Jo was sporting her new haircut, it certainly helped a bit with seeing at what point in time we are right now, but before that it was difficult, especially because there was an unusual jump back in time (7 years) really quickly after the introduction that is really not seen too often when a film just started 20 minutes ago or so. The make-up helped a bit too in understanding which year it was at that point. Oh well, maybe it was just me who struggled to understand and it will get easier on rewatch. Nonetheless, there is no doubt for me that the good moments this film has are far more frequent than the weaker ones. So it gets a positive recommendation from me for sure. I generally do not like saying a film is more suitable for a female audience, but looking at the gender proportion in my showing and how much (judging from screams and noises) women in the crowd seemed more involved with the story (let alone, this being at its core a story about 4 girls), I think it may be somewhat true for this one here. So go watch it with your girlfriend for her birthday perhaps. She will love you even more afterward. By the way, I was really surprised how full the theater was. It deserves to be seen. Go for it."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 January 2020,10/10,"This is a classic book done with an all-star cast in an entertaining fashion. Saoirse Ronan gives us an Oscar-worthy performance as Jo March. It is a story of life for four sisters in Concord, Mass. during the Civil War with an absent father. They bring out the issues of women's struggles in social class and economics. Jo does not want to get married and doesn't know why she can't love Laurie (Timothée Chalamet). This is the extent of any lesbian hints. All the women want to be independent, but the era prevents them from achieving their primary dreams, except for Jo. I wish Margot Robbie had played Amy."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,6/10,"The original novel by Louisa May Alcott, released as two volumes in 1868 and 1869, is an enduring classic, and has produced a good number of film adaptations. There were two silent films in 1917 and 1918, was the 1933 Katharine Hepburn (first sound) version, there was the 1949 Elizabeth Taylor/Janet (first colour) version, there was the 1994 Winona Ryder/Kirsten Dunst/Claire Danes version, and there was the 2018 modern day take to celebrate the novel's 150th anniversary. With Awards Season coming up, this seventh feature film adaptation was being tipped for a few award gongs, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird). Basically, set in the nineteenth century, it sees the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters, going backwards and forwards in time. In 1868, Josephine ""Jo"" March (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Saoirse Ronan) is a teacher in New York City. She goes to an editor, Mr. Dashwood (Tracy Letts), he confirms he will publish her work, subject to considerable editing. Her sister Amy (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Florence Pugh), in Paris with their wealthy Aunt March (Meryl Streep), sees childhood friend Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence (Timothée Chalamet) and invites him to a party. At the party she is angry at his drunken behavior. Meanwhile, Jo meets with Friedrich Bhaer (Louis Garrel), a professor infatuated with her, and he gives her constructive criticism of her work. Afterward, Jo gets a letter saying that her younger sister Elizabeth ""Beth"" (Eliza Scanlen) has gotten sicker, so she returns home. In 1861, in Concord, Massachusetts, Jo and her older sister Margaret ""Meg"" (Emma Watson) go to a party where Jo meets Laurie, the grandson of their neighbour Mr. Laurence (Chris Cooper). On Christmas morning, their mother, affectionately called Marmee (Laura Dern) persuades the girls to give their breakfast to their poor neighbour, Mrs. Hummel (Sasha Frolova). Upon returning home, the girls are surprised to find their table full of food, provided by Mr. Laurence, and a letter from their father fighting in the Civil War. Jo visits their Aunt March, who invites Jo to Europe with her. Amy is invited in by Laurie, following a school punishment for misbehaving in class, before her family comes to take her home. When Meg, Jo, Laurie and John Brooke (James Norton), Laurie's tutor, go out one night, an angry and jealous Amy burns Jo's writings, upsetting Jo. Amy attempts to apologise but to no avail. The next morning Amy chases Jo, ice skating with Laurie. Amy breaks through the ice and almost drowns but is saved Jo and Laurie. That night, Jo expresses guilt over what happened to Amy. Mr. Laurence's grumpy nature is softened upon meeting Beth, he learns of her musical talent and offers her the use of his grand piano. In the present, Laurie visits Amy to apologise for his behaviour at the party. Later, he urges Amy not to marry Fred Vaughn (Dash Barber), but to marry him instead. She turns him down, thinking she is the second choice, after Jo, she also turns down a proposal from Fred, only to learn that Laurie has left for London. In the past, Marmee is informed that their father is ill from the war in Washington, D. C. Jo sells her hair in order to help their mother travel to care for him. Beth is given the piano from Mr. Laurence, but contracts scarlet fever from an infant, part of a family of poor people she was helping. Amy, who has not had the disease before, is sent to Aunt March. Marmee comes home early when Beth gets worse, but she recovers in time for Christmas, with their father surprising the girls returning home. On Meg's wedding day Jo tries to convince her to run away, but Meg tells her she is happy getting married. Aunt March announces her trip to Europe but decides to take Amy instead of Jo. After the wedding, Laurie admits his feelings for Jo, but she insists she does not feel the same way. In the present, Beth's condition worsens, and she eventually dies. Later, Marmee reveals a devastated Amy was returning home with a sick Aunt March. Jo wonders whether she was too quick in turning Laurie down and writes him a letter. On their way back, Amy tells Laurie she turned down Fred's proposal. The two kiss and later marry on the journey home. Returning home, Laurie catches up with Jo and they agree to just be friends. Outside, Jo throws away the letter she wrote for Laurie. The next day, Jo begins writing a novel based on the lives of her and her sisters. She sends the first chapters to Mr. Dashwood, and Bhaer turns up at the March house on his way to California to teach. In New York, Mr. Dashwood was unimpressed, but his daughters found the chapters of Jo's book and ask how it ends. He agrees to publish the book, as long as Jo amends her ending so that the main character will marry. Jo then chases after Bhaer and stops him from going to California. She negotiates copyright and royalties with Mr. Dashwood. Later, Jo has opened a school in Aunt March's house, who gave it to her after she died. Her book has been printed, titled Little Women. Also starring Jayne Houdyshell as Hannah. Ronan gives a trailblazing performance as the tomboyish sister, Pugh is splendid as the aspiring artist sister, Watson and Scanlen are fine, and there is good support from Chalamet, Streep, Dern, Cooper and others. The past versions did the story in linear order, this version going backwards and forwards in time does put a new spin on things, the script is fresh and does embrace the source material well, it is charming and has a splendid use of colour and costumes, a memorable and worthwhile coming-of-age period drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay for Greta Gerwig, and Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Good!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 June 2020,,"My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. There are several interesting ""extras"" on the disc.This is writer/director Greta Gerwig's movie. Most of her life she has admired the literary work, and has admired Alcott. She jumped at the chance to write the script and direct the movie. The result is a movie a bit different from prior versions and with Gerwig's own spin of what she thinks Alcott would have preferred.We enjoyed the movie but frankly some of the editing choices made it difficult to follow the story and to differentiate between the times when the girls were younger teenagers and when they were young adults. It added a bit of confusion which took away from the viewing pleasure.In this version Jo is played by Saoirse Ronan. I am a big fan of hers and to me her two best roles are in ""Hanna"" in 2011 and ""Brooklyn"" in 2015. But the role of Jo was not the best for her, I think Maya Hawke did it much better, was more authentic as Jo in the 1997 3-hour miniseries.But those are not major points, we enjoyed this movie even though we both think the editing was more confusing than helpful to tell the stories here."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,,"I didn't know the story beforehand, so I was rather confused by the non linear story line. I do one the costumes and the acting in the film."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,7/10,"The Louisa May Alcott novel has been oft filmed, so I wondered what new take could be given on it.Thankfully this turns out to be a joy, with a wonderful central performance from Saoise Ronan.Certainly a film worth watching."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 April 2020,10/10,"A remake of the 1994 movie. I think it was a ""spin off"" from honey I shrunk the kids."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,7/10,"This is a super (if rather freely) adapted version of the Alcott story about a family of sisters as they come of age towards the end of the American Civil War. I suppose that I do, personally, prefer the 1949 version - it has a little more feistiness. In this iteration though, Saoirse Ronan is great as the independently minded author determined to go through life on her own terms; no mean feat at the time. Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are good too as her sisters/mother respectively (though the accents are a wee bit dodgy on occasion). Meryl Streep has some cracking one-liners and has her facial expressions perfected. The star for me, however, is Timothée Chalamet - he plays the charming but emotionally fickle ""Laurie"" in a thoroughly captivating, engaging manner. The attention to detail is impressive and Alexandre Desplat's score helps the whole thing to come alive. It does sag in the middle; could perhaps do with shaving 15-20 minutes to tighten it up a little, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,8/10,"I approached this movie and the subsequent report on it with two strikes on me; 1) I am male, and 2) I haven't read the novel. If it comes to that I haven't read any of what we might call 'girl' novels, Anne of Green Gables, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, What Katy Did, and if any were filmed I didn't see them but I do know they EXIST, just as I knew Little Women existed before checking it out. If gorgeous beautifully shot rural settings make for good movies then this is a good movie. In a way it is reminiscent of the nod to Currier & Ives in Meet Me In St Louis except here the accent is rural rather than urban. I have to guess that someone on the 'creative' team has seen fit to make the action move back and forth in no apparent pattern which may well make sense if one knew the book. For instance it wasn't immediately apparent to me that Jo actually lived in New York for blocks of time rather than just travelling to see a publisher - it might also have helped to know the distances involved i.e. was it feasible to make a day trip to Ne York from the area of New England where the Marches make their home. I've already praised the camerawork and the acting is equally good with Laura Dern scoring heavily as the mother whilst Meryl Streep appears to have phoned it in for once."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 September 2020,6/10,"Set during the American Civil War and after, the story of four young sisters - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - their lives and loves, triumphs and heartbreaks and growing up.There have been several adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel with the 1949 (directed by Mervyn Leroy and starring June Allyson, Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Mary Astor and Peter Lawford) and 1994 (starring Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Bale, Susan Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne and Eric Stoltz) versions being the best among them. Both were excellent, with the 1949 version to the fore (a 9/10 for me, vs 8/10 for the 1994 version).With this adaptation, writer-director Greta Gerwig (whose previous film was the wonderful 'Lady Bird') does her best to create something new, using a non-linear storyline and some departures from the novel. Ultimately, however, while still quite enjoyable it is not in the same league as the 1949 and 1994 versions.The non-linearity - jumping back and forth between the women in the adult years to their younger years - while novel, detracts from the plot. It is difficult to build any momentum or engagement due to the back-and-forthness. In addition, it wrecks any intrigue regarding relationships and other developments in the sisters' younger lives, as you can see how it pans out.The film also doesn't have the warmth that the other two films had. While the bond and camaraderie between the sisters is reasonably well demonstrated, it just feels a bit hollow.This said, it's a decent telling of the story with some solid performances, especially from Saoirse Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy. However, I found Timothee Chalamet, as Laurie, a tad irritating and Laura Dern seemed miscast as Marmee.Very uplifting, emotional ending which ties everything together quite nicely."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,10/10,"Oh my God, what a glorious movie this is.This past year at the movies was one of surprises for me. I did not even want to see ""Joker,"" but then was blown away by how much that movie affected me. I was prepared to hate ""Jojo Rabbit"" and then was utterly charmed by it. And I couldn't have cared less about yet one more screen version of that old war horse ""Little Women,"" but then I cried like a baby multiple times during the movie.Sometimes I cried because of what was actually happening on film, but other times I teared up simply because of the warmth and passion coming from the screen, generated both by the actors and writer/director Greta Gerwig, who clearly adores this book and its characters and finds all sorts of ways to make it feel fresh, contemporary, and of the moment.I think I might actually love Saoirse Ronan, and her scene with Laura Dern, where she talks about how sick she is of love being the only thing a woman is allowed to care about, followed closely by how lonely she is, left me on the floor. I've never been even slightly moved in any other version of this story by what happens to Beth (I've always been like ""eh, whatever""). But in this version I was devastated and didn't think I'd recover. I love how Gerwig finds a way to make this movie about women having control of their own stories. I've never read the Louisa May Alcott book, but I know of the compromises she had to make as an author in order to get her story told, and I feel like Gerwig finds a way to tell the story (without changing much in the way of actual plot) that is the way Alcott would have told it had she been allowed to. It's like Gerwig conjured Alcott from a ouija board and had her by her side as she developed this project.If you had told me at the start of the year that ""Little Women"" would end up on my own personal 10 best list I would have laughed at you. I would have done the same about ""Joker"" for that matter. Here's to keeping an open mind and letting movies do to you what they will.Grade: A+"
LITTLE WOMEN,24 December 2019,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. More than 150 years have passed since Louisa May Alcott's novel was published (volume 1 was published in 1868, volume 2 in 1869). By my count, there have been seven previous movie adaptations, dating back to the silent film era and through the more familiar George Cukor-Katharine Hepburn (1933), Mervyn Leroy-June Allyson (1949), and Gillian Armstrong-Wynona Ryder (1994) versions. One might think that sufficient, yet, after viewing this latest, you'll likely join me in believing that director Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott (and by natural extension Jo March) are kindred spirits ... timeless storytellers of the moment.Oscar nominated (writing and directing) for her standout LADY BIRD (2017), Ms. Gerwig remains true to the beloved source material while adding her own contemporary touch. She begins with the adult March sisters and then flashing back 7 years to the stage of living together and battling through the difficult and awkward transitional phase. The four sisters Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) are exceptionally well cast, and we immediately recognize the familiar personality traits of each. Jo is the serious, determined writer who has an understanding of financial necessities. Meg is the warm facilitator beloved by all. Amy has ambitions (or is it dreams?) of being a great artist and living an exceptional life. Beth, the youngest, radiates a sweet nature and love for the piano.Much of the story is told through the eyes of Jo. Her independent spirit and frustration with how the world is, boils over at times. She states her disappointment at being born a girl, and is described as having ""a nature too noble to curb."" While viewing, one must keep in mind that this was the Civil War era (the girls' father is a military Chaplain), and women had achieved very few rights in society. The contrast is never more evident than when comparing Marmee (Laura Dern), presented here as a near flesh-and-blood saint, with Aunt March (Meryl Streep), one quite at ease in thumbing her nose at societal norms for one reason ... she is rich.Fans of the novel will be pleased that Timothee Chalamet plays ""Laurie Laurence"", who struggles every bit as much as the sisters in finding his way towards adulthood. His scenes with Jo are exceptional. Chris Cooper, not seen nearly enough in movies these days, perfectly captures the broken spirit of Mr. Laurence, a man never quite able to escape his own personal loss. Other key cast members include James Norton as tutor/teacher John Brooke, Louis Garrel as Friedrich (here a Frenchman), and Tracy Letts dropping some deadpan comedy as Jo's publisher Mr Dashwood.Ms. Gerwig (perhaps with a future as one of the greatest filmmakers) displays storytelling and cinematic craftsmanship at the highest level. She bounces between timelines (over at least 7 years) and different sisters' stories, showing how each is so different ... yet all interconnected. These spirited sisters, raised in the same modest home, have their own independent thoughts and ideas of how they want to live their lives. This delivers multiple comings-of-age and examines 'a woman's place', whatever that means. In fact, the message is that a woman's place is whatever she decides, and while her options are many (despite obstacles), her decisions are personal. None of the four sisters are played by American actors, and all four perform admirably. Pay particular attention to Florence Pugh (MIDSOMMAR) and her work as Amy. Also impressive is the Production Design by Jess Gonchor and the score by 2-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat. This one is all about the storytelling and characters, so take in the bunch known as the March sisters. As a side note, Greta Gerwig's next movie is a live-action BARBIE movie, with Margot Robbie in the lead."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,7/10,"Saoirse Ronan is such an enchanting actress she brings life to the character. She is the best actress to play Jo March. in the 94 movie Winona was lovely but not as fine. In the 49 movie June Allyson wasn't appealing enough.The story was told in a flashback manner with lots of jumping around in time. If you don't already know the story well it can be confusing and loses impact especially when showing the death of Beth.Apart from Saoirse Ronan the casting isn't great. Timothée is too teen looking and too millennial. Laura Dern isn't very motherly in demeanour. Didn't like the Professor played by Louis - he looked a bit sleazy for the role. Emma Watson looked too child like to be the eldest
sister.Imperfect but worth a watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,5/10,"I won't set out the plot of this film. This is only partly because the plot of Louisa May Alcott's novel is so well known. It's also because the film is so confusing that I couldn't actually understand a lot of it. Writer/director Greta Gerwig has chosen to tell the story in a peculiarly non-linear way, with flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within a flash-forward, flash-forwards within a flashback, and...you get the general idea. The only way I could make any sense of it was from my knowledge of the novel itself and of previous film and TV adaptations. This must be the only version of ""Little Women"" in which Beth not only dies but also comes back from the dead. (At least once and possibly twice). I don't think this was intended as a Lazarus-type resurrection, merely a side-effect of non-linear narration.The film differs from earlier versions of the story in a number of ways. Jo's admirer, Professor Friedrich Bhaer, is, in the book and in most previous films, considerably older than her, but here he is a young man of around the same age, more undergrad than professor. At one time older man/younger woman romances were common currency in Hollywood, possibly because the average Hollywood producer is an elderly or middle-aged male with a much younger trophy wife, but the effects of the #Metoo movement may have made film-makers uneasy about depicting relationships of this sort. The March family are normally described as living in ""genteel poverty"", but here they seem pretty well heeled, especially when compared to a genuinely poor family like the Hummels. They are, admittedly, poor when compared to their wealthy aunt, but only in the way that a millionaire is poor when compared to a billionaire.I am, in a way, sorry to have to be so critical about the film because there are some good things about it. It is, for example, visually attractive, reminiscent of a British ""heritage cinema"" period drama, and I liked Alexandre Desplat's musical score. There are some good acting performances. Pride of place in this respect must go to Saoirse Ronan as the determined, independent-minded and feisty Jo, but I was also struck by Timothée Chalamet as Jo's other admirer Laurie and Meryl Streep in a cameo as Aunt March. Ronan and Chalamet also appeared together in Gerwig's previous film, ""Lady Bird"", like this one a coming-of-age film but with a modern setting. Ronan is the only one of the four actresses playing the March sisters to have been born in America, and even she has spent more of her life in her parents' native Ireland; Emma Watson (Meg) and Florence Pugh (Amy) are British and Eliza Scanlen (Beth) Australian.My favourite screen adaptation of ""Little Women"" probably remains the one from the early nineties, but I will not make direct comparisons as it is a long time since I last saw that film. Greta Gerwig's film is in some respects better than the 1949 version with Elizabeth Taylor; it is, for example, better acted. (That film contained some strange examples of miscasting). Gerwig's narrative style, however, meant that her take on the story never moved fluently and never really held my attention. 5/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,,"""I've had lots of troubles, so I write jolly tales."" Jo March (Saoirse Ronan)Yes, the troubles of the March girls in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women are not a few, including death, disease, and men. The last item is the recurring danger for 19th century women who disregard the iron clad warning, from mothers mostly, that a girl is guaranteed success and safety if she marries and marries well. Jo is not like other girls because she holds out as long as possible in her spinsterhood while she pursues her writing career.Writer/director Gerwig does the impossible: She makes the novel new by letting the girls, especially Jo, direct their lives with energy and love. No better household occupies other movies this year, or almost any year. With Jo the spirit at the center, they represent the longing of women who are on the cusp of being recognized as intelligent and creative.In the family are a writer, a painter, an actress, and a pianist, about as representative of the muses as you can get. Gerwig enthusiastically directs the actresses to run in all directions on their own. As an ensemble, the cast may be the best of 2019; as individual actresses they give the audience a full measure of strength and weakness.With soft golden interior light and bathing sunlight through the windows and in the outdoors, Gerwig gives the nostalgic and warming ambience needed for us to love and respect these romantic characters. Alexandre Desplat's music, although at times intrusive, is mostly spot on to support moment and thoughts.Greta Gerwig has a masterful film that should be nominated for an Oscar. As for those actresses, they work so well together that they may cancel each other at Oscar time. Whatever, because they embody the bright, emerging young feminists we promote today: tough, ambitious, and loving--only over a century and a half ago. Greta and Saoirse-Alcott would write about them if she were alive."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,7/10,"""Little Women"" a film that has been done many times is one that entertains with drama and love as it's a sprawling journey of life, love, and choices. The film is a reflection of life thru flashbacks also as it looks at the times of the March sisters. Told mostly thru the eyes and point of view of one young up and comer Jo March(Saoirse Ronan) it shows how her and her sisters lived life with hope, energy, and love. As Jo longed for success to become a writer holding out for respect hoping that her intelligence would be known all while spinning sisterhood. The scenes are filled with many outdoor takes as it seems the characters were always on a journey. And the picture is a showcase for the talents of the March family as it features a writer, painter, actress, and musician. The chemistry of the cast is in top notch form with good work from Laura Dern and Emma Watson. May not be everyone's cup of tea still it's a masterful work of storytelling and art!"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 March 2020,8/10,"""Likewise, Gerwig vibrantly carves out a pellucid orbit to point up the story's undeniable feminist slant on steroids, never preaching or showboating, through the words tailored to the quartet siblings and even the snide Aunt March (Streep, chewing the scenery a bit, but a perfect foil to balance the sisters' wholesomeness), the film lays bare the shackles thrown down on women of that time (19th century) by the patriarchal society, meanwhile respects each girl's different life choices, although it is Jo's canny smartness, savvy resilience and talent as a self-sufficient writer that is eulogized as the centerpiece in the ambiguous ending, has Jo married to the criminally handsome Professor Friedrich Bhaer (Garrel) or not?

LITTLE WOMEN,24 March 2020,8/10,"My parents read Little Women to me when I was a child (I found it boring but have no memory beyond that), and I've seen three adaptations that I didn't care for, so I only watched this one because my girlfriend wanted to.But much to my surprise, this was much better than what I recall of the rest.In my head, Little Women is the story of one interesting character, Jo, and a set of frilly girls who left no impression. But instead of offering one tomboy and a bunch of girly-girls, director Gerwig offers a rambunctious tribe. There is a physicality to all the girls I only remember Jo having, and while this makes Jo stand out a little less, it gives the story a lot more drive.And while I've felt Little Women always pushed a ""real writers don't write pirate stories"" moral that I find objectionable, this version has a more nuanced view that is more about the reasons a writer might organically change genres.While the non-linear story sometimes had me confused, and while Soirse Ronan's Jo isn't as compelling as Katherine Hepburn's overall this is easily the best version of Little Women. Definitely worth watching (although I am torn between giving it a 7 and an 8)."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2020,5/10,"This most recent take on the old Louise M Alcott classic novel (and there have been many), shakes up certain aspects of the story with its time-shifting narrative and nods to feminism and creative artists, but the end result is still recognisable despite its mild modernist makeover.The story should be familiar, concerning the four daughters of the March family, who, while father is away from home fighting for Lincoln in the American Civil War, are busy growing up in Massachussetts, one house down from the rich widower living in his grand mansion, alongside his feckless, baby-faced son and one door up for the slum-shack inhabited by a poor, sick family in need of charity and fast.I will admit to some confusion at times over the treatment of the timelines which interconnect here. Only once did I see a ""seven years earlier"" subtitle, near the start of the film, but from then, was left to ascertain where, or more to the point, when I was from the context of the scene or the appearance of the actors themselves, the latter, in particular proving little help when the physical signs of a character being younger or older were difficult to detect, certainly any changes in fashion weren't helping. I don't mind being made to work and pay attention during a movie, but some more date-subtitling would probably have helped.The story begins and ends with the erstwhile oldest sister of the March brood, Jo, the budding author amongst them. Somewhat tomboyish in her manner and appearance, the questions are immediately posed, will success and true love find her and of course the answers by the close are inevitable. From there we're gradually introduced to her family, their conscientious mother, whom they all ridiculously call """"Marmee"" and three sisters, all equally, if improbably, aspirant in the arts, one for acting, another for art and the youngest for music. Not your average family then, the only other one I can think of in life, so similarly ambitious being the one helpfully referenced at one point, the Brontes.The lives, loves and deaths of the family are then somewhat haphazardly set before the viewer but as indicated, I didn't think this modernist non-linear approach helped the story-telling. This is a family saga and better told, I think from back-to-front. I know that's the way the story has always been filmed but different doesn't always work and this reworking I think is a case in point. The sets and costumers were fine but I was doubtful of some of the casting and performances. Saoirse Ronan seems too old for her part and Timothée Chalomet way too young for his, this most apparent in their scenes together. None of the other acting I saw really reached out to me either as the phrase ""playing the clothes"" came to mind.My wife and I had reasonable hopes of this slightly seasonal family drama this Christmas Eve but were left thinking a little less family and a little more drama might have been in order."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,6/10,"'Little Women (2019)' is the umpteenth adaptation of its source novel, yet the first which I have seen. Apparently, its time-hopping structure is entirely new, seemingly included to call attention to the story's various call-backs and contrasts, and has caused some confusion among audiences unfamiliar with the book. I can't say that's a real issue, though, as I find the flick perfectly comprehensible, its stylistic choices always serving the narrative instead of detracting from it. The movie is sprawling, domestic and somewhat wistful. It focuses on traditional romance, family dynamics and the struggles of women, viewing each aspect primarily through the rebellious eyes of Jo. Her three sisters do get distinct personalities and their fair share of screen-time, though. It's a tale of sisters, through and through. It's about their individual struggles to manoeuvre through a world that doesn't want them to be themselves, which you're always invested in. The acting is great across the board, with struggles strewn across faces and heartbreak seeping from unspoken words. The only issue with it is that some members of the core family are playing far younger than they have any right to be: Pugh's Amy, for example, is supposed to be thirteen for a large portion of the piece. Though the writing and acting do a good job of conveying youth, which contrasts well with the characters' eventual adulthoods, the casting simply isn't believable and it detracts from the experience. Other than that, though, the flick feels like it's exactly as it's supposed to be. It's confident, engaging and sometimes quite charming. It doesn't quite hit as hard as I'd like and it does feel very long, coming close to overstaying its welcome on quite a few occasions. It's never boring but it's often just passive entertainment. Still, it is entertainment. It's good enough and perhaps couldn't be any better. It's a solid effort. 6/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,7/10,"One of the main reasons I was interested in seeing this new version of the classic ""Little Women"" story was because Greta Gerwig came on board to direct, and strangely enough, I thought the direction was actually one of the weaker aspects of the film. The choice by Gerwig, or perhaps her editor, to tell this story non-linearly feels like a mistake but a unique choice that I'm sure many people appreciated. Across the board, the performances, cinematography, writing etc. were all very good. But I wasn't sucked in like I hoped I would be, and much of that can be attributed to the jumbled storytelling (or at least in my opinion). But I am glad the film is getting recognition considering Gerwig was mostly snubbed a few years ago for Lady Bird.7.5/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,,"Never seen or read any version of this story, but this was a brilliant, brilliant film and highly recommended."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,,"The 7th film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of the same name is the only version that I've seen so far and frankly, I don't need to check out the ones that surfaced before anymore coz Greta Gerwig's Little Women is an instant classic that impresses on all fronts, and also establishes her as a creative force to be reckoned with.Written & directed by Gerwig in what's her solo sophomore effort, the film is crafted with so much love, passion, honesty, authenticity & heartfelt warmth that it has the viewers under its spell within minutes. Gerwig captures the joy, pain, tenderness & everlasting love between sisters with such effortless purity that it's just beautiful to watch.Coming off the critical & commercial success of Lady Bird, Gerwig proves that she is no one hit wonder, for Little Women is much better & far more mature work from her. The period details, costume design, low-light photography stand out with ease, while excellent editing makes sure there isn't a single wasted scene in the final print.Gerwig's script bestows each character with arcs that exhibit depth & richness, and then she directs the terrific cast of Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen & others to help them bring their respective roles to life with finesse & vibrancy. Ronan's input is amazing, Pugh is just as good & the rest provide brilliant support but it's their chemistry with one another that clicks best.Overall, Little Women presents Greta Gerwig in stellar form, and is another quality addition to her filmography. Exquisitely highlighting the women's plight, prejudice & powerlessness in those days and to an extent even today, Little Women is a joyful celebration of sisterhood that's highly faithful to its source material and is winsome & whimsical in wonderful ways. One of the best all-round films of 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,7/10,"As strange as it sounds, this is probably the first adaptation of Little Women I've watched. I enjoyed the story, I just didn't enjoy how it was told. I found the fractured storyline difficult to follow, especially since the characters all look the same age throughout the film. Nevertheless, this movie features some wonderful performances, along with a beautiful score and impressive costume design. Maybe it's time for me to watch the other adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's famous novel."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,10/10,"Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) has been tutoring in New York City and writing stories for publication. Although she lives in the attic and sends money home to her family, she has struck up a friendship with a professor, Frederick, who lives in the same rooming house. A family crisis back home sends her returning to the Boston area and her childhood home. While on the train, she reflects on her childhood in a family of four sisters. First, there was oldest Meg (Emma Watson) who was clever and kind while resenting the lack of riches in the family. Then, Jo came next, a tomboy with a talent for writing and a strong personality. Following her was Beth (Eliza Scanlen), a quiet and thoughtful girl who loved music and playing the piano. Finally, but not least in her mind, was Amy (Florence Pugh) who favored art and drawing and whose likewise strong personality and desire for elegance came into conflict many times with Jo. On happenstance, when Meg and Jo are invited to a dance, Jo stumbles upon their neighbor, Laurie (Timothee Chalumet), who is back from Europe and is somewhat shy; nevertheless, he and Jo get on like the dickens. In addition, Laurie has a tutor named Mr. Brooke, who comes to admire Meg very much and a grandfather (Chris Cooper) who is gruff and scary. Going back and forth in time, Jo lays out their struggles and joyful events. Father is away with the North army in the Civil War but Marmee (Laura Dern) is a strong woman who encourages her daughters to be the best they can be. The gals put on plays for neighborhood children, sometimes quarrel, go ice skating, take care of their poorer neighbors, and dream big dreams. Soon, Meg falls in love, Beth gets scarlet fever, Amy acts out at school, and Jo tries to please Aunt March (Meryl Streep) who has employed her as a companion. All too soon, the girls are grown and have new struggles. How will each of them turn out? Will their father be proud of his ""Little Women""? This new version of Louisa May Alcott's timeless classic is the best and bravest adaptation ever. First, the cast is just grand; all of them deserve honors. Then, the director Greta Gerwig has chosen to forego a linear tale and go back and forth in time, resulting in a fresh approach to a well-known story. Moreover, the settings, the costumes, the historical recreations, the melodic score and the cinematography are near perfect. Yes, like this viewer, you may have seen many film versions of the novel and read and re-read the happenings of the March girls. But, do not let this discourage you from going once again to celebrate a truly wonderful American classic. Bravo, Ms. Gerwig, for bestowing it on movie audiences one more time."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 May 2020,10/10,"Most all the film adaptations of the book going back to the early silent 1900s have received quite good reviews. Hard to go wrong with this story; a bit of real life everything. As to this one it's sets, props, costuming, acting all very well done. I'm most impressed w/the forward thinking intelligence in expressing the rights of all, i.e. ""I'm not a poet. I'm just a woman. And as a woman, there's no way for me to make my own money."" ""If I had money it would belong to my husband. If we had children they would be his."" In many parts of the world still true today to a degree that places women at a value lower than cattle."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 September 2020,10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Little Women"" (2019) is an instant classic. This is the type of a movie that we need more like it, and we don't even recognize it. It is a picture that has everything clicking on all cylinders:
a) casting & acting is more then great - it features amazing performances by one of my all time favorites Saoirse Ronan & a great newcomer Florence Pugh which i remembered from ""Midsommar"" - this is a young actress to look out for. Add here a supporting cast by always terrific Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, Tracy Letts, Meryl Streep (!), Chris Cooper - it hardly gets better then this.
b) shap, funny, very warm and very involving and touching screenplay - this is a story that values family, love and feelings to each other.
c) terrific directing and production values. This movie was directed superbly as it never dragged and was very involving from start till finish.Overall, ""Little Women"" is an amazing movie that was very touching, funny, amazing acted, written and directed. Cast of actors in this movie was out of this wold. You will be touched by this movie of simply how wonderful it really is."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,7/10,"Little Women (2019). With fresh, innocent eyes and mind that never experienced a ""Little Women"" movie or novel, this apparently seventh version of the well-read book by little women themselves seems to offer a rather difficult to follow movie. Too many jumps, flashbacks, and chaos seem to reign, chaos while understandably a part of living with the March family becomes a rather unsettling blur to the uninitiated. What is strikingly and perversely amusing is that even the author of this well received movie, Louisa May Alcott agreed that even her book that so many movies were based on was not a work that she enjoyed writing, never liked girls, and that the book in fact was ""dull."" When compared to Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, especially the 1995 television mini-series, this Little Women perhaps unfairly doesn't provide the newly initiated audience with an easy flowing and immersive experience. Admittedly the performance of Saoirse Ronan stands out with her Elizabeth Bennet-like fierce character, albeit Elizabeth Bennet had an even more of cultural restrictions on women."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 February 2020,8/10,"There's an undescribable charm in how director Greta Gerwig carries the dramatic Alcott novel and its flowery characters in Little Women that makes it more appealing than the original source itself. It's not the feminism-on-your-face outlook that it borderline takes towards the end, but the feel-goodedness that enchants you as you look through the eyes of the lead protagonist of the lives of these women. The various escapades that they get into, add to that the non-linear, trippy storyline, it comes together to give you a cosy feeling. I should also note the soothing score of Alexandre Desplat that drives the film in addition to the resplendent performances by each and every person in the cast. TN.(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the MAMI Year Round Programme in Mumbai.)"
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,9/10,"Incredible acting, beautiful clothes throughout and heartwarming vibes! Greta Gerwig is brilliant I love the way she writes! I can't believe I didn't really know about the story before, my mom told me it's a book and there's been at least 6 adaptations which is crazy. Very enjoyable period piece film or at least it seemed like one."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,6/10,"I just got out of Little Women.Well, I made it to the end, but it was a slog at times (especially the last half hour). Despite cries for it, I'm not expecting Greta Gereig to be nominated for any Oscars as it just isn't that good!!If Saiirse Ronan gets a nomination I'd be ok with that as she carries thus movie.
Emma Watson and Florence Pugh are good in their supporting roles, whilst Laura Dern and Meryl Streep do what they do, so well. For me though, the stand out performer was a man. Timothèe Chalamet is a man to watch.The costumes are all on point and the cinematography as beautiful. Yorik Le Seux should be nominated for an Oscar. I think the cinematography is the best thing about the movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,,"If ""Little woman"" is not the most adapted (stage, movie, TV) classic of all times, it would be very close to being the one. What director Greta Gerwig has done is to make from it a movie of the second decade of the twenty-first century, and retain the original charm faithfully.Parallel timeline is an often-used technique these days but few are as skilful as Gerwig. The toggle is not arbitrary as many others, but thoughtfully used to forward the story, enhance the mood, or accentuate key plot elements.From the viewpoint of the original book, the first series of scenes in the movie are ""seven years later"" with Jo in New York trying to get some of her work published. We see her getting valuable advice from the editor: if the story is about a woman, it better end with her getting married or die, or else it just won't sell. Then comes the next series of scenes ""seven year ago"" (starting point of the book), the Christmas scene in which their kind-hearted mother succeeds in persuading the four sisters to show what I would call Good King Wenceslas spirit. The movie carries on cutting back and forth between these two time lines.I am not going to details of the plot as it would be just as unnecessary as for, say, ""Pride and prejudice'.Going directly to the performances, Saoirse Ronan's portray of Jo is perfection personified, the strength, the weakness, the spirit, the vulnerability, the brilliance of this young woman. She is the most deserving of the Oscar nominees for best actress.Emma Watson's Meg, not bestowed with her sisters' talents of writing, music or painting, is the most practical of the four. Although Jo does remind her of her acting talents, Meg decides to lead a simple life, marrying the financially unattractive tutor, the man she loves. This is not a difficult role to play but requires good discipline in measured balance between reason and passion. Watson is pitch-perfect.Eliza Scanlen brings to the screen the endearing Beth, tragically lost to illness before the end. Very watchable is her father-daughter affection with neighbour lonely widower Mr. Laurence (Chris Cooper), starting with being invite to go over any time to play the piano that is left unused, ""if only to keep it tuned"", says the considerate old man.Florence Pugh has received a deserved Best Supporting Oscar nomination for playing the free-spirited Amy, who laments ""I am second to Jo all my life"". Although she has not been favoured to win, she already has another breakthrough coming up, going toe-to-toe with Scarlett Johansson in ""Black Widow"".There is a field of support with strength and depth. Playing the kind-hearted mother with passion and strength is Laura Dern, who is nominated for Oscar best support in another movie, ""Marriage Story"" (and already won in Golden Globe). Meryl Streep plays the rich aunt, with winks and grimaces that she can do even when she is dead (sorry Ms Streep, ""in her sleep"" is just not enough here). Her one-liners such as ""I am not always right but I am never wrong"" will not fail to remind the audience of Maggie Smith in ""Downton Abbey"" if they have seen that movie. Of the handful of men, not much needs to be said about Timothee Chalamer, doing what he does best playing Teddy, the heartthrob who captures emotions ranging from infatuation to devotion from young ladies across his path. The best though is Chris Cooper who must have plays any kind of character imaginable. As the lonely widower with a heart of gold, he melts hearts.""Little women"" does not have a Oscar nomination for cinematography, most unjustly. One scene that is particularly mesmerizing is a distant shot of Jo and Beth at the beach, with the sky and clouds bathing in ethereal light behind.Talking about mesmerizing scenes, one depicts a sudden surge of inspiration showing Jo, in the wake of Beth's death, burns midnight oil (quite literally) turning out page after page of the sisters' life stories, spreading them on the floor. This brings back images of Doctor Zhivago's outpour of poetry on a desolate snowy night."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 April 2020,7/10,"""Little Women"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we follow the story of four young women who are trying to live their lives differently one to another, following their own dreams and trying to achieve their goals.I liked this movie because of the time that it was placed, the well written script and its very interesting plot. I also enjoyed the photography of it and regarding the direction of it that it was made by Greta Gerwig I have to say that she presented very well the situations of the society of that time and she combined very well romance with drama. The interpretations of Saoirse Ronan's who played as Jo March, Florence Pugh's who played as Amy March, Emma Watson's who played as Meg March and Eliza Scanlen's who played as Beth March were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Timothée Chalamet's who played as Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence, Chris Cooper's who played as Mr. Laurence and Laura Dern's who played as Marmee March."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2020,8/10,"Little Women (4 out of 5 stars).Little Women is a good coming of age drama about four young girls who are raised by there mother. While they meet a young boy across there street which he befriends with them. As years go by, their love for each other changes as they grow apart and trying to overcome with life changes.It is a beautiful plot. I liked it more than i thought. These four girls growing up and changing. One wants to be a writer and live free from marriage. Another wants to be a painter. The other wants to be an actress but falls in love early. And the youngest wants to play music. The plot can be emotional with characters facing tough times in life. It does have a feel good ending.The cast ensemble is great. I love the actors that played there roles. They all did great.The direction and script is great with the storytelling. It was a little confusing at first with the story bouncing around from the past and present. Which the tone and characters clothing needs to be paid attention too to find out were the story is.Overall, Little Women is a good film that is worth seeing."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"As I sat down in my theater seat for ""Little Women"", I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I had somehow (despite being a pretty prolific reader) never absorbed the original text, so I came into this Greta Gerwig adaption with a clean slate. When the credits rolled, I found myself absolutely blown away by the depth and complexity of both the overall messages and the performances within this story.For a very basic overview, ""Little Women"" tells the story of the March sisters--Jo (Saorise Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). Director Gerwig uses intercutting flash-backs/forwards to examine their lives growing up together and then striking out into the world as individuals. Ostensibly, the character of Jo is focused on the most, as she struggles with how to balance her independence with her potential loneliness in an era that was not kind to women unless marriage was part of the equation.The original Louisa May Alcott story proves to be a compelling baseline to this film in and of itself. Like I said, as someone who had never read/seen that story before, its themes of sibling friendship/squabbles, growing up poor (yet still helping others along the way), and trying to find one's way in the world as an adult really hit a chord with me. The fact that most of the cast don't share my gender did not in the slightest deter me from relating to all of the film's themes. Tears were brought to my eyes on many different occasions.Simply via the way the overall movie is structured, Ronan's performance stands out as award-worthy (and is being rewarded as such). Her writing/direction from Gerwig shines just as bright. One concern I had coming into this movie is that the trailers seemed to really be pushing the female-centric, almost feminist angle. Nothing wrong with that approach, but I just tend to prefer some more nuance, and that is exactly what Gerwig provides (I should never have doubted in the first place, I guess, after being impressed by her in ""20th Century Women"" from a few years ago). In fact, the incredibly emotional conflict within Jo provides the best moments of the entire experience. Nothing preachy or one-sided here.I also have to add that Timothee Chalamet (as ""Laurie"") gives what could/should be an award-winning performance of his own. His interaction with every cast member is perfect, whether via humor or gut-wrenching emotion. I hope he is rewarded on par with Ronan.Overall, ""Little Women"" proved to be a film that completely caught me off guard in terms of how deep and thoughtful it turned out to be. Not only is the screenplay a gem (potentially more awards for best adaptation?) in its time-hopping, but all the performances and themes match that writing. Without spoiling anything, it also features an ending that will have you mouth agape and pondering its significance long after you leave the theater."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,9/10,"Did the world need or ask for another adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's famed novel Little Women? The answer is probably no but after having sat through Greta Gerwig's lovingly shot and beautifully staged version of the beloved story of the March sisters, you'd be hard pressed too find many viewers that weren't glad this new take on the classic story came to life.Announcing herself as a filmmaking force with her directional debut Lady Bird, Gerwig proves here to be the real deal in a very big way, as she takes the reigns behind the camera and takes charged of screenwriting duties as she instills her own flavor and verve into Alcott's family drama.Whilst set in the Civil War era of the United States, Gerwig manages to bring modern day sensibilities and flair to the March's tale, without ever losing sight of the core heart and soul of the narrative that has managed to maintain a place in popular culture for these many years since it's initial release in print form.Little Women is one of those features that feels accomplished and thought through wherever you look from Yorick Le Saux's photogenic cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's sumptuous costume design, through to a typically strong Alexandre Desplat score, as the film showcases Gerwig growing before our eyes as a director in what's a major step up production wise from the small-scale and more independently structured Lady Bird.As with her breakout film, Gerwig has managed to assemble a fantastic and on song cast to bring her vision to screen with every performer bringing their A-game's to proceedings here, as returning Gerwig actors Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet as the determined and unflappable Jo March and the devilishly charismatic Theodore Laurence respectively shine brightest in a loaded ensemble.With Lady Bird and this higher profile effort under her belt, it's clear that Gerwig is an actors director, as she also oversees the further establishment of 2019 breakout star Florence Pugh, who delivers an awards worthy turn as the more artistic and whimsical March sister Amy.Thanks to the film's overwhelmingly strong performances and technical strengths, the fact that Little Women's now more formulaic and familiar plot movements and processions never threaten to detour from the fact this heartfelt and soulful effort is a thoroughly enjoyable and likable affair, that manages to say some important things about equality and female empowerment without ever feeling preachy or overbearing.A strong vision from a female filmmaker of substantial and timely power.Final Say -A deservingly praised incarnation of a much adapted tale, Little Women is a fabulously watchable version of a literary classic that further enhances Gerwig and her actresses standings in the cinematic landscape.4 1/2 burnt novels out of 5"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,6/10,"Little Women (2019) was written and directed by Greta Gerwig. It's based on the 19th Century novel by Louisa May Alcott.I had high hopes for this film, but they weren't fulfilled. I don't think I should say ""based on"" the novel. I should say ""somewhat related to"" the novel.Director Gerwig has spread out the story so that it's not only about Jo. That's OK. However, because the book is written in Jo's voice, she is the key player. In 1933, Jo was portrayed by Katherine Hepburn. In 1949, by June Alyson, and in 1994, by Winona Ryder. They were all great. Saoirse Ronan plays Jo in this version, and she's excellent.The problem for me came in the casting of the French actor Louis Garrel as Professor Bhaer. He's described in the novel as a middle-aged, ""philosophically inclined,"" and penniless German immigrant in New York City, who was a noted professor in Berlin. Louis Garrel is a handsome man, age 33, but looking more like age 25. What young woman with Jo's temperament wouldn't want to marry him? However, that wasn't what Alcott wanted us to see. She took the hard path; Gerwig took the easy one.The movie has an all-star cast, but the actor that carried the film for me was Laura Dern as Marmee. The camera has always loved Dern, and it still does. Director Gerwig got that one right.We saw the movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. I think it will work well on the small screen. Note that I entitled my review, ""A Minority View."" The movie has a very high 7.9 IMDb rating. My daughter--who knows movies--thought it was great. However, I think you'd do better with Katherine, June, or Winona."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 February 2020,6/10,"One thing that really worked for the movie was the way they presented the story. Oddly, it was not confusing and it worked. The performances were pretty good from all of the cast members. However, the story singled out the main character and left out mostly all the others, even though the little one managed to shine through the cracks the story left, with her fasty personality. But, she looked better in the later timeline, as her younger self didn't really sell for the young silly girl she supposed to be. The romance looked hasty too. And there were moments that were rushed by. But overall, the movie was nice."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,7/10,"Writer/director Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"") puts a contemporary spin on Louisa May Alcott's nineteenth century classic novel in Little Women, now in its eight film version. Alcott's semi-autobiographical story about four sisters growing up in Concord, Massachusetts during and after the Civil War stands out for its warmth and celebration of family, its exquisite period costumes, and for its strong message of female empowerment, rare for its day. Unfortunately, while previous versions adhere to the sequence of events described in the novel, Gerwig takes liberties with the chronology, mixing scenes of past and present, tinkering that only serves to create confusion and undercutting what is essentially a coming-of-age drama which relies on our understanding of character growth and development.The film begins with the March sisters as grown women. The free-thinking, independent-minded Jo March is the central character, an aspiring writer who may be a mirror for Alcott. Unlike the 1994 version which, according to one critic, ""invites your attention, slowly and elegantly,"" the latest iteration seems to be happening in warp speed, creating an atmosphere of high spirits and calculated energy. In the opening scene, Jo, in a heartfelt but somewhat subdued performance by Saoirse Ronan (""Mary Queen of Scots""), is living in a boarding house in New York doing odd jobs to support her family.When Mr. Dashwood (Tracy Letts, ""Ford v. Ferrari""), editor of the magazine, the ""Weekly Volcano,"" agrees to publish her first story, Jo tells him that she is promoting the book for a friend and wants it to be published anonymously. The editor says to tell her friend that if she wants to be a successful writer, her stories must end with the female character being married or dead, not a promising choice for some people. Jo has become fond of boarding house acquaintance Friedrich Bhaer (Louis Garrel, ""Planetarium""), a language professor from France, but her inability to handle his criticism of her work causes him to disappear for most of the film. We meet Jo's sister Amy (Florence Pugh, ""Midsommar""), in Paris to study painting, accompanied by her sharp tongued Aunt March (a delightful Meryl Streep, ""Florence Foster Jenkins"").Aunt March tells her that the most important thing she can do is marry a wealthy man. Being that women at the time could not vote or hold well-paying jobs, could not own anything if they were married, even their children, this was a practical idea leading Amy to conclude that marriage was an ""economic proposition."" Even so, Amy has her heart set on dilettante Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, the March's good looking and super-wealthy next-door neighbor played by a wild-haired Timothée Chalamet (""The King"") in an earnest yet unconvincing performance. There are two other sisters in the story, Beth (Eliza Scanlan, ""Babyteeth"") and Meg (Emma Watson, ""Regression"") but they are peripheral characters that are not well-developed.Meg has fallen in love with John Brooke (James Norton, ""Flatliners""), Laurie's former tutor whom she will eventually marry, while Beth, a talented pianist, is engaged in a fierce battle with scarlet fever. While Jo is the most independent of the characters, other paths are respected as well. ""Just because my dreams are different from yours doesn't mean they're less important,"" Meg tells her. While in Paris, Amy runs into Laurie and is not shy about her feelings for him but she has a consuming passion to first prove herself as an artist. ""I want to be the best or nothing,"" she says at one point.Though Jo turns down's Laurie's pleading marriage proposal and rejects the life of being a wife and mother (Alcott never married), she later shows her vulnerability when she admits to her mother Marmee (Laura Dern, ""Marriage Story"") that she is lonely. The film then flashes back seven years to Christmas in New England when the girls were teenagers, the only visible clue being that their hair is shorter. With their father (Bob Odenkirk, ""The Post"") involved in the war, Marmee teaches the young women about the rewards of kindness for those less fortunate when she brings a Christmas breakfast to a family in need.In one of the most exuberant scenes in the film, the teenage Jo engages in a wild dance with Laurie, whom she has just met at a party. When the girls are rehearsing a play, they invite Laurie to join their club and be accepted as part of the family, something he relishes. In one of the narrative's most iconic moments, Amy, angry at her sister for not taking her to the theater with her and jealous of her friendship with Laurie, consigns Jo's manuscripts to the flames when she is not at home.When Jo returns she is devastated and furious but, when Amy falls into a crack in the ice and is rescued by Jo and Laurie, she is forgiving and Amy is sorry for her childish behavior. The scene emphasizes the warmth and camaraderie of the sisters, showing how a family can rise above petty grievances and provide mutual support. It is a reminder of how good Little Women could have been without the gimmickry."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,10/10,"I'm confident in my personal identity as a straight, cis-gender male...but damn if this didn't make me wish I was a girl with many sisters. Greta Gerwig. My God. She is truly a master. Even if this isn't quite as inspired or good as Lady Bird (though it may be), it squarely solidifies her as a filmmaking genius. Pure cinematic goodness, that even in its saddest moments is a welcome reminder of the importance of love & kindness in a deeply unfair existence."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2021,8/10,"In the best Jane Austin style, empowered women, despite all the stigma of the time, submissive behavior of women, certainly these works led many to delirium and probably to the stimulus of dreaming and reaching a breach in patriarchal society with the ideals of Jo... Beautiful film, dramas, family relationships, fights between sisters, forgiveness, loves, dislikes, dream fulfillment, deaths, romances and happy endings... Louisa definitely represents me, accomplished and only, we are enough..."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,7/10,"Little women is film that will probably be a big thing in awards and it could win some of them for sure,but for me the best was florence pugh who after staring in this and fighting with my family and midsommar become one of best rising stars in industry and we can except a lot from her in future starting with next year black widow,emma and saiorse were also good in their ways,only chalamet for me didnt, fitt in story he felt only as love interest and he didnt have a big impact on me,little woman is a very good made film with its good plot and message of sisterly bond that worked in a great way"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 January 2020,7/10,"""Little Women "" (2019 release; 135 min.) brings the story of the 4 March sisters (Amy, Jo, Meg and Beth) in the 1860s. As the movie opens, Jo is offering a short story to a New York publisher, who to her delight offers to buy it, albeit with serious edits. Meanwhile Amy is in Paris with her aunt, where she runs into her friend Laurie. Back to Jo, who gets a letter that her younger sister Beth is very ill, so Jo returns home. We then go to ""Seven Years Earlier, Concord, Massachusetts""... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest adaptation of the famed 1868 novel by Louise May Alcott. However, it is the first directed by a woman, namely Greta Gerwig. Following her strong 2017 directing debut ""Lady Bird"", Gerwig returns as director (and script writer). Gerwig confirms that she is a director to reckon with, as the movie is as pleasant as it is timely and contemporary (among others, examining the role of women and marriage). Saoirse Ronan, also the lead in ""Lady Bird"", is the central figure as (as Jo), and the main glue that holds together the large ensemble cast. The other sisters are played by Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Eliza Scanlan. Laura Dern is delightful as the gruels' mom. Timothée Chamelet, typically so solid, looks lost most of the time as his character tries to decide which of the sisters he really likes best. Meryl Streep gets about 10 min. of screen time as the crabby Aunt March. Last but not least, there is a wonderful orchestral score courtesy of Oscar-winnning composer Alexandre Desplat, and I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he gets another Oscar nomination for this.""Little Women"" opened wide on Christmas Day and has done very well, both critically (it's currently rated 95% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and at the box office against formidable competition (the latest Star Wars). I saw it this past weekend and the Saturday early evening screening was PACKED (just short of a sellout). If you are in the mood for another take on ""Little Women"", or simply are a fan of Greta Gerwig or Saoirse Ronan, I readily suggest you check this out, be in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,5/10,"Little Women is a remake of the 1994 film of the same name and stars Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh,Meryll Streep,Laura Dern and Chris Cooper and tells the tale of the March sisters who are living together and basically that's all I can say. The acting is decent,Emma Watson was grand although I prefer her in Beauty and the Beast, the rest of the actors are all playing the part ok. My only downside is the story. I cant describe what this film is telling me. One minute we see Jo meeting some bloke with her story the next we see her with her sisters,then we see some guy who wants to marry one of the March sisters.If you love period dramas like Downton Abbey and Pride And Prejuice you may enjoy it. For me I'm glad I went to see Bad Boys For Life instead.5/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,4/10,"Little Women is back again for the umpteenth time, this time courtesy Greta Gerwig-but one must ask, does Louisa May Alcott's iconoclastic novel (by 19th century standards), still deserve another cinematic adaptation? The answer is sadly ""no.""
Back in the day, Alcott's novel was a big thing. Written by a self-professed ""proud spinster,"" Alcott presented a role model for young girls in the form of Jo March, a tomboy turned author who rejects immediate motherhood as well as romantic love, in order to pursue a career as a creative writer.
Little Women was already a decidedly feminist tract long before the idea became fashionable-so why does Gerwig get so much credit for emphasizing the idea a little bit more? By doing so (especially during the first half of the narrative), Gerwig pushes back against the very quote from Alcott with which she starts her film: that Alcott's intention was to write something amusing, despite the fact that her own life was filled with sorrows.
Virtually the first half of the novel is a portrait of three teenage girls and 10 year old Amy (but in the film, Beth is the youngest). Alcott views them affectionately with all their foibles and despite her sentimental view of both parents, the gentle humor comes through without hesitation (check out the 1933 and 1949 versions in which both leading ladies emphasize Jo's idiosyncrasies and tomboy demeanor).
Gerwig's Jo (Saoirse Ronan), on the other hand, is all business as a newly minted feminist icon. She anachronistically traipses through Concord, Massachusetts, on her way to fame and glory as the author of Little Women (for Jo ""becomes"" Louisa May Alcott at film's end). She even has Jo throw a temper tantrum (perhaps to vainly show more ""character depth""), when she reacts poorly to Professor Bhaer's criticism near the film's climax.
What Gerwig also tries to do is play up the conflict between Jo and sister Amy (Florence Pugh). It's Amy who falls through the ice on the pond and almost drowns, after a fit of jealousy over Jo's possible burgeoning romance between Laurie (Timothée Chalamet), the boy next door turned eventual romantic lead.
To her credit, Gerwig attempts to flesh out Amy's character by developing the romance with Laurie, while they're sojourning in Paris. But Chalamet is completely miscast as an almost androgynous waif. Earlier, Gerwig stages a ridiculous ""jig"" between Jo and Laurie which only serves to underscore how young Chalamet appears and how little masculinity he projects.
Indeed, the male leads (Laurie and his tutor John Brooke) here are part and parcel of conventional 19th century romantic figures which a modern scenarist can do little with. Gerwig again pushes back with another anachronistic scene as Amy explains why she is forced to marry the rich Laurie (it all has to do with the ""system"" that prevents women from becoming independent and owning their own property). The preaching just proves to be a little extra ""padding"" for characters who have little to do (Gerwig does try to develop Laurie as a ne'er do well a bit, but eventually must fall back on Alcott's scenes of domestic bliss).
Such traits also extend to the other March sisters, Meg (Emma Watson) and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). Meg of course represents the 19th century ideal-the woman who seeks motherhood as fulfillment. Alcott however infuses the character with some dignity as Meg marries a man of no means. The March mother Marmee (Laura Dern) is continually trying to teach the girls to marry for love and not money!
That leaves the doomed Beth, the sensitive musician, who succumbs to scarlet fever three quarters of the way through the film. It's a thankless role and Gerwig's treatment brings no tears (the quick cut to the cemetery is not enough to move us). Check out a young Margaret O'Brien in the 1949 version-despite the sentimentality, she somehow manages to be quite affecting.
Structurally, Beth's death signals the end of the childhood bond between the sisters-but a harbinger of changes and new things to come for all the principals.
The supporting players bring quite a bit of color to Alcott's tale but here, unfortunately, none of the actors ""get it."" Special dishonorable mention should surprisingly go to Meryl Streep who appears to have no idea how to play Aunt Marsh who really should be a truly comic figure (exemplified by the crochety old maids found in the '33 and '49 films).
Jo's rejection of Laurie perhaps sets Alcott's novel apart from many of the typical melodramatic novels of the time. But today there's nothing particularly revolutionary about it. Jo ending up with her intellectual equal, Professor Bhaer, proves perhaps to be far more shocking than the idea of unrequited love with Laurie.
While Professor Bhaer is supposed to be German, Gerwig chooses the handsome French actor, Louis Garrel, to play him. Gerwig has been quoted as indicating that choosing the handsome Garrel was intentional-to show the denouement is not to be taken seriously since Alcott herself reveled in being single and was forced to put in the happy ending in her book as a Deus ex machina.
Much has been said of Gerwig's decision to present the main events of the narrative as a flashback. Simply put, it's confusing. While successful in showing the early camaraderie between the sisters, much of the humor from the original novel is lost.
In addition to the updated added feminist spin, Gerwig also remains hemmed in by the novel's implicit limitations which include melodramatic romance and the patriarchal nature of 19th century society."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,6/10,"The trend these days seems to be to hate on remakes. I have no problem with remakes and let me tell you why: they bring stories that would otherwise be lost forever to a new generation. Because of the 2019 version of 'Little Women' how many people will see this movie (and perhaps consequently read the book) that otherwise never would have? A lot. Now my issues with remakes come when they fail to do two things. Firstly, they need to put their own twist on things (even if only in a minor way), but there has to be something that makes their version unique. 'A Star Is Born' (what I consider to be the best remade film of the last 20 years) for example created its own music and changed the story up in a few places. Secondly, you have to evolve your film to a new generation. This second point is where the film falls downs a little.The fact is that as great of a story as 'Little Women' may be considered to be, with every year that passes it becomes harder and harder to relate to it. If this book or screenplay was written fresh tomorrow it would be thrown out the window. Therefore you have to do everything you can as a filmmaker to bring the story into the modern world (while still telling it in the time it was set in - I believe a version of 'Little Women' actually did try setting itself in modern times and failed miserably). To her credit I think Greta Gerwig did a really good job at trying to achieve this, but she was fighting an uphill battle. If they make this film again in 25 years I will be very interested to see how it is perceived.The film has been nominated for six Academy Awards at the ceremony tomorrow. It is up for Best Picture, although I fear it will struggle in that category. The Academy doesn't usually like to give the nod to remakes and I don't think it could compete with the better films even if they did. Saoirse Ronan has been nominated for Actress in a Lead Role. She is becoming quite a regular in that category and I'm sure she will win one day, but again I don't think she can win it this year for 'Little Women'.Florence Pugh has been nominated for Actress in a Supporting Role. She has a tremendous amount of screen-time for a ""supporting actress"" which usually would give her a big advantage, but ironically I think she will lose out to her co-star in 'Little Women' Laura Dern who has been nominated for another film 'Marriage Story'. On a side-note I believe this was only Pugh's second strongest performance of 2019. I would have liked to see her nominated for 'Midsommar', although I'm just happy she was nominated at all. She deserves it. She was the stand-out actress in 'Little Women' in my mind.'Little Women' is a well put together little package, and if this is the version of the story this generation comes to know then I think they could do far worse. Time is running low for this story to be told though I fear."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,7/10,"I thought I was going to dislike it but I was wrong. It was ok. I like stories about that time period as I'm interested to see how people lived during that time. If I'm reading the credits correctly the movie is not an adaption of the novel Little Women but more of an adaption of a book about the woman who wrote Little Women which seems autobiographical. I never read ether book obviously but for me the movie does feel like they are cramming a lot of the book into this picture and it's no surprise to me after I was reminded in the credits that Greta Gerwig directed this film. It has that Mumblecore feel, but I think I enjoyed that tone more in her other movies like Frances Ha and Ladybird.Here, too much was happening. Too much stuff that I did not care about. I was into Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, and it did not hurt she was the main focus of the movie. I was into Florence Pugh as Amy March who had some cool moments, and that's about it. anything else that happen lost my attention slowly, but still, A little too happy but not as bad as I was expecting."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,,"Writer/director Greta Gerwig tries her hand at Alcott's timeless, semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story by spotlighting two different time periods in the lives of the indefatigable March sisters, with first-rate casting featuring Ronan as the free-spirited, aspiring storyteller Jo, Watson as the fashionable, domestic Meg, Pugh as the economical, attention-seeking Amy, Scanlen as the quiet, musical Beth, and their journey from childhood to young adulthood as they pursue their individual hopes and dreams during the 1860s. Even though it isn't a direct page to screen adaptation, and the overlapping of timelines can be taxing at times, Gerwig is able to stage many powerful scenes that explore the all-important themes of sexism, loneliness, friendship, love, and unbreakable familial bonds thanks to four fabulous leading ladies, and quality work from Chalamet, Cooper, and Streep who are invaluable in key supporting roles. ***"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,9/10,"10/10 - Saoirse Ronan once again proves she is an actress of the highest caliber and her supporting cast wasn't too shabby either (Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Meryl Streep, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, and Laura Dern)"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,6/10,"I saw ""Little Women"", starring Saoirse Ronan-Lady Bird, Hanna; Emma Watson-Beauty and the Beast_2017, the Harry Potter movies; Florence Pugh-Fighting With My Family, The Commuter and Timothee Chalamet-Lady Bird, Homeland_tv.
First, let me start by saying that I am not the target audience for this movie-my wife wanted to see it. If you are a fan of the book or any previous incarnations-I think there have been several movies made-you might enjoy it more than I did. It takes place during the American Civil War and follows a family with 4 daughters, all independent and talented. Saoirse is a writer, Emma is an actress and Florence is a painter-the other sister is a musician. Their father is off fighting in the war. Timothee is a neighbor that takes a liking to a couple of the sisters. He really likes Saorise but she doesn't like him the same way so he goes after another one, Florence. The story jumps back and forth through different time periods and it is a little confusing at times. Telling the story of the sisters and their trying to make it in a man's world hits a lot of feminist issues that are still around today. There are a few cameos, including Laura Dern, Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep.
It's rated ""PG"" for thematic elements and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
I wouldn't buy this one on DVD but if you are a fan, you might like it better than I did. It would be alright as a rental."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,9/10,". . . for such alleged crimes as belittling U.S. Law Enforcement, fomenting Civil Unrest and resisting American Regime Change, as if this movie studio were the proverbial ""elephant in the room,"" or something. But personally, I found no evidence of any such ill intent boiling to the surface of Sony's LITTLE WOMEN. Rather than remaining faithful to a fairly staid and hackneyed core text, the Sony version of LITTLE WOMEN seems to insert the scripts for all previous film adaptations of this story into a giant blender before pushing the ""Puree"" button. (The resulting smoothie is so tasty that the ladies sitting in front of me expressed a wish for the LITTLE WOMEN crew to tackle the Scriptures next, and blend a more palatable Pablum of all those Biblical epics from the 1900s.) Of course, the insertion of spicy new material into the musty original tale helps a lot. (Take, for example, ""Aunt March's"" suggestion that ""Jo"" become a bordello madam at 35:45--obviously, this is NOT Grandma's LITTLE WOMEN!) Unlike Harvey W.'s period pieces such as SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, ladies are NOT confronted by gratuitous nudity in Sony's remake of the Alcott book. Instead, the focus here remains squarely upon dollars and cents, which is as American as uniformed young girls selling their cookies."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,10/10,"When I think of Katharine Hepburn's Jo, in George Cukor's delectable ""Little Women"" of 1933, what I remember is not her chatter, as raucous as a raven, but her impromptu fencing match in a drawing room, or the galumphing (moving in a clumsy, ponderous, or noisy manner; inelegant) rumpus she makes when, at her mother's call, she clatters down the stairs.Ronan is less loud than Hepburn, but she has inherited some of her hustle and bustle, and anyone who admired Ronan in the title role of Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" (2017) will note a similar fixity of purpose in her portrayal of Jo. Katharine Hepburn is a very hard act to follow but Ronan exudes the role brilliantly.In the latest film, Amy is played by Florence Pugh, whose star, from ""Lady Macbeth"" (2016) to ""Midsommar"" (2019), has continued to rocket. (Next spring, she will battle through ""Black Widow,"" as Scarlett Johansson's sister. A slight change of tone from the Marches.) Pugh is twenty-three but seems older, with her frightening poise and the pass-me-a-smoke throatiness of her voice, and while the innocence of Amy, equipped with long blond braids, is a stretch for her, the willful tenacity presents no problem. Florence Pugh's Oscar-nominated portrayal of Amy March was a stand-out. Her performance is tremendous.The other actors who complete the March quartet--Emma Watson as Meg, and Eliza Scanlen as the vulnerable Beth are perfectly cast. Both were women are superb in their roles.Laura Dern, who plays Marmee and Meryl Streep as Aunt March, Laurie (Timothée Chalamet),and his sad grandfather (Chris Cooper), Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel) round out the notable ensemble.Gerwig's adaptation is not chronological: to and fro she darts across the years, chopping the plot into flashbacks and flash-forwards, and keeping us on our toes. Gerwig isn't afraid to let her audience work a little. She trusts our intelligence and our curiosity, and also her own command of the medium. It kept the story fresh and I applaud her storytelling. Brava Greta !Little Women is made with so much heart, love and enthusiasm both behind and in front of the camera that even the deeply sad scenes still fill you with joy and longing. It's an explosion of emotions, from loss to love to everything in between. Gerwig's smart, delightful film seems on its way to becoming a classic.Director: Greta Gerwig

LITTLE WOMEN,4 October 2020,4/10,"OK, so, I am not intimately familiar with the novel(s). I want to read them, but because I struggle with literature above a certain age, I thought maybe this could be a good starting point to help me access the novel later.I saw this with my mother who has read the book several times and even she had reservations about it.I don't really have the competence to give an in depth review of this movie even if I just take it on board as a movie and not in terms of how it translates the novel to the screen.But what we found quite bemusing was how they basically do the exact opposite of what was done for the recent adaptation of IT: they take not only Alcott's more famous book but splice it with the first sequel ""Good Wives"". Upon research I have discovered these were originally published as one novel in two parts but here is Britain they were two totally different volumes; two different novels so maybe I was a bit hard on the movie just now but it was still bizarre.One thing I do feel confident in condemning is the movie's commitment to a non-linear narrative that certainly was never used by Alcott. Very early on you see ""7 years earlier"" which is not ideal film making but whatever. What really gets to me is that that is the last time they do that. I didn't realise they were switching back and forth in time until over half way through because the narrative gave very little indication. The girls do not age physically at all in these 7 year jumps.I get the strong impression that this movie was tailored for people who had read the book, in fact, those who were intimately familiar to it, leaving people like me who were very willing to hear what this movie had say, high and dry. Its confusing...The acting is a mixed bag. I think the sisters are applying very naturalistic acting to very stylized period literary dialogue and it makes it very hard to lose yourself in the story. If they'd approached it more like a '40s movie the whole thing would have worked better.On another note: I can never pick nuances in these movies. I thought Jo was a tomboy because she doesn't seem to be one here. But apparently in the 19th century any female with messy hair was a tomboy. Well I guess that settles it...So, although I admit that maybe my perspective isn't the most reliable here, this came across to me as muddled, careless and fanfictiony."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,10/10,"There will be mild spoilers in what follows.Anyway, a bit like the Irishman I wasn't expecting a ton from this film. After all it is like the 5th adaptation of the novel and there are only so many ways that you can approach the material. Fortunately, Gerwig manages to find a couple of big ideas that really make this telling of the tale fresh and different. They are first she bifurcated the book's timeline (roughly where the book itself is divided) and had the second half of the book run in parallel with the first half. The first scenes you see are, more or less, the middle of the book (i.e. Jo in New York). You bounce back and forth from the start to the end until the film end lines up with the book's end. The climax of the first half of the book occurs as the second act climax of the movie etc. This structure not only gives the this film a distinct feel to it but it really highlights the rhythm of domestic life that is such a cornerstone of the novel. Little Women at its core is a coming of age tale and I think playing with the timeline was a wonderful way to refocus on the book's coming of age themes. Second, it is has been awhile since I read the book but Jo being the writer of the story you are watching (if I recall correctly in the second half of the book Jo ends up writing only the first half) is really beefed up and made central. It ends up creating a narrative ambiguity around the Under the Umbrella material (i.e. Jo's marriage) in which it is not clear if it occurred or if the material is fiction that Jo had to insert to sell the book. I think the most natural way of looking at it is Jo does eventually marry Bhaer but not how it happens with Jo chasing him down at the trains station. It happens outside the narrative you see. Regardless, this bit of narrative ambiguity helps sell the story beat while reinforces the theme about the limited choices women face. It is a wonderful idea to bring a different take on the material that is keeping with aspects of the novel.The script is the best part of the movie. Indeed there is not a single word I would change but the best scene in the film is Jo facing doubt about writing Little Women because it is not ""grand"" enough. There is a brief argument with Amy. Amy ends talking about grandness is in the writing not the reception. That too me is really pointed subtext about how ""feminine"" films a degraded because they are feminine; you feel Gerwig's doubts and frustrations in that scene.The film becomes truly great through because Gerwig as director doesn't lean into the inventions of her script. It would not be difficult to re-edit the film in a straightforward way because of how classical the film is shot. The resulting film would work as lesser version sure but it work. There is deep rich irony between the script's poststructural sensibilities and Gerwig channeling Ford and other golden age of Hollywood. The film looks illustrative and the compositions are jaw dropping in their visual lushness. The film never feels stagey but it is eye popping in its visuals. (Hence why I think it should win art direction and costumes)And of course the acting is wonderful from all involved. I think this is career best work from everyone.I simply adore this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 April 2020,1/10,"This film start with a girl ""Jo"", bring her writing to a publisher to publish, another girl ""Amy"" painting, and she met a guy ""Laurie"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Jo writing a book entitle ""Little Women"" to be publish, and the book is about Jo and her three sister(Amy, Beth, and Meg)! Entire film quite long, and full of boring conversation! The overuse of the dancing scene, and overuse of the confusing flashback scene, also make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Jo and Laurie saving Amy at the frozen lake! Barely touching scene is, grandfather of Laurie ""Mr. Laurence"", giving the piano to Beth as a gift! At the end, Beth die, Jo marry to Friedrich, Amy marry to Laurie, and Meg marry with John! Jo watching her book publishing! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,7/10,"New version of Louisa M Alcott's classic novel about the 4 March sisters looking for love and a substantial life in 19th Century Massachusetts.Greta Gerwig has produced another fine film cleverly incorporating modern themes around feminism and equality within a story structure that moves away from the standard linear approach and puts events around the lives of the sisters in a weaving structure of overlaid set pieces and flashbacks. This all works very cleverly without messing the source material about and plays out superbly by a stellar cast with surely a number of awards beckoning, particularly for Florence Pugh."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,9/10,"Little Women: Writer/Director Greta Gerwig puts her stamp on this adaptation from the opening scene. Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) is obviously Louisa May Alcott as she sells a story to the publisher Dashwood (Tracy Letts), her clothing is more obviously masculine, unusual for the times, even a tad too hipsterish, in keeping more with the way Alcott would have dressed. Later the fourth wall disappears totally as Dashwood and Jo negotiate the ending of Little Women. The complex triangle between Jo, Amy March (Florence Pugh) and Laurie Laurence (Timothy Chalamet) is deftly handled. Jo's reticence/ love towards Laurie is expressed through gestures and facial expressions rather words most of the time. Amy is the mercurial yet well-meaning ingenue, who usurps Jo and goes to Paris with Aunt March (Meryl Streep) who portrays her role icily, the sort of aunt you'd like to leave locked in an attic. Overall a joy to watch. 9/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 February 2020,8/10,"So I am giving this movie an 8 even though I didn't really enjoy it. I don't feel like giving it a low raing--I wanted to love it, but I was kind of bored most of the way through. It was well done--the sets and costumes were great to look at, and the performances were lively. My problem was that I really couldn't follow the plot. It jumped around in time--at least I think that was what was happening--and I was confused about when things took place. I am curious to know if this is how the story unfolds in the book, or if it is more linear, and I have a feeling it might not have exactly the same ending. So now I have to go read as a result of spending the money to see this at the theater."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 April 2020,1/10,"Extremely feministic film with unlikeable characters. The whole story is so boring, the movie is overlong, all cliches and feminism only happen. They try to show independent females, but they are the worst kind you'd expect - narcissistic, mean, jealous, annoying and selfish. I will dare to say this is the worst movie of all time. I don't understand the praise it got. If you want a great feminist movie with strong characters watch Thelma & Louise. This is pure stereotypical cliche garbage."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 January 2020,9/10,"Acting, costumes and set were all excellent. Great character development. A rare beautiful family film in the era of materialism. Nice."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 February 2020,10/10,"The perennial favorite & Oscar nominee for Best Picture is the latest from wunderkind director & scribe Greta Gerwig (she's also been nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay) is the 8th screen version of Louise May Alcott's young feminine yarn about the March sisters trying to make their way through love, marriage & life during the late 1800's. Leading the pack is Saoirse Ronan (returning to work w/Gerwig after their Lady Bird collab), Emma Watson, Florence Pugh (nominated for Best Supporting Actress) & Eliza Scanlen w/Laura Dern playing Marmie (already nominated for Marriage Story) & heartthrob du jour Timothee Chalamet playing the sisters neighbor & sometime suitor. Telling the story in a non-linear fashion (scenes vacillate from the past to the present & back again) invigorates the text which makes the images come alive giving the audience an additional motive to keep up w/the proceedings as the incidents come hard & fast but never at the expense of the richness being displayed. Muscular support from Meryl Streep as the March's well-to-do aunt, Chris Cooper as Chalamet's grandfather, Louis Garrell (I remember him from Bertolucci's The Dreamers) as Ronan's literary balm & another scene stealing turn from Tracy Letts as the irrepressible book publisher."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,8/10,"Thank God Timothee Chalamet didn't have goatie like Bale in Anderson's version. Also, Gerwig snubbed so hard!!! Todd Philips who?"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,5/10,"This is one of those movies that's wonderfully acted, beautifully shot, a wonderfully portrayed period piece and yet I couldn't care less about it. By the numbers, this should be a pure knock out but it all feels so blah, predictable and... Repetitive to me. I feel like I've seen this all before and while this one is wonderfully polished it's still the same story told for the (a quick Google search tells me) 18th time.Also, the way this jumps back and forth in time really drags it down for me. I don't necessarily want giant titlecards announcing the year each time but for the most part there's no super clear distinction as to what's happening when and in relation to what until after the scenes have ended.If repetition doesn't bother you though, if you don't mind seeing the same thing again as long as it's pretty and well acted then this may work out great for you. I was just bored, which is really frustrating when there's THAT MUCH talent on screen."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,8/10,"It's a classic novel and remake movie, the 2.5 hours is not boring at all. It's totally feminine movie about Jo March of her career and love life as well as her siblings. But if it's best picture and best actress consideration, it will be not a winner for sure. 1917 or joker must be the leading from my perspective given the behind meaning and awesome production. For acting side, Saoirse wasn't as good as Scarlett in marriage story. She just act right for the role she played and the space of acting in Little Women is really limited. Scarlett should be more convincing to be best actress."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,10/10,"Fantastically acted, written, directed, and marvelously entertaining, Little Women just may be one of the best book to film adaptations ever made. The cast is impressive and all play their part quite beautifully, especially the film's main leads Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet. The film is touching in so many ways, and bound to make your eyes water on more than a few occasions. Greta Gerwig clearly deserves recognition for her again brilliant direction and her adaptation of the original source material is clearly the best take on it to date. The film's cinematography also feels perfect for the tone of the film, bu never feeling too dreary or too dreamy, and all together sweet without being too corny. The pacing is masterfully done, and the film is altogether incredibly enjoyable. The emotion throughout the movie both feels raw and real, its touching and funny, sad and inspiring, and all together makes for one of the most brilliant films of the year, and even the decade.
My Rating: 10/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"If we can get a new version of A Christmas Carol every other year, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get a remake of ""Little Women"" once every twenty-five years. I really think this story is just so delightful that it would be nigh impossible to mess up; it's innocent, funny, well-directed and shot, and best of all, it fills you with a sense of warmth and gratitude. It's no wonder this film came out on Christmas day. It's the perfect holiday film."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"Little Women is an incredible period drama that's funny, emotional and extremely heartwarming throughout. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen and Timothée Chalamet all give incredible performances and have perfect chemistry. Laura Dern and Chris Cooper are both great and Meryl Streep is excellent in her small part.
Greta Gerwig's direction is also incredible and the film is beautifully filmed. It's well paced and jumps between two different timelines effectively. The music by Alexandre Desplat is amazing."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,,"Lot of messy scene after scene, making your head spin and dizzy. There seems no focus on anything except those girls' meaningless conversations among them, blah, blah, not even one quiet moment through out the whole movie. Got a headache trying to watch it but simply couldn't bear further. These girls are annoying and shallow, even with the ambitious and strong-minded one who is the main character like to be a writer. No genuine chemistry among these girls, only felt forced staged scene after scene, loud and random, no focus, no depth. Bad casting job, especially the young male ones. A mimic Jane Austin crap in American Hollywood style but without any charm or interesting points. A totally unnecessary remake of an outdated boring novel that could do without."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 September 2020,9/10,Little Women proves that Gerwig's directorial debut Lady Bird was no fluke - firmly confirming that she is a great filmmaker; a force to be reckoned with. It shines a new light on a classic story that retains the themes and drama that made it so.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"GRADE: A-THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Greta Gerwig's film adaptation makes for a wonderful moviegoing experience not to be missed.JIM'S REVIEW: Louisa May Alcott would have been overjoyed with Greta Gerwig's masterful adaptation of her classic novel, Little Women. Ms. Gerwig's has captured the essence of the beloved tale and updated it for today's modern sensibilities. She has created a lavish film that skillfully recreates the March sisterhood with stunning production values and an excellent cast.The story is well known, so I will gingerly dance over the plot. I will say that the film, as with the novel, depicts a devoted family in 1868 trying to survive hard times after the Civil War. With Father still away at the battlefront, Mother Marmee looks after her four loving daughters: Meg, a down-to-earth type, Amy, an artistic but self-centered lady, quiet musically-talented Beth, and the central character, Jo, an aspiring authoress and modern-thinking woman of the times. This complicated story follows their separate lives and spans a number of years.Director / writer Ms. Gerwig's is at the top of her game. The film is gorgeous in its visuals and outstanding production values. Alexandre Desplat's romantic music score sets the lyrical mood throughout the film and Yorick Le Saux's cinematography is stunning. Add to that, Jess Gonchor's wonderful production design and Jacqueline Durran's exquisite costumes which not only show a range of styles that comment on her sisters' personalities (from bohemian to straight-laced to the latest in Paris fashions) while also staying in period garb. As director, Ms. Gerwig allows time to distinguish each character's individual traits and their internal relationships with others. She shows the obstacles in being a woman during this era and never becomes overly preachy or feminist about it. She creates insightful dialog and conversations to tell their plight and ambitions with such concise craftsmanship and care.Her screenplay does not follow the linear storytelling of the Alcott novel, and jumps from past to present. At times, this film structure gets a tad confusing, so that the moviegoer needs to latch onto changes in hair style, dress, or setting as a barometer to the timeline of events. But this is a minor annoyance. The script is one of the best film adaptations from an original source. It does condense some of the sub-plots about Meg's and Beth's life while emphasizing the sibling rivalry between Jo and Amy for more dramatic purposes.Flawlessly acted by a cast that truly impresses, Saoirse Ronan portrays Jo as a feisty and head-strung heroine. She lights up the screen. The actress brilliantly conveys her character's self-doubt and determination about her writing. She handles the emotional highs and lows with a rare subtlety. It's a commanding performance that deserves award attention. Her playful relationship with Teddy, charmingly played by Timothée Chalamet, is one of the film's delight. Their chemistry together gives the film a deeper meaning and only enhances an already outstanding screenplay. Both Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, in their smaller roles as Jo's sisters, are very good. Most impressive is Florence Pugh in her larger role as the mercurial Amy. Her speech about the inequality of women's right is a standout and very well delivered. Strong support comes from an all-star ensemble that includes Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper,Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, James Norton, Louis Garrel, Jayne Houdyshell, and Laura Dern, giving a lovely performance as the matriarch of the March household.But it is Ms. Gerwig who deserves most of the accolades in bringing Little Women to the big screen. She expresses the yearning and passions of first love, the joys of adolescence, the sadness and heartache of life's disappointments, and beauty of the creative spirit through her words and vision. Little Women is one of the year's best films."

This tale of the classic title accomplishes the goal of bringing the classic tale back to the big screen, and balances the classiness with the fire that comes this day and age. Great settings recreated the culture and to have the unique twists of flashbacks to help establish the writing and characters was fantastic for me. The acting brings it out even further and is probably the biggest selling point of the film for me. Yet, the main limitation for me is that the movie starts to lose its balance the farther the film goes in. I would have liked to have seen more of the characters balanced in, while also not getting too lost in the new presentation style and balancing the story amongst others. If it ran another hour, it might have been the perfect time, but hey, a three-hour movie is a lot to ask this day and age. My scores are:Drama/Romance: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 April 2020,8/10,This movie was surprisingly good. I liked it a good bit.
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,10/10,"This was my favourite film of the season, primarily because of the artistry of Greta Gerwig and the skill of the performers. Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson, were brilliant as I expected them to be, but, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen were new discoveries for me (and I have already begun to enthusiastically follow their filmography). Laura Dean brought a gravitas to the nurturing, generous Marmee that deepened the character. When I saw that Meryl Streep was bringing her legacy to a relatively small role, I knew there were great expectations of this production (I later found out that both she and Saoirse, announced to Greta Gerwig, pre-production, that they WERE going to play those roles). Greta Gerwig is a profoundly intelligent writer and filmmaker, and she attracts equally gifted people with whom to collaborate. This production is rich with insights into the characters that come Louisa May Alcott's own life and borrows from some of her other works. Those who follow me know that I chat with other movie goers as I leave a movie, and, of the 6 people I spoke to, 4 gave the film a straight up 10. Two women (who watched the film together) were confused because they missed the cues as to shifts in the time line, so here's the scoop - the movie begins in the middle of the book, with Jo in New York scrambling to be published. Only once, is a flashback labelled as such, but, the movie continually flips back and forth between the Jo's present and her past. As her present sparks themes from her childhood, we are transported back to those memories. Greta Gerwig is very deliberate in how she places her cuts, long before shooting begins, so don't miss her deliberate artistry. I've already gushed on too long, so I'll end by rating this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Classic Americana Drama}"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,8/10,"Of course this is the kind of movie that could only been directed by a woman. Lovely images, lovely girls, lovely scenes. And besides the true merit of the film it was time to see a movie without explosions, bombs, cuffs, kicks or any kind of blows. There is just only love, friendship, sentiments and nice feelings. Of course this movie portrays in a very realistic way another era whose uses and behaviours have nothing to do with the present ones. This is the story of four sisters and their mother whose relationship with each other reveals a friendly family. despite the fact that they are very different from each other in their thoughts, ideas, preferences and habits. One of the best movie of 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 May 2020,8/10,"Little Women leaves you in a whirlwind of emotions but in a good way. Greta Gerwig's second directorial feature tells the coming-of-age of four sisters (Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth) living through the aftermath of the American Civil War. Late into the film, Jo asks Amy how domestic struggles and joys of women could make an exciting book. The answer to that question is what Greta Gerwig (who has also written the screenplay) offers us in Little Women, a wonderful movie that will have you beaming throughout.The story keeps jumping back and forth (seven years), detailing significant events in the lives of the sisters. There's love, there's sisterhood, there's Christmas (and its icy landscapes), there's sickness, there's death, and there's the triumph of one's story resonating with others. Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh's inflammable chemistry stands out in their scenes. Emma Watson seems to have come of age (in reality) gracefully. Cinematographer Yorick Le Saux adds an alluring glow for the portions depicting the past while keeping it raw in the present, as realities begin to hit hard.A particular stretch really caught me off guard. In the past, the family is shown to reunite and celebrate Christmas, a scene that's abruptly
intercut with the present where an important character passes away.
For a film that focuses on its women, the men too are neatly written and given adequate texturing. I liked Tracy Letts' arrogantly honest depiction of Mr. Dashwood. The costume design is exceptional and the Academy Award for it, rightly deserved. The 1860s setting is masterfully executed and the non-linear storytelling style put to good effect.An extra half star goes for the climax scene which beautifully captures the details of printing books in those times (that's right, using a printing press!). It's where the narratives of Gerwig's film and author L.M Alcott's life (which it's loosely based on) seamlessly blend to create a satisfying conclusion. Little Women will urge you to closely follow the work of Greta Gerwig and Saoirse Ronan, if Lady Bird already hadn't."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,6/10,"Little WomenYet another adaptation of Ms Alcott's adolescent female homespun potboiler this time getting the full Hollywood treatment. The whole thing was treated with an almost biblical reverence, American classic agreed, on a par with Austen and Brontë absolutely not, what an absurd assertion.... lol!Much was good, much was more than problematic and the mixing of Ms Alcott's life with Jo March, a literary creation albeit loosely biographical, was perhaps a liberty too far.What was goodThe general atmosphere of the film was great and the stylist did a fine job.The acting on the whole was strong, Saoirse Ronan played it safe after that Scottish abomination last year. Her American accent was impeccable but she just seems wholly unable to do humour. Florence Pugh as Amy was a fabulous scene stealer we all loved, quite a talent. Emma Watson, whilst pleasing on the eye, broke into a strange Roedean accent on a least two occasions.Timothée Chalamet played an excellent fop and Meryl Streep played herself.The musical score was a delight however Beethoven rarely reduces anyone to tears with its Germanic regularity, should this not have been Chopin as the novel appeared in 1868.What was badly handledThe chopping of linear story and time shifting the viewer was bewildering and really quite unnecessary. I was giddy!There were several scenes ruined by excessive freneticism, we were meant to experience, by proxy, the hubbub of sibling rivalry within a domestic setting I just wanted them to grow up and shut up.The first half of the movie just did not breath and there was insufficient character development and then the second half became baggy and ponderous.Overall I enjoyed this flawed movie but it was instantly forgettable 6/10. No awards here, except perhaps for Florence Pugh, I am afraid due to the strange insertion of current political influences and a great deal of self indulgence by the Director that ruined a perfectly good story.I must add, why oh why have they cast two English, one Irish and one Aussie as the March girls, surely America can find some Americans to act in an American classic.....duh!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 October 2020,9/10,"This film is one my favorite movies of 2019. It has great ensemble cast. The costumes and sets were excellent. The acting was exceptional. The cinematography and scenery were brilliant. It has a very touching and beautiful story. However, it can get very confusing, at times you can't really tell between the future and the past, they could've used a color filter or something to differentiate them. Other than that, everything's pretty tight."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,10/10,"Just saw this movie and I'm just completely blown away. Greta Gerwig of Ladybird is a genius. I can't believe how modern this felt even though it was a period piece. I've never read the book and I don't think I've ever seen any adaptations of this but I may actually read it. I just found the story of the March sisters absolutely compelling. A story of love, loss feminism in a time of great inequality, coming of age and so much more. The movie speaks volumes to any who would see it but especially women. The movie is not preachy by any means and I was surprised at how entertaining it was funny, sad, emotionally resonant and completely engaging. The performances are just stellar across the board. Laura Dern is solid in a subtle turn as the mother. Florence Pugh of last year's Midsommar adds another great performance to her roster and Emma Watson has truly never been better. Meryl Streep is also great in a smaller role and Timothy Chalamet of Call me by your name adds another mesmerizing turn. But it's Saorise Ronan as usual who steals the show. Her Jo is modern, inspired, layered and passionate. Everyone has amazing chemistry together and the film is just one of the best I've ever seen. From the inspired cinematography like the scene on the beach with Jo and Beth to the effective score and confident, inspired direction it's truly a masterpiece I didn't see coming. Definitely the best film I've seen so far out of 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 September 2020,1/10,Not my type of movie. This movie should sit in the back of my bathroom cabinet and never come out.Should go there now.Don't watch it1 star
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,9/10,"""Little women"" was written by Louisa May Alcott in 1868-1869 and is, like ""A star is born"", filmed many times. Well known are the 1933 version (George Cukor) and the 1949 version (Mervyn LeRoy).One of the reasons for me to see the film was that I had missed the well received debut of director Greta Gerwig ""Laybird"" (2017).The film is about four sisters growing up, and has feminist undertones. Feminist because all of the sisters have ambitions of their own. All of the sisters practice some form of art (music, acting, writing or painting). In the meantime their relatives keep telling them that the only way for a woman to earn a living is to marry a wealthy man. The publisher ot the girl who writes keeps telling her that at the end of the story the girl must be married. Undertones because the men the girls meet are much to nice and open minded to develop a militant form of feminism.The real strength of the film is the delicate balance it keeps between romance and family life. Yes the girls fall in love, sometimes with the same man, but romance never becomes an obsession to them, like it is for the sisters in ""Belle epoque"" (1992, Fernando Trueba). Their mutual relations are always as important as their boyfriends, if not more important.Another theme is the contrast between everyday hapiness and compelling drama. A hint at this theme is already given in the undertitle of the film (own your story) and further elaborated upon in the charachter of the writing sister Jo. She initially writes dramatic short story's to earn a living but only gets success when she writes down the story of her family. In spite of their ambitions in their respective art forms, neither sister (with the possible exception of Jo) really breaks through. A star is not born.The cast of ""Little women"" is amazing. In the older roles (mother, aunt) we see established stars such as Laura Dern and Meryl Streep. But also in the roles of the sisters we see some upcoming stars. Jo is played by Saoirse Ronan (""Brooklyn"", 2015) and Amy is played by Florence Pugh (""Lady MacBeth"" , 2016)."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 January 2020,8/10,"Lady Bird was great back in 2017, and on a recent rewatch, was somehow even better. A great directorial debut is always going to build anticipation for a follow-up effort, and thankfully, writer-director Greta Gerwig has hit it out of the park again, although with a very different effort that truly establishes her and her debut film as much more than a one-off or fluke.Make no mistake though- despite being of a similar quality, this is a very different film to Lady Bird. It shares some cast members, and the editing style is similar at times too... I guess they're also concerned with young characters, but this one's set a century and a half earlier and is generally a more serious affair.Coming into this, I was not familiar with the source material, nor am I much of a fan of period dramas. I was sceptical I'd like this, despite really enjoying Lady Bird and seeing how great the reviews for this were. So I was pleasantly surprised by how moving, entertaining, and beautifully shot this ended up being.Most of the performances are absolutely fantastic. Wouldn't be surprised to see nominations for both Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh (who's has a fantastic year considering how good she also was in Midsommar). Emma Watson is perhaps less impressive, but she's far from bad, and her character is one that's perhaps more reserved and less emotional, the story providing less opportunities for more outward, showy acting, so I suppose in that way she's still quite good too.I understand the non-linear editing here isn't present in the original novel, and I really loved it here. It's compelling and punctuates the emotional depth of many scenes, as they're contrasted and compared in interesting way with similar or different scenes, appearing in the past or future. It's never confusing either, largely thanks to a noticeable but not garish use of saturation for past scenes and non-saturated colours in the ""present"" scenes.The only way I can fault the movie isn't even really a criticism- it's me not loving this genre, and therefore occasionally feeling slightly unengaged and not always terribly interested. Like I said, I usually avoid period dramas for this reason. Olden day problems, frustratingly repressed characters, snotty, upper-class characters, trivial squabbles and issues.... thankfully, none of those things are really present here. By the time the film finished, I felt good inside, and surprisingly moved, not at all regretting the two and a bit hours I'd spent in the cinema.An 8/10 may seem low, but if I got a lot out of this movie, the people who are usually more interested in this sort of genre are likely going to absolutely love it. With this and Lady Bird under her belt, all I can say is that I can't wait to see what Gerwig makes next."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,9/10,"Movie afternoon with Gertie.Have never read the book and came in blind. It made made me laugh, made me cry. And looks amazing to boot. This isn't reverential to the text, more focused on capturing the mind and spirit of these women. Boldly the story is told in non-chronological order, which really worked for me. The moving back-and-forth in time highlights the emotional cycles of the sisters.The casting is heaven-sent - they just keep appearing and all arriving with their 'A game'. But Pugh once again steals the show. She oozes Amy's vanity and selfishness, but also shows her intelligence and resilience.An intelligent film is one that makes us show empathy towards people's imperfections. This is a beautiful, all-encompassing cinematic achievement. Who wouldn't want to spend time in the March household?"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 August 2020,7/10,"In the seventh film adaptation of the novel by Louisa May Alcott: Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) is the second of four young daughters living in rural Massachusetts during the 1860s. An aspiring writer (clearly a stand-in for Alcott), she juggles her ambitions, her wishes to help her family when in need, and a romantic life all while being determined to have an independence untraditional for females in that era . The lives of Jo's sisters are also chronicled: Meg (Emma Watson) has acting talent and dreams of marrying and raising children; Amy (Florence Pugh) is an aspiring artist; and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is a talented pianist. The March family also deals with financial challenges (despite living in a huge, beautiful house) while the patriarch is away fighting in the Civil War.Using the non-linear approach, there are many back-and-forth time shifts that are sometimes jolting, making the film seem more like a series of related segments rather than a united whole. But director/writer Greta Gerwig has orchestrated a beautifully, moving piece with lighting, music, set designs, exterior shots, and costumes that are all at the highest level, wonderfully re-creating an era long gone by.Ronan is very powerful as the lead and lives up to the demands of a very deep, complex character. She is at her best in a confrontation scene with a potential lover played by Timothée Chalamet. While most performances and characterizations are quite good, Jo's older sister Meg (Watson) and Meg's love interest, John (James Norton) have little chemistry and occasionally come off as bland although their individual performances are good otherwise. Other roles are played by such stalwarts as Laura Dern, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper.A very clever device is used by the film's end showing the parallel of the fates of the characters in Jo's book matched with that of Jo herself. The climactic scene at a vintage train station is one the most beautiful of conclusions. - dbamateurcritic"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,10/10,Simply everyone and everything about this film was a pleasure to watch. I always know when I haven't had to check the time once during a film over 2 hours once it's a sign that it's very good and if anything I wanted it to last longer. Such a simple concept and in many ways simple story yet so enticing and magical to watch as a viewer at the same time. Easily in my top 10 of 2019 and nice to see a film so good that's suitable for pretty much the whole family.
LITTLE WOMEN,12 February 2020,9/10,"The story of the four March sisters, growing up in the Civil War era (also Christmas, but I'm not sure that mattered), all very different with distinct ""voices"" and well developed (although, Saoirse and Pugh as ""Jo and Amy March"" have more screentime and focus). We see the evolution of these girls in 7 years span. The story is beautiful and sad, and cheerful and tragic. And maybe it sounds ""too simple"", but it ends up being an epic journey, with four well rounded stories all connected in between, plus some little ones from the secondary characters.The acting is great overall, and specially from Ronan, Pugh and Chalamet, the young lover of one of the March sisters (Chris Cooper, as his father, makes us emotional with no more than a handful of scenes).The update of the story about women is clear but subtle, which speaks well from both, the original novel (ahead of its time) and the splendid adaptation from the also great director (in this case) Greta Gerwig. The editing is superb, going for a non lineal style, differentiated by the color schemes and filters, and avoiding making character development scenes feel too long. The score is perfect for my taste (classical) but I could understand if ""overused"" for some.The only bad thing is that they didn't use different (younger) actresses for the scenes 7 years in the past, sometimes making it hard to believe the behavior of clearly 20+ women acting like adolescent and pre adolescent girls."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,8/10,"I've always been a fan of Greta Gerwig. When she came out with Lady Bird in 2017, I absolutely loved it. So much so, that it was my favorite film of the year. Saoirse Ronan is such a talented actress and top three going today for me. So what happens when you add Florence Pugh, Emma Watson, and Laura Dern? You get a highly entertaining film based on a literary classic. A great final film of 2019.The film is based on the book by Louisa May Alcott and is about a group of sisters who grow up together through years and learn lessons about life, love, death, womanhood, and the bond that keeps them united through the years. Jo March (played by Saoirse Ronan) also looks to find success in her writing and attempts to get her memoirs published. Most importantly, the film stars young charmer Timothee Chalamet.I read a lot of people had problems with the time jumping. I had no such issue. I think it was easy to tell when the film was going back and forth by the contrast of the picture (the memories were brighter and more yellowy orange) while the present was more blue. You can also tell from the hairstyles, especially that of Florence Pugh. I liked the narrative style that was implement by Gerwig, the story which has been adapted many times needed to be fresh for this modern audience.The performances all around are great. There are humorous elements to most of the characters, especially that of Ms. Pugh. Ronan is fabulous as she pretty much always is and the script does not let the characters down. Its sharp and witty and has the right amount of emotional weight that it needs to. There are somber moments here as the sisters deal with a close death and the range of emotions is handled well by the actors and by Gerwigs direction.The costume design, cinematography, and set design all feel incredibly authentic. Its a period piece and it feels like it comes out of the era. I don't know how closely the film follows the book but I'd suspect from the positive reviews there hasn't been too many big differences. The film handles its wintry elements well in addition, you can see why this was a holiday release.You would think that Greta Gerwig has been making films for years and years from the way this film looks and feels. Its crazy to think this is her second work and that she just burst out behind the camera two years ago. Its a warm, expertly crafted film that keeps it light hearted while dealing with a lot of struggles and tribulations people go through in their lives. An excellent way to close out the year. Now stay tuned for my top films of 2019 post.8/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,10/10,"In Writer and Director Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"", Jo March, Alcott's Hero, played by Saoirse Ronan, regrets her angry unforgiving nature over her younger sister Amy, played by Florence Pugh, who could have died, because of her irresponsibility. Wise Mother Marmee, played by Laura Dern, sits beside distraught Jo. She says that she knows what it's like to be ""angry nearly every day of my life"". She hopes that Jo does better. Jo confesses to her consuming writer's passion, and Amy's callous act when they were children.Marmee reminds, ""There are some natures too noble to curb, too lofty to bend."" Perhaps, following one's greater nature is more about what you're willing to give up. That too is the eloquent beauty of Greta's ""Little Women"". Greta reunites with Saoirse from ""Lady Bird"" in Alcott's rites of passage tale of unconditional love. Saoirse plays the young vulnerable idealist Jo, who wants to be taken legitimately as a writer. Still, she wants to be loved.Saoirse's Jo cops to her loneliness to compassionate Laura's Marmee. Mom asks Jo if she loves Laurie, played by charmingly aloof Timothee Chalamet. Jo says, ""I want to be loved."" Marmee says, ""That's not the same as loving."" No, it's not.Still, Jo has unconditional love. Returning home from New York to care for her ailing sister Beth, played by quietly strong Eliza Scahlen, she reads to Beth at the beach. Weakened Beth wants to hear more of Jo's own stories. She tells her, ""Keep writing... after I'm gone."" Jo's eyes well with tears. So did mine.""Little Women"" has great soulfulness and humanity. Life is both joy and loss on the journey of creating your own greater version. Life is about defining your calling, your purpose, and finding balance. Yes, we all want to be loved. Maybe part of being loved is forgiving others and ourselves, and giving love back, too. Rather, I believe that's what Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott are trying to say.Set during the US Civil War, Director Greta brilliantly weaves childhood flashback into her very contemporary transformational narrative. The 1860's was not the time for women, which might be the social irony of Alcott's novel. Wealthy Aunt March, played with humorous gravitas by Meryl Streep, reminds Amy that a woman must either have money or marry a man with it.Laura's Marmee raises her 4 daughters Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth, played by Saoirse, Emma Watson, Florence, and Eliza, all alone while her Husband, played by solid Bob Odenkirk, is away supporting the Civil War.The girls all have their individual passions. Jo, of course wants to be a writer. From the time they were young children, she wrote plays for her sisters to performs, albeit reluctantly at times. Meg's passion is acting. Amy wants to be a famous painter. Beth is quiet shy piano protégé.The March's live next door to the very rich Laurence's. Their longtime childhood friend is playboy Theodore 'Laurie'. Timothee embodies surprising charm and depth of emotion in Laurie. Laurie has been in love with Jo, since they were teens. Jo loves Laurie, yet not in the way he wished. That's the designed melodrama of ""Little Women"". What could have been the perfunctory plot device, Greta reinvents as the narrative of self-discovery and forgiveness. Greta's profound muse is Saoirse.Saoirse authentically captures the joy and the suffering in Jo's visage, in her being. She's wickedly funny negotiating her book with publisher Mr. Dashwood, played by cantankerous Tracy Letts, also from ""Lady Bird"". Her kindness comforts when she hugs Marmee following personal tragedy.Saoirse's nobility rises and never bends. That's the distinct heart and humanity of Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women"". Often times, creating the greater versions of ourselves is about letting go. It's about love and forgiveness, for others and for ourselves. That makes watching ""Little Women"" beautiful. Just saying."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,9/10,"After the success of Greta Gerwig's debut film, Lady Bird (2017), I was pleased to find her directing again with a tried and true classic, Little Women (2019). This movie isn't new or its content original by any means (this is the seventh film adaptation after all). However, Gerwig has managed to give it a poignancy and relevance to today's issues while still maintaining an apparent loyalty to the period. It probably helped that Gerwig had tons of acting talent along for this film, including collaborators from her last film: Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet. In the end, I found this to be perhaps my most favorite adaptation of this classic piece of literature.Where Gerwig shines in this film is her ability to use flashbacks and dueling timelines to show the contrast and growth of the characters in stark moments of brilliance. My one qualm is that this technique was perhaps used a little too liberally, which meant I lost track of which timeline was which a few times. Otherwise, the moments that paralleled the lives of these four girls from Massachusetts were played to maximum effect and done with cinematic artistry that should make this version the standard.I also appreciated the slight meta nature of the framing of the story, the superb classical music, and the beautiful set design. Still, it all pales in comparison to the actors. Aside from the ones already mentioned, there were standout performances by Florence Pugh (my favorite), Laura Dern, Emma Watson, Chris Cooper, and Meryl Streep (doing what Meryl Streep does). The best moments are the soliloquies about how successful writing isn't necessarily good writing, the economics of marriage, and the struggle to be an independent woman when it's also necessary to be wanted and loved by someone else.Greta Gerwig proving she's a master director, I give Little Women 4.5 stars out of 5."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,10/10,"Little Women is based on the novel of the same name, by Louisa May Alcott. Jo March(Saoirse Ronan), Meg March(Emma Watson), Amy March(Florence Pugh) & Beth March(Eliza Scanlen) are four sisters, who have very different aspirations in life.Little Women is a phenomenal movie. Writer-director Greta Gerwig has given us another unforgettable movie, after Lady Bird(2017). This film will make you guffaw, tear up & by the end of it, you will leave the theater feeling very happy. It gives the audience a very positive message. The cinematography by Yorick Le Saux, the production design by Jess Gonchor & the costume design by Jacqueline Durran are exceptional. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Saoirse Ronan is spectacular as Jo March. Ronan's acting prowess knows no bounds. Emma Watson is brilliant as Meg March. Florence Pugh is outstanding as Amy March. Pugh's acting keeps going from strength to strength, after Fighting with My Family(2019) & Midsommar(2019). Eliza Scanlen is awesome as Beth March. Laura Dern is excellent as Marmee March. Timothee Chalamet is amazing as Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence. Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, James Norton, Louis Garrel, Jayne Houdyshell, Chris Cooper & Meryl Streep are brilliant as Mr. Dashwood, Father March, John Brooke, Friedrich Bhaer, Hannah, Mr. Laurence & Aunt March, respectively. Little Women is a must watch, for people of all ages. It deserves all its award nominations, including its six Oscar nominations. Go & fall in love with the March sisters!"
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,8/10,"There have been many adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's 19th Century Classic novel LITTLE WOMEN following the adventures, loves and losses of the 4 March sisters - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth.. My favorite is the Orono High School's production of the musical version of LITTLE WOMEN (starring my daughter as Jo), but coming in a close second is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn starring as Jo (the quintessential Jo, in my book). So was there really a need for ANOTHER version of this?Well...yes...and...no.As adapted and directed by Greta Gerwig, this version of LITTLE WOMEN stars Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy and Eliza Scanlen as Beth and has a strong ""2019"" female empowerment vibe to it (this is intended to be a compliment). I've seen this called a ""Little Women for the #metoo era"" and I think this is misguided branding - for it does disservice to the #metoo movement - and to this film.Ronan - as expected - was Oscar nominated for her strong, independent turn as the strong and independent Jo. This is a perfect marriage of performer and material (almost as good as the Hepburn turn) and Ronan lands this character strongly (and correctly) at every turn. Timothee Chalamet matches her beat for beat as her erstwhile love, Laurie. This is the 2nd time that these two have played opposite each other (LADYBIRD was the other time) and there is a strong chemistry between these two - I look forward to many, many more pairings of Ronan and Chalamet in the future.Famously (or maybe, it's infamously) Greta Gerwig did NOT receive and Oscar nomination for her Direction - and I think that is a shame (there are at least 2 nominated Directors that I would take off the list in favor of her). Because she adapted the screen play (a piece of work that she WAS Oscar nominated for - and will win in an effort to make up for the Directing snub), her Direction is sure-handed and strong throughout. She has a very good feel for the material and knows what she wants to do throughout, to interesting results.This is because Gerwig chooses to focus much of this version on the relationship between Jo and Amy - a relationship that gets short shrift in most of the other adaptations. By casting Florence Pugh (also Oscar nominated) in the Amy role, Gerwig has a strong antagonist to Ronan's protagonist - with shades of both being grey. Neither character (or performance) is black and white they are both interacting with each other as realistic sisters would, both taking turns being ""in the right""....and ""the wrong"".Because of the focus on the Jo and Amy characters, the other 2 sisters - Meg and (especially) Beth - get short changed and even though both Watson and Scanlen are ""game"", they have precious little to do. The same goes with Meryl Streep (Aunt March), Laura Dern (Marmie), Tracy Letts (who seems to be in EVERYTHING right now) and Bob Odenkirk (of all people). They are all strong - and earnest - in their limited time on screen, but NONE of them have that much to do. Only Chris Cooper shines brightly in his small, supporting role.I have to admit that because I've seen this story many, many times, I found my mind wandering a bit - especially at the beginning. But by the time Ronan/Chalamet/Pugh started working off of each other, the film - and my interest - rose.So...is another version of LITTLE WOMEN necessary? I'd say no. But...if this version of LITTLE WOMEN is the one that the Little Women of today see - and can identify with - then I say ""bring it on.""Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,7/10,The film has a good ensemble of talented actors and these actors work extremely well together like a well choreographed ballroom dance. They all carried their fair weight with their acting performances. Cinematography and film setting is pretty good too.
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,6/10,"It's that time of the year again when all the Oscar movies start to hit the screens. Little Women is the first of this years Oscar movies that I've seen.The movie cuts between 2 different timelines that are (or at least start) four years apart. The movie tells the story of the four March sisters who are quite different, but very closely bonded. Life is tough for the March family and even tougher for some of the families in the community. In terms of awards my guess is that Florence Pugh as Amy March probably as the best chance of a supporting award. Having said that Saoirse Ronan is also excellent as Jo March.The movie is very watchable if you like good wholesome family entertainment."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,2/10,"Greta Gerwig wanted to make an American version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" Well enough, but she shouldn't have titled it ""Little Women."" Her movie of that title betrays Louisa May Alcott's book.As in British adaptations of Jane Austen novels, there is much attention paid to pretty young women, pretty dresses, mansions, and lush landscapes in the US and Europe. Again, as in Jane Austen adaptations, women's lives revolve around men and romance. Who will marry whom? It's a courtship game of musical chairs. You don't want to be the one who is left standing at the end, so you grab the best, richest man you can before someone else grabs him.Gerwig wants her characters to appear ""woke"" amidst all their marriage obsessions, so she has a character deliver a shrill feminist manifesto every ten minutes or so. Amy is given a speech that could have been lifted word for word from Emma Thompson's script for ""Sense and Sensibility.""These speeches are not true to the book or to Louisa May Alcott's life. In fact it was Alcott's male editor, Thomas Niles, who encouraged her to write ""Little Women."" Her publisher published many women writers, including Emily Dickinson and Julia Ward Howe.Even as Gerwig's ""Little Women"" is built around women yearning for Mr Right, every time a man touches a woman she swats his hand away and shrieks something like, ""I don't want you! I want to write! Paint! Pose in this pretty dress!"" Denying women's attraction to, and relationships with men isn't feminism, it's brittle, artificial, Hollywood wokeness.Because Gerwig's so-called ""Little Women"" is about romance, the main characters are much older than they are in Alcott's book. In the book, the girls are 12, 13, 15, and 16. In the movie, Saorise Ronan is 25, Emma Watson is 29, Florence Pugh is 24 (and looks 30), and Eliza Scanlen is 21. And boy do these women look like women, not at all like girls.What's more, not one of them is American. They belong in an Austen adaptation, not in the original, and prototypical, ""American girl"" story. No matter how good they are as actresses, they never conjure the brisk, flinty New England soul beneath their costumes and studied American accents. At least Katherine Hepburn, a Yankee, was able to do that in the 1933, George Cukor adaptation.Louisa May Alcott was steeped in New England Transcendentalism. This movement was tough and demanding. It's why her family was so poor. They were trying to reach human perfection. The Alcott family lived for a time on a vegetarian commune called Fruitlands that was so strict that they wouldn't even allow themselves to use cattle to plow the land. That self-righteousness is inescapable in Alcott's writing, her life, and ""Little Women.""""Little Women"" is not a book about pretty women, pretty dresses, and pretty mansions. It's a book about trying to grow up to be a role model of human ethical excellence. Poverty is a very big theme in ""Little Women."" This is a book about people surviving starvation, cold, and malnutrition through sheer force of will. Greta Gerwig used stripper Cardi B as inspiration when making her ""Little Women."" It shows.Gerwig, for reasons I can't begin to fathom, decided to tell the story dyslexic style. Scenes are jumbled. A character dies, and then is seen alive again. I don't see how this adds anything to the final product.I don't know if Meryl Streep is overacting or if everyone around her is underacting, but when she's onscreen you think, ""There's Meryl Streep, the great actress."" Takes you out of the story. Timothee Chalamet is supernaturally gifted. He is brilliant and quivering with life and believable in every scene he is in. He deserves a much better movie. Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, and Chris Cooper are all terrific as the publisher, the March family patriarch, and the rich next door neighbor. Ironic that the best performances in this man-bashing film are by male actors."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,10/10,"Greta Gerwig's follow up to her Oscar-praised ""Lady Bird"" from 2017 looks set to repeat the job this year. For it's nothing short of a masterpiece of cinema.Louisa M. Alcott's semi-autobiographical novel has been filmed before (in 1949 and 1994, together with a number of other TV versions). I've not seen any of these previous versions and (as a literary philistine) I've never read the book either. So the story was new to me and drew me in perfectly.The March sisters - Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh) and the youngest Beth (Eliza Scanlen) - are being brought up by their mother (Laura Dern) and Aunt (Meryl Streep) while their father (Bob Odenkirk) is away fighting in the Civil War. Also providing a helping hand is the rich neighbour Mr Lawrence (Chris Cooper), whose good-looking but indolent son 'Laurie' (Timothée Chalamet) has had the hots for tom-boy Jo for many years.Each of the girls has a talent: for Jo it's writing, with her struggling to get her work past the grumpy publisher Mr Dashwood (Tracy Letts, from ""Le Mans '66""); for Meg it's acting; for Amy it's painting; and for Beth it's music.The film follows the lives, loves, successes and misfortunes of the sisters over two periods, split 7 years apart. It's a bumpy ride for some.It struck me, as the big green BBFC certificate flashed onto the screen, how rare it is to find a ""U - Suitable for all"" (UK) certificate on a film these days. This is a film that the whole family *could* go and see. My only reservation here would be the way the film zips in and out of the two time periods at will. This might confuse the hell out of younger children. The subject matter of one part of the story may also disturb sensitive kids.It's a really old-fashioned film - full of melodrama, love, unrequited love, death, charity, ambition and kindness - that builds to a feel-good ending that was totally corny but felt perfect in every way. We need more of this in our lives.Wow. Just wow. The Oscar Best Actress categories are going to be a bloodied battlefield this year! There have been some GREAT roles for women on screen in the last year, and the Academy will have a job on their hands to narrow the long-list to the short-list this year. I would have tentatively forecast that Renée Zellweger might have had the Best Actor Oscar wrapped up for ""Judy"". But then here comes Saoirse Ronan. With phenomenal screen presence, she lights up every single scene she's in. Emma Watson and Florence Pugh are great actresses (and both here stand a stab at the Supporting Actress category), but your gaze always falls straight back to Ronan's reaction.It's also a wonderful performance for newcomer Eliza Scanlen as the youngster Beth: I heard director Greta Gerwig comment (on Edith Bowman's excellent Soundtracking podcast) that Eliza needed less lighting than anyone else on set as she was ""naturally luminous""!Again lodging a cracking performance is the versatile Timothée Chalomet.... does the young chap make a bad film?When you get to the end of the ""cast bit"", and you haven't mentioned Meryl Streep and Laura Dern yet, that says a lot!What comes across more than anything else is just how apt this story is today to the 'girl power' times that we are currently living through. Jo in particular is the rebel of her day, fighting against the conformity of what it was in the time to be an independent woman, and specifically an independent working woman. Some of Alcott's words from the book could even today act as a rallying cry to those looking for greater change.My reviewing year has certainly got off to a bang with this one. It's a glorious movie, utterly absorbing with ravishing cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and a brilliant soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat: both I suspect likely to feature in Oscar nominations. It's also likely to be nominated in other technical categories including Production Design, Costume and Hair & Makeup.And I predict that this is inevitably going to be a Christmas favourite to match ""The Sound of Music"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in future years.Comes with a highly recommended tag from me.(I went to see this again last night and loved it even more... as a result I've upped my rating from 9/10 to 10/10. I think its a masterpiece.)(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks.)"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 November 2021,7/10,"What a surprise. The movie that made me interested in Little Women again. I'm often surprised at how much I love that chick book. This is my favorite film version. It is beautifully shot. Meryl Streep, as usual, is a delight every moment on the screen; Laura Dern is always a joy to watch. The costumes are comprehensively Victorian, but the world they live in is Victorian blended with the wild west: America! We get some marvelous acting and a whole lot of tear jerks.During the civil war a family of four girls and their mother are left to fend for themselves and their household. The next-door neighbors take a liking to them and they look out, for each other. As time goes on each sister will go her way and this takes a toll on such a tight-knit family."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,8/10,"Greta Gerwig, in my estimation, is one of the most brilliant female scriptwriters/film directors currently making movies. Her version on Alcott's classic novel is spellbinding. She adroitly juxtapositions a several years span between the year composing and publication of her 1868 book and the Civil War years at home when the novel's events took place. I am also appreciative of Yorick Le Saux's plush cinematography. What a duo Gerwig and the French photographer made to produce one of the most gorgeous period pieces in many of a moon.Two minor complaints: The casting of Timothee Chalet, the love interest of two of the sisters. He's portrayed as a young wastrel whose apathy somehow attracts the two into wanting to marry. Another is that Alcott had writing success writing under the nom de plume A.M. Bernard before composing Little Women, a detail totally ignored.Otherwise, an outstanding film that surprised even this guy who went on his wife's insistence."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,8/10,"From books to plays, to films, the Little Women story is one of those stories that just keeps getting updated, which isn't a bad thing, as long as they are doing it for a specific reason and not because they are out of ideas. Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.Flashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.It doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.Little Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.In the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"My Review- Little Women my Rating 9/10
On 2nd viewing 10:10How wonderful to start a New Film Year with a movie which will surely be one of the very best films of 2020I remember when I heard that there was to be yet another version of Louisa May Alcott's best selling novel Little Women written in 1868 I thought surely not another version of this Old chestnut. I should have known that the excellent director 36 year old Greta Gerwig would have something new and splendid to add to this story.There are already 3 very good screen versions of Little Women the 1933 version directed George Cukor and starring Katharine Hepburn as Jo it's my favourite up till today. It's a well known fact that George Cukor was the favoured director of the great Hollywood Actresses he knew how to direct women to make their performances great.
Then we had a very colourful perfectly enjoyable chocolate box version from MGM in 1949 directed by Mervyn Le Roy and starring June Allison this time as Jo.In 1994 Australian Director Gillian Armstrong made her version of Little Women and it also was very good with Winona Ryder starring as Jo .I thought well that's it thanks but no I was wrong a 2017 mini series and another film version in 2018 of Little Women came along . I haven't seen these two versions and probably won't but that's why I was underwhelmed when I first read that Meryl Streep was cast as Aunt March in this new film.As soon as I read Greta Gerwig was directing I absolutely loved her 2017 film ""Lady Bird "" and then to hear that the star of that movie Saioirse Roman was to play Jo March my interest in this version increased 200 % . Another bonus then to read my favourite movie score composer of the moment double Oscar winner Alexander Desplat was to score the film I was hooked.All the performances are excellent in this splendidly crafted film but I must say Saoirse Ronan the New York born Irish actress gives the performance of her career . Saoirse has given many fine performances but her portrayal of Jo March independent self made woman growing up in a family with three sisters .The movie is set during and just after the American Civil War . Saoirse is perfection in the role of Jo and portrays just the right amount of steely determination and warm affection for her family I'm sure even Louisa May Alcott would love this Jo March.It would take to long to mention all the fine performances in this Little Women of course Meryl Streep is sublime as crotchety old Aunt March . Im sure there will be many Academy Award nominations forthcoming in many categories for this Little Women adaptation. The most obvious being Best Film ,Best Director and Best Actress and Best Score but I couldn't decide Best Supporting actress because we have Meryl Streep and Laura Dern as Marmee March the mother who holds her four daughters in her heart and maintains the household while her husband is absent at War. Laura Dern gives added dimension to Marmee in this film even a little anger at times to make her more human. This role is poles apart from her power role as Renata Klein in the series Big Little Lies.Timothée Chalamet gives another terrific performance as Laurie he's the elegant ,very dashing Grandson of Mr Laurence who falls in love with Jo their romantic dance introduction in the early part of the film reminded me of a similar dance scene in The Sound of Music between Maria and Captain Von Trapp . It's the great choreography in this scene that sets the mood for Jo and Laurie's future relationshipThe other standout performance for me is Emma Watson as Meg March ,how far this graduate of Harry Potter has come since her role as Hermione Granger, she is radiant in this role and such a natural actress .
I could go on there are so many good performances in this movie one of the most effective ingredients in the film is the beautiful score by Alexander Desplat it's one of his very best .The one thing at first that did throw me off kilter a little was the switching back and forth from flasbacks to future plot lines but it's very effective as long as you know the story fairly well and who doesn't?Greta Gerwig I would say has taken over the reputation of George Cukor as the finest director of women in movies today this film has the stamp of Sisterhood all over it but it's rare today to make a movie that I feel appeals to every audience member male female or child that doesn't have The Disney Logo on it.An adjustment on 2nd viewing
I'm adjusting my Rating on my 2nd viewing of Greta Erwig's "" Little Women.""
It deserves a 10:10 from me.Like a great painting seen for the first time and appreciated more on next viewing this movie gets better and better .The editing as I mentioned moved back and forth in the timeline and threw me off plot a little the first time .
However on 2nd viewing it seems perfect and like a jigsaw the pieces all fit perfectly now.I hope Little Women receives many Academy Award nominations tomorrow.
I really hope Saorise Ronan wins is Best Actress 2020 and Greta Gerwig Best DirectorAs far as Best Film I'm sure 1917 will win but who knows as far as I'm concerned both films are equal for different reasons.Good Luck Little Women.
You're certainly the most enjoyable movie of the year for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 March 2020,8/10,"Although i didnt like the endind, so and didnt the author, i felt myself surpringly enjoying this movie. it felt like a really good adaptation of a novel, even though i didnt know it was a based on a novel.8/10: actually really good"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 September 2020,7/10,Good actors and pretty camera shots in the time period it takes place with a better adaptation of the book.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,9/10,"Period costume drama.A remake, adapted from a classic novel of four sisters making their way in a male dominated world. We're able to appreciate each woman for their own very different artistic talents, we're given time to explore each character.Stars Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, and Timothée Chalamet. But it's Saoirse & Timothee who were both Oscar worthy!We took our 9 year old granddaughter who only got a little fidgety towards the end due to the lengthy run time (for her at least). This is a classic story that has been retold for a new audience.Very good - recommended."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,8/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The 92nd Academy Awards are presented this Sunday, and Little Women is part of the few 2019 releases that are only now (2020) being shown in my country. I really want to watch every Best Picture nominee before the ceremony not only to provide my honest predictions but also to have a Top10: Best Movies of 2019 more complete regarding the number of films watched. Well, Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the famous book isn't able to crack a spot in my Top10, but it's definitely worth an honorable mention.There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the Best Director category, way beyond just the Oscars. The lack of a female nominee across a few award shows raised some discontent, and most considered Gerwig's work to be more than enough to warrant more nominations, especially at the Academy Awards. Now, I'm going to be as polite, respectful, and fair as I can. While I do agree that Gerwig does a great job in directing this movie, I still believe that the five male directors nominated for the respective Oscar did an even better one. Even removing Todd Phillips (Joker) out of the equation (which I entirely accept), I would definitely choose Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) as his replacement.With that said, do I suddenly become a misogynist? Do I always favor men when I send my own ballots to the OFTA Awards, for example? I don't think so. It's just a humble opinion. Putting that discussion aside, let's focus on the positive aspects of Little Women because there are many! Usually, romance isn't a genre I tend to love, but I really enjoyed this adaptation of Alcott's famous novel. I'll start with the cast because how can't I?With such a stellar team of actors, I knew I was going to receive some amazing performances. Every character gets a lot of screentime, but Saoirse Ronan is definitely the lead as Jo. She's the odd sister, the one that doesn't really want to follow the ""rules"" of being a woman in the XIX century. She wants to do what she loves for a living and be independent without having to be this housewife that simply married a rich man. She wants to be remembered. Saoirse incorporates this personality like it's her own, and adds another brilliant display to her acting career.However, Florence Pugh gives the standout performance as Amy. Undoubtedly, Pugh is the breakthrough actress of this last year. Fantastic physical display in Fighting with my Family, one of the best performances of 2019 in Midsommar, and the most complex role of her career in Little Women. Since the story is continuously going back and forward in time, everyone has to portray two versions of the same character, but Amy is the one that changes the most. As a childish, immature, silly, young Amy, Pugh delivers some of the funniest moments of the film. Truly hilarious at some points. Then, as an adult Amy, she's more grounded, responsible, and about to follow one of the ""rules"" of society regarding women: marrying a rich man.Eliza Scanlen carries an emotional arc as Beth, and the best past-present sequence is due to her. Emma Watson is Meg, the older sister who everyone looks up to since she seems to be perfect, so her arc goes through some demonstrations of how her imperfections make her a role model to her sisters. Timothée Chalamet is also one of the standouts as Laurie, a neighbor who gets close to the March family, but I won't delve into too many details regarding his story. Laura Dern (Marmee March) and Meryl Streep (Aunt March) are perfect as always. Every character arc is exceptionally developed. With a runtime slightly over two hours, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that the characters possess.I can't address every single one in detail since there are so many, but I tried my best to give an overview of each of the main ones. Clearly, Jo, Laurie, and Amy's arcs are the absolute best. However, Emma Watson's character story is the one that feels too superficial and too simple compared with her sisters'. It doesn't really feel like she went through any change throughout the years, and part of her story feels a bit forced. Beth's arc might also be straightforward, but since it's associated with an emotionally powerful plot point, one can understand her little screentime.The past-present storytelling method works for the most part. There are a couple of moments beautifully and seamlessly ""stitched"" together, giving the viewer a sense of fulfillment by witnessing the start and end of a little story that happened in the past and later in the present under other circumstances. Nevertheless, some sequences either drag too much or lack emotional investment. Since the movie crosses the two-hour mark, I found myself bored during certain storylines that failed to captivate me.In a film with so many characters, it's very common to give more focus to only a few of them. It's impossible to call someone a protagonist if half a dozen characters have the same or more screentime or plot relevance. However, this always brings the issue of not being able to fascinate the audience with every character arc. Also, some past-present transitions are so abrupt that they disrupt the overall pacing by being a bit confusing. Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig does an excellent job in balancing these timelines, and an even better one by opposing the contrasting tones of each period and still make them consistent.Technically, Yorick Le Saux offers gorgeous cinematography, Alexandre Desplat provides a subtle yet efficient score, but the costume design steals the show by being extremely period-accurate. The colors of the whole movie tell a story on their own, as well as the set design, so be sure to look around on each wide shot because there is much to see behind the actors.In the end, Little Women doesn't do enough to warrant a spot in my 2019's Top10, but Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the classic graphic novel deserves all of the screenplay awards it has been receiving so far. As expected, the whole cast is phenomenal, but Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timothée Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. With so many people, it's remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has. However, some storylines are not as captivating as others, and the pacing suffers from these less exciting stories, which bring the movie down for some moments. The past-present transitions are mostly well-handled but a few are too confusing and abrupt. The contrasting tones of each timeline are consistent throughout the runtime, and the costume design steals the ""technical spotlight"". Overall, it's a pretty good romance, so if you enjoy the genre, I can't see why you shouldn't enjoy this one.Rating: B+"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,8/10,"A big, cosy, hug of a film that also kicks you in the nuts whilst whispering into your ear that everything's going to be alright."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 October 2020,10/10,"In an era with so much inappropriate and disgusting messages in the movie industry, this movie is an absolute treat for me and my family! Clean--no swearing. No blood or gory violence.No sex references or scenes on any gender. The sophistication and level of beauty of a well-written and well-acted movie is a wonderful change. I encourage those to watch it if you are tired of horrible messages in movies. The only thing is the flashbacks may be hard to keep up, just be aware of filters and other indications of the timeline of the movie to notice if it in the past or present. But found the timeline very necessary and suspenful. Lovely movie for me and my family and can't recommend it enough. :):)"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,9/10,"One of the most beautiful movies of the year. I haven't seen any of the other versions nor did I read the source novel but what I loved most about the film is the beautiful harmony that director Greta Gerwig brings on screen from the very first minute of the movie unit it lasts.
The acting is superb. You have Saoirse Ronan who commands every scene she is in and gives her Jo so much life and makes her also very unpredictable in emotions and reactions. Its really nice to see Ronan on the edge to become truly her generations Meryl Streep. Oh Streep herself was fine in this, giving us quirky Aunt March in a very enjoyable, almost self ironic performance. Loved her characters unintentional sarcasm. Emma Watson is the weakest link, but her character is also the most uninteresting one. However its still sad she didn't do anything to uplift that fact. Florence Pugh is wonderful and totally deserving of her Oscar nomination for her loud, wild and then very calm and sensitive performance. So many emotions in one performance. Just great.
Laura Dern is fine, lovely and giving a very warm performance. Chris Cooper is somehow wasted however it is always a good addition in any movie he is. Eliza Scanlan was great, already loved heir in ""Sharp Objects"" but she did something that Watson wasnt able. Bringing a rather blunt character truly to live. Last but certainly not least there was Timothée Chalamet who gives one of the most underrated performances of the year. How does he not get more mentions for this truly fantastic and fresh performance? And no I am not only talking about *his* scene I am talking about his entire appearance . So natural, so witty, so funny, so charming so tragic so wonderful. Did not expect him to live up to those little women but he did and deserves much more applause for it.
The screenplay was great. I sometimes got a bit confused with the time twists though. Great score by Alexandre Desplat and in the end one of the best films we got to see 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,9/10,"Little Women is a coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) based on the novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott. Starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Eliza Scanlen, it is a good natured adaptation of a classic piece of American literature successfully brought to life for today's audiences.In 1861 in Concord, Massachusetts, the four young March sisters Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) all live in the care of their mother Marmee (Laura Dern) while their father is off working during the American Civil War. As the sisters are in their late adolescence, the four of them are each contemplating their future prospects, whether it be to follow up on their creative talents for a long-term career or to simply find a wealthy man to marry. The second youngest, Jo, is an aspiring writer and ultimately decides to write a novel documenting the life experiences she and her sisters involve themselves with during this important part of their lives.With a warm sincerity to its characters and source material, Little Women hits all the correct notes for a modern day adaptation that manages to transcend its subject matter to provide enjoyment for just about everyone. Even though someone like me is not the target audience, such things should not matter so long as the story is worth investing in and the characters are likeable enough, which this film has in spades. I was surprised at how much I ended up genuinely caring for each of the four sisters as they all came of age in their own different ways. I assume this is one of the many reasons why the original novel is held in such high regard, as there is certainly a timeless feel to the way it has been written, despite its 19th century setting.Writer/director Greta Gerwig, who rose to prominence with her 2017 film ""Lady Bird"", follows it up with yet another charming coming-of-age story, one that would be more familiar to the general public. This is definitely a film that needed a female director as it requires the viewer to adopt a woman's point-of-view, something a male filmmaker would struggle with. With that said, Gerwig does her best to make this as entertaining as possible to either gender by showcasing each of the characters with relatable problems and realistic aspirations that anyone can invest themselves in. Unfortunately, she does occasionally struggle with the pacing and editing of the film. With a runtime of 135 minutes, there are moments where you can truly feel the film's length and this does cause it to drag at times. In addition to this, the film flashes back and forth between two different years and because each of the characters don't look that much different in either year, it can cause confusion figuring out which year we are supposed to be watching. Considering the original novel was long enough to be released in two parts, it was no easy task to adapt it perfectly, so Gerwig earns credit for the personal effort she has gone to for this film.Each of the four sisters were played wonderfully by their respective actors, with Saoirse Ronan clearly being the standout amongst them. It amazes me how such a young actress can carry a film with this amount of poise so intricately without becoming overbearing to the audience. This is easily her best performance to date, which is saying a lot considering how many fantastic roles she has played previously. Worth mentioning as well is Timothée Chalamet, whose memorable supporting role as the sisters' rich neighbour contributed to many of the film's best moments and had me looking forward to each time he would interact with the rest of the cast.In conclusion, whether you care for the source material or not, this adaptation is certainly worth checking out. Personally, I have never read the original novel nor have I seen any prior film version, but this one has made me curious about doing just that. This goes to show how timeless such a story is and by the looks of things, it can only keep getting better with age.I rate it 8.5/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 April 2020,5/10,"I wanted to see this movie because I have been following this director for a long time. I liked his last movie and his career has been meteoric. I was looking forward to seeing what I could do on a big budget. What a disappointment I have been.The case is that there are sequences that have something inside, that come to you, but with the montage that he has made, there comes a time when you are more aware of where the sequence will cut and what sequence it will go to now that you have seen the movie.It has taken away the soul of most of the intense moments of the film, it is as if he had shot it quickly or did not know how to give soul to many moments. He passes them so fast that they have no emotion.I can't stand when the actors speak to the camera when reading the letters, nor does it go to the script, nor does it have a soul.I personally like linear narrations, it is true, but in this case, since it is not linear, it does not get you to empathize with many moments, because they are also placed in such a way that they lose all the spirit when putting the sequences in that order.I do not like how it begins, it has lost all the illusion of a person who writes your first novel with what it costs and reaches the publisher, you have not empathized with it. And let's not say the end. With how good the other was, he has destroyed it.The actors, the casting is horrible. It does not make sense to have certain actors in those roles, there are several that are very bad, but you could not believe them because the role does not go.The lighting is quite good, it is thanks to it that in some sequences you enter, if not even that.The director this time, for my taste has failed miserably. It has many planes that are horrible to us, are poorly composed. It is not that he does not use the camera to narrate, it is that he sometimes gets dizzy with the actors seated, due to the way they shoot. The rhythm is not right. It doesn't catch you at all. He has made the second worst version of the five I know.And I approve it because it has a completely cinematic invoice and because in some moments if it arrives, but it has been long"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 August 2021,8/10,A wonderful acted period drama that shines all along its runtime. Filled with great moments and a beautiful third act. The best 'Little Women' of them all!
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2020,8/10,"It is not easy to reimagine a familiar story into something that feels truly fresh. But Gerwig did just that. I knew this story already, but I experienced it in a new way this time around - new laughs, new surprises, new moments, new insights. I have never loved period pieces like this one, perhaps because the stakes felt too low at the surface level...but only because I failed to connect. This film helped me see that there was far more to these characters than I remembered or realized last time around. The time period may have been the late 1800s, but the experiences were universal. And more relevant than ever."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,7/10,"18 women set out in the forest to look for this thing. All of them had boyfriends and strong lives in the film, there was 0 character struggle in the film, for anyone. The hunt for the tortoise was more of a Saturday social gathering. All the gals were dressed in princess Reebok shoes and wrapped in big cotton blankets( the wardrobe, of course, provided by alto barbie). The blankets they used were heavy, which caused the hunt for the tortoise to be more enjoyable to see. The tons of strawberry vines were a nice touch. A notable scene: The woman wearing the red quilt took a bite of a hanging strawberry, and simultaneously exposed a part of her bare leg."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,8/10,"I don't think I've ever watched an adaptation of Little Women. In all honesty I feel a little out of my depth. This isn't really my thing, but I'd be lying if I said the 2 hours didn't rattle by. Largely I suspect because the story is pretty fast paced. Odd as not that much happens to begin, rather a collection of small incidental scenes flick past, building a rich base for the quite exceptional cast. The non-sequential timeline certainly helps too, creating a varied and intriguing story arc. It is a bit foppish in places, high society nonsense et al, but the undercurrent of female struggle powers through it well enough and if you watch this and aren't moved, you're a heartless empty vessel (and more than likely male). I don't know how this compares to the book or previous screen outings, but Gerwig has directed something truly special. By the end I was a blubbering wreck in tears. It's restored my faith that I'm not such a cynic after all. Quite frankly I didn't want it to end."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 December 2019,10/10,"Easily the best picture of the year. Charming, warm and beautiful with great humor and lovely effortless performances. Director Greta Gerwig is what Sofia Coppola should have been.
Though I havent seen any of the previous incarnations of the Louis May Alcott book, this blindsided me as to how a throwback film should have been.
A lot could be said about this being ""woke"" or that it rewrites a bit to fit 2019 sensibilities, but I suspect it's always been there to mine. It's heartbreaking at many points and proves cinema is alive! Since there is no one being thrown through drywall or being punched into space, it's an incredible feat with emotions alone. By the way...they address this in the film...""why would anyone read or watch a story about...people?"" Because we are dynamic. We suffer, we lose, we laugh and live. And with the energic performances of all the sisters...we want to hug them all. A work of art!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 March 2020,9/10,"2019 has been a good year for movies. I really loved and enjoyed all the 9 Academy Award nominated movies and many more. The greatest snub of the year is simply Greta Gerwig. She truly deserved some recognition for this brilliant direction. I haven't read Little Women or watched any adaptations on the book before so it was a very good experience for me. The story is just outstanding and the screenplay for the movie is equally good. All the departments were really good. The casting deserves applause as everyone was good. Saorise Ronan and Florence Pugh were the ones I liked the most and Pugh is the most exciting prospect in Hollywood right now. Alexander Desplat's music sets the whole vintage mood for the movie along with the excellent cinematography. The costumes, makeup and hairstyling a were really good. Overall, I really liked Little Women very much and it's a must watch for everyone. Waiting for Gerwig's next."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 August 2020,8/10,"Greta Gerwig, in my estimation, is one of the most brilliant female scriptwriters/film directors currently making movies. Her version on Alcott's classic novel is spellbinding. She adroitly juxtapositions a several years span between the year composing and publication of her 1868 book and the Civil War years at home when the novel's events took place. I am also appreciative of Yorick Le Saux's plush cinematography. What a duo Gerwig and the French photographer made to produce one of the most gorgeous period pieces in many of a moon."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,8/10,"An enjoyable period drama about the growing up and loves of a group of sisters in 1800's America. Superb acting from the cast and a great depiction of the presentation of the era, although it is all a bit too clean and idyllic at times. There isn't a strong single plot but instead a selection of events which are interesting enough and never dull, although it can feel a bit jumbled at times due to all the flashbacks."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,8/10,"Little Women is a delight, as it uses the ideas and characters that made the novel great, put together a great ensemble cast allowing each to shine and have personality, and puts touches of nonlinear storytelling and homage to the novel which are the cherry on top. While I didn't love Lady Bird as much as most, Gerwig hit a home run here, adapting the novel impeccably. The ensemble is great, with Ronan and Pugh as absolute standouts who breathe life and empathy into their crucial characters. Pugh in particular made the time changes work, as her voice and character very well represented the transition from adolescent to late-teen Amy. The nonlinear time fits the story very well, as we understand where the girls are going and how the romance plots evolve. It's a truly fantastic adapted script, as it has all the essential moments and feelings of the novel with no filler, and plenty of space for the characters to showcase their personality and flair. The theme of limited female options and marriage being an economic proposition felt especially poignant, but all the ideas feel relevant and present today. This feels like a movie everyone agrees is great but is already beyond public discussion. Gerwig should clearly have gotten into Best Director over Phillips, and I really hope it wins best adapted screenplay. Very glad I read the book before watching it, as Gerwig clearly shows her love and appreciation for Alcott's work."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 May 2021,7/10,Saoirse Ronan? Great. Florence Pugh? Great. Greta Gerwig? Great. This movie was a great remake of the previous renditions and it is good to see that these types of stories are still getting made.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,9/10,"Little Women (2019) Review:Greta Gerwig writes and directs the beloved story of four of sisters coming of age in the aftermath of the Civil War. The story is told through flashbacks and present tense mainly through the eyes of Jo March (Saoirse Ronan), Amy March (Florence Pugh), and Meg March (Emma Watson). I really like the story of Little Women. In 1994 we got a version with lead actress Winona Ryder and I liked that one last time I saw it. Greta Gerwig proved to be a fantastic director with 2017s Lady Bird. She was the only female director nominated for best director that year. I really hope she gets nominated again this year and I think it would be amazing if she could win. Gerwig has a way of directing to make everything feel real and personal. I was invested in the story and the characters. Every performance is practically flawless. Even with Emma Watson occasionally slipping to her British accent, she still provided a great performance. There's three performances that really stood out to me. First off, Saoirse Ronan is perfect in every role that I've seen her in. She is the perfect Jo March and brings life to the screen. The sparks of creativity that lead her to write we're all genuine. Those sparks were her becoming Jo. I just loved her. Second, and another actor that is perfect in every role, is Timothée Chalamet. He plays the main love interest, Laurie. He embodies this arrogant but fun man who is trying to get the stubborn Jo March to fall in love with him. Chalamet's performance isn't getting the recognition it deserves. He costarred with Ronan in Lady Bird and those two have a real chemistry. Their energy is just perfect together. I loved his Laurie and how he interacts with everyone. Finally, my favorite actress of the year, Florence Pugh plays Amy March. From what I know, in the book we're supposed to not like Amy and she's annoying. However, Amy was my favorite character in the whole film. Florence Pugh is a fantastic actress. In Midsommar she gave a gripping performance and also another good performance as Saraya Knight in an underrated movie this year, Fighting With My Family. I love her so much and she is well deserving of the Oscar for this performance. Since the film is shown through flashbacks and present, we get to see this change of character from young her to adult. Younger her would whine and joke around. I loved that aspect of her character. There's a scene where she's crying outside and then comes inside and is joking around. I was dying of laughter. But for every comedic part there's always something dramatic. If Hollywood needs an actor to cry for a scene, she's the perfect choice. In Midsommar she practically cried throughout the whole film and then parts at this. Her crying feels real to me because it's not the typical cliche crying we usually see. That may just be me but that's what I think. Like I said many times, I love the performances. The story was adapted very well and Greta Gerwig deserves the praise. The only problem I had with the story was when it goes to the past it doesn't show that it's the past until we look at the characters and what story is happening. There were a few attempts where the tone in the cinematography changed but there was one instance where it went back and forth sort of frequently and it was hard to keep up. It's something you sort of have to get used to. Speaking of cinematography, I liked it. There's some really gorgeous shots, in particular some beach sequences. Alexandre Desplat's score is beautiful as always. I think he's one of the greatest composers and there's no doubt he'll get a nomination for his work on this. Some of the songs are emotional and help with the tone. It wasn't just the sad scenes and great performances that made me cry, but also his score. I urge anybody to listen to his score, or any score in general, rather than some music on the radio. People should really appreciate them more. Listening to it before watching the film I felt some emotion during some of the songs. I basically only listen to film scores and this is my message to get you to take some time, sit down, and just listen to the beautiful music. If you don't know the story, I'd suggest bringing some tissues into the theater. That goes for those who know the story as well. I think basically everyone in the theater was crying. This goes back to Gerwig's direction of making everything feel real. I cried a few times. The emotion is all there and there's no denying it. Overall, Little Women hasn't had an adaption better than this. I'd highly suggest seeing this. It's made it to one of my favorites of the year. There's no way to be disappointed.My Grade: A"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,10/10,"...This is by far Gerwig's best work and somehow maybe one of her most personal as well and that's what makes this adaptation amazing; it's respectful of the source material and the author, cognisant of what audiences require now and faithful to Gerwig's own sentiment and sensibility. The Marches are all, top to bottom, stunningly cast and acted and the interlocking nature of the story makes it brisk and poignant. It's beautifully shot and edited, it's a real masterwork of drama and sometimes comedy, every frame is lovingly, achingly constructed with flair, restraint, warmth and soul."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,10/10,"Funny. Endearing. Charming. Emotional. Sombre. Powerful. An absolute delight! Little Women is perhaps the best adaptation of a classic novel for the big screen.There are many reasons why this film was great, but ultimately my perception and enjoyment of a film is based on how it makes me feel. Little Women made me feel everything, connecting me so closely to the characters and the story that I didn't want it to end. It was a masterclass of cinema from Gerwig and a testament to the timeless nature of Alcott's novel.The cast were incredible. I was so captivated and transported by the performances of Ronan, Pugh, Scanlen and Watson and the chemistry between them. Ronan once again proves following Ladybird that despite her age she is a powerhouse of a leading lady. Pugh deservedly picked up an Academy nomination for her portrayal of Amy, and was at risk of stealing the show. Not a single member of the cast felt out of place.From any period piece you want to feel transported to the era, which Little Women achieved in triumphant fashion. The costume and set design were impeccable, creating such rich detail which added to the feeling of complete immersion within the film.The plot was typical of the era and very enjoyable, proving why this story is such a classic. Having not read it I'm not sure what changes Gerwig made from the original text, but the story flowed well and the non-linear story telling was used expertly to enhance the emotional elements of the story.I could go on a lot longer with praise for Little Women, but I'll stop here simply to say that this was such a powerful and emotional film and an absolute delight to watch. Don't hesitate - watch it now!"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 September 2020,8/10,"I cannot speak for all women in the world, but I face limitations even though they might not exist. As a woman, there are many things I was not supposed to do such as being loud or walking too late at night and things I consider before I make an important decision in my life such as 'should I take this job or should I start thinking about my family?'. It just seems and is considered by most that men have more time because unmarried men in 40s with experience and success are wanted while unmarried women in 40s with same money, fame, or status are called 'spinster' who passed their moments. Marriage also changes women's career more dramatically. Having kids can impedes promotion or even make women give up their careers. This movie brings up all the questions still applicable today and lets audience ponder upon it together with Jo. Jo's struggle to find her true self and true happiness is so so so ours. I also love how Little Women respect all the decisions by having Meg marry the man she loves so happily and willingly.Each four sisters' character is distinctive, and it shows well on the film. Their costumes and hairstyles even show these differences. Most importantly, four actresses understand their roles perfectly and assimilate themselves with the parts. Tones, manners, and voices well represent each sister.The story is rich; settings and customs are picturesque and brings out nostalgia; there are romance and heartbreak; there are also characters' developments audience can totally feel together; heartwarming story and great message to ponder upon."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 August 2020,8/10,"We shouldn't have needed a fresh adaptation of this, one of the most loved and repeatedly adapted books in American culture - it's so embedded in the international psyche that there's even a joke about in an episode of Friends. But we reckoned without the consummate skill of writer-director Greta Gerwig, who finds an unexpected approach to the story that would sound oddly meta in the description but that works superbly in execution. It helps, of course, to have such a stellar cast - one which proves the need for 'Best Ensemble' awards; it's redundant and unfair to pick one performer from the almost universally excellent line-up. Throw in some beautiful cinematography, and this is a beautiful, warm embrace of a film that still emotionally satisfies. There are occasional misfires: the cursory nod to slavery and racism seemed tokenistic to me, but I may have misread that. And Meryl's Streep character and performance seem to me to lapse too much into genre trope territory in an otherwise nimble film. But ultimately this is a film that leaves you smiling, the sort of thing you'll want to watch and rewatch over Christmas holidays, seeing something fresh each time and enjoying everything that feels familiar in all the right ways."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,10/10,"The timeline hopping is cleverly and masterfully executed (see the warm vs. cold tones, mirrored shots) and adds remarkable emotional depth (see Jo walking down the stairs x2) to what is an already extremely well-written (and acted) web of characters (to the big emotional moments are added many brilliant little overlapping quips and quibbles). Often hilarious (""I'm making a mould of my foot for Laurie to remind him I have nice feet!"") and always heartfelt, with a delightfully cheeky ending.
9.5/10"

."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 September 2020,10/10,The Performances of the entire starcast are brilliant. The Story moves back and forward hence it sometimes gets confusing. Florence Pugh has got the body language right and she looks adorable . Emma Watson is great..But Saoirse Ronan steals the show with her nuances and subtlety. The Direction is brilliant and Greta Gerwig transports you to that period and the magical story. Attention to detail is so perfect in this film that absolutely nothing feels out of place
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,9/10,"As long as you are very rich, you don't need to get married. The plot is not limited to women's marriage and marriage, but also concerns about personal growth. They are independent and have their favorite careers: writing, painting, music, acting. You can marry a poor man you love, you can reject a rich man you don't love, or you can choose to be single and love freedom. Marriage is not a necessity for everyone. Some people just love freedom. Respect the diversity of human choices. The writing paper of the heroine is tiled in a room full of moving people, which is moving, and the gap between me and Xueba / Master. Sweet tea is so beautiful, no one wants to marry sweet tea."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,9/10,"I haven't read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, neither have I seen any of the previous film incarnations of her famed novel, so I came to this with no expectations other than that the cast is stellar and the director, Greta Gerwig, is highly noteworthy. (Lady Bird was superb in my opinion - next up is Barbie, written by Noah Baumbach and starring Margot Robbie - that should be interesting.)What interested me structurally about the movie is that it is essentially both an autobiography and a fiction - the novel itself is represented as little stories but the narrative describes how the book came about. For some critics this has been problematic as it requires (or allows if you prefer) a considerable amount of time-switching, that is not always captioned for the hard of intelligence.The movie is an emotional rollercoaster with peaks of hilarity and depths of real pity as the four March sisters, that make up the main protagonists, live a struggling middle class life surrounded in close proximity by deep poverty and significant wealth. It is this relationship with money, and the pursuit thereof, that is the central philosophical backbone of the movie and allows for many excellent vignettes and clear messaging that money is not the root of all happiness.On the side of the rich sit three excellent portrayals; Timothy Chalomet (outstanding as the main love interest Laurie), his wonderful and generous of spirit grandfather (played beautifully and touchingly by Chris Cooper) and the 'evil'(ish) rich Aunt March (Meryl Streep). Laura Dern continues her annus mirabilis as the girls' mother (it complements her performance in Marriage Story.)More than once the beautiful tableaux' that Gerwig sets up reminded me of Dorothea Langue's Migrant Mother. In that it resonates love and tenderness in the face of adversity.This is a tremendous piece of film making in every way. It's funny, moving, beautiful to look at, poignant and thought provoking.Saoirse Ronan is excellent, as always, but Florence Pugh's ability to appear both 14 and 26 is even more remarkable. Emma Watson is solid and poor little Beth is played touchingly by Eliza Scanlen.Overall it's a great ensemble production with the real star of the show, Great Gerwig.Bravo!"
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,8/10,"""Little Women"" is empowering, refreshing and an absolutely lovely film backed by an incredible cast.
.
In this drama, the March sisters are four young women each determined to live life on their own terms. Based on the classic novel of the same name.
.
I had neutral feelings about ""Little Women"" as I walked in to take my seat, but in the end I thoroughly enjoyed this film. A sweet, sensitive and powerful film that will remain timeless like its source material. The cast of leads is terrific but Florence Pugh steals the show. Pugh will become one of the great leading ladies in the biz (see also ""Fighting With My Family"", ""Midsommar""). ""Little Women"" is garnished with beauty and a joy to watch. You will fall in love with this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,9/10,"""Adorable women"" Greta's new film is an epic epic, beautiful and playful that despite many setbacks and casualties always tries to keep up with hope and passion.The script, which is based on a book that has already had other adaptations for the cinema tells the story of a quartet of sisters, their loves, difficulties and disagreements, never hiding the tragedy but always looking for the happy part, Greta introduces us the film with a sentence saying that it tells happy stories because it has lived many sad times, and that is a perfect allegory to the film and the metalanguage produced by him in the figure of the book of Job.Each sister has her own personality that is intertwined between them, Jô is the sister who seeks independence and the different, the sister who does not accept the status of the situation and wants to change constantly, extroverted and charismatic the actress who lives Jô incorporates her character and gives a show apart, the young actress is the beating heart of the film, contrary to what Jô represents we have Amy, the most spoiled of sisters, who dreams and preaches the pattern, getting married and living a beautiful and artistic life, lived by florence who makes a wonderful performance, incorporating all the perks that her Amy lives for, plus a great performance for the young actress, we also have Meg who dreams of love and starting a family, lived by Emma Watson who is very well in the feature , and finally we have Beth, the youngest and most innocent of the sisters, and in turn the most perfect for not containing the evil and malice of the others.Greta directs her film very smoothly, counting on an incredible artistic direction, with great hair, makeup, great costumes, her great direction is even a little lost among all this production, another highlight is also the great soundtrack and magnificent photography, which mixes different shades of colors between the narrative lines and the mood of the feature, these changes are small, but they are able to situate the viewer very well.""Adorable women"" It's a great film, a shame that came out in a year of so many great films, which ends up somewhat obscuring its prominence, but we have great performances and a beautiful story, we left the cinema happy and satisfied, knowing that we saw something pleasant, touching, an allegory to life very well acted and directed, with a beautiful artistic production. NOTE 9/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 May 2021,8/10,Overall this movie is decent not as good as the book and women making a stand without being all I'm a women nonsense and a great story about sisterhood.
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,3/10,"I found it confusing and distorenting. Other than that everything was great. The acting was good and casting was good. Good adaption of the book.But those time jumps that have plagued so many movies lately didn't add to the movie, they only took away. Taking from the suspense that would have been there if you didn't already see what happened!"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 March 2020,8/10,"""Little Women"" is a 2019 drama directed by Greta Gerwig starring Saiorse Ronan and Emma Watson. Last night I had a movie date and the lady decided to watch this Oscar contender and I was totally appeased with her choice and surprised, as she was the only person I know how also wanted to give it a watch. What am I to say? She made a pretty great decision. While I've heard that the novel this film is based on has been adapted countless times and in several forms in the past, this was actually the first time I've heard of it at all. That's what made me so curious. First of all, I wanna point out what a stellar cast Gerwig assembled for her feature. Next to the leading ladies, Dern, Streep, Pugh, Chalamet, Cooper and even a Bob Odenkirk appear in here and not only do they all look gorgeous, it's also breathtakingly magnificent how they all, each and everyone, deliver so well It's been a while since I've seen such an outstanding ensemble cast that performs on such an equal level. What also had me in a permanent state of admiration was how beautiful everything and everyone looked. From gorgeous and paradisiacal costumes to a diversity of atmospheric set pieces there was nothing that didn't take my breath away. It's almost like I got caries from so much eye candy. Aside from this, I adored how the film unexpectedly worked with a narrative structure that consists of a well balanced amount of flashbacks and scenes playing in the present time and is perfectly convey with a play of colours, and even though it personally confused me at times (was kinda tired, I guess), I liked that so much, because it's unusual for a film like this and I honestly didn't see that coming, but it once again showed what an ingenious director Greta Gerwig is. Furthermore, the movie's basically extremely slow paced and takes its time to elaborate it's characters and even though I appreciated it on the one hand, it also had a minor flaw to it on the other, as it was extremely lengthy at times, just slightly too much. But that's criticism on the highest level, as I was still entertained by this well crafted and magnificently filmed piece of art. But not only does it look marvelous, the topic it's dealing with is the best part of it. In a business of countless films that only sexualize women (*cough cough* Baywatch *cough cough*), this film is the total opposite of it. It's so wonderful to see that a mainstream film depicts that women are more than ""birth givers"" in our society and that women are allowed to dream and have a career as well. Without showing the moral pointing finger, it has such a powerful message in it and it makes me so incredibly happy to see so much inspiration shown in a film. Although the film takes place in the nineteenth century, it's still a necessary reminder, as inequality is still a major issue in our society. All in all, it's a masterfully crafted piece of art that doesn't only convince with its outstanding cast and brilliant leading actresses, also with its excellent writing and directing style that now makes me even think that Greta Gerwig was snubbed this time. A win of an award is overdue for her, that's for sure. The business sadly lacks such gems like this and she has once again shown how much talent she has. Mark my words, she'll be recognised in the near future. Everything else would be a shame."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,7/10,"I was very torn on what to rate this. In the end I settled for a 7.5/10. I think It has spirit and I can definitely see it becoming a fun cult following type of movie. I have a few complaints with the movie.Firstly, The characters get little character development, a lot of the run time is filled with pointless dialogue or social outings.Second, ""Jo"" is supposed to be the main character, and yet we don't get a lot of deep talk about her personality. We know she is a writer, and we know shes a bit of a tomboy, but that's about it.Finally, the movie makes an editing choice that isn't explained until the last 30 minutes. I found this jarring and took away my enjoyment when they finally do explain it."

U
director: Greta Gerwig
starring: Saorise ronan,Florence Pugh,Emma Watson,Eliza Scorn,Timothee Chalamet,Laura Dern, Meryl streep etcoverall rating 96/100Little women is based around 4 sisters who are successful artists in different forms such as authors,actors,musicians and painters. But they must try and either succumb to expectations of settling down with a man and getting married. Or to fight against the power of men and make it on there own. Wow what a beautifully crafted movie with so much warmth,charm and fantastic acting lets talk about this more in depth.First of all the films cinematography and aesthetics were stunning. This film was simply stunning to look at. It was so simplistic and yet so effective, i felt like i was in a massive story book. With also breathtaking dance routines and costumes that really caught your eye and left you in awe of what you were watching.Next the film was actually fairly funny and it also had a fantastic amount of emotional weight to it as well. The family dynamic between the four sisters and the mother bought a lot of relatable humour for me. As i have two sisters which made me connect slightly more with the humour that was being used. Florence Pugh who we will be talking about again soon bought me the most humour as her brutal honesty bought a few much needed chuckles. And the film also had a perfect blend of emotional weight to it as well. The film spent so much time developing all of the sisters stories that you couldn't help feeling emotionally connected to each of them. And to see the collapse of the youngest sister ( Eliza Scorn) health was incredibly heartbreaking, and seeing her death and the impact on Jo ( Saorise Ronan) was heartbreaking but also inspiring as this is what motivated Jo to right her most impactful and successful book.Next the film had a charming tone throughout,and the script was phenomenally clever and impactful. As previously mentioned seeing the family dynamic and the bond that the whole family had was truly charming and heartwarming. As it reminded me of the bond i have with my family which made me feel comfortable and at home whilst watching. And the script wow was phenomenal. Despite it being set a long time ago the script felt so modern and reflected on society today. With some brutal truths of the roles of women in society in the past and today. With some impactful lines from Saoirse Ronan and Florence pugh.Now before i get into my final positives. I do just have to say my one negative that stopped the film from being perfect for me. The film slightly overused its usage of flashbacks. So it firstly made it fairly confusing at first to know what time period you were in. And then it made the narrative slightly clunky. But this was only occasionally so didn't really effect my overall opinion of the movie.Now time for my final positives. The casting was perfect. All the performances were great and i had 3 standouts in particular. I thought the films casting was perfect for every character. And it was filled with both experienced talent and up and coming talent perfectly. And everyone did a fantastic performance. So i haven't mentioned Eliza Scorn,Emma Watson,Laura Dern or Meryl streep in my key standouts but they all did great jobs. But my key standouts were Saoirse Ronan,Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet. Saoirse's performance was incredible and oscar worthy in my opinion. She put so much effort and passion into her performance that you believed everything she said and did throughout the whole film making her character truly inspiring. Florence pugh was phenomenal really showing her acting versatility. With both the serious and funny moments making me excited for her future roles she takes on. And finally Timothee Chalamet who held his own in a rightfully so female dominated movie. He was charming throughout. And he also showed a great contrast with his character of the mischievous and troublesome side to him, but also his sensitive and charming side and Timothee portrayed this perfectly. Also making me excited for his future work.Overall despite a slight over usage of flashbacks. Little women is a visually stunning,excellent crafted and acted cinematic masterpiece that deserves to be an awards contender."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 October 2021,10/10,"A brilliant coming-of-age period drama film, written and directed by Greta Gerwig, which is the seventh cinematic adaptation of the 1868 novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888)."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 September 2020,,"I found the non-linear weaving of the story to be quite effective at showing how the lives of these girls intertwined between time - how different moments of the past echoed and affected the present. Overall though, it didn't really resonate with the material, but it was very sweet."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,8/10,"There should be such a journey in the course of everyone's life. It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life. ""Aunt"" is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie. In the tenderness and tenderness, Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle-aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup. Teacher Huang Meiying, who plays her mother, is both acting and funny. Every move makes people shout ""It's too subtle""! The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan. After she separated from Xu Yiwan, the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes, striding among a group of exotic faces. That was both the liberation and rise of a woman, and the best ending of the whole story. I really like this adaptation of Little Lady. As a kid (actually until growing up) I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together. Because it's too long apart, I can remember very few details, except for two places, one is Laurie's tassels on Jo's apron, and the other is the secret code of their pillows.
Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong, giving the director a personal explanation: this is the needs of the times, and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster. And I asked my question in a publisher's tone: I can't see why she wasn't with her childhood sweetheart? I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood. (Well, because of this I'm willing to give this movie five stars, even if it doesn't meet my expectations in a few places.) Once again, I would rather embrace such an open ending. I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period, but I do n't accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person (to his sequel).
The genius of the film is non-linear narrative, which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light. Some transitions were very genius, especially the comparison between Beth's first scarlet fever and his last death. Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong, and it really made me cry. It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth's body in the book, which kept me upset. And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb (also Beth said write for me. Amy said Beth is the best of us)."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 December 2020,7/10,"Nice movie, one for all the familyThough thought the constant flashbacks were a bit messyAs always Saoirse Ronan was great , with Florence Pugh also good."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,9/10,"Little Women - Helmed by Greta Gerwig, Little Women is a retelling of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of 1868. Even though it's over 150 years old, its relevance hasn't eroded one bit, because it revels in the strength of human bonding and family values. The March sisters Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth live with their mother mother Marmee, as the father is away for the livelihood. Each of the four sisters has a strong character, tastes and philosophy of life, but are deeply devoted to one another and the family. Little Women is the telling of their life through the eyes and pen of Jo, who has the gift of creativity in writing.It's heartwarming to say the least. Saoirse Ronan delivers a knockout performance as Josephine, the second sister who doesn't believe that the emancipation of women lies in marriage and will go any distance to oppose it. So strong is her conviction that she denies love and the man who absolutely adores her, Theodore Laurence (Timothee Chalamet) their righteous place in her life. She wants to be devoted to her art and career, and by when she realizes that she has meted out injustice to him, it's too late. Little Women binds warmth, care, love, affection, kindness, aspirations and even sibling rivalry to a lesser extent in a poignant essay.The costume design is legendary stuff and Jacqueline Durran's Oscar award for it is hugely justified. Laura Dern, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen and Meryl Streep are delightful. I am not surprised that Little Women is retold once every 20 years as it transcends the passage of time and generations, it's perhaps as permanent as human emotions are."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 July 2021,8/10,"Greta Gerwig's 2019 adaptation of Little Women follows the four March Sisters- Jo (Saoirse Ronan), Meg (Emma Watson), Beth (Eliza Scanlen, Sharp Objects) and Amy (Florence Pugh)- as they go through their lives and attempt to live out their dreams. Jo, the tomboy of the bunch yearns to be a sucessful writer and balks at the idea of marriage, despite her growing friendship with neighbour Laurie (Timothée Chalamet). Eldest sister Meg on the other hand dreams of marriage and starting a family, growing closer to Laurie's tutor John Brooke (James Norton). Youngest sibling Amy dreams of being a successful painter and living a life of luxury whereas middle sobling Beth simply enjoys playing the piano and being in her sisters' company.As the years go by however the four begin to grow and things around them begin to change. March Mother Marmie (Laura Dern, Big Little Lies) wants her girls to just be happy in life whereas the stern Aunt March (Meryl Streep, The Prom) hopes that the sisters will marry rich, putting particular pressure on Jo and then Amy. Many things in the March family may be changing but the sisters' bond remains forever strong, whatever happens they'll always be there for each other.Similar to what I discussed in my Emma. Film review, I had very little knowledge of the Little Women storyline before watching. Obviously Little Women is a classic, so famous in fact that I had some vauge idea of what I was going into, (plus I've watched the Friends episode where Joey reads the book) but overall this was pretty much a blind reaction for me. I can definitely can say that after watching I enjoyed the story and want to watch or read more of the different adaptations out there, especially since I've heard this version makes some of the characters more likeable? Despite knowing nearly nothing about Little Women I now feel the need to watch the film all over again and then watch all the different versions I can, I definitely had a great time with this one.Little Women was such a feel good story (whilst also being incredibly sad in some places), and I can definitely see why it's considered a classic. I loved following the March Sisters through their lives, through ups and downs and heartbreaks and moments of grand gestures, it was just such a happy, heartwarming film. I don't know what it was exactly, the christmasy themes, the family warmness, seeing the sisters fall in love, I just had such a good time watching and I can definitely see myself rewatching, especially at Christmas.I absolutely loved the sheer chaotic nature of the March family and how wild and absolutely in love with each other they all were. It sounds like a weird way to phrase it but some scenes were like watching a group of people who didn't know they were being observed. Obviously all actors are meant to act like the camera isn't there but here it was like the sisters were just always completely themselves with each other, oblivious to everybody else around them. The bond and chemistry between the four was just completely brilliant and something that couldn't have been faked, there was a real bond there.Amy was definitely my favourite of the four March sisters and I've heard that this film does wonders for her character, making me slightly nervous to watch other versions of the film and see if my opinion changes. Nevertheless in this version I loved Amy and most of this is down to Pugh's performance and her growing relationship with Laurie. Starting off as a pretty spoilt child, Amy grows into a much more intellegent and mature woman and I loved her very realistic for the time views on her status in the world. On top of this I loved her and Laurie together and was definiely rooting for them to stay together, Laurie and Jo did have a very cute relationship but I think Amy pushed him a lot push and wasn't afraid to call him out when she needed to.The way that Gerwig shot this film in a non- linear timeline did slightly confuse me at first (and in hindsight maybe this wasn't the best version of Little Women for me to watch first?) but overall I came to like the out of order technique and what it did for the story. Seeing events out of their chronological order meant we got to see a more rounded version of the March sister's lives, seeing multiple storylines play out simultaneously. I think in particular this definitely helped with the Laurie and Jo vs Laurie and Amy relationship. Seeing both couples blossom at the same time meant both were fair game at winning audiences over (even though we already knew what was going to happen anyway). Just from seeing audience reactions I've heard that this style really helped improve Any's character so I'll be interested to see how it comapres once I've watched some older adaptations of the story.Overall I really enjoyed Little Women and can definitely see why it's considered a classic. The storyline and relationship between the four March sisters was just so feel-good and heart warming and I really enjoyed following each sister's journey. In hindsight maybe this wasn't the best adaptation of Little Women for me to watch first because of the timeline and tweaks to characters but nevertheless I still plan on watching further versions of the story. This was just such an emotional film and already I want to watch it again, I loved it."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 September 2020,7/10,"DO you notice that films made about different era, made in different decades, are lineant to what society was then. WHat I mean is women in this film are portrayed to be more free, than what they would have been portrayed a decade ago. though film story would be based in the era.
Anyways this is a good film."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 December 2019,7/10,"A visually elegant film through and through, and bolstered by a heartfelt, passionate eye for storytelling, Little Women is a thoroughly likable and ultimately captivating watch, ending on a real high. However, the journey to get to that finale is rather arduous, and with a haphazard, often incoherent narrative structure for the majority of its runtime, the film never really manages to grab you quite as strongly as it hopes to.But before I get into that, let's start with some of the things that work all the way through the movie, namely the performances. With an A-list cast featuring big names of all sorts, there's no shortage of talent on screen in Little Women, and that talent shines through from beginning to end.Saoirse Ronan is effortlessly lovable in the lead role, commanding respect with her character's impressive determination and fervour for life on her own, and yet still with the innocence and insecurity to make her seem just like any other lost young adult struggling to really find her place in the world.Alongside, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen are delightful as her sisters, each bringing unique and memorable characteristics to life in genuine and enjoyable style. The screenplay doesn't quite nail down the four sisters' individualities and quirks for a little while, but thanks to those excellent performances, it's easy to see who the film's main characters really are.And with a number of excellent supporting turns from the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern and more, it's difficult not to be wrapped up by the charisma and heart of Little Women, and all the more so when it's all delivered with such clear passion and love by director Greta Gerwig.While it has a modern consciousness, Gerwig gives Little Women the feel of a good old period drama, shying away from following current trends by bringing darker, more vulgar themes into the mix, and instead creating a visually gorgeous film with a wonderful beating heart. It may seem a little simple and weak in comparison to what we're used to nowadays, and doesn't quite have the power of comparable genre films of the past (namely Gone With The Wind), but there's no denying that Little Women is a thoroughly enjoyable watch from beginning to end.However, as enjoyably charismatic and full of heart as the film is, it really suffers for the majority of its duration due to a muddled screenplay, and a frustratingly misguided narrative structure.At its core, the story is very simple - the lives of four young women as they grow up and come of age. Of course, there's more at play under the surface, and the film in fact does a better job at telling the deeper stories than the main plot, but when it comes to that coming-of-age tale, Little Women proves an often disastrously messy watch.Following a moderately non-linear structure that switches back and forth between the girls' lives in the time of the Civil War and afterwards, the film aims to show the fleeting nature of childhood, and the natural passage of time as young women grow up. The problem, however, is that Little Women flicks between the two time periods so furiously that it's very easy to get lost, and by the final act, I found myself constantly wondering what and when I was watching.That's partly symptomatic of not enough work being done to differentiate the time periods visually - just a bunch of different hairstyles seem to do - but it's also a result of the screenplay's inability to bring themes covering both time periods together in an effective manner.The story looks at adolescence, young adulthood, personal independence, love and everything in between, and there are absolutely a number of links between the periods in which the women are younger and just a few years older. However, the film fails to set its story out in a coherent, thematic order, instead telling two wildly different stories at the same time, and never doing enough to make them connect with one another.It's only in the very final act that things do begin to tie up, and with a delightful and innovative finale, the film's charisma and fervour for storytelling shine through once again, but it all comes after almost two hours of unnecessarily confusing and convoluted drama. Moving at a bizarrely frenetic pace throughout, and never taking a step back to let you know where all the players are in their lives at whatever point in time, it's very easy to get lost with Little Women, and a whole lot harder to find your way back in.Overall, I still rather liked Little Women. With effortless charisma, gorgeous visuals, passionate directing and delightful performances across the board, it's difficult not to love, but its muddled narrative and messy structure do work against it significantly, proving a major point of frustration and confusion throughout."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,9/10,"If Saoirse Ronan doesn't win an Oscar for this then I will be shocked. It's a brilliant film on all counts but her performance is the icing on the cake.The film is a real emotional rollercoaster with the story, plot and pace all on point. All the acting is very good and it completely absorbs you.My only reservation is knowing nothing about the book before I may have been taken by the story rather than the film but if I am the film isn't half bad anyway."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,8/10,"This movie shows the strong relationship between these 4 sisters. Very touching! However, have to really focus on the movie because the scenes jumping from past to present all the time. Sometimes hard to figure out."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,1/10,"If you do not know this story, or if you read the book so long ago you have forgotten it then this film will not make any sense. The same actresses play both the children/young teenagers and the 20 something women they become so it is hard to work out which period of their lives is being depicted at any one time. This is before the use of time backflips and fast forwards that are spliced together willy-nilly. There is hardly any dialogue so that we get lots of gurning, irritating giggling like the actresses are secretly going knickerless for laughs, and touching and hugging each other as if to threaten placing a hand somewhere where it shouldn't. I went in error as, after all, the woman who gets listed as an actresss but has none of the requisite skills, namely Laura Dern, is in it. This alone is the only indicator you will need to avoid this utter tripe and offal film."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 September 2020,8/10,"The film is a beautifully shot and wonderfully acted tale. It handles themes like feminism and doesn't make it like Charlies Angles (2019) and Ghostbusters (2016). It shows that Jo wants to be independent, but realizes that she wants to be loved by a man. Not the ""all men are pigs and stupid"" trash that the previously mentioned films push. Anyway great film, I thought it was amazing and definitley recommend it. 8/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 May 2020,7/10,"I'm not certain of how much it is faithful to the book, but I appreciated this film. There are multiples great performances, the story is deep, but most importantly, it is realistic and relevant still today. It is the kind of stories that will always be up to date.However, the viewer can be disoriented, during the major part, the timeline is not specified, you have to watch it entirely to understand.It also gets critical on the code of literature back in the day, which is satisfying.Furthermore, according to me, there is too way to watch this movie, you can watch it as it is, an historical/romance chronic of the past, but you can also watch it as I did, like an essay on our society depicted as an epic movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,9/10,"It's best film about 4 girls and their choices in the life. Firstly, all actresses and actors did perfect eork. Their performance is wonderful, I really like Florence Pugh as Amy March, and the brilliant of this film, Meryl Streep is wonderful as aunt March. Secondly, costumes are really amazing, costumiers are deserved to win Oscar in their nomination.
So, it's good romance film for all ages."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 December 2021,4/10,"Starting at the end is rarely a good idea because it destroys all the emotional payoffs. We open with Jo selling her stories (so now all the earlier stuff where she's struggling to be a writer is diffused of that struggle). We open with Amy already in Paris and painting (so now we understand that Amy does escape to a more glamorous life as desired), and even worse, we open with her running into Laurie and us finding out that Jo turned down his engagement (so ALL romance in their earlier years is now ""who cares?"" because we know where it leads). Oscar nominated?? Filmmakers wanted to be different? Put their mark on the story by telling it out of order? Makes no narrative sense. So if you already know the story and you won't to see pretty costuming, watch it. If you don't know the story, watch the 1994 version instead."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2020,8/10,"Little Women addresses certain vicissitudes in the lives of the four March sisters, their parents, friends and suitors from the Civil War. One of them, Jo, writes and sets out to be a freelance writer (Saoirse Ronan); Amy pint (Florence Pugh); Meg plays (Emma Watson) and Beth plays the piano (Eliza Scanlen). At the moment her mother, Margaret (Laura Dern) manages on her own since her father (Bob Odenkirk) is in front of her, which does not prevent her from permanent solidarity tasks. There is a father's wealthy aunt (Meryl Streep) and wealthy neighbors: a grandfather and his grandson Laurie (Timothée Chalamet) who is always orbiting the sisters.In both the original novel by Louisa May Alcott and in the film, she plans the issue of what degree of economic independence a woman could achieve at that time and what opportunities they had to channel their vocations, marriage being apparently the only possible destination (and not necessarily savior). Something like the universe of Jane Austin but in the US and with the new concerns of the time.With at least two previous film versions, in this one, the director Greta Gerwig makes two fundamental interventions: one, in the way of narrating, since it permanently alternates the time of adolescence of the sisters with another after the War, with the girls more adult. This coming and going creates confusion at first, as it takes the viewer by surprise. On the other hand, in the first part of the film, the scenes are rather choral, which, added to the permanent temporary break, threatens the growth of the characters and empathy for them. In the second part, on the other hand, and already accustomed to the mechanism and with more focused approaches, this way of telling creates interesting parallels and the story takes hold. (With a very different story, a similar temporal approach works from the beginning in El jilguero, for example)The other intervention emphasizes the autobiographical character of the novel in the figure of the writer Jo, creating interesting metafictional instances.Beyond these interventions, the director respects the conventions of romantic melodrama, which is the one that ends up gaining strength with her love affairs and rivalries. In this way this classic but intervened story ends up working.Young actresses shine in their performances, Laura Dern looks expressive and restrained, the infallible Meryl Streep's aunt is the voice of the establishment, and Chalamet brings an essential romantic charm to her character.The period construction is exquisite while Alexander Desplat's music is unnecessarily emphatic.It is interesting to compare this film with Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled, where a boarding school for young ladies run by Nicole Kidman welcomes a soldier during the Civil War itself.

LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,9/10,"There is something special about Greta Gerwig; something I can't put my finger on. Her tales of youth are always vividly relatable (even if the temporal setting and other particulars largely aren't) in a way that, alongside her increasingly distinct writer-director personality that mixes the snappily hilarious with the deeply stirring, more than makes up for the parts that seem obvious.I have seen movies that sort of look like Little Women and share similar messages before; it's not even the first Little Women movie. Again, however, Gerwig makes it sweet, enjoyable, and moving in her own way. I'm not even sure I can explain what it is, but I'll give it a whirl!On top of her aforementioned knack for gracefully blending drama and snappy comedy, another remarkable double hit this time is how she creates a wholly authentic 1860's setting filled with authentic 1860's persons, but also makes us relate to said persons and know them as folks we may meet and converse with today. These people, their dreams, the bonds they form, and the type of struggles that weigh them down are timeless; it is the details of their day-to-day that make them convincingly ""olden"" (the anxieties of one particular ballroom scene will translate perfectly to a typical 2010's prom night, despite looking and sounding very much like a fancy vintage ball), on top of the production design and costumes of course (much of the scenery also emits a warm ""coziness"" that only very old houses and snowy woods can achieve).Another thing that helps, which Gerwig brings with her from her all-too-real solo debut Lady Bird, is resonant female camaraderie at the film's center; fully-realized kinships that everyone - women or otherwise, but women especially - will respond to. There is crystal clear history between the main heroines, even before we see/hear all of it (some scenes take place in ""the future"", which isn't always blatantly signposted, outside of match cuts and shifts in color warmth, but still obvious from how the characters have changed alone).Something Gerwig's getting notably better at, meanwhile, is the staging and coordination, giving us multiple moments where there is plenty going on outside of the scene's central interaction, further adding to the realness. Finally, all the above-mentioned things she succeeds at are in no small part due to her cast, including Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen and wonderful, wonderful Saoirse Ronan as the March sisters.These actresses, and the characterizations they so fully realize, add to the ""lived-in intimacy"", as Tomris Laffry succinctly named it, of the viewing experience. The ever-resilient aspiring author Jo March (Ronan), a semi-avatar of Louisa May Alcott, makes for a particularly inspiring figure - far more genuine and loveable than any studio-engineered Rey copy.The supporting actors are similarly great, even if Ronan remains my favorite (and hopefully the Academy's). We see legends like Meryl Streep (who is so epic, I guess, that Laffry's review credits her as Aunt Josephine twice), Chris Cooper, and Laura Dern alongside relative newbie and returning Gerwig collaborator Timothée Chalamet. Also running on all cylinders is Alexandré Desplat, even if I predict (but certainly won't mind) a Guðnadóttir win on Oscar night. Sometimes the expository dialogue doesn't seem entirely natural and there are some confounding editing choices, but these are inconsequential flaws. I have little else to complain about here, though I would suggest Emma Watson keeps practicing her American accent.This, I would suppose, was not made with a viewer like me in mind, nor do I know as much about this period in history or the Alcott source as an ""intended"" viewer might. But again, it doesn't matter. Not only must I acknowledge good filmmaking when I see it; I also just really, genuinely enjoy Gerwig's movies (besides, I do believe the best films, while not trying too hard to please everyone, can indeed please just about everyone, whoever the ""real"" target is).I have tried my best to explain how her funny-yet-sad and olden-yet-timelessly-relatable way of filmmaking has worked so astonishingly well here, when several other period pieces have also done this kinda stuff - or attempted to, but instead made me feel trapped in a bygone era I don't understand or care about, filled with people too temporally (and socially) detached from me to seem at all relatable, whether or not I ""buy"" them. Gerwig makes me feel like I could sit with them by the fireplace and talk about everything."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,8/10,"As a movie the performances in the new production are lovely. But, I found the constant flashbacks and flashforwards disconcerting and irritating.The 1994 version was chronological and some of the scenes were more touching and emotional. The deathbed scene with Beth in the new version was vague and confusing."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,7/10,"The greatest strength in this film is its ability to convey warmth and care between characters. I loathe films that will try to get a big ""AWWWWWWHHH"" out of the audience at particular scenes, but that is not what is happening here. Instead, the way the characters are constantly in physical contact and there for each other provides such a heart-warming atmosphere at all times. Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh are brilliant in their roles, especially the former. The greatest downfall of Little Women is its inability to convey time changes. The entire film is 2 timelines running side by side, 7 years apart. It is very difficult to distinguish between the two right when a scene starts. Because of this, I actually gave up on enjoying the plot all together, and instead just basked in the warmth and friendliness that Greta Gerwig created."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2021,8/10,"After a slow and a little confusing start with the various timelines, the movie really hits home. The acting of every character is great, the story touching and the photography beautiful. A great ode to life and family."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,5/10,"Well, I'm gonna start from what I like about the movie.It's technically great, the costume design is insanely amazing, the sets and everything else is awesome.The cast is something truly remarkable, there is so much talent here, and almost everyone knocks it out of the park. Saiorse Ronan is great, Laura Dern is awesome, Timothée Chalamet is really good too, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep (!), etc etc etc. The acting is great, and seem this actors work is something really cool.I love the message the movie wants to pass. Like in the scene where Jo is talking with her mom, about been a woman, and she said what is probably the best line in the entire movie (and it was showed at the Golden Globes when they announced Saiorse's name competing for best actress), that ""women have hearts, they have souls, as well as just hearts, and they've got ambition, and they've got talent, as well as just beauty, and I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for... but I'm so lonely"". This message is so powerful, even though we know the period where the movie was way worst for women that nowadays, we still can take a lot from this statement, and see it like a critic on how our society is still structured.The use of color to separate the ""present time"" and the past is great, and looks beautiful, but I felt it got saturated as the movie went own. Additionally to that, I felt that the movie's pace wasn't good, at some point half way through it, the cutting between the past and the present happens multiple times in a 5 minutes span or something, and that truly confused me at times, it's like they were trying to tell too little of one storyline, and already cutting back to another storyline that's slowing connecting to that first storyline, while it could just have told you a bigger part of said past story, in order to comeback and connect more than just one little point to the present story.Besides, the movie itself give us information in the present, that isn't really backed up by what we are seen in the past. Like when Amy says to Laurie (in the present) that she has ""always loved him"" while he always loved Jo, as if it was something he knew and still didn't care and had only eyes for Jo. However, we never see this two (that been Amy and Laurie) had any connection in the past, she didn't try anything with him, they barely interact with each other alone, tbh. So, even with that excessive exposition in one storyline to connect with a point on another storyline, the movie still leaves some important stuff without a background that would have helped a lot in connecting with that the character is feeling.And finally, I don't like the finale, the movie starts to use a somewhat ""meta"" approach towards the end, and it's truly out of nowhere... in fact, the movie tells you, with all the words, that it's finally... sucks. That Jo spend the whole movie saying she doesn't want to get married, but... gets married at the end.To sum up, Little Women is a movie that has the intend of spreading a message that's truly valid and important, however, it fails mainly on its pace throughout, and even though it has a fantastic cast, it isn't enough to overcome all the other flaws, at least from my point of view."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 December 2020,8/10,"Despite its origin to double root, this adaptation's style meant that it should have been four equally across its loose"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,3/10,"I heard such great things but I fell victim to the ""liberal propaganda club"" to give this movie great reviews. All you need do is look at the cast and the director... they are the who's who of the Hollywood elite. Laura Dern, Timothy Chalamet' (who Btw looks younger than jo here). Greta Girwig did another movie that got amazing reviews ""Lady Bird"" but when most people saw it they thought it was one of the worst movies they ever saw. Do not buy the hype. This is not an improvement on the prior version just another, inferior, telling of this same story. Why bother?"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 December 2019,5/10,"It might be good but i cant watch anything with Meryl Streep in it, she has that whole Hilary Clinton vibe about her, nope can't do it"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,8/10,"Before seeing this version, I had seen and re-watched the 1994 film and recently listened to the audiobook. I really like this adaptation!The actors played characters who seemed sincere, authentic, and actually felt like a real family! Of course, Saoirse Ronan does a great job, but I was especially impressed with Florence Pugh's performance! Also, the young men were cast very well! Timothée Chalamet was an absolutely perfect Laurie (almost imitating Christian Bale's portrayal and making improvements) and I thought Louis Garrel was a much better match for Jo. Personally, I thought they messed up the umbrella scene at the end, but oh well.The scenery and costumes were great, but there was definitely room for improvement on the appearance of the girls in terms of their ages. Through much of the film, Amy and Beth looked much older than they were supposed to be at the time and Meg didn't look quite old enough.The timing format with flashbacks, although interesting, was also confusing and basically assumes that everyone in the audience knows (and remembers!) the main plot points already, which is probably not the case."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,8/10,"I'm not a fan of Saoirse Ronan or period pieces, but for some strange reason, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I had previously thought. I was overjoyed to see Pugh in another role after dynamic performance in Midsommar, and I honestly think that Ronan, with her fierce tenacity, and Scanlen, with her quiet but charming cadence, stole the show. It all ended in a very neat conclusion and left me feeling satisfied. My biggest complaint is that the storyline was constantly jumping around and it made me a little confused at times.B"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,8/10,"""Little Women"" is the classic story of the four March sisters growing and learning about the world together in the northeastern United States during the 19th century. We have Jo (Saoirse Ronan) - the strong-willed writer, Meg (Emma Watson) - the softer, more traditional sister, Beth (Eliza Scanlen) - the quiet one, and Amy (Florence Pugh) - the spirited and most immature. Marmie, the mother, (Laura Dern) oversees the girls while the father is at war.They're a charming bunch, different in their own way. The headstrong Jo believes she has this whole life thing figured out, and she often urges her sisters to follow her suggestions, which are an ounce of urgency away from becoming outright demands. Despite Jo's efforts, each girl possesses the gusto to follow her own path, and ultimately, they live the lives they want to lead as little women.Greta Gerwig delivers a wonderful adaptation of the classic novel, perhaps the best to date. Give her plenty of credit for the work, just make sure to also credit the actors. They're all brilliant. The girls give outstanding performances, as does Timothee Chalamet as Theodore Laurence, the boy next door to the girls. Everyone calls him Laurie, everyone except Jo.Jo and Teddy, as she calls him, share an instant and lifelong connection. They love each other immediately and always. It's clear as day to everyone. The only person who doesn't seem to see it is Jo. Focusing on her writing and drive to show the world that women are worth more than their appearance, Jo has no interest in marriage or love. But this is a story, so the two will have their chance.Here comes the SPOILER.I'm sorry to question the writer of such a wonderful story, but with the clear love between Teddy and Jo, why in the world do they not end up together? The movie's version of the story attempts to explain it but fails miserably. In every scene Teddy and Jo share, the two characters display magnetic chemistry - the rare kind. Nothing can keep them apart. Except for an unfathomable choice by the author of the novel. Jo turns down Teddy, who turns to Amy for her hand in marriage. She says yes. This works well for Amy because she had always loved Laurie, as she calls him. But Jo is later so upset and desperately lonely that she immediately agrees to date a professor she met while teaching young writing students. The two get along fine. Just fine. The two get together after he shows up at the March home one day, spends a bit of time with the family, then leaves. As soon as he walks out the door, the rest of the family shouts at Jo that she loves him and should chase him. What? It's laughably absurd, as there is zero indication that Jo actually loves him. I hate to say this because I liked the movie very much, but this misstep in the story must be called out. Jo and Teddy should be together. Yes it's predictable, but it's the correct ending.END of SPOILERGerwig makes a beautiful film, sagely including enough light moments to complement the heavy theme material that makes up more of the movie than younger viewers might notice. Gerwig establishes a fitting tone, lighting and style, all elevating the overall film. With all that she does well, she also makes one curious decision, which is to sequence the film completely out of chronological order. It never totally works, more often taking away from the story than improving it. The choice is one of the couple tiny blemishes preventing the film from being flawless.For anyone and everyone, ""Little Women"" is worth seeing. See it with others and talk about it afterwards. It'll be well worth your time."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 June 2020,8/10,"As stated in the headline, coming of age films or drama movies that don't lean heavily into comedy or thriller are typically not my favorites. I've also never seen one of the ""Little Women"" movies before. I decided to watch this for the cast and ended up really enjoying the movie. I can't really explain why I liked it- I just did. Ultimately, if you're debating whether or not to watch this, I would highly recommend you give it a shot."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 May 2020,7/10,Great costumes. Lovely actresses - brilliant performances. Good storyline of each one.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2021,9/10,"Lots of clashing tones weaved together masterfully. Real human element here. Well shot, acted, and paced. Some subplots are not as engaging as the rest. Emotional payoff doesn't quite land but is done well."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,4/10,"This is a very anachronistic story and like To Kill a Mockingbird was probably an important book in it's day. However it's day has gone and watching To Kill a Mockingbird now is uneventful as the story has been shown in much better ways many times over the years.
Similarly Little Women seems to be one of those stories that gets told over and over again and yet it's not that great a story anymore and much less relevant in this day and age.
The acting is fine from some, and there are lots of nice technical aspects but one thing threw me completely was the moving timeline. One minute Meg is professing her love for her husband, 15 minutes later she is getting married! These odd leaps happened frequently until it got to the point I lost track of what was actually happening.
Greta Gerwig is certainly not the acclaimed director some seem to think she is. With less than a handful of films to her name, and only 1 of them being any good imho I think Little Women shows her inexperience.
I'm a big fan of Florence Pugh and Siaorse Ronan, but I am sad that they had such a low rate director who failed to bring out their talents in this film.
I rated this 4 and that was for Pugh and Ronan, had it not been for them I'd have turned it off after 20 minutes."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,8/10,"Review:
'Little Women' is a coming-of-age period-drama film directed by Greta Gerwig. It is the seventh film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott.
When this film first started, I was concerned that I wasn't going to like the storyline take that Greta Gerwig was doing with it. The editing really prompts the audience to pay more attention to the detail in order to get the most out of the story, though it was a little confusing at first. However, by the end of the film, I found myself having a great time and was very engaged with the characters and story.
The film follows four sisters (Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen) come of age in America in the aftermath of the Civil War.
Strong performances all around. I don't understand why Laura Dern was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for 'Marriage Story' and not this film. She was way better in this movie and had way more screen time. The three lead girls are all great and play their characters perfectly. Saoirse Ronan takes the reigns at the films lead, but my personal favorite is Florence Pugh as Amy. She was fantastic playing this character at all ages, showing different levels of maturity and really nailing it. I hope she wins Best Supporting Actress - based on who is nominated I really think she deserves it most. Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet and Eliza Scanlen were great as always as well.
The reason I mentioned the editing before is because the movie is told in a sequence of flashbacks, but it gets a little confusing at times differentiating between flashbacks and modern day. That's where strong acting needed to come into play, as the girls acted like younger, less mature versions of their characters. It's not a fault of the movie, I just think it's more of a reason to watch the movie again.
Overall, the story was engaging, the acting was great, and it does have a re-watchability factor, which is a big surprise due to it being a period-drama.
4/5"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,6/10,"Little Women (2019)I was excited to see this movie purely due to the lineup of talented actors but while watching it, I genuinely could not understand what was all the hype about? It is a lovely story about 4 sisters and their prospects of career and marriage which seems relevant for today's age but as film, it doesn't feel special. Normally, I enjoy movies about young people trying to find their way in the world and I was expecting it to be an emotional rollercoaster; sadly it was a different kind of a rollercoaster.Being a coming of age story, Little Women could have been so much better both structurally and emotionally if it used child actors. Instead Greta chose to squeeze out the stars by constantly jumping back and front while keeping their appearances unchanged which made it difficult to connect emotionally and logically. That being said, there are good performances from Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan but at the same time Emma Watson is uncharacteristically acting like a dried leaf and Timothee feels lost the entire film.Overall, I felt like this story has been told before in many different forms and having big name actors didn't make this one different. There are some beautifully touching moments which got smudged due to the lack of consistency and haphazard storytelling. It could have been so much more but instead it is just above average thanks to the wonderful costumes, decorations, music and two good performances."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 January 2020,5/10,"What is up with the praise being heaped on Little Women? Anthony Lane in ""The New Yorker"" said it might be the best feature film an American woman has yet directed. Nobody slaps Ida Lupino in the face like that if I can help it!The performances are fine, especially Ronan, Pugh, and Chalemet, who are featured. And there are memorable moments, but at no point was I moved to anything approaching laughter or tears. Perhaps I need to be a bigger fan of Louisa May Alcott, or of Greta Gerwig, but this movie is a Civil War-era soap opera interrupted by a few feminist proclamations-- which are articulate, even wise, but still. And, ye gods, I've never seen so much hugging in a movie in my life. It accounts for a measurable portion of the protracted 2h 15m length, and I do not believe that impulsive hugging was a characteristic of 19th-century society.The oddest thing by far about this ""Little Women,"" though, is that the most appealing characters are the men, all of whom are charming, generous, thoughtful, and selfless. Their only flaw is their apparently blind devotion to the clamorous March women. And those last two sentences say much about how romanticized this Gerwig version is."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,5/10,"What is up with the praise being heaped on Little Women? As I write, it's 8.3 on IMDb and 95% on RottenTomatoes. Anthony Lane in The New Yorker said it might be the best feature film an American woman has yet directed. Nobody slaps Ida Lupino in the face like that if I can help it!The first problem is the choice to jumble up the timeline. Maybe Gerwig thinks chronological order is boring, or she thinks there's some intrinsic value in flashbacks and flashforwards. But all it did was create mild confusion. As another IMDb critic said, it was dyslexic editing.The performances are fine, especially Saorise Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timothée Chalamet, who are featured.

LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,9/10,"Jo March played by Saoirse Ronan looks back on the lives and loves of herself and her sisters. This is a beautifully crafted film directed by Greta Gerwig. The cinematography is gorgeous so is the costume design and production design. You watch these little women grow from teenager to grown women. Jo is a writer, Amy is a painter, Meg is an actress and Beth is a talented pianist. Ronan was great as Jo and so was new star Florence Pugh as Amy. I loved every part of this film, the acting and everything else ive described. I highly recommend this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 February 2020,7/10,"It's tradition in Hollywood readapt Louisa May Alcott's classic time to time. But we had an overdose of it for the last three consecutive years.Beginning in 2017, a three episodes mini series starring Emily Watson and lovely Maya Hawke was fairly adapted by Heidi Thomas and directed by Vanessa Caswill. In 2018 Claire Niederpruem failed badly to bring to current days the story for a TV movie starring Sarah Davenport and Lea Thompson. As if it wasn't enough, Greta Gerwig was probably approached to develop her own adaptation between both releases after 2017's directorial breakthrough and Academy Award nominated Lady Bird.The approach was a very wise move by Sony's former chairwoman Amy Pascal and Sony itself to respectively produce and distribute the movie for three reasons that I personally believe. First because it was interesting for Sony to promote its brand under a female themed movie in a time where women are demanding more creative control and equalty, second because Greta is kind of an unnoficial face of this new gender equalty era of Hollywood, and third because it would be a great opportunity for Paschal to repolish a scratched image after 2015's email leaking scandal.It's good to know - or at least believe - that Greta had total control of what she was wondering for the adaptation, as she stated that the book is so important not only for the american culture but also to herself. But at the same time oddly to believe that she was unnaware that Pascal's leaked emails made clear at that time that she, as a chairwoman of one of the major studios in Hollywood, was also supporting the gender inequalty disservice in the industry, among other issues.Anyway, I understand that to achieve certain objectives sometimes we must pay bitter prices for it. And I don't disqualify Greta's work by that at any means. I just think that, as this kind of gender spokesperson that Greta naturally embraced, accepting work with Pascal is not necessarily what I expected and I felt the need to point that.Lola Versus, Frances Ha and Mistress America were three movies that made me believe that Greta was building an amazing career as an actress and as a writer (the last two she co-wrote with her husband, Noah Baumbach).And I wasn't wrong after all.Her adaptation of Little Women is old and new at the same time. Unlike the 2017's TV movie, Greta didn't have to bring the story to the present to make it fresh. The mainly concepts of the story are there, the characters and their respectively personalities were maintained, only the story development suffered minor changes together with free dialog interpretations that added more depth to the social criticism that makes Alcott's classic survive throughout time.Her direction is simple but targeted, she has a solid concept in her mind and does go for it, even if sometimes some scenes feel corny or cliched. Her freewill spirit is everywhere since the beginning, like when Jo is running happily thru the streets after getting some cash for her own work, the same way Greta does in Frances Ha for similar reasons.The majority of the cast is great, but imo some of them feel misplaced. Chalamet never makes his character believable, not about lack of talent at all, but because he always seems too young for his role. Louis Garrel should have fit better, and James Norton should've fit better on Garrel's role. The same I think about Saorsie Ronan and Emma Watson, because Watson never gives the feeling that her character is the older one, which is important for the story for the fact that Meg is the 1st of them to feel the social consequences of getting older and still single.For sure the best achievement of Greta is the amazing and unexpected ending she beautifully created. Trully a gem that will please even the most hardcore fans. That ending expresses a lot of that modern concept she was so eager about being respectful to the original source at the same time.Trying not to make comparisons, but doing it anyway, I still prefer Gillian Armstrong's version because it is sublime in a lot of ways, being hard for me to now watch Little Women and avoid remembering Winona Ryder as Jo, Claire Danes as Beth, Kirsten Dunst as young Amy or Christian Bale as Laurie. The entire cast was such perfection! And Thomas Newman music is undoubtedly an unforgettable classic.Greta did a respectful work for the current generation, and I did enjoy a lot. But for those ones that was graced by 1994's version, it's gonna be hard to replace such masterpiece in our memories."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 December 2020,7/10,"There is much to commend this film, not least an excellent performance from Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. Good support too from the rest of the central cast, lovely cinematography and a great attention to period detail, including a short section illustrating book making! Unfortunately however the film is marred a little by the frequent time shifting, particularly in it's early section when the viewer is still getting to know each character. A real shame."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 May 2020,9/10,"It's rural New England during the Civil War time, and a mother is trying to raise four teen daughters while a father does the fighting. What could possibly go wrong? For starters, the girls might be girls and start falling in love here and there. But that's not the worst part: some of them might start having ideas about their lives!A jerky timeline and a speedy chitchat might create an early prejudice towards this film, making it look like yet another soppy costume drama. However, as the story unfolds and the pieces start coming together, you realize that Greta Gerwig took on this adaptation for a reason. This may not be the first Victorian age coming of age story, nor even the first one with a feminist undertone. But boy, can it touch, even if you're a middle-aged man in 2020!Considering that this is not the first work of Gerwig/Ronan duo, I can't help but compare Little Women with Lady Bird. The environments of both stories could not be more different, but the whole notion of an adolescent woman looking for her purpose in life is still there. And if the former story is as realistic for its era as the latter, then there's one equally funny and sad conclusion to be made: the century and a half that passed since those times have turned us into big babies, overprovided and whining and clueless.Having four Greek muses for daughters is already impossible to imagine in our time, when children have so much to consume in terms of things and entertainment that they hardly feel compelled to evolve themselves. But the beauty of Little Women is that it doesn't try to sell you morals or preach at you. No, the characters are still clumsy and flawed, they make mistakes and break things. But it's the reactions of the daughters and their mother to those sisterly conflicts that makes it painfully obvious that, as the society evolves and progresses, our personal maturity degrades.All the analysis aside, this movie is simply a pure joy to watch. Not in the least thanks for the male part of the cast. Timothée Chalamet was forgettable in Lady Bird and annoyingly decadent in Call Me by Your Name, but here he is essential. By not drawing attention to himself but instead being the contrasting counterpart for Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh who steal the spotlight in turns. Although the male characters here work mostly as a backdrop for a largely pro-femme narrative, it never allows a single hint at misandry, instead reinforcing the idea that a woman's pursuit of meaningfulness in life is not opposed to having warm and harmonious interaction with men, something that radical feminists often tend to renounce these days.All these little but important qualities combined with an artfully ambiguous ending make Little Women a beautiful and truly inspiring story. Which doesn't just reiterate the obvious fact that both parenting and growing up is hard, but actually gives us hope that we can be better at both."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,9/10,"So the writer/director was snubbed by the Oscars. And the industry wonders why the audience is no longer there. It's because people won't pay your high prices for the crap you are producing. Few of the really good films were even nominated for an Oscar. So keep producing films that only others in Hollywood will go to see, and you will go broke.
Now for this film. Like another reviewer I have never read the book or seen previous movies. But I really enjoyed this movie. My only complaint is that because of the constant change of time (like in all other movies that use that method of transition) the story is hard to follow.
I must say the actress playing the lead and Laura Dern are superb. I have long been in love with Laura Dern and now even more so. I also am in love with Emma Watson but was very disappointed with her performance. I'm so glad I saw her in ""Beauty and the Beast""."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 May 2020,9/10,"Little Women (2019) is a period film but it manages to feel so modern and fresh, maybe due to the fact that it touches upon topics that are relevant to us, now.Even though I've never read the book, I'm aware of its significance, and I'm certain Greta Gerwig did an excellent job adapting it.Honestly, I feel like I could rewatch this a thousand times and still love it, but I recommend you watch it at least once, because it's definitely worth it."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 March 2021,4/10,"Honest question.-
Sense and sensibility
Pride and prejudice
Little women
Are they all the same book with he names changed? Privileged families with all female offspring try to attract suitors/find their way in life."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,10/10,"The literary critics who know these things say that ""Little Women"", the novel (1868), broke new ground in giving women and especially young women an entirely new set of role models to read about that went beyond the conventional domestic ones. What better way to show that than to follow the stories of four sisters who all follow very different arcs and yet love each other intensely. It's been given several movie and TV renditions already, so what more is left to do?The answer is here in Greta Gerwig's new film. It's ""adapted"" from the book but the differences are fairly small, as far as I can tell. It's a masterpiece. The thing that struck me most was the beautiful, seamless flow of the storytelling. Rather than telling the story in a linear way, it steps back and forth in time over the critical 7-year period when Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are growing from girls into women and meeting their various, very different paths in life. It's never rushed but there's not a wasted minute either. It's all backed by wonderful period scenery in Concord, Massachusetts, and meticulously recreated settings: the housing, clothing, transportation, conversations, all spring to life so thoroughly and yet without calling attention to themselves.And the cast: Saoirse Ronan (Jo -- the surrogate for author Louisa May Alcott) is outstanding. Emma Watson (Meg, the oldest) is outstanding. Florence Pugh (Amy) is outstanding. Although Jo is the heart and center of the story, all three of them have major scenes that give us insights into the different difficulties faced by young women 150 years ago. Eliza Scanlen (Beth) has a bit less to do, but she's very affecting as well. Representing the older generation, the great Laura Dern (Marmee) and Chris Cooper (Mr. Laurence) are beyond outstanding. They disappear so completely into their character roles that we are not even aware that they are acting. These two are among the top screen actors we have but (IMO) are terribly underused. (NB: when Dern and Ronan are together they uncannily look like mother and daughter.) Add in of course Meryl Streep (the rich, imposing Aunt March), and Bob Odenkirk (Father) and we have a top-drawer cast from end to end. For the ongoing love interest, Timothee Chalamet plays Laurie, who's consistently very interesting as he comes in and out of the plot but is ultimately somewhat elusive: who is, he, really? We are left not quite knowing.I give this 10/10 not just because it's all well done, but essentially because I can't think of any way it could have been better. Previous knowledge of the book will help, but the movie stands as a work of art on its own.Little Women is a masterful achievement by Greta Gerwig and her powerhouse troupe of actors. It could be nominated for any number of Oscars, from directing to acting to set design to costuming to scripting, and I expect it will be. It's an absolutely complete and absorbing piece of cinema."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,6/10,"I wished like more about the story because of the cast and the directing, but was sufficient for me enjoy until the end."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 April 2020,8/10,"A good screenplay as one could only expect. Acting skills also skyrocketing, making this a truly wonderful epochal Sunday drama. Easy to fall in love with the characters who are as flawed as romantic and humanely real."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,9/10,"Greta Gerwig has given a truly impressive version of this classic that has been committed to film in the past, but perhaps not as uniquely as here. This film is a rich display of superior acting and storytelling, such that you will be captivated and enraptured even if this type of story is not your usual cup of tea. It is the story of four sisters growing up around the time of the Civil War and pursuing their hopes and dreams as their adulthood approaches.Saoirse Ronan gives a startling performance as the ringleader of the sisterhood, an aspiring writer who struggles with her own longing for love and her dreams of a career and independence in the face of a highly patriarchal era. Florence Pugh is a revelation, in a fiery performance reminiscent of Ellen Page in ""Juno"", one that initially seems anachronistic but gradually becomes complex enough to make the film even stronger. Timothee Chalamet is a joy to watch as the understated but earnest Laurie.My primary criticism is that the chronology is at times a bit difficult to follow, let alone keep track of. In this regard, it might be more appreciated by those who know the book by heart, as opposed to the uninitiated. I am also surprised that the film makes so little use of Meryl Streep in an animated but smallish performance as the elderly aunt. But despite this and some occasional narrative confusion, this film is superbly satisfying and an incredible experience. This is not to be missed and recommended to the highest degree."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,6/10,"I have to wonder how many IMDB accounts are now studio owned, as the amount of reviews that said this is the best film of the year and Oscar worthy? For costumes, maybe, sure, but as best film of the year? Hardly. Even if this was the only film I'd seen this year it would in no way be in competition for best film. If there is now a Most Mediocre category in the Oscars, sure, this will win it.I'm under the impression Greta Gerwig is manufactured hype, just like Ben Afleck and Matt Damon in the '90s, but I'm not sure, ""Why her?"" Maybe as the token woman so Hollywood seems less the patriarchal pit of misogyny it is? I don't know, but it seems odd after one successful indie film they give her this kind of budget.The film was lavish and visually impressive. The costumes were amazing, and the scenery is pretty. I could see she was trying to emulate the look of famous paintings in the beach scene, and some of the Paris scenes. The casting and acting is really good. And as far as directing, the scenes she broke down where well done, the problem is that it didn't track well as a movie, it was more like vignettes, one after the other. To me, this was more of an indie or art house film with a big budget. There wasn't any particular need or reason to constantly flash back and forth between time periods. I liked the idea of us following their adult lives, because it seemed like Greta was trying to make the film her own, and not a repeat of the '94 version. The problem is it didn't work. We didn't build any feelings for the characters which I also found very absent in Lady Bird. In Little Women I at least liked the characters, but I didn't feel any urgency when Amy fell through the ice, and I didn't feel anything when Beth died, where in the '94 version I was crying buckets. Even though the '94 version was far superior, I'm not comparing it by that standard. I haven't seen it in ages, but my memory of love for that film is the only thing that brought me to see this film, along with the cast.I find it ironic that Greta chose to emulate the look of famous paintings in this film, as that's kind of what this film is. Pretty to look at but flat and little depth. Maybe Greta would be better suited to direct short films. She does a good job in some areas, and the scenes themselves are good, while, still I wouldn't say amazing or Oscar worthy, but she doesn't seem to grasp making her audience feel anything. Her films are not quite as vapid as Marvel movies, but they're pretty shallow. I think Greta has potential, but I feel like they advanced a director who is a work in progress rather than who's there yet.I did notice a lot of elderly women in the theater where I saw it, and the reaction I got from them is they enjoyed it. Given senior women is a horrendously underserved market, and the book was popular back in the day, I can see why it would appeal to them, despite the film's lacking. As I said, the film is likable and really nice to look at even if it falls short. I wouldn't say don't see it, just don't go expecting greatness or for it to measure up to Little Women's predecessors."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 April 2020,8/10,"The movie about the little women. Sisters, with different ideologies and nature. How they go through the little struggles continously which gets unnoticed by the male dominant society, sad but true. Many life lessons are tethered into this. Its about life, love, respect, money, apologies, forgiveness, anger and everything in between.
How you can forgive the person you think you cant. How your behaviour towards life changes with every step you take and things that happen to you.This is for all those women whose contribution gets unnoticed and they have things to tell us."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"Love it,one of many remake of that story,brilliant . My favourite is Amy March so funny ,the actress playing the character so well ,fantastic. Lady's movie"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,Meryl Streep is mesmerising and as always marvellous
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,"I was very impressed by writer-director Greta Gerwig's first film, ""Lady Bird,"" so I was excited to see how she would take on the challenge of adapting a beloved, classic American novel while also making it seem thoroughly relevant and satisfying to contemporary audiences. Needless to say, she did an outstanding job at creating a truly memorable and well-made ""Little Women.""To tell the story of the four March sisters (Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth,) Gerwig uses a non-linear narrative that goes back and forth between when they were younger and their current life as young adults. While such a time device might seem distracting, she does an outstanding job at making it not only accessible but necessary. Each flashback is carefully placed and edited into the film for a reason; usually, to further develop its characters. By the time the film ends, we are left completely satisfied based on the unique character development of the main characters throughout their young lives. That's an extremely impressive feat already, but Gerwig doesn't stop there. The dialogue in her screenplay is fast, sharp, and slightly acerbic. The writing always helps develop characters both in personal and contextual manners, and the film's sense of humor nicely complements the story. As a result, viewers must pay careful attention--but the benefits are plentiful as the film concludes if they have.I was also riveted by the performances in the movie. The four main actresses (Ronan, Watson, Pugh and newcomer Scanlen) are all excellent. Even though the film clearly presents a specific personality and mindset for each of its four main characters, the film clearly humanizes all of them as truly multi-dimensional people. Charming and affable, Timothee Chalamet's performance as Laurie is also memorable and often a lot of fun to see. Also noteworthy are Laura Dern as Marmee and Meryl Streep as Aunt March. Rounding out the unique and witty story and performances is the film's aesthetic value, with stunning and immersive cinematography and production design of 19th-century New England. Even seemingly simple lighting in enclosed spaces (e.g. houses) in the film, which may go unnoticed by some viewers, is crafted with clear appreciation and talent due to a variety of unique constraints caused by filming a story set in this time period--for example, the need to rely on candlelit interiors. A simple but powerful score also adds to the film's sense of atmosphere.All in all, this was a superbly made and memorable adaptation, and I'm excited to see what Greta Gerwig does next. Very highly recommended. 10/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,9/10,Good adaption and very well acted. Wonderful story brought to life. Very visual and enjoyable period drama. There's nothing not to love even if you haven't read the book.
LITTLE WOMEN,11 December 2019,9/10,"Greta Gerwig's post-'Lady Bird' female centred 'Little Women', based on the acclaimed novel by Louisa May Alcott, takes us back to the late 19th century in which we follow the lives of the March-family. Numerous adaptations have been made over the past few decades, but Gerwig elevates the material, translating it in a way to appeal to modern audiences, without ever losing the essence of the well known story.When we first meet the talented Jo (Saoirse Ronan), she's living in New York, teaching girls literature and trying to sell her own stories to the local newspaper. While Jo lives her best life, her hopeless romantic sister Amy (Florence Pugh) lives with her old fashioned aunt (Meryl Streep) in Paris, attending painting classes while hoping for a true love to come rescue her. Other sister Meg (Emma Watson) is happily married with kids and the musically gifted Beth (Eliza Scanlen) has been bedridden with a severe illness. When Jo gets news about Beth's state quickly deteriorating, she leaves everything behind and jumps on the first train home. While Jo naps, we flash back to easier times seven years earlier, when all sisters still lived merrily under one roof.The first thing you'll notice is the scale on which all of this has been made. Extraordinary production design inside the old mansions surrounded by the breathtaking scenery of Massachusetts, where Little Women was filmed. Let Academy Award winning (for his scores of 'The Shape of Water' and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel') composer Alexandre Desplat set the tone for each scene with his classically infused orchestra, and all you need is talent on screen and on paper.Luckily Gerwig knows how to write a terrific screenplay and the cast has the most incredible chemistry. The dialogue is riddled with timely jokes and hopelessly romantic discussions, perfect for that time period. It's all part of a bigger picture in which each character has their own story to tell. Saoirse Ronan's (Lady Bird) radiant presence is again noteworthy, more so, she is quickly becoming the best actress in the business. While rising star Florence Pugh (Midsommar) as the truly hilarious and hopelessly obsessed with love, wealth and looks Amy, gives another career defining performance, to leave a mark on today's moviegoers' memory. It's when all four sisters and their mother (played by a comforting Laura Dern) first appear on screen, you'll fall in love with this family. There's a cosiness and homely feeling to their interactions, that will warm you up from the inside. Something this innocent and safe hasn't been brought to the big screen in a very long time and Gerwig knows just how to control your emotions.After a lot of going back and forth in time - which is quite confusing to begin with, but you get more used to it further down the line when both timelines move forward to meet in the middle - the final third of the film builds up to a gut wrenching conclusion. For some reason, the actual heartbreaking event isn't so much of a surprise, it's the aftermath that truly shatters your heart into tiny pieces and leaves you gasping for air while tears roll down your cheek. Little Women is just as heartwarming as it is excruciatingly sad. Greta Gerwig has made a timeless classic that exudes love. Watching this film will for sure become a new Christmas tradition in many households. What a wonderful gift.Originally published on intoscreens"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,2/10,"A tap water movie without any high and low scene boring movie. Can see it's try to introduce the main 4 sister,mother and the guy in 2 hrs ,but it failed badly.No character development ,I feel no connection with every one that even something happen to them I feel nothing about it.Two different past and present story plot mix terribly I can't tell which one. Everything is so beautiful portray like a fairy tales story. No logic at all. Talk so fast like rapper , can't catch a word they say."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,8/10,"Little Women shows to me that I need to pay more attention to Greta Gerwig as a director. She used her direction to craft a faithful and emotional adaptation of the classic novel. Each and every performance in the film was great. Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the lead character and Emma Watson and Timothee Chalamet do great jobs as a sister and a friend. Each character felt unique and it was interesting to watch each of them reach their lowest of lows and then reach their highest of highs. The story flows pretty smoothly although the runtime is a tad bit too long. The film is about 2 hours and 20 minutes and it really felt like it should have been just 2 hours. That's mainly due to the film's slow pacing. That being said though, there was something in each scene that interested me whether it was the lighting, cinematography, or performances. I also too slight issue with some stylistic choices in the beginning. There is a scene where Jo Marsh is running down the street and it changes to slow mo for 2 seconds and it felt weird. From the films from Greta Gerwig that I have seen, she loves using themes of love and relationships with our family a lot. She expertly hides these themes within her screenplay for the film. The film manages to pull off a lot of emotional weight. Certain scenes in the film are intended to be emotional and they worked great for me. Some directors probably wouldn't have been able to pull it off but Greta Gerwig did. The cinematography, although not the best of the year, was great. Almost every shot was interesting to look out and there was always something to pay attention to. The costume and set design are fantastic. The costumes look great and authentic to the time period while the set design is warm and inviting. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic. It feels authentic to the time period and feels unique. Overall,Little Women is a great take on family relationships with great performances, an intelligent script, fantastic musical score, and good cinematography."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 July 2020,2/10,"This movie seems to have had such wonderful reviews but for this reviewer I cannot understand where they coming from . The 1949 version was so, so much better with a tremendous cast. There were 38 in the cast but this new version has 124 in this. Where did these characters all come from?I got to 45 mins then had to speed it through 30 mins. Such a garbled piece of work by a 5 time Director who thinks she has more of a career in directing than action, over 40 films. Maybe she should stay there.I directed LITTLE WOMEN on stage about 15 years ago and it was a huge success but I am guessing today's audiences just do not want the true version. Unless I missed something the Civil War appears to be over. This was not the case in the story. The sets were so dark, as is usual with most of today's movies. Even the outdoor scenes were dark.Unfortunately when movies are remade today they usually are nothing as good as the originals. Just look at the few Hitchcock remakes which were absolute disasters.My apologies to the Director for what I have written here but Louisa May Alcott would be turning over in her grave at this disgrace of a story."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 April 2020,8/10,"Little women is such a heart warming film! The kind of experience you get when watching Studio Gibli's films. The clothes are amazing, the acting is magnificent. I love it"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 March 2020,9/10,The Direction and acting were TOP. I really enjoyed this adaptation. Will be watching again. And again.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 January 2020,7/10,"The most disappointing aspect of Little Women is that when Bob Odenkirk shows up he has no reason to dish out any swear words or curses, something he was definitely born to do. It is difficult to watch the movie without a goofy smile on your face, for Greta Gerwig directs us to be a part of the March family, especially the March women, who are getting along just fine on their own in a low or middle-low economic status while their patriarch is off fighting in the Civil War, a noble cause because slavery is unethical, repugnant, and violates the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.It is also difficult to watch the movie and believe the March sisters could get along so well, even when they are mad or upset with one another. While their father is off defeating slavery with a bayonet and a rifle, the March sisters are fighting the paternalism of society. They struggle to achieve identity, even though each of them are highly talented in acting, music, painting, or writing. The plain truth is that they should marry rich, even if there is no love, for it can secure economic stability.Lessons learned: do not marry a teacher, Timothée Chalamet sure is pretty for a boy, and good thing Saorise Ronan cuts her hair so we can tell what year it is."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 September 2021,8/10,"An adaptation of the book by the same way that follows the lives of four teenage sisters living in the American Civil War period.I have never read the book, but there was a certain charm to the story that I really enjoyed. As a period piece, the set design and costumes were excellent, and I appreciated what felt like a honest representation of teenage / young adult life for women in the period.I did find the movie difficult to follow at first, (at times, I wasn't sure if there were four or five sisters that I had to keep track of), but I got a grasp of the flow and story telling by end of the first act.The movie is worth a watch, and it was deserving of a best picture nomination. Any issues you find with it are only noticeable because it is a really well put together film already."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,7/10,"Showcasing the era of 19th century the film is beautiful in every way, whether its cinematography, sets, Costumes, screenplay or film cast.
Film is about four sisters and their relationships, when they were teens and how they followed their separate paths and what incident brings them together. Saoirse Ronan doing all the heavy liftings with so much conviction supported well by Florence Pugh, Emma Watson & Eliza Scanlen. Not forgetting the seasoned cast of the movie who also played their role very well including Laura Dern as caring Mother and devoted Wife with Meryl Streep & Bob Odenkirk with their brief appearances.
Here I would also like to mention Timothée Chalamet who for me now is a period drama Specialist as his onscreen subtlety and calmness is commendable not doubt He and Ronan are already acclaimed actors in this young age.
Despite film being emotionally engaging it is little bit confusing at some points as storytelling includes parallel timelines which is simultaneously showing present and 7 years earlier stories, also film could've been concluded within 1hour 40mins despite its been stretched to 2 hours and 15mins."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 July 2020,7/10,"I would describe this film as a U shape curve. The front and back is good. Though it gets rather dry at the middle of the movie. As such, I will say this. No doubt, the cinematography of this show is amazing. The plot is decent, though while the center of the movie helps to add depth and helps in the development of the characters, I find it rather dragged out. However, this all comes to fruition at the end when you see the pieces being put together.Also, given that this film shows 2 timelines in parallel and how one ultimately led to the other, it does get confusing at times when the only way I could feel that it was the other timeline (and I was second guessing myself) was the sudden change in attitude of the characters.Overall, I'd say that while it does get boring at the center, of you were to push on and watch it, you would see that all your efforts would pay off."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,9/10,"Greta Gerwig known for directing the movie Lady Bird Directed movie Little women and also wrote the movie based on book by Louisa May Alcott. I enjoyed Gerwig's writing . The movie is about four sisters , oldest Meg March (Emma Watson from Harry Potter movies), second sister Jo (Saoirse Ronan from movie Ladybird) third sister Amy(Florence Pugh from movie Midsommar) and Beth (Eliza Scanlon). Each sister contributes to stability and joy for mother Marmee (Laura Dern ....too talented and well known) and father March (Bob Odenkirk ... famous Saul from Breaking Bad). Meg wants love, marriage, children. Jo wants to write and publish books and does not have any desire to change the perfect family setup. Amy wants to paint but always seems to feel second to Jo's overambitious and defiant personality. Beth, the youngest, is frail and does not like confrontation and watches silently the battles between Jo and Amy. Timothee Chalamet(from movie Call me by your name) as Theodore/Laurie/Ted is full of love for Jo who has no place for him in her journey of life. The scene when Amy falls through ice following Jo and Ted is very emotional and shows true love, kindness and caring among siblings with great upbringing. The movie has excellent screenplay. Saoirse Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy are terrific and both are worthy of Oscar nominations. The movie is 2hrs 15minutes too long. Some scenes were redundant. Screenplay, Direction and great ensemble. Oscar worthy."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,9/10,"One of the best films of the decade, full of enthusiasm, meaning and pathos. Film conceived as if it were a theatrical work and if it was not the intent, this state was nevertheless reached. A splendid cast, where as in a game of ping-pong alternate the ""close-ups"" (acting speaking) of actor in actress with no holds barred: Chalamet, Saoirsie, Pugh, Watson, Dern, Odenkirk, Cooper and more; literally a caravan of human wonders. Creative direction by Greta Gerwig with a precise cinematography by Yorick Le Saux, capturing events like a painting, which is placed in front of us for hours and hours to grasp every little brush stroke. Powerfully written story, better told, moving and compelling. Little Women is nothing more than a dream with wide eyes open."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 May 2020,10/10,"I watched the 1990-something adaption of LMA's novel and I can safely say that Gerwig's adaptation is more complete although the timeline of the movie isn't linear. Greta gave them March family a rather happy ending and viewers won't have to wonder what happens to Jo March and her sisters after she gets her happy ever after.This was a beautiful film, the colours were rich, the cinematography was lovely and the characters were wonderful. I especially loved Saoirse Ronan's performance and I think she captured Jo March perfectly.I love Jo's spirit and I can relate to her somewhat, when she says that she's so lonely in her pursuit of carving her way in the world. Ronan and Chalamet have such great chemistry and although I knew that they wouldn't end up together, it was still a pleasure to watch them reunite in this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,1/10,I total understand director motive was making this movie and I respect it but now this treads goes on Hollywood will forget soon what it's like to make an original movie .and they will focus on this unnecessary remake which I'm never mean bad but just unnecessary.Try to make something original instead of overusing same thing.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,,"Little Women was one of my most anticipated films of the year and it did not disappoint. It is a fantastic film. Although I do prefer Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird.Greta Gerwig is a fantastic director. She directs this film to perfection. It really is a great looking film with fantastic sets, costumes and really stunning cinematography.
Although a slow film, the film hooks you from the start with such a terrific script. It's such a beautiful film with wonderful characters. All 4 main characters are just perfect. And the bond between the 4 is insanely good. The film has a lot of heart and everything is handled so well.
Everyone here is really terrific. In fact it is one of the best acted films of the year. For me the highlight was definitely Saoirse Ronan who absolutely steals the show.
As far as flaws go, I suppose some of the scenes without Jo March are slightly less compelling but other than that this film is genuinely brilliant
Overall I loved it and it's one of the best films of 2019"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 May 2020,9/10,"Little Women's beauty lies in its simplicity and sincerity. The way Gerwig crafted the screenplay out of the book is both unique and yet clearly reminds you of the original material.
Although the story is a classic and is no doubt one of the most followed story in cinematic history (been made five times already in film) still this film successfully casts the story in a very contemporary way.Speaking of the performances, which is in fact the USP of the film. Ronan and Watson are breathtaking. Chalamet is seamless in his potrayal of Laurie. And Pugh is a revelation.Although the story is immortal but still Gerwig's reincarnation gave it a whole new life.An excellent film."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 May 2020,10/10,"I love this film because it supports women's' rights. The protagonists are very strong and smart. I was very sad when Beth died, but I realized that it Jo had to lose a sister to forgive a sister (Amy). I love its genuinely charming and entertaining storytelling and it's amusing acting. All in all, I highly recommend this beautiful movie to everyone who's willing to give this great film a try."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,8/10,"This film is simply spectacular! The acting is superb by everone in the cast, the attention to detail here is just breathtaking. I was wondering during the film that how much time and effort were into making this movie.I was a bit annoyed by the non-linearity of the script and thought it was overdone but besides that I enjoyed this film a lot. Go see this."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,9/10,"As much as I liked the 1994 movie of LITTLE WOMEN (with Winona Ryder as Jo March), it did not motivate me to read Louisa May Alcott's novel. However, the 2019 adaptation had exactly that effect on me. I just ordered a copy from Amazon.Though it's maybe ten minutes longer than I thought it needed to be (hence my ""9"" rating), LITTLE WOMEN is terrific! Yes, Greta Gerwig's script mixes in 21st-century gender politics, but never to the point that the film becomes preachy.There's not a character in this movie, even a minor one, with whom I wouldn't want to sit down and have a nice, long conversation. I cared very deeply about the Marches, the Laurences, et al, and was anxious to see what became of them. The film did not disappoint.LITTLE WOMEN is a gentle, life-affirming story that touched my heart in way that IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD simply did not. I would gladly watch it again."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,10/10,"I went into Little Women not having read the novel or having seen any of the adaptations. It's the best movie I've seen this year. Everything is superlative: Ronan's performance, Deslpat's score, Le Saux's cinematography, Gonchor's production design, and of course Gerwig's writing and direction.There are multiple times where this film looks like a painting. The scenes at the beach in particular are stunning, with one shot of Beth and Jo with sand swirling around them being my favorite of the film.I really hope this film isn't overlooked at the Academy Awards like it was at the Golden Globes. Gerwig absolutely deserves a best director nomination and I'd give her and the film the win. It's that good.Watched on Dec. 27, 2019"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,8/10,"Even though I've seen about 5 different versions of Little Women this film was super enjoyable. The acting was wonderful and all the actors fit their parts perfectly. This account decided to shake it up a bit by filming out of sequence, as Jo reflect by going back and forth in time, (which wouldn't have been my first choice but it was done very well.) Jo March, the writer of the family, tells the story of her and her 3 sisters coming of age in the years after the Civil War. The script is excellent, the movie is visually beautiful, and the actors draw you in to this heartwarming family of strong, vibrant, talented young ladies. You'll laugh and cry and leave the theater smiling. An enjoyable movie for the whole family and especially perfect for a mother-daughter date or ladies-night-out, In My Humble Opinion! (This film had several 2020 Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actress. It won for Best Costume Design) 8.5* 2020."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 August 2020,10/10,"This is an adorable film, I use the word adorable because Jo likes big descriptive words! :) and it made me adore the characters and care about their lives. The acting was spot on in my humble opinion. The emotions just poured from the characters and it was an emotional ride. Love this Film, I wish Hollywood would do more period pieces and classics! A MUST see."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 May 2020,8/10,"The beginning of the movie was already nearing the end, but the taste was not settled yet, with a beige curly hair growing like a weed, and Joe had been running for her writing career in New York. In the publishing house, ""usually the manuscript fee we give is 20 to 30 yuan, your one, I will give 20 yuan."" Qiao agreed to accept the two pieces of money and then picked up the skirt and hurriedly walked on the street. Knowing that she would come back here to fight arrogantly for another important work; Amy, who has become a celebrity in another compartment of Europe, met Laurie again, and the girl's heart was difficult to calm down. In the first five minutes of sitting in the cinema, I was full of question marks. Unlike the previous version, which started with a cold and warm Christmas, it showed the life scene of loving sisters. The new version of the movie tells you at the beginning: The little woman has Woman; the little boy is also wandering. It seems as if a gust of wind confuses your autumn leaves.
The film also has shortcomings. The four clues of the sisters of the original book have a clear contrast, and the use of brushwork is a group portrait.However, the film takes the timeline apart and tells it in a modern narrative way. The limitation of the film length is sloppy, and it may be difficult for the audience to understand.But the valuable thing about ""Little Women"" is that not only the story is outdated today, but also the positive, optimistic, and good attitude towards life is now very valuable.Moreover, even looking at the prosperous beauty of the protagonist, the oil painting-like lens, and the clothing with a sense of the age are enough to be pleasing to the eye. Don't say anything, go check it out."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,"It feels like a very fresh & modern take on a story from the 1860s. Beautiful to look at and wonderfully acted. It is fast-paced for a story of that era but I didn't mind that. There were too many charming characters, beautiful homes, and too much lovely music to let trivialities bother me."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,8/10,"This review is coming from someone who doesn't know the book and never seen any other Little Women movie. I completely fell in love with the story, it's simplicity, emotional twists and drama. The performances are fantastic and talk about a cast, probably one of the best in 2019. Since Meryl Streep to Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Saoirse Ronan and even Chris Cooper looks good on this movie. The future of Hollywood is very well preserved with all this talent, so young and already so well established in the industry (Eliza too!). Loved all the performances, specially Saiorse who gives such a brilliant performance it goes beyong supporting actress. The costume design are always so beautiful and the cinematography gorgeous. Saying that Gerwig was overlooked is an understatement as everything she did was nominated except herself. Hope it does well in the Oscars but if not, it remains one of my favorite movies of 2019!"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,4/10,"I went to see this film with my mother tonight after reading a rave review from A.O. Scott that convinced me this was something more than just a retouched chick flick. This movie, however, was not fun worth my losing sleep. The costumes, music, dancing, and cinematography are beautiful sure, but the story simply did not move me. My mom always spoke fondly of the Wynona Ryder version so I was expecting something grand and less provincial than this ultimately was. My main complaint is that the film was far too long for such little conflict. I hardly felt any attachment for any of the sisters other than my acknowledging their beauty and aesthetic pleasantness."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 September 2020,4/10,"Long, boring movie with meaningless topic. 100 years ago, as a book, yes maybe."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 March 2020,8/10,"It's only her 2nd movie as a director (following Ladybird in 2017) and I think this version of Little Women just goes to cement Greta Gerwig's place in the new wave of talented directors. Perhaps because she is a writer and actress by trade as well, which makes for a powerful combination.Of course a lot of the value of this story telling comes from the Louisa May Alcott's timeless novel.Still, the slightly tweaked scenes vs. the classic versions and the two parallel timelines with past and present of the characters are great achievements and notables twists to this version. I loved the lightning and overall colour scheme of the movie.Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh stood out to me as the best ones in the movie, portraying 2 of the 4 March sisters on which the movies focuses.
I didn't find Emma Watson - facial expressions and accent put me off - or Hollywood's hot property Timothee Chalamet particularly convincing. The last one because came cross as too young for the role he was portraying. Also, without spoilers, I was just not convinced by the developments of his romantic life.Definitely a good movie with a powerful message about women's role and expectations faced in society. Does a good service to the novel.Looking forward to watch whatever Greta Gerwig puts her mind to next."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 January 2020,6/10,"The writer / director must assume that everyone is familiar with the story, and so could creatively jump around in time, while compressing the story. For those who are not familiar with the story, it is just a confusing mess. In some cases, husbands show up without any hint of who they were or where they met that sister. I eventually had to find a summary of the story to realize that secondary character A was likely also secondary character B. Certain changes of heart also seem unexplained."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 February 2020,8/10,"LITTLE WOMEN - Thank you so much, Greta Gerwig for this beautifully storytelling film. It's been so long I had missed a film with full of joyous, happiness, struggles & tears in the cinema and this film gives me all these human emotions. The characters and the characterizations are so truly resemblance in our real life too. Always been a fan of actress Saoirse Ronan and director Greta Gerwig combo since Ladybird (2017). Highly recommended you all to watch this film in your nearest cinema"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 March 2020,10/10,"For the s scenery, funny script and Emma Watson in a corset"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 July 2020,8/10,"The story of four sisters in the threshold of womanhood, their dreams ,passions, fears, apprehensions, compulsions and compromises as they grow together. Jo March ( Saoirse Ronan) the protagonist so to say is a writer with great ambitions to publish her novel. See her as she writes day and night and then neatly arranges the pages on the floor. She has been told by the publisher that the heroine must get married in the end since thats what decent ladies do. The other sisters are Amy ( Florence Pugh, the painter), Meg (Emma Watson) the eldest is married to a school teacher and is in the process of adjusting with economic issues, and the youngest Beth ( Eliza Scalen) is afflicted with a terminal illness. Their father is away in the civil war, and they are looked after by marmee ( Laura Dern, superb as usual) and aunt March ( Meryl Streep, accomplished as usual).
The narrative ( despite being in non linear format) keeps it interesting in the sisters' pursuit of happiness as they navigate through the unpredictable phases of life. Director Greta Gerwig does an excellent job and is helped with the gorgeous costumes and the first rate cinematography. The countryside has been captured attractively."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,8/10,"This is the best adaptation of the book I have yet seen. Well worth watching.I have to question some of the negative reviews here, though. Many complain that it isn't as good as the 1994 version. Usually people like the first version of a movie they see, and cannot be objective when they see a subsequent version. I've been guilty of the same thing. But in this case, watching the two versions with an open mind, this is far better. It seems some of the people who prefer the 1994 version are doing so out of some misguided generational loyalty, which makes no sense. Movies should be judged as they are, not in comparison to any others that came before. Keep an open mind, and leave the preconceptions and generational biases at home.The worst reviews here are from people who don't know much about films. One reviewer complained that this wasn't as good as the ""original"". Movies and mini-series have been made from the book going back to 1917. So what is the ""original"" to him? The 1994 version, which is one of 20 or more adaptations of the book? Seriously?Please, if you are going to leave reviews, at least know what you are talking about."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 December 2020,6/10,"Surprising to see such a high rating for this movie, and I can only guess it's because people don't know the original story. The rating would be much lower if people understood how much stuff director Greta Gerwig changed and added. Greta is a great writer and director when doing her own projects. But when she took on this classic, she inserted herself too much.
First and foremost is the back-and-forth timeline. Don't pretend you had no problem keeping up. It was near impossible. You see a married couple, and then you see them meeting for the first time. Okay, that is obviously a flashback. But then you see a different couple, and you have no idea what timeline they are in. Jo has hair in one scene, and then it's gone, then back again. So it was easy to see which timeframe she was in. But not for any other character. The back and forth story frames was the same thing that ruined the last few seasons of LOST, and it was very intrusive of Greta to do that to Alcott's classic.
Next, we have Greta's own inventions, characters such as the book publisher who looks into the camera and speaks directly to us in the audience. I don't remember where that part was in the original book. Oh yeah, it wasn't. The director did this on her own and invented an unneeded story line where Jo March was the writer of Little Women, and not Louisa May Alcott. A huge mistake.
All 4 girls looked the same age, and this was a big casting mistake, plus Laurie looked 12 years old throughout. I know Great wanted to hire the A-list of young actors, but the characters are not the same age like these actors are."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,2/10,"Bored to hell, performances are so predictibles and also not easy to understand when is past or present,
great cast but no more, just a good cast"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,8/10,"Superb. Not a weak performance, except for Timothy Chalamet, who never outgrows being a pretty boy. (Perhaps Amy will man him up). Saoirse Ronan is an ideal Jo, full of intelligence, courage, pride and temperament. Amy finally gets to have her side of the story fairly heard, though not necessarily agreed with, instead of being the vain, shallow quasi-villain she's usually seen as. (I hope this is Florence Pugh's breakout role; she deserves it.) And Gerwig's idea of turning the book inside out, putting the second half in present time and telling the first through Jo's flashbacks, is in my opinion brilliant, because it puts the focus on the women that the March girls grew up to be."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,7/10,"NOTE: This review will be based on this film in general, I did not read Louisa May Alcott's novel or the other adaptations of the novel.Little Women is a 2019 film adapted and directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird). The film is based on Louisa May Alcott's famous 1868 novel Little Women. Little Women is the first book in Louisa May Alcott's Little Women series. The story revolves around the lives of four sisters growing up during and after the Civil War. With their father off fighting the war, the girls face the hardships and constraints of poverty and social expectations.My first impression of the film is that it is a bit slow, but not boring at all. The vast majority of the scenes are important in the film, if not all of them. Since I didn't read the novel I can't compare what I adapted from the book and what I didn't adapt to, or if they lacked important scenes. I have to say that sometimes I got a little confused when it was a flashback and when it was present, but as the film progresses you realize that when there are more blue dresses it is present and more red is a flashback.The acting is superb, each of the cast is incredible, I love with my heart to Saoirse Ronan and see him with Timothée Chalamet back gave me happiness, their facial expressions, the way they speak, their accents, everything is perfect. Florence Pugh had one of her best years with Midsommar and now this film, and I have to say she is one of the best actresses around today. Laura Dern is obviously perfect as always and I hope she wins with Marriage Story. Meryl Streep was like Meryl Streep and had very little time on screen (Bob Odenkirk appeared more than her and he appeared in the middle of the film).The cinematography was spectacular, each shot was incredible, and there is not much more to say.The production design and the dresses are what shine most in this movie, they make you feel like you're in the 19th century. The dress design is going to win at the next Oscars gala, they're spectacular, from the dresses that appear when they're the ""girls"" to the present, each one is beautiful.The editing and soundtrack were not the best of the film, the soundtrack of Alexandre Desplat was very good, not bad at all, but I would have wanted it to be more present and was not the best of him at all, I still think that The Grand Hotel Budapest is his best yet. On the other hand, the editing was a bit weak, when they changed you to flashback or present sometimes you didn't notice and there are scenes that are a bit badly edited where you realize that the cut is a bit badly done, but who cares?In conclusion it's a good film with good direction, good acting, soundtrack, cinematography, costume design, and production design but I feel it's not my kind of film."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 May 2020,8/10,"The new version of ""little women"" is by far the sharpest and most explicit dialogue of all, on marriage, career and social reality. Instead of playing with flowery words, women are allowed to express what they want very directly and pursue what they want, which is the real content of this book, and the version most in line with the world view of contemporary young women."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,1/10,This is not little woman and the actress are horrible also the've added scenes that were not in the book and amy was way miscast also i don't remember aunt march calling the family horrible or telly amy she was the only one to save the family also Christian bale was better as laurie to many flash backs the 1994 version is by far the best one there is no little woman in little woman 2019 and i have read the book and this Isn't it
LITTLE WOMEN,22 March 2020,8/10,"Pleasantly surprised after being persuaded by my wife to watch the film. Little Women is a spell binding, albeit slow paced film that is both sad and romantic. Though I've never read the book, Greta Gerwig's version of the film shows why it is such a literary masterwork, that these character's personality and desires are so tightly knit that you become attached to this loving yet struggling family. How Gerwig pieces the timeline is also notable in creating more suspense, and she is helped out by a marvellous cast. It seems like everything that pointed towards success for this effort."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,9/10,"Greta Gerwig did an outstanding job of making the characters lovable and empathetic. I rarely get emotional as I watch a movie. I never cried while I watched this one, but I felt my eyes welling up several times, even during the characters' happy scenes. I got more and more invested in the film as it progressed.For the most part the acting was outstanding, including probably Soairse Ronan's best performance ever. She was so great that she exposed a poseur- no offense to Emma Watson, who is stunningly gorgeous and did a serviceable job in this movie, but she doesn't belong in the same room with Soairse.I was introduced to these characters when I was a small child in the '80s. Gerwig did a great job of introducing them to the uninitiated."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 November 2020,8/10,"Little Women, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) flaunts an all-star cast featuring Saoirse Ronan (Lady Bird), Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Emily Watson (Harry Potter franchise), Eliza Scanlen (The Devil All The Time), Timothee Chalamet (Call Me By Your Name), Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and the Meryl Streep (too many to mention.) In comparison, the 1994 version featured Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale.Period movies can be a drag to others but this 5th theatrical version was consumable mainly because of the cast, and the bits and pieces about the movie such as the clothes of Jo (Ronan) and Teddy (Chalamet) showing some similarities to display their closeness, and how each sister had a distinguished color palette (which might've contributed to it's Best Costume Design win), as well as the March house, looking dull from the outside but very homely and alive inside. This attention to detail can sometimes spell the difference and is appreciated for a production that was in development hell since 2013.Ronan and Pugh were standouts (garnering Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nods respectively.) Ronan has been nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars every other year since 2016. Let's see if she makes it back in 2022 and be in the running as this generation's Meryl Streep. Speaking of, Streep was the one that suggested there'd be a speech about how discriminated against women were back then. Women have come a long way since then (mainly marriage has become a personal choice as opposed to an economic one) and should be the first ones to recognize other forms of discrimination and offer their support to each other (it's still baffling how misogynists world leaders are popular right now.) Maybe that's the reason we have a fifth version of this movie. We need to be reminded of how long we've come and how far we still need to go. Hopefully, when we get the sixth version, it's not because we need it anymore, but because we want it."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 August 2020,10/10,"I haven't read the book, but the adaptation struck me as a masterpiece by Greta Gerwig and Louisa May Alcott. Besides, it has a fantastic cast. Among my favorites is Ronan (Jo), Watson (Meg), Pugh (Amy), Scanlen (Beth), Dern (Marmee), Chalamet (Laurie). It seems like a compendium of talent and a multicultural environment of writers, painters, actresses, pianists, etc."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,8/10,"This is a fantastic movie. It is able to not follow some of the most important screenwriting advice (giving your protagonists a specific goal to pursue, for example) and succeed. The movie is always engaging and it never lost my attention. Having seen this film and the new Charlie's Angels recently, I can say that, unlike with Charlie's Angels dullness and pretentiousness, this is how one crafts a female-empowering movie.
The structure is also very interesting. It keeps the audience back and forth, past and present. It can be a little confusing as the movie starts, but one gets used to the pace.I'd have very few, small flaws to point out. We're constantly told Aunt March is mean, but we never really see her being bad. Cold, if anything, but even then she has some warm moments that make her lean more into the nice side. I also think there was a missed opportunity to have a big, conflictive scene when Jo decides she wants to marry Laurie, only to have him tell her she just married Amy.However it is, the movie is really good, and a serious contender for the awards season."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 August 2020,8/10,"Saoirse Ronan as Jo, is an absolute delight to watch. I believed in her character almost from the first frame, and even though the ending was just a little on the predictable side, I was really pleased she got what she always dreamed about, rather than just cow-towing to what society expects of young women of that era."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 February 2020,6/10,"But not great either. i love the book and i love the '94 version of this film. this one did not sit super well with me. i thought i would be confused by the flashbacks but i was not so that was a nice surprise. i also liked that beth was given more to work with. overall though the film felt like the actresses were mocking the material (or maybe i picked up on how much fun they had making the film. i don't know) either way the tone didnt fit right. wasn't upset about the ending like i thought i'd be because they did NOTHING to establish jo and bhaer's relationship. in fact, jo wasn't very likable at all. she came off quite selfish in the end. i don't have a lot more to say except surprisingly this cast looked WAY too young to play the ages they played in older years. timothee chalamet and florence pugh were the worst offenders. (pugh was the opposite actually. she looked too old) also, i don't know if this was the purpose, but they made the family look a hot mess. in the 94 version, for example, they're refined despite being poor. here, the girls were loud, boisterous, obnoxious. the film is called 'little women' but they did not behave like women at all."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,8/10,"The cast was impeccably chosen and performed no less impressively than expected! I'm not one to often choose movies of this time period, but I knew I wanted to because of the cast, and I was further enticed by the generous ratings; I'm so glad I did."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 May 2020,7/10,"I saw 2 other versions of ""Little Women"" To be honest I wasn't impressed with this version. I gave 4 for only the great actors/actresses in the movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,7/10,"FUN FACT:
There have been 8 film adaptations of the Louisa May Alcott novel and 5 of them are rated a 7.2 on IMDB. Also, 3 of these film adaptations have been within the last 3 years. For reasons unknown these facts amaze me.SYNOPSIS:
A story of Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) coming of age with her sisters while trying to support herself with writing stories for the newspaper and attempting to live outside of the social norm of what's expected of a woman during the 19th century.REVIEW SUMMARY:
This was a lovely cast with lots of chemistry. I started off really enjoying the film and would've rated it higher if it had not veered off of the strongest part of the story. In my opinion, Jo March's story was most interesting along with her friendship/romance with Laurie (Timothee Chalamet). Although they do make her the main character of the story, I felt they took a little too much time with some of the other sisters. I wish they did less with Meg March (Emma Watson) and Amy March (Florence Pugh) had a situation where her half of the story could've been really interesting, but it almost felt like a huge important chunk of her story was left on the cutting room floor. With that being said, the movie was very sweet, but I think it's going to fall a little bit outside of my top 10 for this year. 7.4/10.-------------------------------------BREAKDOWN------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
Greta Gerwig is a solid director, but between this and ""Lady Bird"", she isn't necessarily a name I need to go out and see work from. I understand that these two films have been very critically acclaimed, but I have yet to be convinced through the direction. There's nothing that I see and think ""wow, no other director could do that."" In fact, between these last two I think there are quite a few that could successfully pull these films off. There have literally been 7 other directors of Little Women (even if this has the highest rating of them all). This is more of an editing flaw, but there were times near the beginning where I wasn't quite sure which time-period we were in. Like, we're flipping between present day (in the film) and 7 years prior and though I had a hunch which point in time were at due to the color difference, I still struggled a couple of times. Also, why was Timothee Chalamet's hair all ""cover of GQ magazine?"" I was waiting for him to pull out his iPhone 11.WRITING:
Now Greta Gerwig strived here in the writing. Give credit to Louisa May Alcott for the original story, but Greta Gerwig did write the screenplay. It's always hard to adapt a book into a movie and it's impossible to compare when you're like me and haven't read the book. As I mentioned in my review summary, there were flaws. Specifically with the character of Amy March. There's a subplot of the story with her and someone else where I don't really know how the transition from 7 years prior to present day happened. It really didn't make sense to me and that's all I can say without spoiling it. That's why I feel like there was possibly more to her story that would patch that up, but it wasn't in the movie and that's unfortunate, because her story might've been the most interesting, if not for Jo's story.ACTING:
Everything is amazing her except for one minor thing. Emma Watson does not have the American Accent down. Clearly they weren't going for a Mid-Atlantic accent as people had during that period, so her having trouble with the American accent through me off slightly. Again, very slightly, not enough to make me hate it or anything and I could never hate Emma Watson. She might be my dream girl. Her natural beauty is something of angels. *clears throat* Anyway, the acting in this film is so good otherwise. Timothee Chalamet is A-List and Florence Pugh kills it. Honestly, I wouldn't be mad if anyone in this film was nominated for an Oscar, but I don't think any of them should win an Oscar. I could most definitely see this film winning a Best Ensemble award."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 September 2020,8/10,"Full disclosure - I have never read the book.Louisa May Alcott's classic novel Little Women, one of the most beloved in the American literary repertoire, has been a source of many cinematic adaptations. While the 2019 version is a very good movie, it is different from other adaptations and makes major changes from the book and other adaptations. If you have not read the book or seen another adaptation, do not watch this. The original novel follows a very tight chronological order, whereas this version jumps around the story. If you've seen another version or read the book, it should be fine. But if you've never seen it, you'll be baffled through the first half.But this is a good movie nonetheless. It's an overall very high-quality production, but the best thing about it is the cast. Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy, and Eliza Scanlon as Beth. It's also boosted by an excellent supporting cast, which includes Timothy Chalamet as Laurie, Laura Dern as Marmie, and Meryl Streep as Aunt Marsh. The performances are fantastic, as is the chemistry built between the characters. The costume design, for which it won an Oscar, is fantastic. It feels very authentic to the time period, which the setting helps. While the order of events is odd, it is very well edited. One thing it did wrong, was that death scene should have been a bit more emphasized.The thing that separates this version from others is that it tries to modernize the story to a certain extent, particularly regarding the feminism aspects. On one hand, it does drift away from the original novel. On the other, it feels neither preachy nor out of place, which are the two ways that that could go wrong. It's easy to tell some parts that wouldn't be present in a novel written in 1869, but it doesn't feel so far detached that it's distracting.By the way, isn't it ironic that Little Women is one of the most popular American novels and the four of them are played by two Brits, and Aussie, and an Irishwoman?"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,5/10,"I'm really not sure what to make of this rote and cliched Saturday afternoon filler. Set in the 1800s during the civil war, four daughters are being parented by their mother while their father is away at war fighting the good fight.The daughters are: The writer; the artist; the earnest one; the musician. Saoirse Ronan does a fine job as a young woman looking to express her self and her frustrations at the limitations put upon her by society's expectations of what a woman ought to be. Florence Pugh turns it up to eleven as the moody artistic one, and it gets very tiring watching her be so hammy. Emma Watson simply can't act; anything other than eyebrow conrtorting earnestness or simpering niceness is beyond her. Eliza Scanlen is the least annoying because there's not much for her to do except be off-screen for her biggest moment.With all the fuss being made over it I was expecting something radical and biting, but this is limp and uninvolving. An absolute trudge that not one of our mixed lot enjoyed, beyond seeing Ronan and Chalamet's work so well together.Pity."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,10/10,"My heart skipped a beat several times (no exaggeration) upon seeing some of the picture book scenes. We have not seen such perfection in staging, color, and lighting since David Lean. Greta Gerwig has entered the filmmaker hall of fame with this truly epic film. I will not quibble about the script, because there are too many good things happening here to pick out flaws, and it is too good for Hollywood, bypassing many of the modern tropes for authenticity.There are three movies here beginning with; child-like hope for the future, disappointment and bitterness over reality, and then what we find during the last third of the film, about which I shall not comment. It is worth the trip.See it in a theater now, especially if you are in your thirties or younger and have only been exposed to the films of the 90's up until now, when real film was eschewed for colorless videos. This one was made with real film's rich texture, depth, and true-ness. These are wonderful locations and settings. Not one scene is given short shrift and there are none lacking attention to detail.It does seem too long at times so be prepared to relax and absorb. In some ways it is an homage to another great period piece in honor of a classic book ""Pride and Prejudice,"" by the amazing Joe Wright. Greta with this film rivals that one. Her script is not better, but her craftsmanship is equal to or greater.Team up with Whit or Noah again Greta, and write your own story with all of
the sparkle of your past films and all of the magic of this one.PS For the critics I would add that most of the world does not have social security. Asians are taught from a young age they will have to support parents when they become too sick or too old to work. Most continents have the same ethic and tradition out of necessity. In the time of Louisa May Alcott marriage and family were everything in the USA and Europe, just like the rest of the world. How you chose meant survival or no survival. Not choosing both was rarely an option. Was life made better after the government got involved in every part of our lives?"

LITTLE WOMEN,25 December 2019,2/10,"Do we really need a 13th version of this project? Hollywood has become a recycle machine, pumping out old stories and exploiting the ignorance of audiences."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 December 2020,9/10,"I initially thought I was going to watch a good-story but one using the old ''Pride and Prejudice'' pattern that I'm already used to. The beginning felt a bit slow, I wasn't quite sure where was it going but by the half of the movie it struck me : this is a breath of fresh air. ''And I'm so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for''I feel this story is for classical romance what a revisionist western is for a classical western. Both are great, both are different and both are needed. Otherwise you get used of the same old kind of story and you become blase about it. And if there are too many stories that follow a more contemporary approach you are going to miss and want the old ''Cinderella'' story. So, a bit of both is just perfect.Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh are gorgeously here, and the rest of the cast also acts good. Great cinematography, great dialogue, maybe the beginning could have been modified a bit so I can get immersed faster into the story but it's still ok.A 9,5 out of 10 from me."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,8/10,"I've read the book a dozen times and have seen many film adaptations so am thoroughly conversant with the material and so enjoyed it. At the beginning even I was confused at why it was starting at the end. If you didn't know who the characters were you had to be massively confused. Especially with the time jumping back and forth without any real clear delineation. Adding to the confusion was that none of the girls seemed to change in age right up to the end.That said, I really loved the casting. I think Ronan was amazing. They had nice chemistry and it was beautifully shot.I really prefer just a straight telling of the story. And it didn't do justice to Marmie and was a waste of Laura Dern. I felt the whole thing was chaotic and disjointed. Imagine how someone who does t know the books must feel."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 April 2020,8/10,"Cars are great, though the nonlinear narrative has a bit overcomplicate the whole story, the overall feeling is still very light. Perhaps when a woman no longer expresses her independence and freedom by resisting marriage, such a society can be regarded as basically fair."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,5/10,"I saw the movie as a companion to my wife in a theater mostly filled up by women. Since the movie is based on a classic novel, there's only so much freedom for the plot to offer something new. Having not read the book, I had the initial impression that the script stuck to the original story which seems to spring from a Harlequin novel. In reference to Pride and Prejudice, I could tell this was a New England version of a Jane Austin's novel, whose theme was apparently in fashion in the 19th century. Later, I found out that the book has much more depth and nothing to do with the silly matchmaker theme which permeates the entire movie.On the positive side the acting was good especially with an above the average performance from Saoirse Ronan who leads the story. The shots were mostly indoors, with the exception of a few street views of the time. So, there was hardly an effort and spending for the re-enactment of 1860s New England. The nonlinear narrative for the storytelling was acceptable only if it could go beyond a mishmash of flimsy subplots which lack drama and tension to keep the audience awake during the character development phase. Indeed, the flow was quite boring in the first hour. The story only became interesting in the last half hour or so, after a love triangle started to appear.In a nutshell, the story is about a family with four coming of age daughters in American civil war years. The dad goes to the front and the mom takes on volunteer tasks leaving the girls at home most of the days. While the family supposedly goes through wartime difficulties (which we hardly notice in the movie) their next door neighbors (a middle age man and his grandson, Laurie) live a posh life in a big manor. Although the girls and Laurie are good friends, Laurie's affection for Jo is obvious. As a rich boy, he's a perfect candidate as a husband but Jo has other aspirations in life.The film has some subplots to show the reward of kind spirits but indeed they are naive and stir resentment instead of admiration. In one scene, we see the girls at the breakfast table in a Christmas morning. The mom joins them and mentions a less fortunate family who are hungry in a cold house. She proposes giving breakfast food as a Christmas gift to the poor family. The girls happily agree and take food in baskets to the family's home. On their return to home, they see their breakfast table is abundant with all kind of decadent desserts and food beyond their means, apparently as a gift from their rich neighbor for their kind-heartedness. Now, this is supposed to be a heart-warming story but only annoys me with the thought of the rich neighbor not helping those poor people in the first place.One doesn't need to read the book to tell that the feminist overtone in the dialogues between the publisher and Jo, Amy's speech to Laurie couldn't exist in the original story owing to its time. Even the inkling of feminism in 1860s is utterly absurd and oxymoron considering the whole subject matter of the film is about some middle-class country girls chasing a wealthy heir dearly for a prospective husband. This is nothing but a conspicuous bastardization of a classic novel out of director's zeal to play to the gallery.Besides that, I found the characters too good to be real. Laura Dern is very boring in her single-dimensional angelic role. Everybody is kind to others at all times and nobody loses her temper. All four girls live in peace and harmony with no dispute. The only notable incident is Jo's natural reaction to Amy after she burns Jo's novel in a rage of jealousy and it is short lived. I didn't go to the theater with the expectation of seeing cracking bones, car chases or blood and gore, but still found the male characters too girly, soft and indeed somewhat wimpy as in the case of Laurie.In an interview, I saw Greta Gerwig expressing her bitterness for not being nominated as the best director award despite other nominations of the movie, including the best picture. Her innuendo and some blatant criticism from other circles for the sexism in the movie industry were all over the place. In my opinion, the movie's nomination for the best picture award is a gross exaggeration. Considering the directorial flaws, leaving her outside best director nomination shows the existence of some sane people who can still judge an award for the merit rather than being subjugated to the rising tide of the day."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,10/10,"Reading Little Women when I was younger I felt that Louisa May Alcott had written her four heroines as the type of girl I wanted to be. Each of the sisters in the United States Union had talents and gifts that I couldn't hope to achieve as a single girl of course. And in the Confederate South of the country at the same time was Scarlett O'Hara and her Southern Belle lifestyle, with her great love Rhett Butler. The pleasure of books was always that you could imagine becoming the character you were reading about. I like to think that maybe even Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennett of Pride and Prejudice had some influence on Jo March. And for today's young girls Greta Gerwig has created a Little Women to encourage them to use their talents to achieve what they want. I love that Friends even had the story line with Rachel and Joey swapping books, she reading The Shining and he her Little Women. The viewers of Friends today would be encouraged to go see this fantastic new adaptation.Greta has successfully switched the story line so we remember the sisters youth in flashbacks, to illustrate their present. And we start midway in the book with Jo, played by the always incredible Saoirse Ronan, lodging in New York, and trying to sell her writing to Tracy Letts's publisher Mr Dashwood. He wants pot boilers and if the main character isn't married at the end, then kill her off instead. Elder sister Meg played by Emma Watson is already married to the penniless but so handsome James Norton's John Brooke, with children. This Little Women has moved fast to Good Wives and Little Men. Florence Pugh is the delightfully well mannered, but at times dastardly Amy, just missing Elizabeth Taylor's peg for her nose. And Eliza Scanlen plays sweet shy Beth. I must also at this point praise Chris Cooper's Mr Laurence. The March's wealthy neighbour. The two of them mainly responsible for my many tears over the piano.The period during and after the Civil War, and the genteel poverty of the Massachusetts March household is fabulously created by Jess Gonchor's production design. With sumptuous set decoration by Claire Kaufman. The cinematography by Yorick Le Saux is like watching paint dry by the great Renoir and his fellow Impressionist artists, with Cortès's street scenes. And by this I actually mean terrific in every sense. But the grand master is Greta Gerwig herself. I've followed her since Frances Ha, and Lady Bird was one of the many films I enjoyed but sadly never got round to reviewing. Hopefully this is my amends and at the forthcoming awards hope she is well and truly considered.The female March household is run by Laura Dern's Marmee. Having quite the career at the moment and beautifully done. Quietly encouraging her girls to be who they want to be. Aided by Jayne Houdyshell's Hannah, always ready with a pair of shoes. And those beautiful costumes by Jacqueline Durran, with a palette that she developed for each of the sisters from the colour of the Christmas book they received at the beginning of the novel. And Meryl Streep is the rich and haughty Aunt March. Being so rich she can say and do exactly as she likes. And she advises a good marriage is all the girls should aspire to, as they are not rich. She is hilarious with Meg's choice! But comes through in the glorious ending that makes you want to cheer.And Timothée Chalamet is Laurie. Mr Laurence's grandson. A rich idler whose charmed lifestyle we see first through the eyes of John Brooke, his then exasperated tutor, and later through Amy. His wild cavorting is not something available to John or any of the March sisters. As Amy points out to him the inequality of men and women (even when married). However rich. And he seems perfectly cast as the floppy haired louche. The great love story that never was, but all the March sisters seem to be a little in love with him, and the rest!, and he with them. And far too neat for an ending with Jo. To the distraught Mr Dashwood. Stop me if you don't know the story but she meets her own Professor Friedrich Bhaer. I loved how Laurie is jealous of the talented newcomer, he can play the now silent piano!, but caring, as Jo's protective new brother-in-law. Friedrich played by Louis Garrel being the equal in every way to Jo. And not afraid to criticise, much to her surprise. I like this new Professor very much. But how we wanted Jo and Laurie. And it almost happened this time. But fortunately the letter gets ripped up just when it's already too late.In a nice touch of fiction becoming fact, one of the later scenes shows Jo negotiating the publication of her novel Little Women. We can imagine Louisa May Alcott negotiating her own book deal, and then we watch the beautiful printing and binding of the story of the March sisters lives. And Mr Dashwood's children urging him to hurry more of the earlier chapters was like the Harry Potter of the day. Written by Jo's urgent ink stained fingers.Greta's Little Women made me want to go a wassailing again as a shout out to Winona Ryder's own Jo March. But the new Little Women are surely our best yet. A dream cast and talented crew in a gorgeous female centred production by a director who really cares about the love and friendship between the sisters, family and their friends."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 November 2021,6/10,"I haven't seen the 1994 version so don't have that to compare to. I was a little disappointed in this, I thought it was a nice film but not as inspiring as I think it could be. What was very memorable however is the chemistry between Chalamet and Ronan. I was already a Ronan fan but this confirmed for me how brilliant she is. And this was the first work from Chalamet that I had seen but it made me very excited about the rest of his career as his talent and potential really shone through."

LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2021,,"This is a familiar tale. Backed by a substantial budget, it has high production values, including the costumes of the ladies and the New England settings.In terms of casting, I felt that Emma Watson and Florence Pugh were too old for their roles. Though Saoirse Ronan acquitted herself well, as usual immersing herself in her character.The movie is charming. Affluent young girls are about to enter society and find a match for themselves. The movie starts with a swirl and girlish laughter. Proceeds along the familiar story line, though with some annoying modern innovations. Ends happily for the family.I have to compare this film with the TV miniseries starring Maya Hawke. Those girls living in genteel poverty are lovely. Generating a great deal of sympathy for their plight and their travails. Maya Hawke achieving dignity and pathos."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2021,9/10,"Its one of the best ever acting Ive seen from a female lead - words cant describe the amazing nonchalant emotions and body language displayed in every second of the film by this lead - Ronan. Its been a few years since Ive enjoyed a women's acting every second of the film-By far, no competition unless politics play role, in getting the Oscar."

LITTLE WOMEN,27 March 2020,8/10,"I have been a big fan of Emma Watson for a long time, she is pretty beautiful.Another two actresses are also very good in this wonderful movie.I like it."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 April 2020,7/10,"Too early to meet, always because still don't know how to cherish and separate, like the lyrics: ""later, I finally learned how to love, but you have long gone, disappeared in the crowd. When you meet the right person at the wrong time, you are bound to miss them."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 June 2020,9/10,"Greta Gerwig's modern 'spin' on Little Women here emerges like faint ripples across the surface of a pond. It's subtle, never forced and doesn't throw you out of the book. It's just there, like something gazing back at you through the most delicate and shimmering metallic curtain. The whole film comes across with a confidence that one can truly luxuriate in and come to trust. It's exquisite to look at, the performances are staggeringly in tune, with perhaps only one or two sequences where the dialogue between characters was approaching the speed of light perhaps unnecessarily. However, who is still around today to actually confirm how certain sectors of young women conversed with one another back in the day? Little Women contains no overblown stereotypes, no violence, no cataclysms, no ratcheting of tension, it's simply a classic and this 2019 revision renders it a supreme entertainment."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 February 2020,8/10,"I liked this movie, but I didn't love it. I feel as though I could (maybe) love it over time. My main gripe is the meta climax that hinges on a callback to an earlier joke about publishing stories. Regardless, it is worth watching at least once."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,1/10,"If there was ever a way to turn a charming girlie novel into a boring movie about relationships, Greta Garwig seems to have found it. About a third of the way through, the question arises ""where is this movie headed""? Then the realization hits that there were several flashbacks without the slightest clue as to what time the movie is portraying. No differences in hair styles, clothing or any of the other flashback signs. As a result, it appears as if the American Civil War takes a decade to come to a conclusion. The net effect is like rooting through a dumpster of unsorted garbage.Unless you like movie directors playing artsy tricks with your mind, give this movie a pass."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,8/10,"The movie has various topics in the process of women's growth: the choice of love and freedom, the exploration of soul and wealth. Jo is ordinary and representative. She is always looking for the life she really wants and to understand how women should live. In our time, there are many things that were scarce and are gradually depreciating. Women have many crossroads in their lives. What the stories of these four sisters are playing for us is that life is not a question and answer question at all, but a multiple choice question. Meg chooses a home, Jo chooses freedom, Amy chooses what she loves, and Beth chooses silence. In life, comedy, bitterness, arrogance, and silence may be staged from time to time. The freedom of choice is in our hands. For the rest of our lives, we will live boldly and experience it with love and freedom."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,10/10,"A movie with soul in it. Perfect acting everybody, logical events and story. Very good storytelling mixing childhood events with present throughout all the movie.
You sense warm and humanity coming toward you if you choose to watch it."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,9/10,"I found it a bit long for my taste - but other than that, no complaints.
Good cinematography, good background score and loved the constant flashbacks to present takes.
Florence's role as Amy was really good, but so was Saoirse's as Jo's.
Overall, really good entertainment and a feel good movie!"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2020,9/10,"This movie proves that Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors working right now. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works very well. The performances are brilliant, the score is absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is incredible, the narrative flows back and forth perfectly, and this movie is very emotional as well. I never read the book or seen the other film adaptations, but I thought the story was very beautiful and engaging, so I''m not surprised why so many people are drawn to this story. Overall, I think this is another great film from Greta Gerwig, and I can't wait to see what she does next."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,"This is a beautiful film, and I highly recommend it, but for those of us who read ""Little Women"" decades ago and don't vividly remember the storyline Greta Gerwig's new time-traveling screenplay makes the experience more of an occasionally jarring, confusing experience than an enjoyably immersive one. (Update: saw it again a week later and realized the idea works beautifully if you do know the story--I loved the film on second viewing). The entire cast is very often spectacularly talented and watchable, and the direction is undeniably assured, so all is forgiven for that first-time viewing disorientation, and I definitely now recommend a second viewing for those of us who left the film confused and a bit unsatisfied the first time around. Turned out to be one of my favorite films of the year after that second viewing."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,I LOVED this movie . I love the book . I love the 94 version . I love the BBC version.. so to be fair I went in knowing I would love it .If you compare there could be an entire list of things that were better in this version .. were better in that .. fit the book and didn't ect . But overall this was AMAZING.Visually this was absolutely beautiful . The actors are so extremely talented . My one beef here is that they should have recasted Amy for flashbacks to make her seem younger . She seemed to forced as a 12-14 year old and looks too old.Meg was my favorite adaptation in this version . I felt we knew her character in a new and more intimate way than ever before . I also loved Fredrick he was adorable and although did not have much screen time you could see why Beth ends up loving him .Loved the ending . Loved the camera angles . At the end when the past and present converge ! That was genius .This is an important story . Empowered women help empower other women . There isn't one right way to be a women or a feminist . And this shows us that in a powerful and touching way . Women need other women and this is an amazing reminder of that .
LITTLE WOMEN,4 November 2020,7/10,"That many stars never does good to the movie. Casting as a part of promotion is a bad practice. Most people here are too young and beautiful and are bad matches for characters. Emotions are unrealistic, superficial. Acting is mediocre and sometimes unbelievably bad. Attempts at moralizing are weak and unfinished. Classic story spoiled. There is one good thing besides production quality - happy ending, which the right choice as this film does not qualify as drama, due to so many thing done wrong."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,5/10,"'Little Women' is simply a story of its time ... and a bit of a boring one at that. If Greta Gerwig can't make it captivating, nobody can."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 January 2020,10/10,"I would like to hang out with these characters. These ""little women"", if you will. They exhibited themselves with such boisterous youthful brashness that I often found myself laughing, if not gut-chuckling. What a wonderful family-unit; but no, more of a {italics}sister-unit{italics} than a family-unit. I loved the way they got on together and had a whale of a time. (Yet there were also some sad scenes that caused my eyes to self-lubricate.)My favorites were Amy (Pugh) and Jo (Ronan). Amy was rather forceful, fun-loving, raucous, yearning, excitable, whim-worthy, world-trodden, and multifaceted. And she was proud of her feet. Jo, for her part, was well-reasoned, impassioned, headstrong, determined, focused, social-sickened, expectation-allergic, hubby-shunning, void-gazing, and contemplative. And she was a non-breeder.The framing was excellent, some of the best I've ever seen. There were shots of swooning countrysides, stately mansions, comfy cottages, bustling theatre-facades, shivering staircases, glistening snow-scapes, and swirling sand-winds.Greta Gerwig did a great job! 💃💅👠👗🏡"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 April 2020,8/10,"When a woman no longer expresses independence and freedom by resisting marriage, such a society can be considered as basically fair. The casts are very good, youth is invincible. Although the non-linear narrative has a little overcomplicate the whole story, the overall feeling is still very light."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 March 2020,8/10,"Little Women is made with so much heart, love and enthusiasm both behind and in front of the camera that even the deeply sad scenes still fill you with joy and longing. Jo -Saoirse Ronan, Timothée Chalamet, meg- Emma Watson, James Norton, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern, Amy-Florence Pugh and beth- Eliza Scanlen are such wonderful actors and actresses that brought the story to life.I have not read the book, however, I enjoyed the story and it made a good job to show the struggles of adolescence around love, dreams, desires and disappointments.It is the story of the four march sisters growing learning about the world together. The story does revolve back & forth in a seven-year period, and at times it can be tricky to figure out where the story is.A huge thing the movie did right was the visuals. They are absolutely stunning. Colors are so vibrant, and the scenery is beautiful. Outfits, hair and makeup are also spot on.I did not doze off a bit and came to know the movie was 2.15 hours long after the end. this movie is really enjoyable. One of the most enjoyable movies recently I have watched,nice, funny, sad, cute and gorgeous."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 March 2020,9/10,"I thought it will be just another overrated lame movie but it over exceeded all my expectations. The storyline is simple but the way the movie is made makes it look more complex. Loved the fact that when the scenes were about the past the colors were more warm but when they was in the present the colors looked colder. Greta did an amazing job! It was like reading a book with my eyes, and I loved that sensation."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 April 2020,8/10,"I love watching these kind of movies. And this is a movie which entertains and teaches, so basically it matches the two most important criteria of a good movie. If you want to watch a story about some little women, their wishes, their emotions, their talents and their will to get success in their respective fields and their struggles while getting entertained then you should watch it."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 November 2020,3/10,"At times beautiful and compelling. Mostly confusing and difficult to hear their words. Pugh has a strange voice and took me out of every scene she spoke. Saoirse is great but even she couldnt disguise her accent consistently. Overall a choppy mess. Characters reading their letters at the camera. Some peculiar decisions.
I still dont know what makes this a classic after so many renditions. There are some great themes and scenes here though reminding us that life is heavy and romantic. I wanted more story and dynamics between sisters."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 December 2019,10/10,"Suffice it to say that this film is destined to be a perennial, like ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE or MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET. The stand-out performance is Laura Dern's. As Jo, Saoirse Ronan is more the glue holding the narrative together, generously supporting all the others. Even the things worthy of criticism enhance the entertainment value. The poverty of the wartime March family--indeed the entire Civil War aspect of the story-- is played down. Costumes and interiors are affluent, bordering on Gilded Age. Like many other period films, there are far too many candles and oil lamps lit in the daytime with sun streaming in the windows. This is LITTLE WOMEN seen through the prism of contemporary gender politics, and that is okay by me!"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,8/10,"I liked this film quite a lot, but I didn't love it as much as many. I really respect and admire Greta Gerwig's auteurship, and think this was a nice re-telling of the story. I loved what she did with time, jumping back and forth, and knitting the various pieces together into a coherent and fresh take. It was a more interesting presentation of this well-trod tale, rather than just telling it in a linear fashion. Lots of other good things about it, too. But, I spent the first half of the film sulking a bit, realizing that I'm probably prejudiced against the source material. American literature from the 19th century, be it Alcott, Twain, Hawthorne, or any of their lot, has always been my least favorite genre, even though the single best teacher I've ever had was for junior year high school English which was American literature and while she set me on the path of thinking critically and expressing myself with words, even she couldn't get me to love most classic American novels. Don't let my lukewarm review or dyspeptic demeanor dissuade you; I definitely recommend seeing it if you're a fan of the story or any of the cast. It's an empowering tale told well."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 February 2020,5/10,"The acting is great and all, and cinematography is flawless but the screenplay and the way this was edited made it barely watchable. The way the movie constantly goes back and forth in time is just so incredibly annoying. Why would anybody do this?? It's so confusing. Halfway through the movie I was ready to give it up but I figured if it's nominated for movie of the year I must give it a fair chance. And although it did get a little better the whole thing was just overall a mess. I don't know... something about this movie just didn't feel right. Don't regret watching it but definitely wouldn't wanna watch again."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 May 2020,10/10,"Little Women(2019) is in fact the best ever drama adapted screenplay I have seen in the last decade. The film is the seventh adaptation of the same novel published in the 1880's. This version makes exceptional claim as the best ever adaption because of the star cast. The inclusion of Saoirse Ronan's talent and the emotional countenace of Elisa Scanlen strongly affirms that claim. Emma Watson and Florence Pugh all stars. These actresses are natrually gifted. The film is centered on Jo March, a talented and passionate writer played by Saoirse Ronan. She is the eldest of four beautiful talented interdependent sisters. The film is directed by Greta Gerwig, her understanding of the original story takes this version to an extra mile.The plot of the film follows Jo March a talented writer who lives with her mother Marmee played by Laura Dern and her three other Sisters; Meg March played by Emma Watson, Amy March played by Florence Pugh and Beth March played by Elisa Scanlen. They have lingering youthful memories that include flashbacks from each girl.
Jo March's flashbacks reveal how she met Laurie, played by Timothee Chamalet, a boy from a wealthy neighboring house.
Laurie became a family friend but with time he deeply fell in love with Jo March. However, Jo March rejects Lauries proposal by saying she is not ready to love and live with him at the expense of her writing. She sees marriage as an economic proposition. Left broken hearted, Laurie decides to live on but promised Jo March that he'll watch as she finds someone, love him and have babies with him. Will Jo March find somebody or return to Laurie?
Little women is set during the dying embers of the American Civil War; giving the film's cultural elegance and affluence.
This film is moving in every scene that passes by. The emotions were natural and eventually heightened by the passing away of Beth March. One cannot hold tears at this point. In fact I was broken, touched and all tears from that scene. The background score made the emotions real and electric throughout.
How Elisa Scanlen played her role also made the emotions exceptional. She adapted the character superbly and delivered a five star performance.
This is the best drama film ever to be on screens. Whenever I pull a pen and paper to compile a list of best films, Little Women (2019) will always be in the top three.
I strongly and boldly recommend this film to all fans irrespective of one's favourite genre. Give this film a try and you'll never regret paying a dime."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 August 2020,10/10,"A very completed film with a perspective of woman and family, a must watch movie"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2020,9/10,"People are completely different in character, united by family ties. A stunning touching story of a dream and love. Temporary parallels harmoniously telling the full story."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,10/10,"This movie is a complete on, cinematography writing and acting. Perfect in every way. Soirse ronan is incredible, i always enjoyed her movies but this one was awesome."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 October 2020,4/10,"A scattered mess for much of the movie, the story jumps back and forth between two time frames, often without any cues we've left one and hopped to the other. Although it was a painfully slow and boring film, it seemed as if the writer felt they didn't have enough time to tell the whole story, leaving the viewer confused and unsatisfied.The movie ends strong and ties a nice bow on everything, saving the movie from being a waste of time. The actress playing Jo was fantastic and stole the show, and the costumes are phenomenal. Throw in some nice scenery and a few laughs and you end up with an underwhelming, but not too terrible movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 September 2021,8/10,"I kept trying to postpone watching the movie, until I've read the book, but I released that wouldn't happen soon and watched it anyway. I haven't watched the 1994 version, nor the series, so I don't have a direct comparison. Barring that, the movie by itself is powerful, dreamy, and rich. Saoirse Ronan (Jo March) put up a splendid person, it was difficult to not fall in love with her. And all the other characters fell in place so perfectly, it felt like they belonged there, the chemistry was unmatched. Though I am slightly disappointed in Timothee Chalamet (Lauri), he did not do justice to the character.The ending made me feel so empowered, the entire movie is moving. I wish this was a mini-series though instead of a movie. There's so much to be said in such little time and while Greta Gerwig gave us a masterpiece, it did feel rushed."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 March 2020,8/10,"At first I was hestitant of watching this film; would it be one I'd enjoy? It seemed rather dull. As the Oscars came and it fell into the prices, I gave the film a shot. And oh boy, this was far greater than I thought it would be. The setting was amazing and beautiful. Writing and acting was great and even though there wasn't much of a gripping story, this film had me hooked until the very end."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,7/10,"Firstly, Saoirse Ronan's performance was first class. I really enjoyed the film, but I also have a lot of niggles about it.
I didn't like the way the story jumped backwards and forwards; the first time was fine but then it got confusing.
The seven year time difference was not evident in the characters' appearance, especially that of Amy and Laurie. It worked perfectly in the Winona Ryder version of the film, when Kirsten Dunst played young, annoying, spoilt Amy - only to be replaced by the pretty, sophisticated Samantha Mathis later on. Timothee Chalamet's performance was excellent, but spoiled by the fact he never grew up in 7 years. He could at least have changed a bit! It's a real shame as this film had the potential of being the best."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,9/10,"I totally expected to not like this movie. Initially, I only wanted to see it because of Timothee Chalamet... I love that actor. He hasn't been in many things but I see everything he's in. His role is great with a few subtle laugh out loud moments.I'm not a big fan of Saoirse Ronan but she honestly knocks it out of the park in this movie. Great performance! Not one complaint.I'm also not a huge fan of Greta Gerwig. Before this movie came out, early critics were saying it was Greta's Taxi Driver(I saw a headline that threw that out there). I immediately rolled my eyes. I'm not sure if it's the greatest movie out there but it's certainly Greta's best and it's the adaptation that would've made Alcott happy.There are a million great things about this movie. The cast: From Emma Watson to Meryl to Bob to Florence Pugh to Laura Dern... it's wow on all levels. I honestly can't believe Florence Pugh was in Midsommar that I saw earlier in the year. Great actress and I feel like we'll be hearing from her in the future.See this movie. I think it'll be one that we remember in the distant future. I doubt it's going to win any Oscars besides maybe costume design but it might sneak in their and get one of the screenplay awards."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 March 2020,7/10,"Already one of my favourite cinematic experiences in a while. There are a few detractions for this new 2019 Little Women, the biggest being how confusing it can get with it's melded chronologies, I understood it but I can see it being a problem for many. If this is your first exposure to Alcott's story, I fear you'll get lost more than a few times trying to keep everything in order. This newly structured, reinvigorated, charming remake of a literary classic feels definitely of the period and of today and it works. It's the first Little Women adaptation that made me realise how timeless this story really can feel in the right hands. Greta Gerwig is on a role, it may not be on the level of Lady Bird but it's an amazing step in the right direction. It may be the millionth version but it might be the best one yet.Mitchell Bulfin"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 February 2020,3/10,"We had a great evening! My wife and I started watching Little Women (2019) and about 20 minutes into it we switched it off and watched Little Women (1949) instead, with June Allyson as Jo, Peter Lawford as Laurie, Margaret O'Brien as Beth, Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, Janet Leigh as Meg, Rossano Brazzi as Professor Bhaer, Mary Astor as Marmee and Lucile Watson as Aunt March!They don't make them like that anymore... these days the world is descending into emptiness and hatred and it shows in pretentious empty movies.Nothing like Little Women (1949) to cleanse our soul from the depressing and chaotic (time-editing-wise, to say the least) mess that is Little Women (2019)..."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 April 2020,9/10,"I think the most important core of little women is to tell us that there is no such thing as 100% absoluteness in life, and that everything can never be faced with complete rationality. Joe's novels are mostly about war at first, to make her earn money or other material, but because a lot of life experience and eventually realized that she really wanted to describe only his family all the mundane of daily life, not only for proof of existence of beth left once, also think back to how they naive themselves into from the past to the present."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 March 2020,10/10,"I started to watch the movie thinking it will bore me at some point but this movie got me sitting till the end. Absolutely a wonderful page turner i would say. Family, Love, Women and Most of all Life is illustrated flawlessly. Charming visuals and a good cast. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 August 2020,9/10,Now this is a completely light hearted film . There is some connection that you feel with this film . All actors acted well & you can watch it with your family .It has its moment of sadness & happiness & touches you in your heart . I haven't read the novel but I know this film has completely done justice to itFrankly this was also one one movie where are started liking Florence Pugh a lot . So I may be a bit biased with my rating
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,5/10,"The only reasons I gave it 5 stars instead of 1 are
1. I don't think any movie should be rated less than 5 stars;
2. I liked the way it developed Amy and Laurie's relationship;
3. I liked the way it developed Mr. Brooks and Meg's relationship.
4. I liked the break-up scene between Laurie and Jo.
Other than that, I didn't like it at all. The 1994 version is soooooo much better. Wynona Ryder is perfect as Jo."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,8/10,"LITTLE WOMEN is a delight of movie and feels like it came from another era of Hollywood filmmaking where attention was paid to dialogue and plot.Saoirse Ronan is excellent and gobbles up every scene she's in. She makes Emma Watson's acting look one dimensional by comparison. She is truly a rising star (if not already one) and following her career will be a pleasure. The supporting cast are wonderful, especially Laura Dern.Two weaknesses as I saw it. There seemed to be no prior indication that Amy was enamoured of Laurie, so that came as a bit of a surprise when she declared she'd always been in love with him. One simple lingering look when they were younger would have 'solved' that for me. Similarly, Jo's attraction to the Professor, while hinted at, never seemed to be more that what it eventually became.Apart from this, this is a film worth your money. And if you love costume design you will love this movie too."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 April 2020,,"Greta Gerwig is undoubtedly a brilliant filmmaker. Her directorial debut ""Ladybird"" was a powerhouse of emotional, intelligent and original filmmaking. It's a fantastic film that's going to last for decades.Whether it's because Gerwig isn't directing her own material, or because of other forces, but ""Little Women"" is a disappointment; made all the worse by all the talent on display. Pugh, Ronan, Streep, Dern, Cooper and Watson are superb, there's a great, classic story, beautiful, sweeping cinematography and even the set design is impeccable. Alas, that is not enough to salvage what could have been a classic.Whomever decided to edit the story into a Tarantino-esque, fragmented mess needs to retire. Taking what is a sweeping, epic and slow burning story and throwing its structure into a blender is one of the biggest filmmaking blunders I've ever witnessed. The editing has no sense to it, no structure, and is all over the place. It's like they put all of the scenes into a playlist and hit ""random.""The film is all the more frustrating because of how good it could have been. A cast of talented actors, (aside from a miscast Chalamet), a great director, and a classic story all lose their lustre from some of the worst editing I have ever seen.Here's hoping this cast and director can get together in the future for something more in tune with Gerwig's style."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,7/10,"First Hit: I liked the theme of women being strong and independent and disliked the jarring time shifts.I've made no bones about Saoirse Ronan is one of the very best actors in her generation and in film today. Here as Jo March, the oldest of the four sisters, she is the focus of this story and therefore, we this story through her eyes.She has three sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen). Each of the sisters has talent. Meg is an actress and in early scenes, she and her sisters are shown making a play together and Meg has the lead role. Amy is a painter and she aspires to be the best and ultimate painter alive. Beth is the youngest, is shy and more unassuming, but plays piano like she was born with one in her soul.The girls are being raised by their mother, Marmee (Laura Dern). She's alone as her husband, and the girl's dad is away fighting the civil war. They live in a large home but because the father is away and cannot provide for them, money is tight which is part of the drive for some of the girls, especially Jo, to provide for themselves as they get older. They don't want to be dependent on men.As a strong independent young woman, Jo wants to make her living and livelihood from the stories she writes. She thinks the way women are treated and the limits put on women to be independent is absurd. There are numerous scenes where this plays out. One such scene is when she's attempting to sell a story and the publisher/editor tells her the girl in the story has to marry and be happy in the end; that's the only way people will accept the story. This infuriates Jo.Jo is also stubborn, as shown in a couple of brief scenes. One such scene is when she was in New York to make her living as a writer, she meets a handsome writing professor and after Jo asks him to honestly critic her work. He thoughtfully does this, and the criticism stings, so she calls him inept and storms out of the room, blaming him for lack of thoughtfulness.There are many acts where her feminism and stubbornness play out, and they are wonderfully done.Meg is different in that she wants to marry. She wants to create a household with children. This is a source of disappointment for Jo; however, it also is a way for Jo to see and accept that people are different from her.Amy is like Jo in many ways in that she wants to be the best and known for being the best. However, in a scene of self-actualization, she realizes that her perfectionist painting technique is outstanding, but she doesn't create anything unique and probably will never be the painter she envisioned herself to be. I really liked this about Amy because the actualization was subtle yet very clear and it came through in her expression.Beth was quiet and meekest of the sisters; however, her piano playing was extraordinary. Her weakness was that she didn't like playing in front of anyone. She was also the weakest of the sisters physically and we watch her demise through catching scarlet fever.All this to say, I loved each of the sister's stories. I thought each of them was superbly acted as well. What hurt this film was the sometimes-jarring way we segued into other time frames. Watching a particular segment of a sister's story and then boom, we find ourselves with that person in some different storyline. Sometimes it made sense and other times it was too obscure at the time to be an addition to the story or the particular sister. With the type of time jumps this film presents it is difficult to tell if they were future or past events because the actors never looked older or younger in the scenes. I just don't think the audience needs to be trying to figure out when the previous scene happened in the overall storyline.One particular scene when Jo cut her hair for money for the family, we see her in subsequent stages with long or short hair but the storyline at one point meant that she should have had short hair but it was long and bunched up in the back.It also appeared that men were only used as place holders and role players to propel the sister's stories, and this isn't a bad thing and it came across as a bit too obvious.Ronan was powerful as Jo. The fault I found with the film was the time jumps that diminished the storyline and had nothing to do with her performance. Watson was wonderfully elegant yet showed a side of fun and enthusiasm as well. The scene where her part of her hair gets burnt off and then to the vulnerable elegance of her coming down the stairs in a coming-out event showed the breadth of her abilities in this role. Pugh was the surprising actor for me. She was sublime in this role, and when she was on the screen, her look alone commanded you watch her. The moment that Amy realizes she won't be a famous painter was genuinely inspirational. Scanlen was beautiful as the meekest of the sisters although she harbored some of the biggest talents in the family. Dern was terrific as the mother who's compassion for others rang throughout the movie. I loved her scene with Jo when discussing patience and anger. Timothee Chalamet as Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence was sharp. Being the rich boy neighbor, who had fallen in love with Jo because of her strength and independence, was sufficiently arrogant, boisterous, and kind. Chris Cooper as Laurie's father Mr. Laurence, was excellent. His thoughtful kindness as the rich neighbor was well placed throughout the film. Meryl Streep was outstanding by being arrogant and funny as the very wealthy Aunt to the sisters. Her well placed and pointed jabs at women having careers were perfect. Greta Gerwig wrote and directed this film. I didn't like her choice to make time jumps without giving the audience clues about the past and future. The actors never really looked different in these time sequences and that was bothersome. Otherwise, she got excellent performances from the actors and the sets and scenes were beautifully filmed.Overall: A terrific film interrupted by time jumps that caused confusion."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,9/10,"A thoroughly enjoyable film, it will make you smile, shed a tear, and the acting is first rate especially from the impeccable saoirse Ronan and florence Pugh, as a 53 year old Male I'm definitely not the target audience for this but I was captivated from start to finish"
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2021,8/10,"The acting is fantastic, the scenery is beautiful, and the costumes are also very well done. Greta Gerwig included a necessary twist in the screenplay, as the plot would otherwise be an outdated, overdone story. The relationships between the women conveyed all the subtleties and complexities of sisterhood. Very immersive experience."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,8/10,This movie is truly enjoyable and the cast did an excellent job ( the scene that Jo and Laurie dance for the first time is just wonderfully hilarious) . But the story is rushed and everything happens too fast so the audience doesn't have the time to linger on scenes and enjoy it and it would be confusing if someone had not read the books . But still a good and enjoyable movie.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,7/10,"Much has been made in the publicity material that this is very much a re-telling of the Louisa May Alcott classic. This is nothing less than you'd expect from Greta Gerwig. And a film telling a story that's been covered so often can best be justified by putting a different spin on it.Little Women tells of the artistically talented March sisters, living a comfortable life in Concord, Massachusetts. The Civil War, at which their father is away fighting, seems a far distant conflict not in any way impinging upon their lifestyle and artistic dreams.The film is shot beautifully, its production values superb. The scene on the beach with children flying kites will surely take your imagination to a Paris art gallery where you're viewing Victorian masterpieces; it's delightful.But the film broadly fails to make its characters interesting. Only Saorise Rohan as the headstrong Jo imbues her character with any spirit. Her sisters are all too anodyne and homogeneous, their talents coming too easily. And the lack of any character flaws makes them all rather dull. They come across as prototype Stepford Wives. Amy is allowed, once, to show a lapse in perfection, and this seems to be merely a contrivance for her to show contrition, and for Jo to display forgiveness. Timothée Chalamet as a foppish Laurie fails to convince he could cause one sister to fall for him, let alone two. Character development is also hampered by Ms Gerwig's unnecessary non-linear storytelling.Little Women is always good to look at and should keep your interest throughout, just. But go expecting to see a dramatic re-imagining of an old story and you'll be disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2020,3/10,"I really wanted to like this movie, I am a fan of the story/book, I loved the previous version with Winona Ryder. But I felt there's no chemistry between the characters in this version, definitely the director failed to make the actors give their best, and the dialogue / conversation seems so scripted they all talk like they are giving a fake speech. Such a disappointment."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 July 2020,7/10,"Okay, I'll confess that I'm a fan of the 1994 version with Winona Ryder, so whilst I tried to view this updated version on its own merits a part of me couldn't help comparing now and again.First, the good. The production itself looks fantastic. It's vibrant and sumptuous. I was pleasantly surprised by how colourful it was, given the modern trend of desaturating for 'gritty' atmosphere, and then giving everything an overall particular hue. The cinematography is similarly pleasing and resisted being too 'modern'. The actors, for the most part, do pretty well on an individual basis. I also enjoyed the slightly greater emphasis on Mr Laurence's attachment to Beth and her love of the piano, given the loss of his own daughter. Whilst that's in the '94 version, it is only briefly covered.As for the rest... I'm not going to say there was anything 'bad', as such, more just a little 'off'. The elephant in the room is the non-linear story telling. I can understand why they did this. As of the '94 version, we can pretty much say that film making (especially for smaller scale, non-effects driven movies) had reached a point where quality of production can't actually be improved on, only different perspectives taken. I'm talking about things such as events no longer feeling set-bound, or any locations feeling limited due to budget etc. This version had to differentiate itself from the '94 version in a substantial way, and changing to a non-linear narrative served that purpose. If you re-ordered the scenes chronologically, the similarities between the two versions would be such that you really would be asking ""Why bother?"".However, whilst I understand the decision to do something different, the problem is that it simply does not work. I found myself accepting scenes that I only understood because of my familiarity with the book/s and previous film versions. A lot of it would have likely been confusing, had I not had that prior foundation. The emotional payoff for many scenes is drained away, without the events leading up to them. They often feel hollow, whilst scenes that lead up to those you've just watched lose the charm they may have otherwise had.A prime example is Laurie's introduction into the close-knit group by Jo, his later falling in love with her, dealing with rejection, and subsequent marriage to Amy. Seeing this out of order makes his character feel less understandable. His self-indulgent period makes him feel shallow, because we have not seen what leads to it. By the time you do, you have already lost sympathy. Also, his falling for Amy is a tightrope between natural progression vs a reaction to Jo's rejection, and this comes over as the latter.Another problem is the casting. Regarding the sisters, the '94 version succeeds by choosing actresses who very clearly embody the characters differently. This version feels as though every actress was picked because they could have played Jo. Secondly, Christian Bale was able to pull off playing both the younger and older Laurie. Timothée Chalamet just comes over as far too juvenile in comparison to the sisters, especially when he has 'grown up'. As for Professor Bhaer... I don't know what they were going for.I know I may sound as though I'm comparing it to the '94 version too much, but it's mostly to show the contrast in how interpretation and casting can alter the story. Overall I feel it's an interesting and well-made take on the story, but an otherwise superfuous and, ultimately, unsatisfying one."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,8/10,Like the comparisons between the sisters when they were young and them ten fifteen years later instead of doing it all in chronological order. It was fun that way showing them as four different kinds of women and why they all picked the path they chose.The quirky moments when they were all dressed like men and Mr Lawrence listening to everyone having fun but unsure if he should go in was funny.Everybody from the maid to aunt march to the editor gets to tell their side of the story.Esp like the ambigious ending it made sense to jo's journey.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2021,9/10,"When a classic book is adapted to the silver screen for the dozenth time, there feels a need to do something different, to add additional elements or change things. And usually this ends poorly. I'm reminded of all of the supposedly feminist remakes of Disney's classic fairy tales that are in fact poorly written and not all that feminist.Here Greta gerwig's framing devices and story does add something new to the famous novel by giving greater screen time to Amy. Instead of trying to do something different change something, she gives the story more time to breathe and creates a wonderful movie.Kim Renfro wrote in her review for Insider that ""I felt a profound sense of recognition and a part of the story I hadn't dwelled on before: the anger fell and expressed by nearly every woman."" The feelings of discontent of the older sister and the feelings of anger of the middle sister all really speak to the experience of being a woman in this time today. and it's great seeing Marmee admit that she's angry nearly every day of her life in a historical setting. Especially because of historical setting is one that many people idolize with whitewash glasses. 2020 felt like a suffocating year and the Trump presidency raised female anger in a way not felt for many as being so visible. And this adaption of a historical book brought to life female anger and discontent many modern day set movies haven't ever been able to distill into a movie.The discussions between Marmee + Jo and Amy + Laurie add depth to the story but also a deeper reflection of a lot of people's experiences.I loved this movie and it's adaption form."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,8/10,"Very strong film. Everything was just well done. Great writing, directing, acting, and the list goes on. Good use of the original material but with a little unique take on it. Actors all did great and the characters felt full and memorable. It may or may not be your type of movie.. but was an enjoyable tale and really well done."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 February 2021,6/10,"I relatively enjoyed the acting, scenery, writing, and how it adapts the events from the book. The only issue would be that nothing goes in order, so the story is too difficult to follow. but it's still fine"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 March 2020,6/10,"I love Little Women. It was one of my favourite books growing up and I've seen many adaptations of the story, the last being a BBC production a couple of years ago with Maya Hawke as Jo. It was a great adaptation. Cue my interest in seeing this version which I have to say was hugely disappointing. Disjointed jumping backwards and forwards in time, actors far too old for the roles and missing the warmth this story usually generates in readers and audiences. Weird modern tweaks like the bizarre dance between Jo and Laurie (wtf?), feminist virtue signalling (yawn) and costumes and hair that were not quite as on point as they should have been. Best scene was the one at the beach which looked like a Renoir painting come to life. Saoirse Ronan is a fine young actress but she looked far too old to be Jo. Just not gawky or socially awkward enough. The other March girls all looked too old to be 12 and 13 year olds although props to Emma Watson for a charming Meg. This meandering mishmash went on far too long and left me and my sister yawning well before the end. I would personally love to see a version of Little Women where the March girls are actually played by kids and the older sisters by different actresses. In the 1992 version Kirsten Dunst played a young Amy and was replaced by Martha Plimpton as the grown up Amy. I think this would be more convincing than 24 year olds playing 12 year olds! Laurie was played like an annoying spoilt brat and the family scenes within the March household were noisy, messy and cacophonous. Why spoil a classic by making it more resonant for a modern audience? Played straight it would still charm and that was sadly missing from this version. Little charm and little warmth."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 April 2020,7/10,"Little women is a good romantic drama movie, especially love Florence, and Saoirse. Not much of a fan for Hermione though. And that forth girl who died, Beth.The plot is not bad, BUTTT.... I must say that it can get confusing since the story keeps on going back and forth in the timeline. You need to hang on to tiny details to follow the story, like Saoirse hair, if it is short, or if it is long, or whether they are married or not.If not for the going back and forth without any cue, I'd rated this 8/10. Overall a fun romantic drama movie, slow paced but relatable and logical."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,8/10,"I admit, I wasn't too impressed by Greta Gerwig's Ladybird. I found Little Women a whole other level of a movie. It's not just that the source material provided a much more colorful story. It's not just that the March sisters seem to be richer characters than Ladybird's decidedly bland heroine. To me with this film Gerwig emerged as a master storyteller and a true auteur. I loved how instead of following chronological order, she presented the story as more of a memory stream. Even though constant time jumps were confusing at first, especially since the characters didn't change much, I thought it made the movie more engaging and somehow more relatable. It created some incredibly poignant moments, like the two times Jo (Saoirse Ronan) wakes up and doesn't find Beth (Eliza Scanlen) in her bed. And I got that strange and wonderful feeling like I was in the midst of it rather than outside looking in. Even bits like when Mr. Dashwood (Tracy Letts) tells what he wrote to Jo directly to the camera rather than as a voice over, that in a different movie would seem like a gimmick, here felt perfectly organic and gave the film a little extra kick. The entire sequence that moves between Jo negotiating her fate with him and living it is pure brilliance. The cast is great in a way that goes beyond just being able to portray complex emotions. What struck me the most was that by the end I found myself in love with every single character. Not because they are saintly, but because they are human. Alive. Warm. Even Meryl Streep's Aunt March is lovable because it's clear that behind everything she says, she cares deeply about the girls.There was only one thing that bugged me a little - too little difference in the sisters' appearance between the two time periods. It ultimately worked anyway, except for Amy. Florence Pugh is a fantastic actress and she did a great job making Amy act like a 13 year old. But she just didn't look like a 13 year old, especially next to her older sisters. I kept wondering why she was always left behind, why she needed Jo to take her ice skating, and how it was that she couldn't understand why Jo stayed mad at her after what she'd done. It also made Laurie's (Timothee Chalamet) sudden change of heart about her hard to buy."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 April 2020,9/10,"In this era of ""political correctness"", feminism seems to have become a sign that some people are deliberately moving closer for the sake of gain.
I just think that ""women have wisdom, soul, and feelings. They have ambitions, talents, and beauty, but I hate people saying that love is all about women."" Sexism has been around since the beginning of slave society. I am very happy because women Economically independent women can already stand on their own in modern society, but when the term 'feminism' for women's rights is turned into a ""woman punch"" by some extreme people, we should know that radical and violence can only lead to greater dissatisfaction. With hostility.
And in 1868, ""Little Woman"" in a time when women could not even get a job, Louisa May Alcott encouraged girls to dare to pursue their own happiness and go out of their choices. Her works encouraged For generations, and today, 200 years later, Greta has adapted it into a movie again. In our time, girls are encouraged to recognize their power and not be trapped by money. This is the true meaning of feminism. It is not to belittle the men, so it is really difficult to get real respect from others.
I hope that the little women in the world can make their own choices, love others or be loved, even if there is no perfect love, you are still strong and chase your dreams, just like Joe, even if it is not the prince and princess The perfect ending, you can still embrace happiness, and the little women of the world will always be happy, go out of their choice, embrace happiness, and live up to love and freedom."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,7/10,"If you are new to the story then I would recommend you to go watch the 1994 version first. Why? This story will seem very confusing and disjointed unless you already know the plot well. Many parts of the story aren't really told at all and the sisterhood isn't particularly well established.If you know and love the story then I would recommend watching this because of it's differences to other versions: the tale isn't told chronologically and it does take some liberties with the later part of the story but it offers some new depth for some characters and there is some wonderful acting by a very good cast.One thing that I found particularly troubling when the story is told this way is the age of the actors. When the tale follows the actual timeline I find it easier to believe the actors are aging - they may look a bit old in the beginning and a bit too young at the end, but I can overlook that. Here you jump many years and end up with someone looking exactly the same just seconds after you saw them supposedly much younger or older.Had i judged this on acting alone it would have been a strong 9 and cinematography is equally strong, but overall I can only give it a 7 because for me the continuum of the story is lost here."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 November 2020,6/10,"Nicely filmed, acting oke, story oke, and well adjusted to he sentiments of today... For girls, and other people who want a feel good kinda thing... Not for me though, pfff"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 May 2020,7/10,Each character has its own charisma and it helped each one of them to fit so perfectly in such a movieGreta Gerwig's way of telling any story is always sophisticated and she sure did it wonderfully in Little WomenSaoirse is one fine actress to watch high five for her performance
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,4/10,"I remember reading the book forty years ago and vaguely remember the story. In the movie, I did fall asleep as the story moved so slowly. There were times that the dialogue went nowhere and I kept checking my phone as time felt that it stood still. Timothee Chalamet did not seem like the obvious choice for Laurie. He did not fit with Saoirse Ronan, in my opinion. I really didn't care about the story, as I had no idea where it was going. And the most annoying part was the flashbacks every five minutes, eliminating any shred of continuity. Wait, no, the most annoying part were the actors talking straight at the camera. I don't recommend this movie ever. Just read the book."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,6/10,"Very aware of itself. ""Aren't we just real sisters. Look how we be real sisters!""
Sadly, could not care."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,9/10,Rarely watch these type of movies but I saw the cast & wow the March sisters were so goodFlorence plays Jo March known as the rebel sister gives her a new light which I enjoyed a lotThought the casting of Timothee was the only flaw of the movie thoughSaoirse is an absolute Star loved her in Ladybird n now This FilmLastly Great wrote an incredible screenplay for today's time n loved her version of Little Women
LITTLE WOMEN,25 March 2020,9/10,"The core of the story is no longer in the middle of love and marriage. The four sisters each have their own growth page and headline events. In addition to the family identity of their daughter, partner and wife, the preference and ideal of the writer, painter, piano player and performance enthusiast who represent their independent consciousness and value integrity.
Women not only have the right to choose their own destiny, this choice is more diverse, their choice is just different from Joe, there is nothing wrong. The film eliminates the bias of right and wrong, presents diverse ideas in an inclusive way, and encourages women to follow their heart's desire to be the most themselves. The female director Greta gerwig understands Alcott's respect and love for women beyond The Times."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 December 2020,8/10,"Allow me to immediately admit here that I have not read the book or seen any other adaptation. However, I fell in love with this film when I saw it in theaters. After watching it a second time I realized what makes this film so special. The four sisters often move and maneuver with such a dynamic flair that it appears as if they are one protagonist, each with different characteristics and qualities. The story is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. The storytelling is done in a clever way. The film does a great job at critically visiting the roles and chances of women in society. And the dialogue is as satisfying and witty as it can get. The costumes are magical and make it deserve its Oscar. The actresses playing the four little women have an astonishing chemistry, and the supporting roles for Timothée Chamalet and Laura Dern are so fine an addition. That said, this is very much a costume drama, meaning that the overall vibe of the film is very similar to that of Pride & Prejudice and Downton Abbey. If that does not float your boat, I cannot guarantee this film will."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 April 2020,8/10,"Fate is often delicate, and the arrangement of fate has been planted inadvertently. The once green years will pass, but I never knew that the best time had just begun."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 April 2021,8/10,"The fourth (of four, currently) of the Little Women movie adaptions (that isn't a silent movie). So, is it worth watching? Absolutely. This is not a case of ""seen one, seen them all,"" in fact, you can't say that about any of the Little Women movies as they all are quite different (though I would recommend skipping the '49 version). This one does something unique, and definitely threw me off for awhile. It's structured like a Chris Nolan movie. It's constantly switching between the past and the future. Every event runs parallel to each other. That is, you get to see the future, and then see how the past led up to that. It's quite an interesting way to tell the story and provides the movie it's own unique identity. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of this, but it definitely doesn't detract from the movie that much.What about the characters? Well, they're done quite well. Saoirse Ronan is quite good as Jo. She feels like a mixture of Hepburn and Ryder in her portrayal. She has quite a bit of emotional depth like Ryder, but feels like a true tom-boy like Hepburn.Not going to lie, I don't like this Amy. She feels needlessly mean. She's supposed to be a brat, yes, but, her burning Jo's book in this movie didn't feel justified one bit in this version ('94 did a much better job at this) and just felt needlessly cruel. That, and Florence Pugh seemed way too old for the character.I'm glad in this version Meg is actually the prettiest of the girls like she's supposed to be. In '49 and '94 I felt that she wasn't. So, that was nice to see here. Other than that, no real comments. Emma Watson did a good job at the character.Moving over to Beth, I really like this portrayal of Beth. Very angelic, like she's supposed to be. Still like the '94 portrayal a bit better, but this is a close second. That said, one thing I really do like about this version of Beth is how they really do show her musical side and her getting that piano in this movie actually felt earned, unlike in previous adaptions.For the rest of the cast: Marmee was good, felt like she genuinely cared for her daughters and was active in their lives, but I still like '94's Marmee better. Chris Cooper doesn't make for a convincing Grandpa Laurence and is easily the worst portrayal of the character. Laurie is spot on in this version and may be the best portrayal yet (that said, Christian Bale was amazing in '94, so we'll call it a tie). Aunt March definitely has quite the personality and is far superior to the '94 version, though I will always prefer the '33 and '49 portrayals more due to their sharp-wit. As for John Brooke he isn't exactly the best-looking, and whoever plays Professor Bhaer gets the job done. He's good but not great.Anyway, time for some other notes: near the end, when Jo sends a letter to the publisher, and the publisher responds, when they stare at the camera reading the letters, that was weird and felt out of place. Shouldn't have been put into the movie like that. The scene were all the family stood around and told Jo how much she loved Bhear was the definition of ""cringe"" and so was the whole meeting him at the train station thing. That was downright bad. I appreciate how Laurie actually felt a part of the March family this time. You see him spending time with all the girls and it feels meaningful, as opposed to previous versions where he was basically just Jo's friend who somehow ended up marrying Amy. Also, I am glad for the first time ever they actually fleshed out Amy and Laurie's relationship. It always felt quite out of the blue in previous adaptions. Here it didn't.Anyway, so, I definitely recommend this version. I would say this is neck-to-neck with '94 for the title of ""best adaption"" of Little Women. It just depends on which strengths of the two versions you prefer more and which weaknesses you can't get over more. Anyway, this was a fantastic watch that I can easily recommend."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 June 2021,9/10,"I came for this movie as it was an Academy Award Nominee; and it was amazing. I'm really fascinated by the plot of it. It's about life of growing girls; all of them always love each other although each has different persona and also different look about the world. The movie will take us round and round with the past and present, and gradually make up a beautiful story. That's all I can say, you have to watch and feel it yourself. Definitely recommend it to my relatives and friends!"
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,9/10,"9:50 a.m.
I finally saw the new ""Little Women"" yesterday. A mid-late twentish Megan Follows look a like plays Jo - complete with her smile - that pulls you in and makes you want to be her friend. It was super amazing. It jumps back and forth between the first half of the story and the second half of the story so unless you have read the book - which is chronological, or seen the 1994 version - which is chronological I think you would be horrendously confused. I was worried that this one would have liberal undertones which it sorta did, but nothing that bothered me too much. Jo voices a need to not get married, Amy voices a necessity for it for practical economic reasons. Personally, it is a pretty intense emotional struggle for me. It does have a unique ending from the all of the other versions which reflects those undertones, but worked well. Costumes, scenery, acting, writing, all absolutely amazing. I wondered how much of the scenery was real - it was so amazing - or if any of it was computer created. Oh and it has a nice Mr. Lawrence which was nice to see."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 December 2020,2/10,"I've grown up with the 1994 version of Little Women. It's a movie close to perfection, in my opinion. So when I heard about a remake I was skeptical. But with the good reviews I figured I had to give it a chance. I'll admit going into it with the expectation of not having it live up to the 94 version in my own view, but I never expected I would hate it. I mean; how the heck could anyone possibly make a bad movie based on such a powerful story? So I was proven wrong, but not the way I hoped; that the movie is justified in having a higher rating than the 94 version. I'd love to sit here and say that, yes indeed, it was possible to improve upon perfection. But I can't. Instead, I was proven wrong in that, yes, it is actually possible to make a bad movie based on this story!From the very beginning something felt off. It starts, and Amy's in France? What happened to the first half of the movie? Jo's in New York. Meg's already married, with children. And Beth's sick... Part of what made the 94 version so fantastic is the way it builds the story. Starting when Amy's at an early age, following them for years as their sisterhood develops, introducing them to new relationships, like Laurie and John, and events, like the German neighbors giving Beth scarlet fever, in a timely fashion. With the story in a linear fashion, you get to know the characters well, and it builds up an emotional relationship between the viewer and the characters. So that, when Beth eventually becomes fatally ill, you grieve with the family. Here, the event passes by without much emotional response, because the movie hasn't built up our relationship with her yet. We get a few flashbacks, but they miss the mark by miles as to build the same kind of emotions as the 94 version managed by letting us ""grow up"" with the characters, by following them in a linear fashion.I'll grant you that the movie has some descent moments towards the end, and for a while I almost got into it; not on the same level as the 94 version, but at least there was something there, and I was getting cautiously optimistic about having a better feeling about the movie at the end than I did at the beginning. But then comes the ending and tears it all down again. Partly because the parts about Friedrich are so exceptionally poorly done. Early in the movie, about the only scene we see with him is when he tells Jo that he didn't like her stories, and Jo tells him that she doesn't want to hear more of his opinions. It isn't until Marmee asks Jo about him, as ""her friend"", that the familiar relationship begins to come into the picture. Then he shows up at their home, with all the misunderstandings and reasons from the 94 version that made it so powerful all but emitted, and only then do we get some flashbacks to how they met. Still extremely underwhelming, and way too late. But what really ruined the ending was how the movie then suddenly, without any sort of pre-warning, starts to mix between being an adaptation of Little Women and a biography of its author, in a way that makes no sense whatsoever. So I started the movie with a question mark above my head, and I ended it with an ever bigger one.Like I said, there were some good moments towards the end; the underlying story is too good for all of it to be bad. But I have to say they tried hard. From the bizarre, underwhelming non-linearity of the storytelling to its ultimate uncertainty about what story it actually wanted to tell. The casting did it no favors either. Having an Irish, British and Australian actress make out three of the four very American sisters seemed wrong; they didn't have the accent down, and for a while I was questioning if they had moved the whole story to England instead of USA. Granted, Saoirse Ronan is the actress that best fills the equivalent part of the 94 version. She kind of looks like Winona Ryder in the role, and is mostly believable in the part, the main shortcomings coming down to the underlying way the story was told. Emma Watson as the earthly Meg doesn't work at all, she doesn't at all look or act the part. She would have worked better in the part of Amy. Talking of Amy; how Florence Pugh was found worthy of an Oscar nomination is beyond me. She worked fairly well in the older years, and perhaps even on par with Samantha Mathis who was admittedly the least effective casting in the 94 version, but she was just laughably bad as the younger Amy. Particularly cringe worthy were the parts where she throws a tantrum with Jo, and burns her book; her whininess didn't seem at all real, and nowhere near as childishly innocent or heartfelt as when Kirsten Dunst did them in the 94 version. The scene with the limes was also truly horrible. And Eliza Scanlen as Beth makes no impact at all. Claire Danes managed to stir up all sorts of emotions throughout the 94 movie, and you truly felt bad for her Beth. Laura Dern doesn't fit the part of Marmee at all, nor does Timothée Chalamet work well as Laurie; he looks like a teenager throughout the whole movie, and you never get in touch with his true emotions of feelings for the March family, the way Christian Bale did. And the poor actor who did Friedrich had pitifully little to work with, and the relationship between him and Jo doesn't seem in the least real.The movie is basically a mess from beginning to end, and the few good moments the movie does have can only be ascribed to an original story so powerful that it is impossible to ruin completely, try though they certainly did... I've given an extra point in my rating for that reason, and for some descent attempts by Saoirse Ronan, but you won't find me seeing this piece of turd again. The story deserves better. Fortunately, it has the 94 version, which is certainly the one I'll continue to stick with for the foreseeable future."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,9/10,"Little Women is a fantastic movie. All of the leading actresses are fantastic and play off each other very well with great chemistry. The story is incredibly interesting and clever, based on a novel from the 19th century which was way ahead of its time. The lighting is used to great effect to differentiate the time period between flashbacks and present day and the cinematography is incredible, with several beautiful shots. Saoirse Ronan delivers a fantastic performance, one which I'm sure will get her nominated for Best Actress at the 92nd Academy Awards. Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are also incredible, delivering depth and emotion to thieir compelling characters. I highly recommend Little Women, it's one of the best films of 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2020,5/10,"Good production values but no depth, just some femenist propaganda"
LITTLE WOMEN,11 May 2020,2/10,"Greta Getwig's screenplay And directing are both crap!Overall she created a confusing, nearly storyless mess out of a classic story, with her horrible screenplay and horrible directing.Her flashbacks have no transitions so it takes extra time figuring out what time period you're seeing. Starting in the middle of the original book then using a lot of flashbacks to try and tell the story was executed poorly. She basically cut up the book in little pieces, threw them up in the air and however they landed that's the order of how she told the story. Total Crap!!Her dialogue is only slightly borrowed from the last movie. Unfortunately she loves to make all the actors speak their lines over each other, especially when all the girls are together it's a chaotic, cacophony of noise. All actors seem to step on each other's lines. It's just such poor writing and directing.If you like this story, then watch any other version of this movie because this one is definitely Not Worth Your Time!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,9/10,"An emotional heartwarming experience, the cast is outstanding, so much collected talent, it's almost unbelievable, naming only one here would be unfair to the rest of the cast, making this movie totally warm and believable. The movie is absolutely beautiful, with a masterful direction by Gerwig, always keeping the lightness, even when tragic circumstances shadow the action. Wonderful photography, set design and music score. The fact that Gerwig isn't nominated for best direction in this years Oscars proofs, that women's struggle for autonomy and emancipation is still worth fighting for."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,6/10,"I'm a fan of the older version of this film, and the 90s version too. This one was worth a watch but I didnt much like the time jumping, found it confusing. Thought the actors played it well. Worth a watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 May 2021,9/10,This adaptation to lme's timeless novel really does well to show the heart and joy of the novel. Sairose ronan is spectacular. Laura dern is great as always. The characters were updated to fit the 2020s beautifully. The only gripe I have is the weird back and forth point of view. Other than that the movie is darn near perfect.
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,,"......for feminists to move through life with that giant chip on their shoulder, weighing them down? The only person pigeon holding you and putting you into little boxes is YOU!!!! And using films such as this (and what is this anyway, the 3rd reboot?) to try and brainwash other's into an oppressive, victim mentality only shows how scared you are that you are losing control over the masses.  You are losing your control of us and, like a scared significant other, grasping tighter as their partner starts to move away from the relationship, the tighter you squeeze us with media, movies, and pop culture, the more you push us in the direction you so desperately don't want us to go. So please, keep making these movies so we can keep winning!!!! ;)"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,8/10,"Little Women is a film that touches on the different culture that was present during the Civil War era. It gives us a unique story that revolves around four sisters who stuck together during the hardships of their life.
Out of all the movie remakes that have been made recently, I would have to say that this is probably one of the most satisfying ones of the year.
This film is not only a remake but also based on a book. Making a film like this is very hard, due to people wanting to compare it to both the book and the previous movie that was based on it. But somehow this film succeeds in what it tries to be.
I came into the theater not expecting much. I watched the trailer and thought it felt too modern and political (which I hate movies that are very political). Turns out that the film was actually very well-made. Although the film did have politics and social issues taking place, it blended with the time period so I found it appropriate.
The film also had great cinematography which I found to be very eye-catching. The use of composition and color was well done and appealing to watch. The use and structure was something I thought very impressive as well. For many scenes they always started with a wide shot, which would cut into a closer shot. And then another closer shot. I thought it was nice that they chose to start out wide and gradually zoom in through with editing, which is my last point.
The editing is most likely the star of the film. The way they cut back and forth from the past and the present without confusing the audience came to be impressive. Structurally, the editing is very consistent and feels very purposeful with every cut back and forth. I honestly think that this is the most impressive part of the film.
Overall the film was very attractive and very rarely did I lose its attention during the runtime.
8/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,1/10,"Another dreadful adaptation of a movie whose story is now totally overplayed. Just when you thought Little Women could be furthered injured no more. Along comes Sairose Ronan and Timothy Chalamet. I don't do that obnoxiously arrogant apostrophe that Timothy so treasures. This was a boring story when she wrote the damn book, it was a dreadful movie when Winona Ryder did it. And now its even more boring in this age of Ultimate PC, Adding black people and Asians where there were none before. This is a flat out, in your face, standing in an elevator, silent prayer at a funeral....FART. Avoid at all costs."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"I loved this film.
Whoever considers this a girl's film has nothing to share of value. ""Little Women"" speaks to everybody!I thought for a moment in the beginning of the film that it spoke for families of moderate privilege, but it soon becomes clear that whatever advantages exist for this family, they share with those who have less. In fact they share with those who have more, who quickly recognize the value and are moved by it. The needed, warming heat coming this family emanates from a deep well of generosity which informs thought and feeling of all the sisters in the story. When their mother isn't there, they attempt to aim at her example - when she is there, she exhorts them to aim for their long serving, long absent father's example. The core of individual character is central.When the film was over, I noticed that nobody in the packed LA theater clapped, as they do with many good films. There was silence - Interestingly, nobody moved for several minutes. I felt that everyone was just absorbing the experience and didn't want it to end. People were chatting loudly about it in the lobby and it made me wonder what the effect really was. I had never heard so many people speak of reading, or never quite finishing the book after watching a film. It had a measurable impact.For me, I felt that the film defined something important - the target-ideal of American family, of successful parenting, of practical economics, individual honesty, important values and aspirational identity, all of which are all vital and current, in our world today.That silence after the film felt like a bit of a communal shock - that such a simple story about young women struggling to grow up together in postcard-pretty, late 19th century New England could feel so tremendously moving and emotional.Please, make yourself feel better - see the film."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 July 2020,,"It felt pretentious and sometimes silly. Although, I liked the satirical tone used to criticize how women were perceived in society in the past but that still relatable nowadays. Very feminist and empowering. Also, the metafiction utilized were cleverly translate to cinema.
I found some drawbacks that I could not overlook. Despite being beautifully shot and the colors in the transitions between past and present were magnificent, I did not like the nonlinear narrative approach. Another problem I found struggling during the whole movie was that they were poor so their clothes should look poor/cheap or old but that was not the case, as matter of fact. Lastly, Saoirse Ronan is a fabulous actress but she struggled with the American accent as well as Emma Watson in a couple moments and Timothée Chalamet was also great but his character was annoying and childish. However, the cinematography, locations, costumes, acting, directing and score were perfect."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,9/10,"To me Little Women is Greta Gerwig at her best, she has provided fantastic direction and has given us a fantastic adaptation of the novel. The performances are excellent no one gives a bad performance, with the stand outs being Saoirse Ronan, Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh who continues to give great performances in a breakout year. The costume and production design is fantastic and the score provided Alexandre Desplat is phenomenal. The emotional payoffs are fantastic, breaking your heart and then warming it at times.There are a couple of flaws with the film however, such as: There are time jumps throughout the movie that took me roughly 20 minutes to figure out when there was a flashback or when we were in the present, and the film did feel a little too long at times.Overall Little Women was an absolute delight to watch, due to its sensational performances, direction and technical applications. I did not expect to love this film as much as I did but i am glad that i did, and gives Greta Gerwig her best film yet."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 August 2020,9/10,"They have got ambitions and they have got talent as well as just beauty .One of the most classy movies with extraordinary cast. The scores were good. Greta is a amazing writer and director. A movie which values my time. Saoirse and Timotthe are great actors. This is an amazing film to watch in theaters. Oh , the production designer and costume designer deserve great respect 🙏👏."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,9/10,"The newest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel, ""Little Women,"" was the best version I have ever seen. Directed by Greta Gerwig, the film stars Saoirse Ronan as Jo March, Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy, Eliza Scanlen as Beth, and Laura Dern as Marmee. Timothée Chalamet stars as Laurie, Chris Cooper is Mr. Laurence, and Meryl Streep as Aunt March.The entire cast is stupendous. Ms. Ronan stands out in her tour de force performance as Jo, the independent writer, who refuses to marry, and is determined to make her own path. She unflinchingly remains true to herself, her family and her work as both a writer and a teacher.The main difference between this adaptation and its predecessors is the stream of consciousness approach as the story moves between the present day March family, and the stories of growing up together. Parallels between the challenges when they were children and the struggles of adulthood weave together to tell their story both now and then. Gerwig and her team does a masterful job of storytelling to balance it all in a cohesive manner that holds the audience's attention and intrigue, even if most viewers already know the original story.To enhance the superb storytelling, the film's cinematography and costume design, recreating 19th century New England, was a bright spot in this visually captivating film. I wouldn't be surprised if this film was among the select few chosen for nominations in both categories at this year's Oscars."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 November 2020,7/10,I've seen better versions. I found the constant back and forth between present and past really annoying and hard to watch.
LITTLE WOMEN,24 May 2020,9/10,Each edition of the classic film has its own unique strengths.This version of the film has a lot of stars and is very expensive.It looks like a very carefully made film.
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,5/10,"After seeing the 1994 version of Little Women, I was curious to see ultra feminist actress Greta Gerwigs version of Little Women. Long story short? It made no sense. The casting ffs!! It's like Gerwig (or the casting director) just slapped together as many young millennial actresses that had some screen clout, and mixed it all together. The ages were hard to decipher if you're unfamiliar with the book. For instance, the lovely Florence Pugh playing the youngest March daughter? Really? It's not her fault but she's obviously looks older and more mature than the others. The gifted and talented Soarsie Ronan as the tomboyish Jo March, comes off as modern day feminist than any woman would have dared in those days. And that alone took away from the believability of the entire film. Poor Emma Watson as Meg March was completely overshadowed by the pro feminist slant the movie gave to the character of Jo, so Watson was indeed under used.
And with all of the young actresses together it gave off more of an all girl sorority house vibe than any genuine blood relations. All in all, it lacked empathy. I just never really CARED about the March girls (other than the young Beth played brilliantly by Eliza Scanlan) in this adaptation. Unlike my favorite version, the 1994 adaptation, the 2019 version (even though the I knew the story) just never clicked on an emotional level. How does that happen in a story told countless times?
Just ask Mz Gerwig who OBVIOUSLY wanted HER retelling to be considered Oscar worthy only because of the rise of feminism and the metoo movements. The film seemed rushed, and with the constant flashback and flashforwards it just comes off as confusing to anyone unfamiliar with the subject matter.
All in all this film is NOT Oscar worthy, It's too confusing, terribly miscast, and has a feminist message that is over done to nauseum. And all of the phoney imbd 10/10 ratings wont change that. So get your handkerchiefs out now and prepare to be dissapointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,5/10,"Little Women 2019 A period drama about the growing up and loves of the March sister's in 1800's America. Constant time jumps due to flashbacks were a bit confusing. Appreciated the performances and certain elements of it but I generally prefer the 1994 version in many ways: linear storytelling, two different Amy's. Storyline has far more heart, warmth, coziness. I've viewed it several times and always cry when Beth dies (Claire Daines fantastic in that scene). (Christian Bale) as Laurie - great actor, captures Laurie very well: charming, confident, sensitive. Susan Sarandon as (Marme) awesome actress brought so much more to the screen. Both were ""A cut above"" no comparison. (Gabriel Bryne) as Jo's Friedrich is ideal...much better actor. The music, performances of ""Little Women"" 1994 version does by far the best job of selling that drama and pulling at your heartstrings."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 June 2020,2/10,Absolutely awful decision to constantly have flashbacks while having the same actresses play both their older and younger selves.Florence Pugh acting like a 7 year old in one scene and then as an adult in the next is just bizarre.This movie was incredibly confusing due to these constant flashbacks. Should have stuck with a linear format to go from the girls growing up together to present day.
LITTLE WOMEN,24 May 2021,3/10,Does the book jump around in time so much like this movie does? It's extremely hard to keep track of when they were.I didn't care about the characters near as much as I wanted to.The angst in this film is almost oppressive. I just couldn't wait for it to end so I would no longer be subjected to it.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 March 2020,8/10,Women have minds and they have souls and they have ambitions... I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it...But I'm so lonely.
LITTLE WOMEN,20 March 2020,10/10,"This film is so impressive and touching with great acting. The novel of this film is one of my favorite, and I really like detector Greta's touching film of women."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 April 2020,8/10,"I have seen this movie many times, and I can't get tired of the description and characterization of love. I like it very much and strongly recommend it"
LITTLE WOMEN,10 February 2020,10/10,"It is certainly a brilliant, beautiful and emotional film in all its facets. Each individual scene is a single piece of art. The whole movie is an unforgettable experience that will reach your heart and the depths of your sensitivity to awake emotions every time you remember the film.Do not forget a handkerchief."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2021,9/10,I watch this movie because last night my girl upload a tiktok about this in her whatsapp's status and i don't wanna get spoiled because i thought this was a good movie (even before i saw it) that's why today i watched this movie and it did not disappoint me a bit. such a good storyline within and bunch of great actor and actress. wonderful experience watching this touching story.
LITTLE WOMEN,9 May 2020,2/10,"Slow motion dancing to terrible music, babbling women with little to say. I stopped watching after 16 minutes."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 April 2020,7/10,"It's been years since I read the book but I'm sure one problem here is that it tends to plod on because the script is slavish to the book--except at the end, when Jo is made out to be an uncharacteristically and unconvincingly assertive businesswoman who stands for no nonsense from her publisher. The beach scene is thrillingly beautiful--stands apart as if from another movie entirely."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,5/10,"There is nothing new under the sun with this umpteenth remake of ""Little Women"". I took my 20 year old daughter to see it because she loved watching a much older version with June Allyson as Jo March and a talented cast when she was a young girl. It was a staple at our house every Christmas and a sentimental favorite. When this new version ended after a very long 2 hours or so, we both said ""meh"", and I regretted spending $50 on tickets and treats. Because most of us already know the simple story written by Louisa May Alcott from our youth, it's tedious to view continuous flashbacks throughout the movie, which add nothing but length to the film. The many location shots are attractive, but so many characters are miscast - Amy March especially, who is supposed to be a beautiful, vain, selfish creature, but ends up having more ""balls"" than sister Jo March, is a real turn-off with her bulldog personna and combative low voice. Mom March (Laura Dern) is a real stretch lacking authentic warmth and maturity, Aunt March played by Meryl Streep turns in a wink-wink old lady performance without a shred of empathy. And sister March played by Emma Watson is just ""there"" without the magical special effects of Harry Potter. On the other hand, March sister Beth is believable as the fragile, ill-fated member of the family, and Saoirse Ronan is good as Joe but lacks the passion I've seen from her in other movies. Wonder if she was directed to tone her intensity down to let other characters be developed more? There's quite a few scenes she's not even in, which hurts the portrayal of Jo March's rebellion and reconciliation as intended in Alcott's book. In that vein, there are only a few short scenes of Jo's New York escape from domestic struggles and her conflicts with a burgeoning relationship with a much older, ""foreign"" professor. There is so little attention paid to their tender, fractious connection as boardinghouse friends, it's a real flaw in the movie because that's where Jo in the novel discovers herself apart from her family. I won't say anything about the ending, wishing to avoid spoilers, but overall recommend that if you loved the book and previous film versions, you might want to skip this one."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,9/10,"Well this movie went from, meh I don't know if I'll watch it to boom top 5 of the year, It's a masterful, passionate, all-in kind of adaptation.
Do not miss this, it's wonderful.9/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2021,9/10,"At the beginning thought it would be boring, but ended up loving the movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 April 2020,6/10,"It's a bit of a messy film. The acting is outstanding but at the same time I thought it was a little bit over the top and overdramatic. The plot was all over the place and very hard to keep track of. It felt like a bunch of different clips pasted together. Cinematography was beautiful yet score was average. The best senyece6 to describe this film is ""a wonderful mess"""
LITTLE WOMEN,31 March 2020,7/10,Florence pugh's voice is too mature for the role. All in all good acting of a classic novel.
LITTLE WOMEN,23 May 2020,8/10,"It is hard to say whether this is a modern classical film or a retro-style contemporary film. Perhaps between the texture of the oil painting and the feeling of joy, the main creation itself does not clarify the relatively unified idea. Ronan's classical temperament was perfectly presented in the film, and the aura that was inspired by Joe White reappeared."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 March 2021,8/10,"I've grown up with a few girls in my house (my sisters, mom, occasionally grandma's) and they talk about the book a lot as if it the bible. They read Little Women almost religiously. It is definitely my Nana's favorite book. Then with the boys in my family, we never talk about it, and I don't think any of us have ever read it. I definitely haven't. Then my mom heard this was a movie and she was dieing to watch it. My sister was pretty excited to watch it too. I didn't really want too because I wanted to watch Gladiator(which is an excellent movie, by the way), but my dad said it was my moms turn to pick because I just picked Mr. Deeds(another great movie)
I was kind of expecting this to be a 6 star movie, but it was actually a lot better than that. I actually liked it a lot because it helped me understand how girls act and the way they act a little bit more than before. Of course, girls are still confusing most of the time, but I understand them just a little bit more. I liked how there were sad parts in the movie. I wasn't expecting anything emotional, which was one of the main reasons why I didn't want to watch it at first. In fact, I was wanting to watch a sad movie at the time, so the fact that Little Women was a sad movie, and that was what I wanted to watch, made me like it more because it was actually giving me what I wanted. The movie isn't depressing though. In fact, it is mostly a happy ending and all that jazz, but there are definitely sad parts. This definitely disserved the Oscar got, even if I don't even know what the Oscar was for. I'm going to read the book soon to see if it is better than the movie. My mom said the book was better, but she also really liked the movie too. Don't let the title fool you. It is great for both men and women."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 August 2020,7/10,"If you know the story of Little Women, you will find this an easy and enjoyable watch. If you are not you will be very confused, it jumps around in time with no definition and that makes things difficult. The actor's are great the costuming is great and the landscapes are great. The direction sucks."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,10/10,"When she was in high school, my mother played Jo in a school production of a stage adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel which was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. It has never been out of print. Besides the stage, it has also been adapted for opera, television, and now at least seven films. What makes the new version by writer/director Greta Gerwig (nominated for the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay) different from all the others is that she takes a non-linear approach to the story. Her version starts when Jo (Saoirse Ronan, Oscar-nominated for Best Actress) is trying to become a professional writer in New York and goes back and forth to the scenes that take place seven years earlier during the American Civil War. Dashwood (Tracy Letts), her editor, instructs Jo that if a novel has a female protagonist, she must be either married or dead at the end. Jo meets Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel), a fellow boarder and a tough critic, much earlier in this film than in either the book or other adaptations. Amy (Florence Pugh, nominated for Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is already traveling through Europe with Aunt March (Meryl Streep) and being romanced by Teddy ""Laurie"" Laurence (Timothee Chalamet). (Jo's rejection of his marriage proposal takes place fairly late in this film.) Amy is given much more screen time and is treated more sympathically than in previous versions. Meg (Emma Watson) is shown as struggling to make ends meet, because, as you may remember, she married Laurie's tutor (James Norton) for love rather than money. Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is still alive at the beginning, and her death, the story's emotional climax, takes place fairly late in the film. The acting, especially Laura Dern as Marmee, musical background, costuming (nominated for Oscars in those two categories), and set designs are all excellent, and this film is well worth seeing even if you know how it ends."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 March 2020,8/10,Women have minds and they have souls and they have ambitions... I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it...But I'm so lonely.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 April 2020,7/10,"Seeing Greta Goveg find Ronan a set of such a specific and suitable way of acting, whether they continue to collaborate or not, they can foresee to be a good actor in this movie. In this movie, Ge Weige has fully proved that he can create an image for the actor, and Ronan has proved that he is malleable."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,4/10,"Just how many times is this story going to be retold? We've read it. We've seen it. Over and over. Enough already. But if you MUST do it again, do it better. Bring something new to the table.How is this film getting all these nominations? Because it's a period piece based on a classic and beloved novel? So it's automatically considered good? Enough!And there are people actually complaining because the director didn't get nominated for an Oscar and are turning it into some sort of misogynistic conspiracy. (Insert eyeroll) The film isn't either but again, period piece & beloved novel so it gets included.I don't understand the Oscar nominations for best actress and supporting actress. Based on what? These roles are about as challenging as an after school special. Choices must be slim
pickings this year. I like these actresses but they just didn't do anything here. And I blame that on the director. I blame a lot on the director here. Ladybird was great and so was Ronan but here she's just bland.I'm so annoyed by the accolades for this film. Why, because they are wearing fancy clothes? Boring, pretentious and been there done that at least a dozen times. Zzzzzzzz."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,9/10,"Greta Gerwig's adaptation of the novel ""Little Women"" is a colorful collage in motion that throws light onto the raw aspects of relationship dynamics . Its gutsy yet blithe. She dismantles the audience's apparent perception of various events that happen as the film progresses and helps them reconstruct a fresh perspective of how things could possibly be. And in order to do this, the director resorts to a beautifully executed non-linear narrative that is embellished with fabulous flashback scenes that wonderfully blend together with the scenes that take place in the film's present timeframe.A plethora of legends including Meryl Streep have acted in this film but my favorite performances were those by Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh. Saoirse was phenomenally exuberant and her performance plays a massive role in helping cement this film as an exotic romantic coktail. Pugh on the other hand skilfully interplays between being somebody shrouded in disdain to being somebody at the epitome of pragmatism. Her dynamic with Saoirse's character creates a sort of tautness that beautifully enhances the film's narrative.Watch this film as soon as you can"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,10/10,"In Little Women Greta Gerwig takes the not challenging biographical feel good period piece to a higher level. By that, It becomes something richer and more complex.The acting is great and every character works independently. This is very important in Greta Gerwig's films because her stamp is not noticeable in the directing but with the stories she wants to tell and the characters of those she uses to do so.I would like to recommend you ""Our little sister"" (2015) by Hirokazu Kore-Eda, also about the relationship between sisters."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2020,6/10,"Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women"" the seventh film adaptation of the 1868 novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott. It tells the beloved story of the March sisters - four young women each determined to live life on her own terms.So I'll be honest, I didn't really vibe with this movie. It's shot nicely, the screenplay transfers over from the source material well and the acting all around is strong. Especially from Saoirse Ronan, I understand now why she's nominated for an Oscar for this role. Her character I identified with the most and cared for the greatest. However I just can't see what the huge fuss is about! I understand that there's a dynamic and lessons attached to this film, but nothing wowed me.Though the pacing was done well and I really enjoyed certain moments of the film. The last 30-40 minutes of this film I didn't like very much at all. It's more so an issue with the changes to the source material as well as aspects of the source material itself, but the ending of this film seems contradictory to the lesson established in the beginning? Also the rushed feeling romances at the ending could've been salvaged with not introducing another love interest for Jo at all. I just didn't care about that guy, especially when were given a beautifully developed relationship between Jo and Laurie to begin with! Either stick with that or have Jo stick to her guns and not marry! Laurie ending up with obnoxious Amy was also a swift kick to the gut.There's also the issue of underdeveloped main characters because there's 4 sisters. Jo is done a great justice, but Meg and Beth are pretty lackluster especially Beth. I'm sad that I didn't have much emotional response to Beth's death in this film, and it wasn't because I knew it was coming. Her character just had very little personality, which is a shame because the reactions to her death from the other characters was so powerful. I wish I could've shared that emotion! I'm also just honestly tired of this story, it's been made so many times (7 I think)! It's grown tired and though I applaud Gerwig for trying it's just not enough for me to love it like many others.A story that could use some changing around, a fantastic main character, beautiful family dynamic and disappointing ending. I hope Gerwig continues to add charm to her films, because we need more female director representation and she's pretty good. I want to see more original screenplays done by her like ""Ladybird"" because I think that's where she really shines."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 September 2020,8/10,"Emma Watson was great in this film as Emma Watson explained in her interview about Little Women wanted me to see it. This film was great it gives film lessons to moviegoers about making a film from a novel like Of Mice and Men, and Cider House Rules. It brings back old classic films portraying a novel to transcribe to the big screen. You are editing out thoughts and narrations that people who work in Hollywood gives green light to screenplays very few have been a sold go. It takes place during the events of Civil War before the first automobile and before first cities looked like today when it started in 1906. Emma Watson plays Beth Marsh with her sisters the Marsh sisters they call little women. Before the turn of the century, and horse drawn carriages and a different version from recent Little Women film in the 1980s that was about senior citizens. This Little Women is about girls growing up to be adult women and coming into age in getting married. In the end, almost everyone gets a guy at the end even Jo Marsh played Siorse Ronan. She finally gets her book published which was about her and her sisters and the times of their life. Their father coming back from the North Army led by Abraham Lincoln. She also gets 6.6 percent of the profits and copyrights to her work."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,10/10,"Great job Greta i just watched it it's AMAZINGGGGG
I liked every second."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,9/10,"I saw this in three parts on telly. All an hour long episodes around Christmas. Now they sell it as a 1, 35 minutes feauture film. Confusing, ne´est ce pas? I´m glad for the threee hours because it was really good and I, for my money, wouldn´t have it any shorter. Brilliant acting.Greta seem the name for the day."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,7/10,"NEW ??? new ... I know what you are thinking; ""Sacrilege to vary from the original."" But it lacked pizzazz, and if Scrabble had four Z's that would be an award winning word. Unfortunately, this movie was NOT award worthy. I screened this with a woman who had an immense literary background and FA degree, she liked it less than me. I found the constant ""forwards-backwards"" format disconcerting, my friend declared it a waste of time and virtually unwatchable. Period piece, great costumes, ""chic-flic"" subject matter, and a stinker that lost it's smell 100 years ago. I am not sure what my point score is, or even how many it takes - but I lost ground with this one ... ;-("
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2021,8/10,"Little Women is a moving, nuanced, and entirely pertinent portrayal of the feminine struggle with the weighted disadvantages of 19th century patriarchal America society. The cast is a pantheon of female acting talent, all of whom manage, within a collective of delicate brilliance, to shine, bring life, vibrancy and explicit humanity to their characters.Additionally, the writing, cinematography, costumes and period specific scenery, all function collectively to bring the story alive, situating it appropriately with a strong air of believability. However, it is the reality or the willingness of some of the key female characters to challenge the norms of society, while others embrace them, which makes this movie so very fulfilling and relevant.The very idea of feminism has not really taken hold as yet, in historical terms, but still, for the sensitive observer, one can see the strength and courage necessary for a woman to demand more. More in terms of expectations, and more, in terms of equality with men. And what is being demanded specifically? Independence, acknowledgement, and a recognised degree of suitable emancipation, all these things are eagerly sought and readily denied, until success and a woman's voice is heard - published. This is the creative fabric of the delightful portrayal of the story behind the writing of the novel of this production's own name - 'Little Women'."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,3/10,Unnecessarily jumping around. No chemistry between the characters. Incessant chattering.
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,1/10,"You ruined a somewhat good movie by casting Meryl Streep. She is so overrated and just boring to watch. After her embarrassing performance in a horrible movie Mama Mia,I'm surprised she is working.She's just gross."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,1/10,It was just remade last year. This was completely lazy filmmaking with no risk.
LITTLE WOMEN,20 April 2020,,I have read the book and this movie simply destroyed it not to mention the actress were horrible and not at all appealing the actor who played Laurie was way to young and was unlike able who ever thought to Meryl streep as the aunt made a big mistake for she is not a good actress and ruined big little eyes 2 also why didn't they use a different actress for the younger amy and these actress also had no chemistry the scene where she shows laurie her burnt part of her dress you can't see it she flashes for less then a sec and the whole beth dying scene was ruined and not even the least but sad the flashbacks made ths movie totally unwatchable i even tried while i was drinking and couldn't get through it also i remember the scene where joe burns a piece of hair off of her sister it was done in the kitchen and not in the bedroom and why is their a scene of Beth with 2 kids cause that was not in the book they could of made a great film instead they butchered it
LITTLE WOMEN,31 May 2020,7/10,"A beautiful and moving story, you will immerse yourself in it and find a different kind of warmth. Whether it's quarrels or conflicts or life trivia, you are not just an audience but a participant, who will regret Joe's refusal and be sad for Beth's departure. Following the lens of the movie, I feel the rise of female consciousness, and feel the equality of gender. No one is destined for what it is. I have n't seen the original book, but the movie is really good. It 's not just shooting trivia and memories. It 's shooting people 's emotions, love, affection, friendship. Isn't this what we have ?"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 March 2020,5/10,"I thought it was well directed and acted. But it lacked the heart that Winona Rider and Susan Sarandon had. It seemed fast paced and impersonal. Well casted and directed yes. Missing a lot yes. It was too fast paced, dialogue seemingly modern and insincere it just didn't get me like other adaptations. Hate if you must."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 February 2021,9/10,I notice a lot of reveiws comparing the movie with the original book and older versions of the movie. As someone who has no knowledge of those I found the story and characters stunning. Every character developed perfectly. The acting was amazing and the characters feel so close to heart. The whole movie is an art.
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,9/10,"It was lovely to revisit a favourite classic novel that was so beautifully brought to life.
Some may ask do we really need another version of this book? Probably not. But thankfully the stars were aligned when the powers-that-be put their faith in another remake. This is the best adaptation I've seen.
The acting was superb, the characters came to life in the re-telling of a well known & well loved story. I tried not to sob in my seat but failed. I loved every minute of it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 March 2020,7/10,Beautiful film with good acting from essemble cast and nice non linear screenplay.
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,7/10,"This movie is about as far away from 'my type' of movie as possible, or at least that's what I thought, but I have to say I enjoyed it a lot.It's a story about the upbringing and growth of four girls from the bubbling happiness and hopeful optimism of children, into the hard and scary reality of adulthood. Therefore, the focus of the film is the wonderful characters played by Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Timothee Chalamet and Laura Dern. They are all very well acted and every single character is unique and filled with personality.Acting and characters aside, it's beautifully captured and the environments really breathes life into the film. The movie is also very touching and I couldn't help but cry, both tears of happiness and of grief.My only complaint is that the story is rather messy and it often jumps between different time periods and places without giving good enough hints of this. I spent quite a lot of time and energy on trying to understand where and when they were, and that is something that could have been done better.Overall, I really liked the film and I completely understand why it has received such critical praise."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 June 2020,5/10,"It's puzzling to me that three of the four ""Little Women"" are played by British actresses, and the fourth is played by an Australian. Not quite sure how it is that Production could not find American actresses to play any of the March sisters--who, of course, are American. TBH, I'm a bit insulted by this.**The Good**
Timothée Chalamet was outstanding as Laurie!
Sets and costumes were excellent.**The Bad**
This adaptation of LW is a non-linear mess. I hope you've already read the book when you watch this, because honestly, I'm not sure how you would know what the story was about otherwise. It jumps back and forth between the past and future, between this plot point and that plot point--a technique that can work, but that doesn't work here.Frankly, the movie never spent enough time on any one plot point or character to make me feel invested in that plot point or character. As a result, from beginning to end, I felt nothing--which is not how I want to respond to a movie.Maybe that is why it took me 3 days to watch this, and I'm a fan of the book.Next time I see that a movie is a Greta Gerwig movie, I will think twice about watching it, because I'm really not impressed by her so far."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,1/10,This film is packed with fantastic talented actors. I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately it turned out to be dreadful. The flashbacks are annoying and don't work in this period drama. You get to a point where you get lost.You feel like there is a real feminist agenda from the director and it tries to hard to do this in the film.I don't understand the 10 star reviews at all.So disappointed.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,7/10,"Greta Gerwig's ""Ladybird"" (2017) received five Oscar nominations and lots of other awards. Rightly so, the film was a charming coming of age story. In 2019 it was time for her next film (actually only her second job as a director): ""Little Women"". The novel by Louisa May Alcott from 1868/69 has already been made into a movie several times, but this is the first film that I have seen of this story. The film is nominated for six trophies at the Oscars 2020, including ""Best Film"".The story is told by Jo and her three sisters, all of whom grow up with different talents and goals. Jo's main problem is that women are reduced to love and romance. She wants to change this with her stories, but of course it´s more difficult in the 19th century than she would like ...In my eyes, ""Little Women"" is a solid feel-good film that picks up on an important topic, even if many films have done it before. And in my opinion ""Little Women"" suffers from the fact that the message is occasionally conveyed with the index finger raised. I would have liked a little more subtlety here. The film also suffers from a little too much kitsch. Towards the end, this is explained relatively nicely on a good meta level, but it was still too much for me. Jumping between the past and the present could also have been implemented more effectively.Some strong scenes are convincing, such as the story about the piano player Beth or the argument between Jo and Laurie. But the best for me are the great actors. Saoirse Ronan is great as always, Emma Watson can finally convince again with a multifaceted role and Florence Pugh is incredibly energetic and charming. Eliza Scanlen is very special as Beth and Timothée Chalamet has never disappointed me! The older cast members are also great: Laura Dern touches with her soulful depiction of the mother, Chris Cooper is just as strong and of course Meryl Streep, with whom you don't have to say much anymore. The perfect role for her!The film is nicely filmed by Yorick Le Saux, if not particularly creative or exciting. Alexandre Desplat's music is very coherent and nicely arranged, but his score was used a bit too inflationary in the film. Less would have been more here and might have taken something away from the annoying kitsch.Conclusion: ""Little Women"" is nevertheless a nice film about growing up and what it means to be able to live dreams. It´s not the best film of 2019 in my eyes at all, but still worth seeing and perfect for a nice, emotional film evening."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 June 2020,10/10,"One of the most emotional movies I have ever watched. Ever. Greta Gerwig captured the story so beautifully. Amazing cast, amazing score, amazing everything. like for real. period. What did they do? That."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,5/10,"Not as great as I expected. I love Saoirse Ronan, so I did love her role as Jo. It reminded me a lot of her part in Lady Bird. However, I did not like the movie as a whole. I think the cast was good but at times I wasnt sure what age each girl was supposed to be. In the 1994 version, you can easily tell who is the oldest and so forth; Amy is also a child which is why she acts the way she does. In this 2019 version, I found Amys to be super annoying because I saw her to be very immature. I found it strange how she was mature all of a sudden in Europe. Emma Watson (Meg) played her role good but I didnt feel like her dream to be an actress was emphasized. You could see everyone elses talents but not Megs. In this version, you could definitely tell Jo and Laurie had a bond. It upset me when all of a sudden he falls in love with Amy but there were scenes to show them starting to connect more. Now, Jo and Friedrich had one scene where it showed them having fun together. It felt forced when all of a sudden he shows up to their house and shes ""in love."" Jo realized everyone is going to die eventually and it wont always be her and her sisters so she wants to be with someone. They shouldve shown more scenes with her and Friedrich to support that there was love there and not only a crush between them. I also did not like how they claim to be poor and lived in a house. At some times it sounded like their accents would come out. Their costumes were cool and looked very realistic. The scene where Timothee Chalamet confessed his love to Jo was really good. He has a good way of portraying emotion."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 April 2020,10/10,"I cried SO MUCH in this movie! Brilliant writing by Greta Gerwig with an equally brilliant performance by Saorise Ronan. All the actors are wonderful in this and it is a joy to watch. The movie is shot exquisitely and the music is top notch. It's funny, heartwarming, silly, heartbreaking, and wholesome. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt a feeling or had a notion to experience joy in a cinema. Greta Gerwig, you are an artist of the highest measure."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,2/10,"The makers of this movie did their very best to ruin an excellent story. If I was not with my wife I would have left at least half way through the movie. At one stage I. Really had no idea what was going on, with all the flashbacks and forward flashing."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,6/10,"First, I acknowledge I had so much hopes on this film, it begs to say it was one of my favourite books ever as I child, finding out back then it was a saga really made me happy.1994's movie is so far the closest you can get to this book's spirit, Winona did a wonderful as Jo, I can't say as much of the last miniseries they made, the same applies here.When I found out about the cast I was really happy, then I realize they weren't casted as I hope to and it was all downhill from there. Emma should have been Jo, Saoirse should have been Meg, Eliza should have played Amy and not Beth, and can we please talk about why trying to make a 24 years old, that looks and has a very deep voice, playing a 10 years old? Please! Even in previous version they got someone younger to do it.Yes, I like that Greta tried to make the 2nd most opaque character in the series get some gravitas at last, sorry Meg, but come on! Amy a feminist??? To what power!? If you ever read the book you would know that nothing could have been farther from the truth.I both know and appreciate feminism, not that much extreme feminism, even if it is a trend now but let's be realistic for a second and stop this centennial nonsense, has anyone here read these books? Any of them? There is more feminism in then that you would find in a lot out of contemporary ones out there. Louisa May Alcott made sure of that, I mean... It's Jo f... March! Wonder Woman of the Wonder Sisters from Concord! I expected more from Saoirse and I can't help to feel otherwise. Now, where are all the important storylines from the saga? Slavery anyone? The American Civil War? I felt most of it was left behind in the attempt to get Amy March more time than the book does actually give to her.It would be also nice if all the filmmakers could stop their love for flashbacks.All in all, it was nice, will I view it again? No. Will I encourage anyone to watch this? Not a chance. When in doubt, grab the book, you will find more pleasure there than this movie can provide."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 April 2021,10/10,"Sorry but this was better than 1994 version. Greta kept the exciting moments in the book and give them the importance they deserve. What i mostly liked about it was that each sister had their space. Beth´s death was very meaningful to Jo and it was very well portrayed. Christian Bale is a phenomenal actor but he didn´t give justice to laurie. Chalamet was better in my opinion. Now about the screenplay the idea of going back and forth was very clever. Every element of the movie was great; cinematography, screenplay, acting. Makeup, music, costume desing, directing, soundtrack absolutely increidble. The movie knows how to capture the important moments and it comes back to calmness very beautifully. AMAZING PIECE OF ART."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 May 2020,6/10,". Particularly good acting and directing but I didn't like the story too corny, the family too perfect everyone happy and great weird moment when Saul appears. did almost cry when the kid was talking about dying"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 October 2020,8/10,"The beginning of this film is a mess. The editing is chaotic. The girls are very noicy and not well defined. But as the story develops the film becomes better and you can indentify the girls. There is a special role for Timothee Chalamet, who is excellent for this role. The film is longer and more emotional than earlier verslons, but also better. Any way, it's a is really a modern version of this old story."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 June 2020,9/10,"I was coming into this movie completely cold. I haven't seen any previous adaptations, read the book nor seen the trailer for this movie. I had no idea of what to expect except for a story about sisters. I got that and so much more!
There isn't a single weak point in this film.
The script is great, the acting, directing, costumes, tone and lighting. It is all perfect.
Because I had no previous reference I thought it was obvious that Jo and Laurie were never going to end up together and Amy and Laurie were so much more compatible. I thought both of those relationships and the bond between the sisters were all sweet. It is overall a feel good, sweet movie that is just delightful but also brings up the issue of money and freedom for women. Which was relevant 150 years ago and still is unfortunately. The timeline is fascinating, I wanted to rewatch the movie instantly, I didn't but watched it again a week later, just as good if not better on a second watch.
Highly recommended, not only for women, but people!"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 April 2020,10/10,"Is it just me or did anyone else feel that the movie is soooo good? I'm not the person who often says this but it is kind of better than the book?
The movie explores the character of Jo and the hardships that Alcott faced during writing/publishing the book. My favourite thing about Greta's LW adaptation is it's ending. If you look closely, there are two different endings to choose and it is upto the audience to go with the ending they prefer.Good one Greta!"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2020,9/10,"I know I am a little biased been Irish buy Saoirse Ronan is just a wonder in this Little Woman, without her what would the film be, nothing, she is in almost every scene of the 2 hour plus old style story telling drama. Its like stepping back into the years when Hollywood (America) made movies about people, not monsters, not killers, no CGI, Just a group of people brought together knowing if they give this their all it will be viewed/enjoyed long after they have passed. If Ronan does not get the Oscar this time (she so richly deserves) after so many near misses well no matter. Everyone who watches Little Woman in the years and years to come will be so satisfied by the whole production they will be so happy they gave this Film 2 hours of their life. Go and watch it with someone you love, it will be night you will both recall years later."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 June 2020,2/10,"My mother, sisters, and I have always loved ""Little Women,"" both the book and the movies. This version is terrible. The girls are all completely miscast. Amy is a complete dud, and once Beth had died, I couldn't even picture her face. I love James Norton, but he's entirely too old for the role, and it's creepy. The structure of the movie spoils the enjoyment of their younger years, and they force completely inappropriate themes into the story. AND the professor is French! They must think Americans are too stupid not to know the difference between a French accent and a German one. Ugh. I can't believe I paid to watch it. It was so bad, I actually identified most with Aunt March. Don't let Greta Gerwig or Saoirse Ronan near another classic."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 December 2021,8/10,"86/100Wanted to watch this film for the first time to oficially set myself into the christmas spirit and, not only did I get that, but now I can finally call Greta Gerwig one of my top 10 directors of all time, calling this film good would sell it short on account of everything this film achieved in its runtime.This star-packed movie shouldn't have worked as well as it did for me. I initially though it would be disastrous to have these many main characters for a film without risking the overall pacing. I feel overjoyed to say that Gerwig isn't only a good director, but a good writer as well. She managed to balance each actor's protagonism so well while also possesing purposeful dialogue that establishes family dynamics.I missed falling in love with movies, crying and having that stupid grin on my face that hurts when you try to break it off. It feels paradoxical to think that the first watch will be as good as the film gets... definetly looking forward to put it on my rewatch list.."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,1/10,"The 1994 adaptation directed by Gillian Armstrong is vastly superior to this offering in all respects. Christian Bale brings the much needed heft absent in previous versions to the important Laurie character. Timothy Chailamet is simply not up to the task - very poor casting. Saoirse Ronan always brings her ""A"" game to her performances. However, Winona Ryder's independent, spirited Jo is more faithful to the book. Completely off the mark is the portrayal of Beth. Claire Danes captures the fragility of the character without sinking to the maudlin. The great Susan Sarandon exudes the warmth and intelligence of beloved Marmie, not unlike the late great Mary Astor. Dern is terribly miscast in the role. (For a perfect casting of the very talented Laura Dern, one only need to see Noah Baumbach's excellent Marriage Story wherein she portrays a barracuda divorce attorney. )Costumes, sets and music all lovely and superb in the '94 film, mediocre and drab in the 2019 remake. Most disappointing, however, is the screenplay. Gerwig's incessant flashbacks are an annoying distraction from the narrative and only serve to drain the piece from its original charm and freshness. The single ""star"" rating is for Ms. Ronan who made a valiant effort to rise above the material.The title of my piece is ""Why."" Why remake a film if you cannot improve upon it in any meaningful way?"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2021,5/10,"90s version much better. Actually, all the previous versions are better than this one."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,6/10,"I thought the costumes were stunning as were the landscapes and the interior sets.
If I had not read the book I think I would have been confused by all the flashbacks. If one hasn't read the book it will take a lot of concentration to follow the story in this version. And Little Women should be a simple sit back and watch film .
Deviations from the original are relatively minor. Maybe it is the omissions that irritated me most? It doesn't make sense in this film the way Jo's affections appear to switch from Teddy to Fredrich as little screen time dedicated to their developing relationship.
Actress playing Amy in flashbacks too old.
Laurie/Teddy actor totally without charisma.
Actor playing Fredrich Baer quite a dish which is not how he comes across in the bookend so a nice surprise."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 June 2020,9/10,"I was mesmerised throughout. The story is a true classic which was brought to life perfectly through the actors' skill. Every member of the cast had a fantastic chemistry and there was a very relatable and realistic dynamic between the sisters. A wonderful film about sisterhood and the conflict of wanting to be independant whilst also wishing to be loved. This is a film that has not taken away anything from the original text which is a breath of fresh air. As a young woman, this film asks questions and gives inspiration."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 May 2020,9/10,"This timeless story is shot and shot again. This time, it uses non-linear narrative, shuttles through two groups of time and space of four sisters. The interspersed time has causality, which can also show the value of the times. The end defuses the possible accusations of marriage and allows the audience to imagine freely. This is beyond the previous version. In addition, writing is always conducive to the development of characters' personalities and backgrounds, clearly showing their specific personalities and mentality, and a good sense of humor fills the story."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 September 2020,7/10,"A little bit difficult to understand at the beginning, and I can't go into the story. The colors are so nice. That's the only part I enjoy."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 April 2020,5/10,"Once again, Hollyweird has to redo that which it has done before. Katherine Hepburn, June Allison, Winona Ryder, and now Saoirse Ronan. How many more times will it be remade? The CONSTANT jumping back and forth in time travel made it feel more like a sci-fi story; but I guess that's what they call ""artistic license"".
Thank God, that ""Casablanca"" won't (can't) be re-made as you can't recreate that story with today's time because too much history has occurred."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 March 2020,7/10,"What could happen in a home with 4 sisters with similar ages! Their lifes are reflected warmly including their loves, fights and excitements.Each is interested in different areas like music, painting, theater and writing."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 March 2021,5/10,A triumph of adaptation! We get vocal fry in a nineteenth century costume drama.
LITTLE WOMEN,30 May 2020,8/10,"The most touching adaptation is that Joe and his sick sister Beth are on the beach. Beth said that I'm not afraid of death. Life is like the ebb and flow. The ebb and flow can't be stopped. Joe hugged her and said that I stopped it once. The same scene of waking up from sleep, when Joe rushed down the stairs again, there was no Beth."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 August 2020,8/10,"Gretas version of this story is just as good as the other film versions, of this book. That says a lot."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 March 2020,7/10,The movie kicks off in a very random plot and this will go on throughout the movie where the audience will jump into flashes of the past and the present and sometimes you need to squeeze the brain a bit to figure out what's happening. This kind of story telling is quite interesting. The movie starts off with a typical misogynist male character. This trend of feminism and diversity in Hollywood is so spread out in all movies that I am kind of sick of it. The first part of the movie was full of this perspective and really turned me a bit off but the progression of the story makes me get through. I really liked Jo in this movie. She is a good definition of a strong female leading role should be. And this movie does not totally despise male but rather celebrates both genders as equally valuable and talented in their own ways. This movie is also suitable for all ages and has lots of good messages to inspire you.
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,5/10,"I wanted it to be good, having seen about everyone of its predecessors, but I was greatly disappointed. By shooting in flashback, it was distracting and could never actually become attached to the characters. The action should have been able to grow so you become attached, but because of the way it was shot you're left all over the place with nothing to grab onto. I understand she wanted it to be different, but she missed her mark."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 July 2020,8/10,"I really wanted to watch the book before I read the movie, unfortunately I ended up not having time so I watched the movie 1st. Both movie and book being coming of age stories, I felt it was empowering and inspired women to make a life for themselves and there are constant themes, messages, poems, alliterations that say this.I love this movie because its not cliche, and although everyone wants Jo to marry Laurie, life is not like that, it doesn't give you the ""ideal or most favorable"" situation. Therefore, fans need to be excpeting of the fact and not give this movie a bad grade just because of this ( which i know a lot of people did)."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 November 2021,1/10,"Emma Watson horrible actress ruins the whole movie, would've been a lot better without her.Ugly untalented worthless actress,
I hope she does not appear in any further movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 June 2021,10/10,Well executed remake of a classic tale with the charismatic Timothée Chalamet stealing every scene with his performance.
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,8/10,The acting was good by all concerned . Some parts of the book were missed out and some parts were added from Alcott's other books . That was reasonable and fine but the ending was a step too far . It spoilt the film for me which I would have given a higher score . It highlighted the fact that the women's movement in the US is trying to change literature and history to suit their current movement .
LITTLE WOMEN,15 July 2020,10/10,In the latest years I've seen so few masterpieces... This is one of them
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,6/10,"As witnessed by my movie buddy dozing off for twenty minutes, which was roughly the length of the edit required."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,7/10,"Was chaotic bit more than i could accept. Jumping in time so often, but as a movie wasnt bad at all.
Still metascore ratings suck af. No balance."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2020,8/10,"What we can expect from the girl as a movie director?Meet Greta, a great director that will make you blame The Academy for not including her as Oscar Best Director nominees.
For me, IMHO, she is more entitled to get Oscar Best Director nomination than Todd Philips.How she direct the entire cast and crew, a camera movement, a music selection, everything is amazing.A story plot that uses forward and backward flow (a non-linear plot) packed very cleverly. It also shows how smart the use of transition in a film."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 August 2020,3/10,"These positive reviews must of been paid for, there is no way this film is a classic. This version of Little Women is absolutely horrible! I can see why Greta Gerwig didn't get an Oscar nomination for best director. I also, don't understand how it got a nomination for best screenplay and best picture. Not one actor was right for the role they were cast in. Amy is extremely unlikable. How could they use the same actress when playing young Amy? She looks older than Meg and old enough to teach the class she was in. I couldn't stop laughing at the lime scene, it was completely ridiculous! All the whining and crying from her made the movie seem as though you were watching a bad comedy. She was beyond annoying! Laurie looked younger then all the little women plus he acted immature. I could not picture him as a ladies man. There is no Jo like Winona, Saoirse doesn't have that playfulness Jo has, she's bland all around. Beth doesn't make you tug at your heart and Meg is just forgettable. Don't waste your time watching this film, it's awful. I'll stick to the 1994 version, it's by far-superior."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 May 2020,10/10,"As long as you have a lot of money, you don't have to get married. The plot is not only limited to women's marriage and marriage, but also focuses on their personal growth. They are independent and have their own career: writing, painting, music, performance. You can marry the poor man you love, reject the rich man you don't love, or choose to be single and love freedom. Marriage is not a necessity of everyone's life. Some people just love freedom. Respect the diversity of human choice."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 October 2021,8/10,"I'm watching this movie without any expectation. I don't read the book, i don't watch any previous adaptation. I really don't have any knowledge about what's about to happen in this movie. Some people complain about it being too short to cover the entire elements from the book, which I can't relate. I understand that an adaptation need to stay true to the source material. But maybe for people like me who doesn't read the book, we don't find that problem. It's a beautiful romance story blend with a family drama from an excellent performance by the cast.Saoirse Ronan as Jo March really stole the show. The depiction of strong woman personality who have to deal with her personal career, relation with her sisters, and marriage that show her struggling with life while also still passionate to chase her dream which led her to make a difficult choices. The atmosphere of a happy family also warm my heart with the chemistry between characters. Maybe my little problem is on the editing of story's timeline. In the beginning of the movie we see what happens in the present day, and then a few minutes later they jumped back to 7 years prior (They show a black screen with the ""7 years ago"" as a mark) but then they never show again which scene is when they finally go back to the present day. But beside that this movie is basically a christmas movie, a movie to watch comfortably with whole family in holiday. Everything seems and feels well-crafted and wholesome."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 July 2020,1/10,"Emma Watson is a liberal and a man hater, a real fascist whom obviously no righteous person would ever even consider to support. Thus I obviously did not watch the movie helping to finance their fascist agenda. More over it says, the March sisters - four young women, each determined to live life on her own term, confirming the fascist agenda of this movie so this movie is a no show and no righteous person should ever even consider watching it.Also, we all know, if have you seen one of these, you've seen them all, there is never something new or interesting in such fascist propaganda movies and TV shows.They are all about man hating, ridiculing men and propagating the superiority of women and the inferiority of men while using their sexuality as one of their main tools to accomplish the same.I was considering clicking yes on the spoilers choice since I am pretty sure I described the full essence of the movie, yet given the above mentioned facts, that won't be necessary, we all knew this from the start anyway."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 December 2020,10/10,"Love is dead. It means nothing to real life. At least the romantic love.
That why a lot of people liked more the old ones: they show what we expect in life. This one shows what we do have instead"
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,10/10,Wonderful compliment to the 1994 version. The acting was beautiful. The music and visuals were lovely. Can't wait to see it again.
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,7/10,"I have read Little Women and watched the 1994 Winona Ryder version multiple times. The 1994 version is one of my favourite movies of all time so going into this I knew that it was going to be hard to top that one but from all the positive reviews I did go in with an open mind, especially since I read that it was supposed to be a feminist retelling.
First of all, I think it was brilliantly acted, Saoirse Ronan is incredible and deserves an Oscar for her performance. She literally carried the movie. Florence Pugh was also very strong as Amy - but more so as older Amy, as she was quite unbelievable as a 12 year old Amy with her deep voice. However, I do think she was excellent in the role when she is older Amy and does have some of the best lines - she overall did bring out a more meaningful side of the character that had not been portrayed before, and one which is more in tandem to the Amy in Alcott's novel. Laura Dern was also fantastic, as ever, I think her portrayal of Marmee as a more complicated character who is not all goodness (as Susan Sarandon's Marmee is in the 1994 version) was much more true to the novel. Oscar winners Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper were also, expectedly, amazing and Chris Cooper's Mr Laurence was a much more substantial character in this version than the 1994 one. However, as much as I love Emma Watson, I found her performance to be sub-par and I honestly doubt her abilities as an actress, as lovely as she is. Eliza Scanlen's Beth also cannot hold a candle to Claire Danes' performance in the 1994 version.
Secondly, the whole non-linear form of the movie is really quite dislocating, even to someone who knows the book and previous film inside out, it could be quite confusing at times. At times the only way you know what time setting we are at is by Jo's haircut. I honestly think that I would have preferred the movie if it had been told linearly. I get why she did it this way - to emphasise the emotionality of certain moments - but at times it did feel like we were watching a bunch of flashbacks/snapshots of the story, which in a sense diminished the heart of the story itself. The fact that Florence Pugh barely looked any different as Amy or even Timothee Chalamet as Laurie did not help much either.
In general, I really LOVE the ending of this movie and the message about ownership of your own work, it is very empowering and I feel Greta Gerwig did a good job emphasising this at the end. I also like how there was the inclusion of certain scenes and elements from the book that are not in the 1994 version such as Jo taking Beth to the beach and also Jo regretting her refusal to marry Laurie. However, I still must say that the 1994 version will remain forever my favourite adaptation of the book - it has the most heart, beautiful performances and I do in earnest prefer the linear form of storytelling."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,9/10,"Too overwhelming. This film makes me feel so many emotions and Greta Gerwig seems to have kept the film's charm, despite it being the sixth adaptation of the Little Women novel written by Louisa May Alcott. What a lovely film."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,4/10,"This is not my favorite version of Little Women, but I understand completely why it resonates with today's generation of young women and girls. I saw this with a teenager and her mother; they both loved it. To me it resonated as ""Angry and Political Little Women"" and I am one of those who was disappointed that it deviated from Alcott's text so much.There was absolutely no reason for Little Women to be remade - especially in this strange choppy style. There have been several excellent versions available for decades- especially the one which features Winona Ryder as Jo and a much earlier version with Katharine Hepburn as Jo.I understand that I am in the minority and not a member of the new woke masses but, Hollywood, please stop remaking good movies! Stop politicizing everything and rewriting history to fit into today's political standards. It comes across as naive and false."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 May 2020,8/10,"Originally i am to see sweet tea, the result is addicted to the plot cannot extricate oneself. Each of the four sisters represents a different young woman. The eldest is vain but ends up with a real life partner. The second son, like a boy, was able to take charge of his own affairs. He did not like marriage and yearned for freedom. The old three is more realistic, the reality of a girl and the middle two is the opposite of the girls. Old four is pure ignorant, let a person can not bear to hurt. Their mother brought them up alone, and aunt may, who never married and had money. The description of the characters in the whole film is simply the best, can not help but make people think of themselves, what kind of person they are. It's highly recommended and I'm going to read the original. And sweet tea is really cool!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 April 2020,1/10,"I am not a whiner, but this movie was sooooo bad. There was no actual point or storyline in the movie. Left the cinema without watching the whole movie. Boring and goed about nothing!
Movie without quality, only the clothing and accessories of the movie were beautiful."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 December 2020,9/10,The Costumes and set design are spectacular and so is the acting from just about everyone. A film with a star-studded cast has everyone up to their best and so is the script. Haven't watched the original and I dont plan on. The thing that brings it to a 9 is the structural back qnd forth of storytelling.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 May 2020,8/10,"As a girl's must read classic, little woman is the Autobiography of American writer Louisa May Alcott. At the invitation of the publisher in 1968, Alcott wrote a book about girls, based on his own life, and became famous. Based on the American Civil War, the novel tells the life and growth of the four sisters of the March family. Beauty, youth, wealth and even love can't make people free from anxiety and pain, from sorrow, and from losing their favorite things. Because in life, some days will be dark, sad and desolate. The film is very restored and classic."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 May 2020,9/10,"I've never seen any adaptation of Little Women, nor have I read the book, although I've heard bits and pieces about it my whole life. I thought this movie was vibrant and full. Florence Pugh brings so much life to Amy, yet doesn't outweigh anyone else's performance. The directing and cinematography is perfect, and the story feels authentic. My only problem, which is not that much of a bother to me tho, is the time jumping. There were times when I had to try way too hard to figure out what timeline it was. It wasn't obvious enough-especially involving Beth's illness."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,6/10,"This movie was middle of the road for me. the costumes were fantastic and i think the actors and actresses did well. i'm super thankful i was familiar with the story bc the nonlinear presentation and jarring editing will probably confuse those who go into this movie blind. i also didn't feel like the characters were developed properly so certain scenes seemed like they came out of nowhere...particularly ones with Laurie. the actress who played Amy was great, but she seemed too mature to play the part. The 1994 version still remains superior in my mind, but thank goodness 2019 LW found an actor who was more age appropriate for Friedrich. cute flick, but nothing special."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,9/10,"Beautiful through and through! Every moment of the movie didn't feel like a burden, every character was present and well presented by the respective actors without over powering any scene, each kind of love and struggle comes through this movie. I haven't read the book and kinda didn't want to but given the acting and the way it is directed, I believe even the book fans won't be left disappointed. Everyone is awesome in their role but damn Soairse is really good as Jo. I would say that out of all the love combos, I teared up a lot on the scenes and the relationship between Mr. Lawrence and Beth. I tried to compare it with the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and I think this ending and story is more apt and feminist. Gonna come back to this movie again in the future."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 April 2020,10/10,"Have been wanting to see this movie for what seems like such a long time. It was absolutely worth the wait. It was perfectly casted, written, & directed. Such a beautiful & perfect film. I didn't believe they could top the original but this was absolutely amazing. I could watch this movie over & over again."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 May 2020,1/10,"No depth, terrible & jumbled timeline, a 30 year old playing 13 year old, a disaster of epic proportions. For shame."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 March 2020,8/10,An absolute masterpiece! Truly a movie like no other!
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,6/10,"I loved the look of the film and SR did a good job bringing feeling to a role, which never got to fully develop with the choice of jumping backwards and forwards. A lot of the sense of growing into womanhood was lost from this narrative choice. Laura Dern is not my Marmie! Watch the 90s version instead."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 April 2020,9/10,"6th film version of Mary Alcott's novel ""Little Women"" almost all of them, movies of great manufacture, great actresses, directors and the 3 most recent ones directed by women.
In addition to the highly analyzed theme of the novel's author, regarding family life and dynamics between 4 sisters and a mother, during the Civil War, ""Little Women"" 2019 with script and direction by Greta Gerwig, consolidates the original work by introducing her vision on the condition of women, in the conservative and macho society of the 19th century.
Based on the expectations and roles that society has established for them, with great finesse and at the same time firmness, the director questions the limited options that women had to face life. The script makes her position clear in Jo's voice: ""Women, they have minds and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they've got ambition, and they've got talent, as well as just beauty.""
And so, Jo shares her love with literature, her sisters and leaves the rest for her love life. Meg is the opposite, she wants to marry for love not for interest, start a family and have a home.
Then Greta, gives us another great dialogue in the voice of Amy, pointing out how difficult it is to make money as a woman to support your family and primarily how the laws favored men in marriage.
The strength of this film resides in the director's intelligence, by unmasking all these absurd positions and taboos, which have been the thought of man for several centuries and of some who still share them today.
The stupendous work of Yorick Le Saux photography deserves special mention with beautiful frames that color the deep love in the film.
The title of my review is another great phrase from Greta Gerwig's script.
Huge performance of Saoirse Ronan, also act: Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, Meryl Streep"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"I loved this! I'll admit that I didn't expect much. I have read Little Women only once before, and found it arduous to read...slowly paced and cloyingly sweet at times. The movie, however, found a way to make the sisters real. They have strong, almost fierce love for each other, yet they're normal in that they drive one another crazy at times, they're not perfect, and they have vastly different viewpoints about life. Saoirse Ronan did a phenomenal job, (as did all of the actors), and like Alcott herself was a feminist ahead of her time. I loved the set and clothing too! Very well done, and beautifully filmed!"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,7/10,This is the perfect Christmas movie. Family viewing. Chocolate box picture perfect. Classy cast. Saoirse Ronan outstanding as usual ably supported by a top notch cast. No major excitement just gentle storytelling. Predictable untila lovely ending which is a variation from previous versions. Type of movie you know whether it's your thing or not before you go to see it. If it is you'll love it if it's not you'll hate it.
LITTLE WOMEN,25 May 2020,10/10,"I've spent lot of my time watching romance-drama because it is my favorite genre ,I will say I've never seen anything like this before,
Another masterpiece from Greta Gerwig after Lady bird. The way she directed this movie is the best way it could've been done. No doubt she is an excellent director and story teller.
Flawless example of women empowerment rather than fake feminism. If you love this genre then this movie is like a treat for you and if you don't you should watch it either.
This movie has everything a perfect movie should ,acting, direction, emotion, fun comedy, character development, everything. The last time i got this type of feeling was La La Land but this movie is much more than expectations, its a relief.This story plots during the civil war ,it's about for sisters named Beth,Jo,Amy,Meg (March) with different dreams enjoying their lives their mother . It's all about the journey of four sisters separated by their dreams unite when the youngest Beth gets a serious sickness. There is a character named Laurie plays a major role in their lives.This story teaches us lot and warmth the heart with the real innocent treatment given to the story ,every character in this film is like an inspiration, mainly Jo played by Saoirse Ronan.In acting section, every one is great and all of them displayed a memorable performance .
Specially Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet ,other than them Emma Watson looked as pretty as Beauty and the beast, Laura Dern was a perfect mother ,Florence Pugh ,and Eliza Scanlen as a shy sister .
I'm not even regreting for this long review
cause it's worth it .About music ,background score is moody and fits the plot and that piano tunes I've listened throughout the movie is still ringing in my head .At last I will recommend everyone to watch it once I'm sure u will love it .
Attraction:- authentic acting, super emotional, heart warming, inspiring ,great ending , Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothee Chalamet."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 April 2020,9/10,"Little Women (2019) [D: Greta Gerwig. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh] I confess I haven't read Little Women. I started it many, many years ago, when I was a callow near-teenager, and got about halfway through. I recall liking Jo, I suppose because she was feisty. And feeling generally irritated because the story, such as it was, didn't seem to get anywhere. So watching this movie version was interesting.
The Wiki entry on the novel shows that the movie keeps to the main outline of the novel. But the movie is framed as a novel written by Jo, based on her family's life. She ends it with a romantic happy-ever-after wedding, because the publisher knows that will sell the book.
Gerwig picked up on all the hints of female strength and emancipation (limited, to be sure, this is the 1860s after all), and used scenes based on Alcott's own life, and fictional scenes from Jo's novel to weave a riff on the love romance that works, despite the goopy happy ending, and the Dickensian sentimentality in the fictional scenes of family festivities. The result is a movie that works. Which is to say, I liked it. Jo ends up unmarried (her occasional suitor marries her sister instead). Pity, she's an Elizabeth Bennet type, and deserves a man who can match her. Of course, such men are much harder to find in real life than in romances.
The movie was nominated for some Oscars, I don't know or care which ones. I liked it. If you haven't already seen it, do so."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,9/10,"Now this movie is exactly how you start off 2020 right.Greta Gerwig once again delivers in her reimagination of Little Women, and it is very good. The performances by the entire cast is beautiful; Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, basically everyone is amazing in this movie.The writing and directing by Gerwig is very well done. As well as the cinematography by Yorick Le Saux, it is spot on. Also credits to
Jacqueline Durran for the great outfits and Jess Gonchor for beautiful set design.The narrative itself is (as I've heard) slightly different compared to the originals and the novel, and it's more tailored towards modern audiences. But that aside, it's still excellent, engaging and heartwarming.There is one minor flaw with this movie and that's the time-jumps/flashback sequences. During some scenes it's easy to tell which is past and which is present, maybe some characters have a different haircut or the colour tone is contrasting between past and present. But there are a few scenes where the ""jumps"" are a bit too quick and often that you begin to lose track of which is current.Other than that, this movie is really enjoyable. One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's nice, funny, sad, cute and gorgeous."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 August 2020,10/10,"I have never read the book myself, although I know it's a classic. The movie, I'm guessing, cut short a lot of the story and everyone's personality, yet it's amazing.The scenery is stunning, the acting even better. These are some very famous and well known actors, and I never even thought about who was acting.I usually don't like the jumps from time to time, but I really didn't mind it, because it works very well for the story telling.Rest assured, I will now read the book."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 June 2021,7/10,"I grew up on the OG Little Women and I was excited to see a new making to share w/ my younger sisters, but I have to say it fell short of my expectations.The way they told the story really confused me even for someone who knows the story. I didn't like how they bounced through the timeline. I also found the portrayal of Jo very annoying. I don't know if it was the dialogue or how the actress played her, but I was disappointed.There were moments that truly warmed my heart. I also loved the costumes and set. If I wanted to watch Little Women, however, I would watch the older version instead.."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 June 2020,10/10,"I like this version. I take pictures of the enduring stories. This time, I use non-linear narration to shuttle through two groups of time and space of the four sisters. The interspersed time has causality, which can also show the value of the times. The end defuses the possible accusations of marriage and allows the audience to imagine freely. This is beyond the previous version. In addition, writing is always conducive to the development of characters' personalities and backgrounds, clearly showing their specific personalities and mentality, and a good sense of humor fills the story."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 April 2021,9/10,"Great film, great character arc, great story, great direction, great cinematography, great costumes, good score, great acting, great script, great make-up!! Really moved by this film, it has very deep layers with characters!! Bit clunky direction but movie was dope!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,7/10,"LITTLE WOMEN is the most gorgeous, historically accurate big screen version of the famous book that's been made several times in movies and for television. It has no foul language, no sex, no nudity, no violence but is a delightful character study of a family dealing with real issues during the Civil War. These things I loved about the movie. And it would be a wonderful movie if it weren't for the fact that the movie jumps around with the source material, leaves out details that were important in the book, and adds details that had nothing to the story other than to confuse any viewer who is read the book and knows these women story.Bottom line, It's a Wonderful movie on its own and if you've never read the book you will love it. However if you've read the book and you love the book and watch this movie looking for a faithful adaptation of the story you will be disappointed. It's a great movie, an instant classic, what does injustice 2 and weakens the book in many ways."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,8/10,"Little Women (2019) is a wonderful movie from every aspect. It has a powerful story, superb acting and beautiful costumes and design. Moreover, it seems to me that I am flipping the pages of a painting book. Every scene looks like a beautiful canvas."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 August 2020,4/10,"As someone who adores the book, I am deeply disappointed in this film adaptation. It feels rushed and forced. The jumping back and forth doesn't help. The characters don't age and the sisters age differences are erased. Also adding a modern feminist ending to this classic is unnecessary and jarring. I guess Hollywood doesn't know how to make a decent movie anymore."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,8/10,"The cast, the costumes and the cinematography of this film were amazing. The story was captivating, though I can't compare it to the book or other adaptations, since I have not read/seen them. It felt like it had a modern undertone which was essential to the movie.The story kept going back and forth between the past and the present, which made it a little difficult to follow at first, especially as the characters look identical at both times (especially Amy, played by Florence Pugh, who goes from being 13 to 20). Also, it seemed as if Timothée Chalamet's character, Laurie, kept appearing everywhere by coincidence.All in all, this was a great movie that I would recommend."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,1/10,"Forced to watch having read the books, this just invites people to indulge in a false bravado that they are in some way cultured having given this full Mark's on IMBD. It's boring, lazy & poorly filmed. Both thanks."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 March 2020,9/10,"I really enjoyed this movie so bad! The actuation are impressive all of the cast, the history is pretty good, the costumes are... no words for that. Is not another movie is promised"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,10/10,"So romantic, so clearly, so frankly, it has no lies in this beautiful movie, so genuine. And I love it.
Love it so much
Jo is the most powerful and honest women character I I ever know. We need others Jo in this world.
Whatever you are doing, you want to be, don't hesitate to be your self. Jo just need courage and honest and be clear"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 July 2020,9/10,"Can't help but understand where each character is coming from. Each bring and makes the completeness of this film very rich. Vulnerably honest, Strong, Generous, Kind, Resolute, Fun and Content characters in their time. A beautiful experience to be a part of in the film industry way. In short? WATCH IT. Amazing."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 July 2020,9/10,"Little Women brings a new look upon the two beautiful classic books by Louisa May Alcott. It mixes elements of both chapters and creates parallel connections between the two, resulting in a very fine movie. Under the dexterity of Greta Gerwig and the beautiful acting, cinematography, wardrobe, production design and soundtrack, Little Women is a magnificent piece of joy in the context of modern cinema."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,4/10,"So I saw this with my girlfriend and I was expecting to totally hate it and unfortunately I wasn't super surprised, but I am able to accept that I, a 15 year old boy, wasn't exactly the target audience.It got better in the third act for me, once I completely understood what was going on, and once I did, I can tell you that the movie is very smart and could be a real eye opener for many if it was more engaging to those people. I also very much applaud how they handled the time jumping with different lighting. I might shave a bit off the time but other than that, if you're interested by the trailer, you'll enjoy it but if not, you probably won't love it."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 March 2020,6/10,"I don't know how you can mess up such a simple story. The characters, costumes, locations and acting were great but this timeline jumping makes no sense because barely any of it is explained and nobody looks older or younger. Unless you've read the book or know the story , it makes little sense. Horribly made."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,8/10,"Usually a movie taken place in the 1800s isn't relevant to today's world but this story is timeless. I grew up loving the 90s version and was excited to see a big name director and actors tackle this, and they did a great job! Saoirse did Jo March justice and deserved her nomination but I already knew she would do great. Florence playing Amy is the big surprise here because she did an amazing job and deserves some recognition as well. If the editing of the movie did not have the story jumping back and forth with the timeline the movie would of been even more impactful. All in all though it was a great film."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 June 2020,1/10,"Another year, another terrible Greta Gerwig film.
After 2 tv series and 3 films why does Hollywood fell we need another version of this awful and syrupy story about a bunch of women standing around and complaining how they should stand on their own two feet.Bad acting and badly directed. Greta Gerwig is the most overrated Director ever!!
Lady Bird was bad enough but this tripe is even worse. They should have just renamed the film 'The Me Too Movement Club'. Avoid at all costs.
How this crap was nominated for best film over A Hidden Life and Ad Astra is a mystery. Oh that's right, because we have to nominate films directed by women because apparantly female directors make great films. Take Note: There has not been a great film directed by a woman since Zero Dark Thirty and that was 8 years ago!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 August 2020,5/10,"I absolutely love Florence Pugh. She's one of my favorite new and upcoming actresses, and I also love Laura Dern, Meryl Streep and Emma Watson, so I was excited to watch this.I've seen Timothee in a few things; and haven't made up my mind if I like him or not, but I do like him in this movie. Timothee and Florence really carried this film.I can't say I'm a Saoirse fan. I hated her character in Atonement, she changed my mind in LadyBird, so this was the deciding factor for me. I again don't care for her. It's not that I love the original, honestly I've never seen it, but I believe everyone else who loves it when they say Winona is the best Jo March.
Saoirse just doesn't have this lovable, nature, she just comes off as narcissist and thinking she's better than everyone else, which is how she made Jo seem; but I feel like there's a lot more heart to Jo that I've seen in the dialogue.Last, but not least, the sequences are off. So, so off. They should've just had the younger versions for half the movie and then the adult versions for the other half. They all looked literally the same way in the time jump so I just had to think about what was happening in the scene to understand if it was younger or older. That really killed it for me, and for my mother, who is a longtime fan of this film.I'm giving it five stars for the actors I previously mentioned and the costume design."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 January 2020,7/10,"It's absurd that the same actress plays Amy both at 12 and 19 years old. In the scene at her school, she looks like the teacher surrendered by little kids. 1994 approach with two Amys it's much more believable. Amy's actress is three years older than Beth's, I get that with her health issues Beth could look younger, but still think it's a weird casting. Florence Pugh is a great actress but there is NO WAY believable as the youngest sister.The new movie it's good, the constant flashbacks are a different take on the famous story, but, if you haven't seen the older versions nor read the book I don't know if the story it's clear enough."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 July 2020,7/10,It starts of where it left in the 94 movie. I'm glad they Didn't remove big parts of the book and kept it true to the book
LITTLE WOMEN,12 December 2019,8/10,I saw Little Women tonight courtesy of a preview at my local theater. It was cleverly written by Greta Gerwig especially her use of flashbacks to tell the traditional story interspersed with a later one instead of a strictly linear retelling. The entire cast was outstanding with Saoirse Ronan leading the way. Definitely worth paying for!
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,8/10,"Updated review - 1 December 2020 (approximately a year later) (8/10)This film has really grown on me. It's one I often return to during this crazy year of Covid-19.I think the main reason is that it took me a long time to get comfortable with the messed up chronology, and to understand and accept why Greta Gerwig did this. GG messed up the order to highlight how an artist such as Jo March becomes an artist, and the memories from her life that were significant and influenced her masterpiece creation of Little Women. And these memories were brought back due to current moments in her present adult life. If you note, the start if the film shows little women and the author as Lousia May Alcott. The film ends with the Same cover, but this time with Jo March's name. It's a cyclical story and journey. It's mirroring an actual writer who writes about a female's journey to become her own writer. GG tries to weave aspects of the real author into Jo March. I think it's genius.However, it did take me 2-3 sittings to get comfortable with this new order and how good it was. The messed up chronology wasn't my preference. But, in terms of telling the artist story, it was done well. And I guess this is where GG's genius came through. It sort of gave me an insight into GG and what she loves about being a creative, and how a creative is inspired, and hoe she herself was inspired by Little Women. So, in short, this version is not the little women that we're used to, and for the traditional one, the Winona Ryder as Jo March version is marvellous and still a fave after all of these years. But, there is a place for this story too. And it is refreshing considering that female actresses/artists and females in general today, still have to learn to be bold to pursue their art/dreams and negotiate what they want. The highlights of the film are obviously Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh. I go back and forth over whether I like Emma Watson in this. I think ultimately she doesn't add anything to the character of Meg, in the way Ronan and Pugh give a brilliant take on Jo and Amy. But she does do a good job as Meg. The actress who plays Beth does grow on you too. I think Claire Danes still does a better job, but Elizsbeth Scalen isn't bad, and gives a convincing and believable performance. After this year, any scenes where someone dies or is dying in a film hits me more due to suffering personal loss. I also like Marmee, Aunt March, Laurie, Laurie's grandfather, the dad, who I also think give great solid performances.In summary, give this version a chance, it may grow on you! I've rounded my rating to 8 due it taking a while for me to see the films brilliance.Initial review after watching in December 2019 (5-6/10)I loved the 1994 version and really wasn't interested in seeing another version yet. But I still went into this film full of optimism, especially as the reviews were so great. Unfortunately, in true Hollywood style, these reviews were overhyped, in a way similar to LaLa Land.What I liked (and didn't like)?The Beth storyline was solid, and the actress did a fantastic job. I especially loved the story development between Mr Laurence and Beth. Of course Beth's passing is sad, and will make many cry. But the juxtaposition of when Beth was ill previously (and then recovered), in comparison to when she passed away, was poorly done and very insensitive. This is where the fragmentation of the timeline did not work and ruined the story. In fact, I hated the lack of chronology. The change of the hairstyles of the Little Women was not enough to show the change in time periods.I love Jo March. She's one of my favourite fictional heroines. I must say that I think Saoirse's Jo was brilliant. My biggest issue was the interpretation of the Laurie and Jo love storyline. Jo is supposed to love Laurie in a brotherly & best friend way, but she is not in love with him and has always known that she would not get with him. Even my younger self who desperately wanted Jo and Laurie to get together accepted this. So the fact that this film has the interpretation that Jo would have said yes to Laurie had he proposed again was so disappointing. The fact that she seems unhappy that Laurie marries her sister Amy is unfortunate. Ultimately, this storyline completely dilutes her love with Friedrich and the fragmented timeline definitely does not help to portray their love in the best way.With Amy March, I think it is necessary to have a different actress playing the younger and older Amy like thr 1994 version. I liked Pugh's older Amy. She had one of the best monologues in the film about marriage being an economic transaction in that time (and I guess it resonates for today in some scenarios). But I didn't enjoy Pugh's young Amy - she was unlikable, especially in comparison to Kirsten Dunst's Amy.The thing I hated most about the film was the pitting of Amy against Jo. They are two strong women from that time who both knew what they wanted, and recognised that they would achieve it in different ways. So why must they be enemies? Why must one hate the other? Why does Greta allude to significant sibling rivalry? I believe two women can be very different and still be respectful to each other's choices, especially if they're sisters. I really was not on board with this interpretation.I enjoyed Meryl Streep's Aunt March and Laura Dern's Marmee. Emma Watson was ok as Meg - luckily she wasn't as wooden as she was in Beauty and the Beast.Finally, Timothee Chalet was not amazing...he added nothing to Laurie, and it just felt like it was acting in a film and he did not become Laurie for me. He was too waif in build, especially in comparison to the little women, and I 100% preferred Christian Bale's Laurie."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 June 2020,8/10,"Can share hardships but can't share happiness. When marriage comes to this, the perpetrator is also the victim. The damage on the wall can still be repaired. How to repair the cracks in the relationship. It's not that we don't love, but that the word marriage is too heavy for love."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,2/10,"So chopped up, it felt so long, and I had no idea when it would ever end because it was cut and scrambled to pieces. I had little interest in the cast. Talented actresses, but not here, weird choices. I love Emma Watson, but her accent was just off. And Saoirse Ronan has a pretty strong accent. It kept bleeding through. I have loved her in many things, but she doesn't seem to have the gravitas to play a period piece. They couldn't hold an American Accent. Much less a Northeast Accent. Certainly not a post civil war Northeast accent. It was just so distracting. I haven't seen much with Timothée Chalamet, but he didn't do much for me here. The decision to tell the story in flashbacks, everything lost any dramatic tension because there was no build up. I will say the audience, filled with Big Women, aunties and grandma's, seemed to enjoy the film. They were also very excited about the salads they had for lunch. So there you go. I enjoyed Laura Dern. Thought she did a great job.I don't understand why Fritz became French instead of German. I've been a fan of Louis Garrel's since Dreamers, but have no idea why he was cast as Friedrich. I don't think any of the sisters are American now that I think about it. So I guess it's cool to have some diversity in the telling of an American Classic, and if the performances were great, I'd understand the choice. I did enjoy Chris Cooper. Not an obvious choice for Mr. Laurence, but I almost always enjoy Chris Cooper. Sorry for the typos. Done on the fly on my phone after the movie. Just vastly confused by this. It didn't service the book, and there are other far superior film adaptations."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 August 2021,8/10,"This is a well rounded movie, all the leads play that parts well.The setting and production pulled you into the era admirably.The skipping too and fro through time was a little confusing every now and again but once you got used to this it actually helped the movie along.Recommended."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,7/10,"This adaption has better costumes, locations, and cinematography then the past adaptions of this classic book. The main problem is this adaptions writing and casting did not hit home like the other did. The actor who plays Joe is not as likeable. The actress that plays Amy was too old. The actor who played Laurie was way to young. They made weird choices with the Beth character. I was in tears with past versions and found myself yawning at important moments in this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 March 2020,9/10,"Such a compelling and heart-warming story. Truely enjoyed this adaptation. However, Timothee really ruined Laurie for me. Jonah Hauer king was best fit for this character."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 December 2020,2/10,"Abused by the huge promotion last season tried to find any slight interest in that poorly produced, miscast and boring piece of very bad movie. The frame changes and cut ups editing doesn't bring any depth to the play, characters come and go as muppets dressed. In big names held together mimicking joy and pain. Pity full."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 March 2020,1/10,"I've read the book (and loved it) I've seen several other adaptations of the book, and enjoyed them all. This one, however, was just so boring and disjointed, I couldn't follow it. I dumped out after about half an hour. They broke the story up so it doesn't happen in sequence, and assumed the viewer understood what was going on. I have a feeling, from what I'd heard, that they wanted to make the movie a modern Feminist vehicle, so had to drop a lot of what made the story actually good. But apparently all the bots Hollywood sends out to flood  with fake reviews really loved it."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 April 2020,6/10,"This wasn't a bad movie, it was actually good, but not as good as its reviews said. The 2017 version was much better in my opinion, but this was still worth watching if you are a Little Women's fan!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 March 2020,8/10,"I really liked the movie and its costume design, and of course, its atmosphere and acting. The soundtrack was elegant and the actors did a great job in expressing emotions and specific charactersitics, especially for Beth.However... one thing I didn't like is the back and forth manner. I certainly believe that the movie could have been way more amusing to me if the timeline was more chronological. I found it hard to catch up with the events, and even thought some of the past events are happening in the present. I had to watch the movie again and more precisely to understand it better...I'm pretty sure that the movie really deserved the Oscar for Costume Design. At last, I give this movie 8 stars..."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,1/10,This movie is horrible compared to the original. The acting is empty and it's basically a repeat of the lines from the one with Winona Ryder. It's ridiculous that all they're doing nowadays is redoing literally EVERYTHING instead of growing some talent and imagination. This movie sucks hard.....I hate it.
LITTLE WOMEN,19 August 2020,10/10,Very well made movie with a great screenplay that doesn't change any of the emotions from the original book. The cast all act amazing. Each of them are cast perfectly in this amazing film and they all act great. The direction is basically perfect. Greta Gerwig shouldve been nominated for an oscar but sadly she didnt. In the end amazing movie. Must watch.
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,10/10,"None of the cast and director will ever read this, but thank you."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 September 2020,8/10,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and just wanting to watch it because of the cast, and didn't pay much attention to the plot. Before (eventually) watching this movie, I assumed it took place a long time ago in England. So I was caught off guard when I head American accents coming from the cast LOLI will say the dialogue wasn't hard to follow either. Usually with films set in a period like this one, I'd expect something like ""oh how thou do tis day"" (imagine that said with a British accent) if you get what I mean.The story of the Little Women feels very wholesome and authentic. As soon as I saw their family dynamic, I had a smile on my face. Yeah, they can be chaotic sometimes, but what house with 4 young women wouldn't be? They all have different ideas of the lives they want to live, and it's nice to see how they try to reach their goals.I will say, I'm not sure if I feel completely satisfied with the ending because it felt like it didn't line up with who the character was. But that goes to show how much I cared for them. I wanted the best for everyone, but obviously things don't always work out and the film really made me feel sad, in a good way (if that makes sense).I really enjoy this movie, and it's probably something I'll watch again in the future when I want something to watch that feels real and sweet."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,7/10,"Tender, beautiful rhythm, well-kept characters and an atmosphere that holds up to the end. we all know the story, making a good movie was not easy at all. 7/10"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 July 2020,6/10,"This movie was difficult to review. I thought the actors and cinematography were excellent. What I did not like was the way the story unfolded. It was as if they took the script and threw it up in the air and filmed it the way it landed. I wanted the story told in a linear way and not back and forth. It was maddening trying to follow the sequence of events. Then add in dreams, thought scenes and I sat there trying to determine if what I saw actually happened. Why complicate such a beautiful story?"
LITTLE WOMEN,13 April 2020,3/10,"Just like a book (or most art) you can tell in the first minutes whether the movie will capture you or not.
I lasted 20 mins.
There's simply no magic.
None of it works.
Nevertheless thank you, Ms Gerwig."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 June 2020,3/10,"I find it difficult to buy into a movie where a family of sisters look nothing like each other despite coming from the same parents. Also, the image quality is quite inconsistent - in some scenes it's downright awful. I could not follow the plot or the switching back and forth, flashback sequences. Suspension of disbelief is the magic of wonderful movies and this one just does not have that magic. I am sincerely puzzled at the glowing reviews."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 March 2020,3/10,"I had very low expectations for this, I haven't liked any of the previous films made by Greta Gerwig and starring Saoirse Ronan and I wasn't a fan of the original novel so I originally had no intentions of watching it. However, everyone kept telling me how fantastic it was so I gave in. Of course, I hated it, what a mess. I really tried to like it but no, I disliked everything about it."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,9/10,"Before I start, I should state that I have not read the source material nor watched any of the multiple adaptations, so this is coming from someone with no prior knowledge of the material. To my knowledge of the reception from my cinema audience, (mostly middle aged women), this film does take liberties with the book. On a pure filmmaking front however, I feel Little Women exceeds as a great story about young women finding their place in the world. To my surprise and joy, there is no heavily politically correct agenda shoe-horned in either (despite some of the marketing and publicity saying otherwise) and is just a really well-thought piece that appeals to both young women and men.The basic set-up is four sisters with four differing personalities and desires grow up together with a loving, charitable mother who holds them together away from the horrors of the Civil War that has taken away their father. The sisters live a relatively enclosed life in their home and try to break free from these domestic shackles to embrace youthful desires such as artistic pursuits and yes boys. Which erupts from a random encounter with a rich cultured neighborly boy that pursues pleasures over hard work. The story takes us over a decade of these sisters lives as their lifestyles change, their needs adapt and the incoming adulthood is about to change their naive bright youth.It's a wonderful film that is a huge step-up for Greta Gerwig (her first film Lady Bird didn't really blow me away as it did for some) and perfectly orchestrates a tight web of stories and arcs. While you may see some events coming, none of them are eye-rollingly obvious and it's just a pleasure being in the company of all these characters. No one feels left out and all have emotional resonance to the plot.The performances unsurprisingly are top-notch with Saorose Ronan and Florence Pugh (who has quickly made herself one of the lookout young stars of her generation) pulling in astonishing roles. Pugh especially deserves an award or praise for making a character that can be at times whiney and repulsive to being rather sympathetic and loving. She pulls in a perfect blend. I also want to praise Laura Dern as well for her performance as the mother. It's been a while since I've felt Dern has really stood out in a film but here, she really blossoms as a caring woman who has the burden of looking after four children during wartime.Overall, Little Women is a film I can't recommend enough. It just works on many levels and is a shining work of what films about women written and made by women should be like."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 March 2020,8/10,"This is possibly one of the most heartwarming movie I've ever watched. Hadn't seen a movie with this much of emotions lately. Moments of sadness, happiness, true love, romance, anger, joy, frustration, forgiveness, innocence, friendliness.... What isn't there in this movie?? I don't have any other words to describe the awesomeness of this movie except saying ""it's a must watch"" for any movie lovers."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 March 2020,4/10,"It seems that ever since 1949 (the best Little Women) they've been trying to improve this movie. All the actresses of the moment are here, but there is no fire or passion. So sorry I spent the $15, can I get my money back? Characters are so simplistic! I can't recognize Laura Dern, SO MILD! I feel like I'm a child watching it. The scenes go back and forth, back and forth, ugh, it's terrible. I grew up idolizing Jo March, but not this character. And why should we care for Laurie, he's a shadow of what LMA wanted. No only am I quarantined at home, but a just watched a weak tea of a movie when I wanted a good, strong brew.
Please, do yourself a favor and get the audiobook and listen to the real story. It would be a much better investment of your time and money."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2020,9/10,"I enjoyed this version a lot! It's a well know story but Greta Gerwig's spin gives it much needed update. It made me like Amy,which I thought was impossible.
Well acted and I liked the realism. I definitely recommend watching it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 August 2020,2/10,"Little Women (2019)This movie was a tedious, overwrought bore. I have no idea what this movie was about: there seemed to be no story to tell or ideas to convey. What there is of a narrative arc was incoherent or irrelevant. The emotions are as fake and trumped up as in a television commercial. I found the time and location jumps as confusing as the motivations of the characters on screen. The director, Greta Gerwig, is for the most part competent but too often clumsy. And while some scenes were beautiful to look at, the artistry of the director is missing rendering much of the art direction pretty postcards. In short, this is no Merchant/Ivory production, not even close. There's also a needless, uncomfortable freneticism to much of the film, with many of the scenes starting with people entering a room manic and incessantly chattering. There are more comings and goings and touching and wailing and kissing and hugging than the story requires. Let's be honest here: this version of Little Women would not likely have enjoyed all the acclaim it has received if it wasn't for the fact that, for Hollywood, this was the year of the woman. So movies about women by women (director and screen writer Greta Gerwig), were cinema's new darling. Regrettably this director serves up endless and boring shots of women clinging to each other, stroking each other's hair, heads resting on laps and heads resting on shoulders, of women longingly looking out the window, tears of supressed joy and love and sadness...ad nauseum. Problem is, if this is supposed to be a modern version, and offer us an empowered way of looking at women in 2019, I'm not sure why it served up a steady two-hour offering of cheap sentiment and stereotypes, a pastiche of a girly movie from yesterday. Most of the characters didn't seem to be in the period the film was set making everything even more awkward to watch. The character played by Laura Dern seemed to belong in some other movie entirely. For me a huge problem with the movie was that the main character, Jo March, as played by Saoirse Ronan, was a total irritant. Her Jo was a bossy, controlling, blowhard you could not warm up to. Oh yes, but her hair was a constant mess presumably showing us how intense Jo was supposed to be. Is this really the new model for modern women? Even with the marvels of Florence Pugh as Amy March, Meryl Streep as Aunt March, and the terrific Louis Garrel as the impossible and come-from-nowhere lover, Little Women was a disappointment."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,8/10,"As long as you're very rich, you don't have to get married. The plot is not only limited to women's marriage, but also focuses on their personal growth. They are independent and have their own passions: writing, painting, music, acting. You can marry the poor man you love, you can refuse the rich man you don't love, or you can choose to be single and love your freedom. Marriage is not a necessity for everyone. Some people just love freedom. Respect the diversity of human choices. The room was full of moving sheets of paper, the gap between me and the best students/masters. Sweet tea is so beautiful, who wouldn't want to marry sweet tea"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 May 2020,7/10,"Every girl has her own advantages and disadvantages, but they are growing all the time. Everyone is trying to overcome their own shortcomings, trying to think of others."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 June 2020,10/10,In my opinion you have to read the book before you watch the movie. I grew up with this book and I can say that I couldn't stop crying watching the movie. It really brought me back the feelings I felt reading the book. Best movie ever!!
LITTLE WOMEN,24 October 2020,6/10,"Am I the only viewer who thought that Timothy Chalumet looked like a pre-pubescent child, rather than the suitor of two of the March sisters? Frail, with virtually no musculature or appearance of masculinity, he looked like the girls' child, rather than someone these beauties would be attracted to. And, God help us, he might have been wearing the dress of that period, but all that I could think of was the infamous Seinfeld puffy shirt. He was totally outclassed by the otherwise wonderful cast. I'm grateful that I waited for it to become a 7-day DVD at my library."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 September 2021,3/10,"Have people forgotten how to tell a story or how to direct movies?The characters were cliché, the scenes messy and the movie a chaotic mess."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,5/10,"While this is still an entertaining and ultimately satisfying film to watch, quite a few things mar the experience. First and foremost there is the inexplicable atomizing of the narrative structure of the source novel. This does not help tell the story and it would make it very hard to follow it for anyone who has not read the book or watched a previous film version. So is this supposed to be some sort of meta-LITTLE WOMEN? After all there are other postmodern touches in the John Fowles-type ending and the speaking to camera.
Secondly what's with the fast editing and close-up to close-up camera work? The mood of most of the piece is sedate and does not ask for or benefit from this rapid Odessa-steps style cutting.
Had you wanted to properly deconstruct the story (and why not?) you should not have gone so conventional and outright lavish on production design. Both screenplay and shooting/editing style would have worked better with a reduced sparse decor.
All of this smacks of a writer/director with a muddled vision but a very keen intention to be perceived as doing something different, 21st century and woke. So there is one massive ego that gets in the way of making a good film. Add to that the hardly less pronounced egos of Ronan and Pugh and the whole thing suffers. Watson does her best but that always turns out to be Hermione Granger, I'm afraid. Streep is actually good, but the role is an easy one to do well in.
So altogether a watchable film, mainly on the strength of that old warhorse of a story, but nothing to justify the hype here."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 September 2020,9/10,"As a fan of the old version i didnt want to watch the new one. But im so glad i did. its such nicely done. the cast, music, dialogues, humor, everything was so on point and exceeded my expectations. all scenes were perfectly executed and the story is so overwhelming.."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,9/10,"Might seem like a silly title for the review, but I watched this and the Star Wars movie in the same week.
Star Wars as a long time fan with my son and this film with my wife.
Have to be honest I was surprised to find myself enjoying this more. Not because Star Wars was bad, but this was much better acted with a more entertaining storyline.
Even Emma Watson finally did some decent acting, hopefully onwards and upwards for her."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2020,1/10,I did not like this adaptation of little women. It was all over the place and poorly put together. I absolutely love all the actresses in the movie and cannot fault them. Poor direction and horrible writing. I didn't love it!
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,8/10,"I have not read the book and that might make a difference. My read the book and it didn't spoil the film for her. We both loved it. The acting is fine, although Emma Watson doesn't give it much.
I understand the timeline is a bit fractured but there's a point to that and it's not complicated.
Great film, beautifully shot, great acting. One out of ten reviews make no sense."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,"Bright characters, beautiful scenery and a smart witty style. We all love Little Women no matter what year you have watched it. But Greta brushes the screen with her wit and style. Nothing drolls on. It's funny, witty and snaps to scenes but not too quickly. With just enough time so the audience doesn't get tired.
Florence Pough was superb. And so was Chamalat playing Laurie.
I loved watching Greta on screen but behind the camera, she is a dream."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 December 2019,9/10,So as someone who has read the books countless times and seen almost all the adaptations I have to say this is by far the best one! The acting is near flawless the writing is just so pleasant and the characters are as alive as they are in the book! I'm surprised this is only nominated for 2 golden globes! This whole team deserves more! Saoirse Ronan just gave it her all in this one and shined one more time! I loved Winona Ryder portrayal as Jo but Saoirse ... she's just Saorise! All the performances were beautiful but Saorise was just stunning! I'm so glad this was made and I'm so glad that I got to see it!
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,1/10,"Little women is a sentimental and overcoming story, as hollywood likes, not a complex story that addresses complex themes.
The criticism treats the story as if it were complex and with great reflections like Dostoevsky's The brothers Karamazov..
It is just a sentimental story of overcoming and with a woman wanting to prove to society that she wants to be independent and winning.
It is a story with an escape valve that can overcome obstacles and that nobody needs, wanting to prove to society in a need to be self-affirming.
Their dialogues are very simple and do not bring much thought as the dialogues of The Brothers Karamazov.
An overrated movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 June 2020,9/10,It's hard to say whether it's a modern classical movie or a retro contemporary movie. Perhaps the main creator himself didn't clarify the relatively unified thinking between the texture of oil painting and the feeling of euphoria. Ronan's classical temperament is perfectly presented in the film.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 February 2020,7/10,"I don't know the book, so I do not know how close it is to the original story.
The whole story explains the situation of women in that time nice. That is good. However the ending is far to ""sweet"""
LITTLE WOMEN,13 March 2020,1/10,What a waste of time. I don't get it. How the hell can people find this movie interesting is just beyond me. Felt like a 3hr movie. I had to break up with my gf after the movie for forcing me to watch it with her.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,8/10,"Greta has made me feel nostalgic for a feeling I cannot express. Little Women transported me back to a state of expression I've been meaning to express for quite a while. With Jo and her will to excel through life and love, I seek to gather all my strength in rowing my boat with time and love by my side. For life's too short to be angry about things that haven't gone your way. There's only a path forward, connections made with time and people living their lives, but out of all, you're living yours, as of now, and the best you can do is, be yourself, unapologetically, forever. That's what Little Women has instilled in me, toward the end. It sure is a beautiful rendition, a promising take on an everlasting classic."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 June 2021,8/10,It's a really engaging film. Feels a bit preachy at times but thats okay. Enjoyed watching it. Great camera work.
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,7/10,"The movie was really good, funny and dramatic. But the narrative makes the story confusing, somertimes everything happens so fast and so slow and the same time. Don't get me wrong, the story is awesome, the problem is how it was told."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,8/10,"So, an Oscar nomination for the movie, I definitely had to catch this in cinema as it had just been released in Malaysia and well, I can imagine why this movie was nominated. The movie revolves around four sisters in which each of them are trying to make a life on their own without the need of having to marry a rich husband. The main character, Josephine ""Jo"" March is where the movie really revolves around at its core where she is an author whom is trying to prove to the world her true potential in terms of writing as the movie takes place during the Civil War and society is more interested in reading stories which brings joy rather than the harsh reality of life. The movie has a few side plots revolving the other three sisters but that's something I will comment about later in the review.
To get things out of the way this is sort of a feminist movie; BUT hod your horses there before you start rolling your eyes or something, this is a realistic take on feminism I feel, there are male characters that aren't bad guys or some evil villain or lazy husband whom forces his wife to work because he doesn't want to; no. In fact, this is a movie where women despite the deficits and general societal stigma within the period of the movie strive for change in their life by putting in continuous effort rather than playing the victim card consistently, they actually put themselves out in the world and attempt to prove that women can do something other than just being a housewife and stuff. Usually I'd roll my eyes the moment they mention that it is a pro-feminism movie which I have no problem with feminism whatsoever but I do have a problem with delusional feminism where the victim card is consistently played and it just gets tiresome at some point hearing that guys are bad all the time.
Yes, the acting now this is a very yes (English left the room for a second there) but in all honesty, everyone does a fine job in this movie and I didn't even know Meryl Streep was in the movie. The standout stars of the film are of course Saorise Ronan (Jo March) and Timothee Chalamet (Laurie Lawrence). These two were simply incredible in this film and it could also be due to the fact that their characters and the relationship between them is the soul of the movie. They hit the required emotional notes during some intense scenes and when it's just pure joy and dancing, you can feel their on screen chemistry is what really sells their friendship in the movie.
This movie won the award for best costume design which I don't really care for the most part or know what is good or bad costumes in terms of dresses but, yeah, it must be something special if that were the case; but I can comment that the attire to the buildings it felt as though you were sucked into the period the movie takes place. However, the cinematography was wonderful especially in one scene where I found memorable in particular as it shows off the green countryside and I just found the sense of scale compared to the character within the particular moment quite interesting; plus, it was just a beautiful view.
Now, on to the negatives. This movie adapts a back and forth time jump where one takes place in the current time and another 6 years prior to the events that take place. This method was indeed an excellent way to show the contrast between the simplicity of the teenage period as compared to adulthood. However, these transitions were occurring rather frequently and despite the movie,s effort to show you the differences through the colour coding whereby the past seems more radiant and glowy whilst the current time seems more dull and gloomy, it was difficult to follow at times and there was a scene in particular which was important within the film but due to these time jumps, it sort of pulled down the emotional impact within the film.
Another issue I has was with the side plots as I found myself being uninterested or not as interested when the story revolved around the other three sisters, true, the movie needs these plots to ensure that the audience are emotionally invested with the other characters hence, the reason for these characters to have these stories of their own in the background. But, I just found Saorise Ronan's character the most interesting in the movie.
All in all, this was an enjoyable movie and well, people were complaining as to why Greta Gerwig was not nominated as best director, this is the obvious reason why, not saying she is a bad director or I have some hidden agenda on female directors, I really can't be bothered if the director is a male or female just give me a good movie; that's all I really want."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2021,10/10,Simply breath taking and makes u feel like u one of those little women.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 August 2020,8/10,"To be honest I've never seen the '94 film and while I cannot say which one is better, I can say that this film is great. I am sick of seeing all this hate and I will debunk the 3 main arguments I have seen used against this movie. These arguments are casting is bad, the timeline is confusing, and the ending is wrong.Argument One: Casting is Bad. This is the least common argument I see, but I thought I would talk about it. This argument isn't against the amazing cast itself, but instead is against the use of the adult actors in the past sequences. In my opinion the cast is perfect especially Saoirse Ronan as Jo. I get why people dislike the past sequences using adults instead of child actors , but if they used child actors I don't think that the film would've been as good. The child actors wouldn't have captured the personality of the adult actors.Argument Two: Confusing Timeline. This one is the only one that makes a little sense for me. The reason people make this argument is because of how the movie constantly jumps back and forth between the movies present and the past. A lot of people think a linear timeline would be better. I don't agree because if the timeline was linear then I think that some scenes would be ruined. The movie relies on these flashbacks to giveback story, but if there was a liner timeline it would constantly have to remind us about what happened the past portion of the story instead of just showing us.Argument Three: Wrong Ending. A lot of people dislike that the ending ends with Jo finishing the book and being forced to put in the marriage part. A lot of hardcore fans hate this ending because it goes agaist the book, but the only reason she put this in is because the original author WAS accualy forced to put in the ending of the book. Greta wanted to pay tribute to the original author by putting in this ending AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS PUT IN.In conclusion it might seem like I'm some Greta super fan or something, but I'm not. There are problems in this film and I'm sorry if it just seems like a straight up positive review, but I just wanted to defend this film from all the haters."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 July 2020,5/10,... that would just be embarassing to compare with previous versions. Not worthy of more words.
LITTLE WOMEN,22 July 2021,9/10,"As a film student, just starting out in the industry, it is shocking to learn this sexist stereotype of men dominating the business is still true. I've already learned a lot in my first year in film, but the most important lesson I'll have to get used to is that I'll have to fight for recognition. Not because I am young or just student still, but because I am a women.It has been a real adjustment, compared to the rest of my life where all genders are equal. I am fortunate however to be working at a production company owned by two women. That is rare.This all relates back to why I love this film and everything it represents. I read that Maryl Streep was the one to suggest adding in a speech about marriage and the oppression of women in that time period, it is interesting to think about what the movie would be like or how it would be different if it didn't address that topic head on.Jo is the epitome of a strong independent woman. She takes life by its neck and runs with it. Saoirse Ronan was the perfect actress to play her as well. I think the fact the Ronan just straight up told Greta Gerwig she was playing Jo says it all.There are so many intricate dynamics going on in the film that create what normally would be classified a boring storyline, a very interesting plot.The one thing I would say that should be further inspected was the relationship between Jo and Friedrich. I think they do suite eachother well, however it was such an abrupt relationship. As the audience, we did not really see them develop an intimate relationship and then all of the sudden they got married. But I'll be honest, I think my love of Laurie and Jo's friendship will taint any relationship either of them haveOverall, it is a great film with a great message and a lovely cast."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 September 2020,4/10,"Aye yi yi. This is the worst adaptation of this story that I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. Gerwig's disjointed, non-linear storytelling is extremely confusing to follow, even for someone like me who knows this story really well. I can't imagine trying to watch and understand it if you didn't already know the story.A few good points. The music and cinematography were beautiful. The acting was fine. That's about the extent of what I can say good about it.I thought most of the casting was off. Saoirsa Ronan and Emma Watson couldn't seem to hold their American accents, and Florence Pugh seemed way too old for her part. Whoever the guy was who played Professor Baer, he seemed way too young. Laura Dern felt too 21st century somehow. Meryl Streep was awesome though - no complaints there. And the gal who played Beth channeled Claire Danes in the 90's version, so that felt perfect. I actually didn't mind Timothee Chalamet, even though I usually find him too childish - in this role he seemed to fit well.Overall this movie wasn't awful, I suppose, just really strangely put together. I didn't feel like there was a natural story arc due to the constant time jumps, which just left me feeling really uneasy. Considering this story in other adaptations tends to emit feelings of warmth and love, that's a problem."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,10/10,"I just finished watching it and I have to say this movie positively surprised me, I loved the ending and the ""let's not finish with a happy marriage ending just because"". The idea of the book publisher pushing into the marriage happening, and that happening on the story in which also seemed pushing it (I mean, she had like two interactions with the guy onscreen, purposely not selling their love that much).I only didn't like the main Masculine character (Teddy) and how that ended in a positive note of ""well I wanted to marry your sister for years, but I guess now out of nowhere I love you"", but maybe that was also part of the ""well women are pushed on stories to always marry"", which is true. Jo's talk about how much she hates women are reduced to that, but that she feels lonely even though she has those convictions (which are true btw, women DO get pushed into being just about love and marriage) was a really awesome part of dialogue.I also loved all the girls characters and a lot of the supporting cast. They were just amazingly good together and I cannot stress enough that I think the Oscar nod was very well deserved."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 February 2020,10/10,"It has been a long time since I enjoyed a movie as much as I did watching Little Women. Wonderful storytelling, wonderful performances, wonderful costumes, wonderful scenery , it is just a joy to watch.
Saoirse Ronan never disappoints , the natural way she goes through all the emotions, with a highlight the scene in her (attic) room with her mother (the also fantastic Laura Dern) and the scene where Laurie (the brilliant Timothee Chalamet) expresses his love to Jo. Those fine actors know how to handle a rich scene like that. it can't get any better.
I have to admit that I did not know her, but Florence Pugh as her sister Amy was also a delight to watch.
Absolutely loved this movie, thoroughly enjoyed watching every aspect of this movie. Can not wait to see what Greta Gerwig's next project will be!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,5/10,"I enjoy period dramas, and I saw the critics rated this film high. I have not read the book, nor was I a fan of the story or the author. I expected a very good film with such high critic ratings. I left thinking the critics had jumped on the bandwagon over this film, or else they were rating it high for reasons other than its artistry. The first about 70 minutes of the film has a script that sounds like it was written by contemporary teenagers. The lines and the behavior work okay for teenagers in the early 21st Century, but they are not realistic for those of the 1860s. At about the scene where Amy is in her painting studio talking to Theodore/Laurie, the first mature writing enters the script. Amy wrestles with the options for her future, livelihood, and marriage, weighing these against her romantic feelings. Not a new theme, but it is written with a mature voice. The middle of the film gets better, and toward the end, Jo also weighs mature questions and develops into a more adult character. The end descends again into a light, Disney-film tone. Many other characters barely rise to the level of adults, e.g. the wealthy neighbor who enjoys hearing Beth play the piano. Some characters, like Marmee and the housekeeper, are given precious few lines that could not be comprehended by an elementary school child. Streep does a fine job with her character, playing it like the Grandma in Downton Abbey. There are some significant feminist expositions in the script at various points, but those occupy about 5-10 minutes of the whole. If you like the book, Alcott, or Disney movies, or if you are a teenage girl/woman, you may love this film. I am not any of these, and I left puzzled about how it could have gotten such high critic ratings. As film art, it is mediocre, but I give it a rating of 5 for its polish and its warmth, especially around Christmas time."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 November 2020,7/10,Beautiful movie. But only for those who sees movie as an art. Not for entertainments. The love in this movie defined in another level. Surely not for entertainment. Won't keep you stick to the screen.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,10/10,"Very lovely movie, Great work from Greta Gerwig, I like the two Path for the Time line , The past and the present, Fantastic Cinema-photography, And excellent soundtrack.
And for the actresses, Awesome Ronan performance she can make the audience Cry and laugh, she goes to much in deep with Joe March, I think Ronan is the next Merly Streep.
To much Thick Role For Emma stone and Meg March, small scene can count with the one Hand finger.
And the other actresses they were Very good
But I wonder Why they told us "" The movie is About Four sister, and when you see the movie it's just Go around one joe March """
LITTLE WOMEN,13 April 2020,7/10,"It seems that many of the movie reviews have been written by fans of the novel who have loved it and have treasured it for years. Their familiarity and their preordained inclination to love this movie seems to have been baked into the cake. I would certainly feel the same way about any film made from a novel by Jane Austen with which I was intimately familiar. The obvious assumption here is that I have not read this novel and, thus, I have approached this movie with only a modest understanding or appreciation of the story.I will easily grant, and I found great joy in, the capable, even the inspired, direction of this film by Greta Gerwig, who also adapted the script from the original novel. Well, to be honest, look at the actors she had to work with. The exceptional talent in the broad cast is astonishing, led by a fiery performance by Saoirse Ronan, who rewarded us with a rich portrayal of the tomboy writer, Jo March. The rest of the performances down the familial line were almost as exceptional from mother Marmee March (Laura Dern) on down to siblings Meg March (Emma Watson), Amy March ( Florence Pugh), and Beth March (Eliza Scanlon). Bob Odenkirk of ""Better Call Saul"" made a belated appearance as Father March and Meryl Streep appeared as the wealthy aunt of this perennially impoverished family.The filming was gorgeous, visually rich and colorful. The characterizations were so strong and vivid that it was easy to be drawn in to an extended story which, however, I found to be disjointed into snippets by the constant cutting and time traveling from the present back into the past and forward into the future. This would not have been a problem for someone intimately familiar with the story, but it was for me.My other major problem was with the character Laurie Laurence, played by Timothée Chalamet. While perhaps appealing as a wealthy young man, he is such a milquetoast of a character that I could not possibly envision what the two sisters saw in him. That Jo saw anything appealing in this wishy washy character as an adult is all the more unbelievable."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,7/10,"The original movie from the 90s was better, but this one is good, too. Everything feels a bit set Up and some bits don't make sense, but overall it's a nice experience. Also, I think the whole part of the sisters growing up over the years doesn't really show, it feels like the story happens in a year.
Worth watching, you won't regret it."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 April 2020,8/10,"From director Greta Gerwig, coming off her 2017 critical darling ""Lady Bird"", comes the sixth cinematic adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved book ""Little Women"". Following the goings on of four sisters in 1868 Massachusetts seeing their journey from childhood to adulthood, experiencing love and sorrow as they must come to terms with what lies ahead in their future. Thanks to the masterful oversight of Gerwig we get to observe said journey in such an authentically beautiful way.The film already feels like a classic that one might look upon with nostalgia, perhaps this can be accredited to the film's heavy thematic attention to nostalgia. Jumping between present day and the past, it gives the feeling that these flashbacks are childhood memories reappearing as the characters think back on a simpler time. Thankfully Gerwig shows constraint to not force feed us through text appearing on the screen reading ""a few years earlier"" or use blatant expository dialogue, and despite this the non-linear plot never feels confused. The choice to construct the story in such a way makes for great engagement and pace, helping to maintain the audience's attention.This distinction of time is successfully achieved thanks to cinematographer Yorick Le Saux's expert attention to colour. The warm hue of the past reflecting the joys and splendours of their childhood creates for a stark contrast to the blue coldness of the present. But while these periods differ so significantly, they are both composed of equally beautiful components. One can give much praise for this to the choice to shoot using film as opposed to digital. Giving the illustrious costume and production design of the film its true medium in which to shine. The grain of the filmstock works well in tandem with the 19th Century period of the film, giving further depth and life to the warmth of the candlelight and the snow-covered exteriors. The way the camera is able to capture the materials and colours of the period reminiscent of a great painting of the time. You can give partial thanks to Steven Spielberg for this who not only suggested, but practically begged Gerwig to utilise film once he caught word that she would be adapting the story to the screen.But what the film is dependant upon to tie all of this together is the characters, and the respective actors who have been tasked to portray them, and they are nothing short of stellar. Each member of the cast brings such charisma to the screen, and the comradery and feeling of true sisterhood from the central four characters is palpable. While many film casts will say how well they got along on set, for ""Little Women"" you can feel a genuine sense of chemistry. They feel like a real family, bickering back and forth, laughing together, and caring for each other. It is the great care that the characters show for one another which is so infectious as the viewer finds themselves becoming deeply invested in the lives of these four sisters.The two standouts however would have to be Saoirse Ronan as Jo and Florence Pugh as Amy. With Ronan displaying expertly the range of Jo's journey from joy, whimsy, and passion, to devastation, cynicism, and rejection. Whilst Pugh gives genuine humanity to Amy as she grows from a mischievous child to a mature woman.It is refreshing to see such a sweet, warm, and ultimately uplifting film. While one may say that at times it is bordering on saccharine, that would be doing a disservice to Gerwig and the casts ability to engage the audience with captivating drama and emotion. One moment the film fills you with a sense of childhood joy, the next emphatic sorrow for its characters, but never does it feel tonally inconsistent, conveying the masterful work of Gerwig's adapted script.Whilst watching the film it appears as a mere slice of life, simply observing the days in the life of these sisters, the film in the end reveals how throughout its runtime it has been building up to a satisfying and almost profound feeling of a clearly defined journey from beginning to bitter sweet end. Displaying how it was ultimately about growing up, developing some semblance of autonomy, and figuring out one's place in the world. With all this Gerwig has truly shown the world how to successfully adapt a classic novel to the contemporary cinema scene."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,6/10,"Visually gorgeous, especially the scenes in Europe but unfortunately the whole film is rather a snooze fest. I think I'll go watch the 1994 version."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 May 2020,9/10,"What a great movie it is.Watched such beautifully portrayed Movie after a long time.You should watch this masterpiec.Simple but Detailed, Common but authentic.Please watch it at least once..❤ i deeply affected and obsessed with the movie.Somewhere the movie also hurts me."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,8/10,"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon.
Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).Two things really grabbed me.1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make.
They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice.
Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music.
In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie & Julia and Philomena.I cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.Also the acting sometimes made my heart beat.
Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?Last. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.)
Something that was different with the 94 version.It is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 May 2021,6/10,"This was just OK, I would say, and not nearly as good as many reviewers and others were saying it was. I've definitely seen some better productions of Little Women, as both feature films and tv versions. Some of this film was historically inaccurate as well, as Concord, MA, in the 19th century, did not have any enormous mansions like the one the Laurences lived in. Sure, it's fiction, but it WAS supposed to be set in Concord. I have a feeling Louisa May herself would not approve of inaccuracies like that!"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 April 2020,8/10,"I'll say up front, I am a fan of the 1994 version, so I came to this movie with mixed expectations. What I found was I needed to watch the 2019 version more than once to like it, but it is good and has it's own energy that's different from the 1994 version. This update is beautifully shot (the scenes at the beach are like a painting), and all the actors do a fine job. I didn't really care for the non-linear story telling (the movie starts with the modern March sisters - Meg married with her twins, Amy already in Paris, Jo in New York), and then after their brief introductions, we are transported to Concord 7 years prior. There are a few more instances of this time play that I didn't really care for, and for the few people who don't know the story of Little Women, it can feel like some of the story is missing or disjointed. The story of Beth was quite truncated, and you never really get to build a relationship with her in order to feel the pain of her death, where literally she's there one minute and gone the next. The part of Professor Bahr (?spelling) is reduced to hardly more than a cameo appearance. How are we to believe he's somehow Jo's love when the movie doesn't bother to build any relationship between the two? He's there towards the beginning, and he doesn't show up again until the end out of nowhere to try and tie up the Jo storyline neatly so that's she doesn't remain single in the end (per her publisher's instructions). This movie does hit all the high parts (Meg's burned hair, Amy burning Jo's manuscript, Jo and Laurie's meet-cute at the dance, Beth dies, etc.) , and I can certainly enjoy this movie on it's own (the scene where Jo turns down Laurie's proposal is beyond heartbreaking), but it has it's own flaws that I think fans of older renditions of the story will see immediately. That said, I do own the movie, and will watch it again until it grows on me more, because it is good, but I still feel the 1994 version is better."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,3/10,"I am at a loss as to why people gush about this film. Went to see it a couple of days ago with my wife. When we got home she asked what I thought and I said 'meh, ok'. She said she didn't dislike it, but not great.
One big difference between our experience of the film was the first half-hour or so. I've never read the book but have seen (a long, long time ago) another adaptation. For the initial section of the film I was completely confused about what was happening - I got the idea it was jumping about in time and space but trying to piece it together was more effort than it was worth.
Once it settled down to a level not designed for those with ADHD, I was mostly waiting for a plot to emerge. I guess it was more akin to wandering round a garden owned by someone who likes colourful flowers but isn't that keen on gardening.
Clearly not a film for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 October 2021,10/10,This was just a delightful and uplifting movie. I went to see it the first time because after my mother passed away I found myself going to see movies she would have wanted to see. She would have loved this one. And as it turned out it was an easy 10 rating for me personally. I saw it twice in the theatre.
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,7/10,"I'm very grateful to have seen this film in theatres. While Saoirse Ronan is no Winona Ryder, she still pulled off a surprisingly great performance as Jo March. Emma Watson is equally wonderful as Meg March, likewise Eliza Scanlan was very endearing as Beth. Laura Dern was also a great casting choice as Marmee (even better than Susan Sarandon in the 1994 film), and Chris Cooper was also very charming as Mr. Lawrence- a great departure from his usual performances as disgruntled villains and anti-heroes. It was interesting to see Chris Cooper and Laura Dern work together since they both played supporting roles in ""October Sky"" 20 years ago.The cinematography is also very exquisite, with the art direction of the historical setting, and it includes glorious scenes out in nature. However, what was problematic was the way the film kept on going from present day to flashbacks over and over again, which would make it very confusing for those who did not read the book (I was a bit put off and confused by the scene towards the end in which Jo tells the publisher that the character in her book doesn't end up with a romantic relationship, which may have been the case for Louisa May Alcott in real life, but makes it very confusing in this story). I also felt that Florence Pugh was rather awkward and clumsy in her performance, and that she did not embody the role of Amy March like Kirsten Dunst (and Samantha Mathis) did in the 1994 version.All in all, Greta Gerwig stays very faithful to the novel, while also including a modern, feminist approach just as Gillian Armstrong had done with the 1994 version. She even expresses the struggles that women faced during that time period, when it came to the matter of financial security and competency."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 March 2020,8/10,"The best movie of little women novel, and the characters omg the best"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 February 2020,4/10,"Frustrating! This film has skilful performances but is let down by a chop chop chop back and forth narrative structure. Despite this the film does has some emotion but could be more powerful if the story built instead of chopping around all the time. It was so annoying, I could not tell which scenes were flashbacks until over half way into it when someone said look for a faint orange tint which means flashbacks. Little Women is one of my favourite stories and if I didn't already know the story I would have no idea what was happening and when it was happening. Many people thought the director was snubbed for an academy award nomination but really this is not a great film and that sounds like the right decision. The director goes out of her way to make the characters look stiff when setting scenes and perfectly framed long shots of buildings and parks. While this might be a good idea to show the repression of the times it is a little overcooked."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 May 2020,6/10,"I didn't enjoy this version as much as I did the 94 version. Both have great actors but this version left the characters somewhat empty and the constant hopping between past and current day was bothering me. It felt more like different set of ""famous"" scenes put together than a real story. I didn't get the same warm feeling than from the 94 version and this one didn't move me in any way. Unfortunately I got so bored I didn't finish watching this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 June 2020,2/10,The critics love this artsy-fartsy excrement but it has to be one of the few movies I've found to be a great cure for insomnia.
LITTLE WOMEN,11 February 2020,9/10,"Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet nailed it. The costumes were amazing, definitely worthy of the oscar! I also liked the feminist vibes of the movie, but I feel like the plot could've been better. It's a ""must"", if you're a fan of this kind of movies."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2020,5/10,"No offense to anyone....I was very bored. I gave it 5 ONLY because it was visually beautiful. Perhaps if I were a pre-teen girl I would have liked it...Did not like the original , do not like this one....to each their own, I guess"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 November 2020,7/10,"The film is not bad, but it's not that good either.First of all, all those flashbacks are really ruining it. I've read the book but even knowing the story it was difficult for me to follow. I kept trying to remember the story from the book in order this movie to make sense. I don't understand why they decided to do it this way because without seeing/knowing the characters it doesn't feel the same to see those scenes when they are grown ups in the beginning of the film.They mostly focused on Jo and Amy and did not show Beth and Meg enough.I did not like an actress who played Amy. I think she is not a good fit for this role. She is too old but also her voice is too mature so she actually seems like oldest sister.Was surprised by an actress who played Jo. I thought that she is not a good choice, but she was fine. And I am sad to say that the best performance was by Meril Strip. I think it's only because Emma Watson has too little screen time. She almost got Meg's character right.What I liked about this movie is that they tried to stay close to the book and show the story as it is written. Also costumes were nice."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"I am not a huge fan of this book or the previous movies, but I went with an open mind. This is a film from another era, nothing salacious, no sex, swearing, etc. Time is taken to get a deep and rich feeling for all the characters in the story, and I came away moved and very impressed by the care and depth of the story, the wonderful acting, and the splendid direction and cinematography. This version of Little Women may very well win over the hearts and minds of the Academy and sweep the Oscars .... if it does, it deserves the honor. Anthony Plumer, Portland Oregon"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 March 2020,8/10,"Eth died - everything never came back, Joe finally chose the not young professor- suitable for themselves rather than the green horse of the Lauren,Meg life of the rules - there is a pair of lovely twins and love her husband, a sentence ,"" kiss her before she die""-Amy and Lauren unexpectedly came together.We hope to have an expected ending with a stubborn view, a kind of stubborn prejudice that wants to keep the good things unchanged."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 May 2020,8/10,"Little women, a warm and healing movie, is a refreshing adaptation of the independent concept of feminism. The different depictions of the four sisters show the modern concept, which makes people feel the power. The costume design is exquisite. The soundtrack allows the audience to feel the heart journey of the role more deeply. All the actors in the movie have wonderful performances, such as the depictions of Jo and Amy. The part of scene design memory in the movie is warm color, while the reality is cold color. This kind of contrast has a strong influence on the plot development conflict. The clip has a good grasp of this kind of time shuttle narrative. The sisters have their own pursuit and ideas in the growth process."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,6/10,Emma Watson should have been Jo. Soairse Ronan is too uptigh and bland. I loved more the 1994's version with Winona Ryder.
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,9/10,"I have read Little Women and all 4 books in this series at least 50 times. Jo March was one of my heroines growing up. I have lived through the tumult of her times felt the pain of the characters every time I read the book. So, when my friend invited me to watch this movie, I wasn't expecting that it could deliver anything new, tell me anything I already didn't know. Was I ever so wrong! The adaption blew me away. The juxtaposition of the scenes jumping back and forth in time rearranged and reconnected the story in a sublime manner. Kudos to Greta Gerwig on a moving heart felt adaptation. Saoirse Ronan was simply stunning. First time I am watching her and she is a breath of fresh air. She brings Jo March to life with all the layered complexity of her character. The rest of the cast was competent except for Timothee Chalamet in the critical role of Laurie. In my opinion, he wasn't a fit. Bringing Lousia May Alcott to life through Jo was a lovely touch. The last scene of Jo getting her book printed, bound and embossed the old fashioned way was classy. Every time I read Little Women, it always gives me new meaning and I find a nuance I hadn't noticed before. This movie did the same thing. It was like reading this timeless classic and enjoying the comforting familiarity of a well known story and yet finding new perspective in it."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 November 2020,10/10,I cried and cried from being sad and also happy this movie is beautiful on so many levels.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 September 2020,7/10,"I think this movie was very well casted with performances from the greatest young actresses of our time like Saoirse and Florence leading the movie. Well actually perfectly casted bar Chalamét, and I say this not as a jab to his acting abilities but because he really does look perpetually sixteen as someone has already stated. I feel an older actor would have been able to convince us better and allowed us to differentiate between past and present Laurie.I appreciate how Greta has told this story that is as old as time in a way that is much more receptive to modern audiences. The themes of feminism and attitudes towards marriage are more prominent in this version and helps bring a new light to characters like Amy and Meg who weren't given as much chance to shine in previous versions. We get to see Amy and Laurie's relationship actually become something other than a few fleeting scenes before they are apparently wed. It felt right to see that get explored.Yet, I do have some qualms about a few changes Greta made that perhaps didn't work as well into the movie. Beth's death is a scene that usually milks the most emotions and grief but in this movie it was not really done justice due to pacing it felt lacklustre. Also another direction that Greta chose to take was pushing Jo and Friedrich's relationship as a friendship until the very end when Jo realises she loves him. In this way the ending suffers as it's hard for us to believe they love each other when we are shown nothing to suggest that besides a few glances and smiles between them. The mentor/mentee dynamic is non existent and this is what their romantic relationship in the book was built on. There was no common interest of transcendentalism or anything further than liking Shakespeare (a scene which was just tossed in). I would have liked to see their relationship start from something so we can appreciate how they end up together that much more.I love this version for taking a new approach but I also think in some areas the changes and the effect of pacing on the storyline delivery hindered the movie from being better than it could have been."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,,"Little Women Mini Review
Endearing is the word that best describes Louisa May Alcott's story about Little Women, and Greta Gerwig's adaptation was no different. Gerwig spun this tale in a new fashion, allowing time lapse shots to transition us between past and present rather than retelling the story in chronological order.Saoirise Ronan was captivating as Jo March, while Laura Dern proved a worthy choice for Marmee March (as did Meryl Streep for Aunt March). You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll leave feeling more wholesome than before - this rendition of Little Women delivers on all counts and it shouldn't be missed.
JaYneWatch It Wombat"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 September 2020,8/10,"Stellar performances from the cast with career highlights from the likes of Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh. The writing and directing are all top notch, and is likely the best Little Woman adaptation."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,8/10,"'Little women' is a beautifully narrated story adapted from a book with a cast that deserve all the praise. However, one of the flaws that seemed to bug plenty of people was the few slow paced screenplays that seemed to pull back the narration. Even though the director found his pace later in the movie, the first 45 minutes didn't help the story move any further, rather seemed like it was beating around the bush.
However, don't get me wrong, the movie eventually learns to satisfy audience with a surprisingly wonderful end.
If you want to enjoy this movie all you need is a little patience."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,10/10,Greta Gerwig has outdone herself once again with her incredible storytelling ability. To take a story that has been done this many times and create something new and beautiful is an incredible feat. The characters come to life and I think everyone can find bits of themselves in every character which makes it very compelling and absolutely heart wrenching. I felt empowered as a woman. EVERYONE needs to see this film. Greta was snubbed for the Oscar but it doesn't change the fact that she did incredible work.
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,7/10,"Not having watched any previous adaptation nor read the original novel, I walked into the theatre with no expectations, but nevertheless a little wary about the title, but aware of the stellar cast. Despite being overshadowed by the likes of 1917, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, and Jumanji, Little Women has passed a whopping $100 million in its worldwide gross, and the reason for that is obvious, it's a superb film that tugs on your heart as you take a trip to the 1860s.Saoirse Ronan delivers a powerful performance and her connection with Chalamet is undeniable, but the sisters, Jo, Beth, Amy, and Meg show cinematic synergy of the likes never captured before and that's thanks to the spectacular acting done by Ronan(Jo) , Watson (Meg), Pugh (Amy) and Scanlen (Beth). It's no wonder why it has 6 oscar nominations, and we'll soon see which ones it'll be able to grab.My one and single complaint is that the flashbacks in time can be muddy at first and slightly confusing, but after moments into the scene it becomes obvious as to whether it's the present or not. It's a nitpick but nevertheless there.This is the one adaptation to watch and I would reckon the closest thing to reading the novel. Greta Gerwig has delivered again with this movie, the cast is amazing, the script is amazing, the directing and shooting is amazing, the movie, in all the ways possible, is amazing."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 June 2021,10/10,"The way i felt watching this movie was AMAZING you can feel every emotion watching this movie you feel happiness, anger, sadness, excited. It's a must watch in my opinion it's great for all ages."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 May 2020,10/10,"... follow. That said, no complaints. I couldn't keep up. Loved it though."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 September 2021,8/10,"This was a really satisfying film to watch, and totally took me by surprise as I didn't get bored as I had thought I would. I have postponed watching this movie simply because of watching that Friends episode where Joey and Rachel partly spoils the plot, and thought I had it all figured out. I hadn't. There is a much deeper plot to this story, a heartwarming, yet heartbreaking but also uplifting storyline. I was only a little disappointed in the ending, but only because of personal preferances of whom should have ended up with whom, but I also kind of like when everything isn't just set in stone from the beginning. Worthy of being watched again and possibly in the near future."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,8/10,"I love this story - seen many versions. This was good but found the editing from past to present rather confusing and annoying. That said, some seriously good acting and great fun dynamics with the sisters."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 July 2020,10/10,"Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with this job. Her best film she directed since Lady Bird! Cast, Costume Design, Performances deserves a lot of praise! Must see film for sure!"
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,1/10,"I just could not follow it for well over an hour, nor was it interesting until the last 30 minutes where it was just ok.I could not recommend it.I expected far more from the cast."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,10/10,"First I will say that this movie is kinda about a few things. Firstly it is trying to highlight the struggles of women with what society expected from them around in the 1800s era. Very much so still ""Get married and have kids"". Clearly people were starting to wake up, as these women's aspirations extend beyond that into creating things. They have life passions, but society keeps stomping in their dreams. It's sad.The second thing is about the nature of love, and it kind of plays into the first point in a way. You have three sisters in particular. On rejects love in favor of her passion, and lives to regret it. She realizes in her you adulthood that she is lonely and sad as a result of perusing her writing with all of her energy. She even comes to realize that she has compromised on her values as to what she wants out of writing. She ends up settling for her second pick of a relationship (or does she?) as a result of waiting so long to come to this realization. The second sister marries for love. The only issue is her husband is poor. She is a stay at home mom struggling to be fulfilled with what she has. She loves her life, ans would not change it, but she is suffering in a very physical way. The third sister loves the boy who loves the first girl. She becomes tired of failing repeatedly on the road to mastering her craft (painting) and decides that maybe she will get married. She decides ""uck it I'll marry for money"", but end up marrying the boy she loves, even though she is his second choice. The fourth sister dies of sickness, but was devoted to her art. It's significant because it is symbolism for purity. It's basically saying it is fragile and hard to maintain.So yeah. A complex movie full of emotion with a lot to say about being you, being a woman, love, loneliness, passion and all of the other ailments of the human affliction. Fantastically done."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"I don't know where to begin but I will start with, it is pure perfection. Couldn't have been done better. I felt every emotion throughout. It makes you feel and think and you finish the film left with a mind wandering. It made me feel and react. That's what film is about, provoking. This definitely did that no doubt about that. I highly recommend, it's now on my list of favourites."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,9/10,"Having read the book as a child I've always loved the story of the March sisters.
This film does not disappoint although it seemed to be in a different timeline order to the book with going back and forward to the past. There were very strong messages to inspire young women as with the original book. I thought it looked stunning and the cast were all very good especially those playing Jo and Amy. I would definitely watch it again. I have only seen the 1994 version once so can't quite recall it to compare.
As the book inspired me as a young girl to try and make my own way in the world without the need to be married I believe those messages are still relevant today 35 years later."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,1/10,"I am happy that Greta Gerwig did not adapt Les Miserables and War and peace which are very complex classics for her to understand and destroyed them in a mediocre adaptation.
It is enough to have destroyed The count of monte cristo and The hunchback in mediocre adaptations."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,1/10,Let me start with I love Little Women but not this version. I can not in honesty give a good review just because the book and other versions I adore. This was a mess all around. Even with much knowledge of the story it was hard to follow which timeline the story just jumped to till part way through the scene. It did not flow at all. Much of the cast did not capture the essence of who they were portraying. That mixed with a jumbled mess of time jumping lead to no character development and no feeling for the story or characters. I so wanted to enjoy this. I just couldnt.
LITTLE WOMEN,4 April 2020,8/10,"This was so beautifully done. The quality of the filming and of the acting was spot on. It was emotional, inspiring, sweet, and definitely worthy of watching for years to come."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 July 2020,6/10,"It was entertaining but nothing more for me. I could not connect to the characters, to their feelings, to their struggles. I think the biggest problem for me was the use of multiple timeframes. This bouncing back and forth in time prevented me from feeling empathy and being involved in the characters' story, as you don't see them growing, you don't get to know them and see their relationships developing. I believe the double timeline also killed the pathos in some scenes that were supposed to be very emotional.I don't care about the story being true or not to the book as I believe every adaptation must bring something new, and I guess in this the movie was successful. I liked the explicit feminist approach it took, but I was simply not emotionally involved.Another thing I did not really like was the choice of having the same actress play young and adult Amy, I did not find her believable as a 12-year-old girl.Overall acting was good, although not top notch for me. Cinematography and lighting deserve merits too."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 February 2021,8/10,I absolutely adore this film. i could watch it on repeat and not get bored
LITTLE WOMEN,8 November 2021,7/10,"+: I loved the movie. It made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me cry (several times). It's beautifully filmed. The acting is good. The music is good. Loved the costumes, of course. The story is touching.-: All the jumping back and forth in time (without much visible physical changes) and between different locations was confusing. I didn't know the story (haven't read the book or watched any other adaptations) and I had a hard time following. I think I got it, mostly, but it was tiring. At times I wasn't sure where and when we were anymore. At some point I kind of stopped caring about getting all the details of the story in the right order. I would have much preferred to be told the story chronologically."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,1/10,"I never read the book, so I can't speak to the film's authenticity, but every single scene where the sisters were together was nothing but screaming, giggling, and talking over each other so much that I couldn't understand what the scene was about. The jumping back and forth in time was confusing to the point where it seemed that it took Beth 7 years to die. I think scarlet fever worked a lot faster back then. Plus, they complained about being poor, but they lived in a gigantic house with Victorian furniture and fireplaces falling all over the place. And a housekeeper/cook who prepared so much food for breakfast that it took the mother and the 4 daughters to schlep it over to a real poor family. Oh, and the skits they put together in the uninsulated attic in the winter? Not in New England they didn't!Can't comment on the acting because most of the scenes are so short and convoluted I couldn't discern any acting.Soooooooo disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,8/10,"It's quite an achievement to tell this well-known story in a fresh way, hewing closely to the plot but subtly updating with new perspectives and gently updating the dialogue without it sounding fake to the time or the characters. The cinematography is lush, there is a compelling intimacy and the acting is superb. I thought the flashback structure was a bit overdone and unnecessary. But my biggest issue was the complete lack of development of the relationship between Jo and Professor Baer. She has fun one evening dancing with him in the theatre and there is an episode where he tells her her writing is no good. That's it? She falls deeply in love with him - to the point of overcoming her aversion to marriage - based on those limited interactions? To me that was this movie's major flaw and left it wanting."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 July 2020,1/10,"Too much jumping around in the story anyone who come into the movie who has not seen any previous versions or read the book would be totally lost. The actor playing Laurie was too young and unimpressive. There was no chance to get into the characters at all because the plot changes took away from their development. The 1994 version is so much stronger and better. Saorise Ronan was good but still not strong enough as Jo. The supporting characters are awful, why they even bothered with aunt march I don't know - disaster."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,9/10,"I enjoyed this new film of a well known book and other movies very much indeed. I know this story so well, read the books a few times, saw the version with Janet Leigh, June Alyson, Elizabeth Taylor and Margaret O'Bryan, and decided to see it again with a few doubts. I need not have worried because I was in safe hands with Greta Gerwig. The imaginative blending of the story behind the story worked perfectly for me and the casting, about which I had had my doubts, was spot on, with one exception. Even this was allayed by the time I got to the end of the film. It was Professor Bhaer who annoyed me when he first made an appearance, all wrong for the short sighted middle aged stout professor of the book and previous films. By the end, when the clever blend of fact and fiction ended entirely satisfactorily, I thought yes Greta went the whole hog and not only made Jo marry, but gave her a handsome Latin husband, perhaps loves young dream! Result!"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 November 2020,9/10,"The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because of the costumes. They weren't terrible, but didn't make any sense to the story or time periods. I was heavily confused about the age of the characters in the film; and weren't they supposed to be poor?Anyways - the writing, acting, and the overall aesthetic of the film is marvelous. It really is a treat, and I laughed out loud on several occasions."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 August 2020,8/10,"I finally saw this version and thought it was well done. It's refreshing to have a real family film that everyone can watch. The only complaint I have is that things get confusing with the back and forth timeline, making the story not flow very well. Also, as well acted as this remake was Winona Ryder will always be the best Jo March (I still prefer the 1994 version)."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,9/10,"I went to this with my wife as a quid pro quo for years of her attending the Lord of the Rings movies on their release. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, the scenes with the sisters as a family were joyous and the acting throughout was of a high calibration. Highly recommended."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,4/10,"I am a big fan of the original texts having read the books on an annual basis for 20 years. I also adore the 90s movie. I was excited but nervous to watch this adaption and finally gathered the courage to watch it tonight.First off I am not a fan of Flashbacks and it irritated me trying to keep up with the timeline.Jo March has always been my favorite fictional character she is awkward, loveable, fiery, talented and passionate. The Jo March in this adaption was not that likeable she was arrogant, static and oddly cold. I feel that the relationships were not developed enough we didn't see enough of the sisters bond, their love and admiration for Marmee and how they opened their home and hearts to Laurie, as the heart of the story is about the sisters more focus was needed on this. Also from viewing this adaption I can't see any relationship or fondness between Laurie and Jo, the proposal seemed to come from nowhere.For me Beth's death was confusing due to the simultaneous flashback scenes and seemed to drag on for some time.As a standalone movie I feel I would have enjoyed it but the heart of the book was missing for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 June 2020,6/10,"Having not read the book, nor having seen any of the other adaptations, I can truly say I went into this blind. I expected a romantic story of sisterhood, and I got exactly what I came for.Ronan and Chalamet were brilliant as always, and it was the first time I'd seen Florence Pugh, who was also solid. The costumes were well deserved of their accolades and the cinematography was exactly what you'd expect for a romantic period piece.Plot-wise, I enjoyed the lack of chronology, as well as the lack of hijacking the story to push any agenda but for the endurance of sisterhood, to which I was pleasantly surprised.Bar that, genuinely nothing of note happens; the sads aren't too sad, and the happies not overly joyus; to which I suspect is the reason it's given it's U rating.Not one to call home about, but not bad by any stretch either."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2021,4/10,Loved the older version. Should have watched that one again. This one felt a like a waste of my time.
LITTLE WOMEN,9 March 2020,10/10,"The story, oh my, it keeps you on the edge! Four amazingly strong female characters, who were just astonishing with their performance."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 March 2021,10/10,This movie is so well made its incredible. From the acting to the soundtrack. Easily one of my favorites movies of all time!
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,10/10,"LITTLE WOMEN
Written for the Screen and Directed by Greta Gerwig
Greta Gerwig does it again! After making an exceptional debut as a writer and director with the uplifting Lady Bird, she presents not only a faithful adaptation of the beloved novel, she captures the essence of relationships, family, and love.
The screenplay is structured in a non-linear style; the narrative intercuts between the winter of 1861 and the fall of 1868. However, the film embodies a pleasing rhythm and fluidity, that the scenes intercut subtly. The winter of 1861 has golden and warm color pallet; while the fall of 1868 accomplishes a grim look with a gray color pallet. Nick Houy's editing beautifully accentuates the non-linear screenplay with motivated cuts, and tremendous visual cues that leave a profoundly powerful impact. Greta Gerwig's sense of staging and blocking a scene is just fantastic. She keeps the consistency and rhythm of her screenplay by pulling the best out of each actor; as well as creating a symphony of sounds with overlapping dialogue. The overlapping dialogue represents the wholesome spirit of the March family. Greta Gerwig captures both the happiness and sorrows that the March family experiences in the classic Louisa May Alcott narrative with sensitivity and compassion. The film embodies this grounded environment, barring the fact that each scene is perfectly staged and designed. The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is as harmonious and compassionate, as the spirit of the March family.The cast is phenomenal! Each actor gives a very nuanced and thoughtful performance! Saoirse Ronan continues to evolve into a mature and sensitive actress. Her portrayal of the talented and perceptive Jo March is heartening. Her screen presence leaves an everlasting impact of joy and happiness with her portrayal of the free-willed Jo March. Emma Watson is equally brilliant with her compassionate performance as the older sister, Meg March. Florence Pugh portrays Amy with a sincerity that makes her character likable. Her performance as Amy adds another dimension to the characteristic of Amy March. Eliza Scanlen as the youngest sibling of the March family, Beth, beautifully evokes the most emotional moments in the film. Her character is the backbone of Louisa May Alcott's narrative, and she portrays the pillar of support and encouragement she is for Jo. Timothée Chalamet is sincere as Laurie. He makes his presence felt in every scene. Laura Dern as Mrs. March ""Marmee"" beautifully embodies the warmth, selflessness, and kindness of a mother. Her performance is the epitome of the gentle spirit of a mother. Meryl Streep is, as always, incredible as the stingy Aunt March. Each actor gives a brilliant performance and add brilliant dynamics to their character.Greta Gerwig's Little Women beautifully presents the beauty of relationships. Little Women signifies the fact that some stories are truly timeless; and art is an imitation of life. The film's lessons of compassion, self-sacrifice, devotion, and passion is as relevant today, as it was in the 19th century. From the brilliant performances of the ensemble cast, the skillful and immaculate production design, the compassionate score, the emotionally intelligent screenplay, and Greta Gerwig's vision and visual language, culminate to make Little Women an equally sorrowful and uplifting film. Jo was inspired to write ""For Beth"", I rushed home to write ""For the Audience""."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 January 2020,1/10,"Why should one take a very good classic film and make a bad remake of it? What is the point? That's what has been done with this new Little Women. Bad casting, worse acting, ugly actors. Even the babies are ugly !!!! Every second reminded me of the 1994 version and reminded me how good THAT was and how bad THIS is. I am surprised to read some positive reviews talking about women's lib and such mambo jumbos. Come on !!! a classic is a classic....don't ruin it with mobile phone and thorn jeans conveying no emotion at all....."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,1/10,"The movie is definitely not bad at all, it was the first adaptation of little women that I have seen. And also i didn't read the book so my opinion is basically based on how the film was executed technically and the Screenplay without comparing it to the novel or the previous films.Directing wise. Gretta Gerwig has a style and can be seen and felt in her movies (Little women, Lady Bird). I personally have no interest in that style of storytelling but it's not a WRONG or a BAD style so why not?
But I was so annoyed and against what she deicide to do in the editing room... Probably she thought it will be a good idea doing these parallels but it wasn't especially with this kind of films. Coming of age, historically dramatic pieces can't afford to be edited that way because realating and investing in the film and the characters will be times harder. It should have been a simple edit with some flashbacks and that's it...The cinematography was nice. I liked the cold and the worm moods, it helped the audience to seperate and tell because sometimes it was a bit hard to tell what it's now and what's then.Acting was good. Outstanding? NO.
Soirse ronan is a talented actress, no one can deny that. She has a nice way with displaying emotions and what she did in little women was more than enough.Florence pugh was really good honestly. I liked how her character could have been the villain but she's stayed loyal to the story (this kind of film and story also can't afford to have a VILLAIN) but she sure showed us that amy can be mean, childish yet sympathetic. And when her character became in her 20's the acting and her skills are shown in a much much better way (her voice is amazing).Eliza scanlen delivered a really honest opinion, The only time i got emotional in this film is when Beth is in the scene... She's quiet yet not so quiet. I love when actors can do that, though the editing was not fair and was about to destroy her performance.Emma watson was nice, she was cute and likable, and since her character doesn't have much to do or offer, I am not gonna blame the actress.Laura dern was ok. The very vulnerable characters don't suit her that much.Timothée chalamet was kinda lost. I didn't like how he portrayed the character. No wonder Jo didn't fall for him, he can be the best friend at best. Sometimes he even looked lost. Not bad acting but kinda repetitive since he's doing the same things in every movie he's in.Meryl streep was Meryl streep. No matter hiw much makeup or costumes are added. U can always tell that this is meryl streep acting. She acts good but that's it. U can never relate or feel with any of her characters.Chris Cooper, louis garrel, James norton and jayne hoodyshell were all really good in their supporting work.
Editing was bad, like really really bad.
The story overall is not bad, but can get boring. And the pace... Don't get me start.Overall not bad film. Some elements uplifted the story and the film but so much TECHNICAL things can be changed for a better result."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,6/10,"I really wanted to like this movie. With such a fantastic cast it seemed inevitable that this was going to be a great adaptation. As a whole between the wardrobe, houses, and landscape it really was overall incredibly beautiful and visually stunning. There were also some great casting elements such as Chris Cooper as Mr. Laurence. I've never liked that character as much as I did here because of his performance. Emma Watson as Meg was my favorite role I've seen her in.
That being said, the rest of the cast was just ok. Such incredible talent but just not right for this film. The biggest casting flaw being that Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh just did not have believable chemistry. Being two of my favorite actors I was excited for their pairing and it just didn't work.
I'm not a fan of movies that move back and forth through time, it takes away so much from the story, especially when it does so in such a mashed up way which is exactly what happened here.
Lastly, the overbearing throw in of the oppression of women that should have been left out entirely. I'm tired of films shoving unnecessary societal and political views in stories where they don't need to be a part of the story being told.
I wish I could have rated this better but the combined elements of the partial wrong casting, the awful back and forth story telling, and the unnecessary political jabs all ruined what otherwise should have been a beautiful adaptation."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2020,6/10,"I was somewhat disappointing by Greta Gerwig's Little Women. In the excited lead-up to the film's start, it became apparent that much of the audience was anticipating a reunion with old friends; the happy chatter as the end credits rolled suggested that they were not disappointed in their most recent re-acquaintance with these beloved characters. I, however, have neither read the book, nor seen any of the previous screen adaptations, and that lack of familiarity with the source material left me feeling lost for much of the film. The use of non-linear narrative left me unsure as to when events were happening, and the relationships between the sisters and some of the peripheral characters were not entirely clear to me. I left the cinema feeling like I had accidentally crashed a party, albeit a beautiful one, where everyone knew each other except for me. Surely a good adaptation should cater for everyone, not only those who are acquainted with the source material?"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,4/10,"This movie was well made but ITS SO BORINGMaybe this just isn't my style of film, but I was looking at my watch every 10 secondsI need to give credit where it's due. The acting is phenomenal (most of the time), the cinematography is amazing, and the look of the film is perfect. From a filmmaking perspective, I have no complaints.However, as far as the story and characters go, I couldn't care less. I wasn't interested in any of the storylines, I had no idea what the conflict was supposed to be, and overall I just didn't care about any of the characters. I'm sure the book is phenomenal and I understand why this movie connected with people, but it just was not for meI won't go into too much detail because I've already forgotten about most of it"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,2/10,"I was expected to be mind blown given the reviews and fuss made about this movie. But after ten minutes in I was bored. Totally and irredeemably bored. It just jumps from scene to scene and provides no story line. It's as though each page of the book has been brought to life but without the benefit of the author's text to fill in the details.Is it technically good? Maybe, but what's the point if there's nothing to hold on to.Flatters to deceive. Style over substance. Dialogue over exploration. And ultimately just a bit, well, boring."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 November 2020,7/10,"You can never go wrong with a little women movie. To be fair there have been a lot through the ages.
The acting and chemistry between the sisters is strong. Saoirse Ronan and Emma Watson are always big crowd pleaser. Watch out for Florence Pugh as Amy March shes smashing it at the minute.Good movie all round and one of the better little women adaptations."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 September 2020,5/10,"Some very artificial world is depicted, a toy world. Who are these people? What planet are they from? How do they make a living? Feels staged. It is staged, but it also feels staged. A spectacle.
And it's terribly difficult to follow the plot.
Very good acting though."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 May 2020,8/10,"I was hesitant to watch yet another version of this story but am glad I did. The original story is still there, although there some back and forthing in time which is a very popular storytelling techniques these days. The acting is superb, the characters really come to life in a way that remains true to the original . Yes the ending is different but I appreciate an original interpretation that actually pays homage to Alcott and the life of women in her time."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 October 2020,10/10,"I love the 1994 film so was apprehensive about watching this one, but I've enjoyed many films with the actors so gave it ago but was fully prepared to dislike it. I loved it!! It's going to be a tough choice between the 2 versions in future, but which ever is available I know I will be happy watching it.
Definitely be recommending this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,9/10,"I really enjoy this movie, It's beautiful, the performances are perfect. I had a little trouble following the timeline jumps sometimes, because the actors didn't change much between the future and the past. But I felt it was a great movie, and I cried almost the entire movie"
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,3/10,"I enjoy about half the chick flicks I watch but this torpid and tedious chronicle is best left for those who revel in the search for and adoration of leading ladies. That's nice but my female side just wouldn't come out to play while watching this one. It was painful. However, my wife liked it enough to earn me enough points to get my wife in to see Ford vs. Ferrari. She liked that too."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,6/10,"Despite some good acting by others, especially the marvellous Laura Dern, the core of Little Women is the character Jo, and Saoirse Ronan is the wrong actress for this part. She is too noisy, and bounces around too much, in an overzealous attempt to portray quirkiness and stubbornness. But she is completely incapable of carrying off the inner strength that was essential to Jo's independence in defiance of social norms. Ronan's Jo made me feel concern about her emotional and perhaps even mental stability."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 November 2020,8/10,Who else was disappointed and or sad that Jo didn't end up with Laurie??? But did she end up with Friederich or not? So much confusion! But it's a nice movie. Would watch it again.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2020,7/10,"The first half hour nothing happens and really boring, I almost switched off but then it started to get a story.
I think the book is probably better because the storyline is nice but the film is in my opinion a bit more than average.
Definitely not a 10 as a lot of people rate it but nice after all."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,8/10,"First of all, this is still way too feminine a story for someone who's not so feminine herself, such as I. But this cinematic journey has been well worth it, given the stellar casting, wonderful production design and locations, sophisticated yet easy-to-digest storytelling technique and the wonderful score. I can see how some may want Greta Gerwig to be among the Best Director contenders at the Oscars.The storyline is nothing new, we follow the growth of four sisters with flashbacks along the way corresponding to what happens in most recent times. I marvel at the direction by Gerwig, the storyline structure is not Christopher Nolan-esque but it truly opens up a fresh angle to look into the March women's lives. The cinematography captures the different times vividly and I rejoice at the fact that it's done by Yorick Le Saux, the masterful cinematographer who makes hell of a silver screen wonder that is Only Lovers Left Alive. The production design and Oscar-nominated costume design presents a pleasant peek into the mid 1800s America and even France. Even if the story doesn't interest you, the aesthetics will certainly inspire you to savor what life was like during that period of American history.I also have to admit my near-unconditional admiration for both Ronan and Pugh, who define this new era of girl power in Hollywood. Their performance carries the whole movie, evidenced by the Oscar nominations. As of Ms. Watson, I regret to say her acting is as boring and predictable as ever, and she probably will always be Hermione. The time and money her publicity team spent on training her to be a speaker for women should have probably been invested instead to acting lessons. Ronan and Pugh certainly came after her, and yet look what they are able to achieve. I love Laura Dern's Mrs March as well as Chris Cooper's Mr. Laurence, they make the best type of mother and father figures I could ask for. Bob Odenkirk as Mr. March? Totally unexpected, yet totally fascinating to witness. I think he does a great job despite the limited screen time. Timothée Chalamet totally knows what he's doing, what a great rebirth of Laurie, I think Christian Bale would approve.Is it Oscar-worthy? Absolutely. But is it as worthy as some of the other Best Picture contenders in 2020? I can't really root for it when some of the masterpieces in the category exist. I like the film in its own way and I believe it has received such acclaim that a victory in any one of the 6 nominated categories would be a total win for Little Women."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 November 2021,4/10,"I have only watched the first 45 minutes, but already don't care for it compared to the 1933 version. For one thing all the switching back and forth of the time lines. I don't like that it tends to make it kind of jumbled up, it doesn't have a smooth flow to it. And in one 5 minute scene they have compressed what the original took half to happen. They have completely cut out the main scene where Jo goes over to Laurie's and meets him and his grandfather. Instead they combine it in a rushed scene with all the women and Marmee at once and included with the glove scene and the borrowing the piano scene. It's just a mess."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing a new adaptation of Little Women my heart sank. Was Hollywood so devoid of new ideas that we needed yet another remake? As a fan of the 1949 and 1994 versions, did we need another retelling? Well yes we did! This version is moving, uplifting, heartbreaking and beautifully shot. The characters are more rounded and even though it's Jo's story, each of the sisters shine. Particular plaudits to Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, none of whom are American, for their impeccable accents and performances. However, the heart that beats the fullest is Jo, played by a wonderful Saoirse Ronan, who is caring, spirited and a joy to watch. Could she finally win a deserved Oscar? Thank you Greta. Louisa M Alcott would be proud."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,7/10,"Visually stunning, but I couldn't bond with the characters maybe due the mixed up timeline, or the lack of chemistry between the main pairs. Pitty."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"This movie made me feel lost. I thought I knew what I wanted to be and I still feel like I do but I don't know for certain. I love movies and watching them like no other and i've always wanted a career in movies but not as an actress, I just don't know as what. I feel so lost all the time but this movie has given me some hope that I don't have to confirm to what other want me to be and that it's okay to be lost cause you will find yourself. So thank you to all the little women.
But seriously go watch this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 February 2020,10/10,"I never read the novel but I think it should be better than the movie....I love this movie....really nice story.....this is what happen in real life most of the people in the world...the character is strong and good....how to face and love each other in the family, support each other, really nice to movie ...."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,9/10,"This version was Refreshing. Special praise for Saoirse Ronan's Jo March. Jo is a character that has been portraited by such great actors (Katherine Hepburn, Winona Ryder) but Saoirse became my favourite"
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,8/10,"It is too lucky to see so many people of celestial appearance gathered together. Although it is the happy ending, we can still feel that our hearts stopped bumping when the first love Showed up! When women no longer resist love to prove their independence, such a society is only fair..."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 August 2021,8/10,"Yes, it's another little women adaptation but I think it's one of the most beautiful. Believe me when I say that every single moment of this movie could be a perfect portrait of a good artist. The atmosphere, the locations, the characters and the screenplay are a masterpiece. But, it would have been even better if there weren't so many time jumps. The timeline isn't much easy to follow and there's a high risk to fall back and don't understand very easily the story.But still, one of my favourite movies."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,1/10,"We watched this new adaptation for about 20 minutes last night. I had only ever heard the title, never bothered to take a look. My wife, naturally, had seen the 1994 film. During those 20 minutes we both started to look dismayed, as if we'd been thrown out of a moving carriage. Or caught the wrong train, more likely. What is this supposed to be? Yes, there are all those fancy costumes and stuff, but it felt like there was no film, no story, just a bunch of non-scripted overacting, as if the actors had been dressed and then told to start acting, without telling them first, what film they were in. And so they end up all over the place, with no clue. Is this the ""gen. snowflakes"" take or what? Anyway, we watched the 1994 version instead and I was mesmerised: Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, wow! And, first of all, the story, the details, the way things are shown. Wow!
In all honesty, if this new abomination has the girls turn into superheroicals-sufferlings shortly after we stopped watching, I don't care. Thumbs down."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,6/10,"It felt to me like this movie was searching for itself the whole time. It was inconsistent and felt like I was watching 2-3 different movies at once, and I don't mean the flashbacks. The atomoshere swinged all the time, making me not care for any of the characters or the story. It had some good parts, but non of them combined well with the other good parts... Random shots thrown here and there just like that.
Also, few of the characters felt ABSOLUTELY out of time (say Amy), like 2019 teenagers dressed up in period clothing... it was unsettling to watch and further ruined this already messy movie.
Saoirse Ronan though was great and did the best she could with was she was given.
I'm giving this 6/10 because of good acting, but honestly it's no more than 4-5, almost as bad as a TV movie would be."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 January 2020,3/10,"I had high hopes for this film. Love Little Women and the Winona Rider 1994 version. This version was boring. The non-linear way in which it was told was confusing. As great as the cast was - and I love Timothy Chalamet - I just didn't feel invested in anyone. It did not move me at all in any way - not even when Beth died (sorry).
I am curious as to how this movie could possibly have gotten 10 stars."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2020,8/10,"I'll start by saying that I don't usually watch too many drama movies. I like them yes, but I prefer a good thriller or horror movies. So that's why I had to write this review because ""Little Women"" is such a simple and humble movie, but at the same time it's so very deep and well done. A story well told, with great actors. It's kinda hard to explain, but at the end of the movie I felt like I just watched a story that would stay with me for a long time. I have never read the book and this is the first movie adaptation I watch, and man... What a wonderful surprise!
If you like heartwarming movies with simple but good plot, you shouldn't miss this one. And after this I am definitely going to read the book!"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,5/10,"The youngest sister was brilliant.
However, it was back and forth in very subtle manners that made floating what was going on ... even for me, someone familiar with the story and author... didn't enjoy it. Really wanted to."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,2/10,How in the world did anyone think it was a good idea to take a film from 1994 and copy it scene for scene but also jumble up its timeline?! Why cast Emma Watson in anything?! It's impossible to understand this film if you have not read the book or seen the 1994 movie. I had read the book decades ago and naturally I did not remember anything. Had not watched the 1994 film (until now that I'm writing this review) and so I didn't even know how much of a copy this 2019 film was. Really not worth any awards. Some of the acting in this 2019 version is atrocious...
LITTLE WOMEN,24 November 2020,8/10,"This adaption, unlike others, starts near the end of the book and tells the familiar tale through flashbacks. It adds a richness to spend more time with the Little Women versus the girls growing up. Every character seemed well cast. Of all the versions, this sets up best if the studio decided to do one of the other books."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,6/10,"To begin with, I didn't get the modern way of behaving, which showed an utter lack of understanding of the time where Little Women was originally set. Also, this ""modern"" way of behaving actually ruined the portrayal of those women of advanced views.
Didn't need feminism, mainly because it was artificial.
But the most important thing that was missing from the film was the romance atmosphere a tale has, a tale for young girls full of dreams.
Never believed in the characters and as a result- I just watched the version from 1994"
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,9/10,"This is the one we should called the MOVIE, not those popcorn movies (although some of them I like), which only for entertainment."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,10/10,"Firstly, I know very little about Louisa May Alcott's novel and I haven't seen any previous adaptations either so I went in just for Greta Gerwig and Saoirse Ronan and boy it was amazingly beautiful. Expertly directed by Greta Gerwig with amazing performances from the entire cast, Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh standing out. Little Women is for anyone who loves a classic tale of Love, Tragedy and Life. The movie so full of love that after merely 20 minutes into it, the characters are no longer just characters, they become like our own sisters and we start wishing for their wellness. Walking out of the theatre never felt so good. This is one for the ages."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 April 2020,10/10,A movie that u want to see not like other action movis or drama movie its a pure story.... Like a hart of a little baby.
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,9/10,"The movie talks and reflets upon feminism and about the lack of liberty, that a society dominated by man, give to woman. Saoirse Ronan is incredible in the movie and I would'nt be surprised if she wins the oscar."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,6/10,"I love the story. I have watched the previous versions and have read the book.
This one, the trailer seemed very exciting and I thought there will be a lot of adventures.
But the movie was not that exciting.
It comes from a lot of mini-stories. And it makes you tired."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,10/10,"As a disclaimer this is the first film adaption of the book I have seen and I have also never read the book. That being said, I found this to be a beautiful and emotionally stirring film. It dealt with love, romantic and familial, and looked at the ebb and flow of both. It is about a young person discovering who they are in a world they have trouble understanding. One of the best things I can say about a movie is that it left me thinking and affected me on a personal level. This one did that.I also have to respond to some of the criticisms I see in these reviews. It's just strange to see people calling this movie boring. It's little women; what did you expect? If you don't like this type of movie then don't watch it. Don't expect it to be a thriller. As to the criticism that it is confusing: As someone who has never read any of the books, I had no trouble understanding the timeline. I think it was all very well done and there were sufficient context clues to keep it straight. And where it was not immediately clear, I believe it was intentional.In conclusion, it is beautiful."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 December 2019,2/10,"So much wasted talent here, simply to tell a superficial tale--about wanting money and good looks. The March family complains about being poor... but they live in a big house, wear beautiful clothes, and are surrounded by people with money who give them money and gifts. It gets two stars for being absolutely gorgeous visually, but it's so dead inside that I couldn't want to get out of the movie theater and away from this non-sensical world. There are no stakes. Also, Bob Odenkirk shows up halfway through to marvel at the fact that he's in a period movie, and it makes no sense, except to laugh at the absurdity. Louisa May Alcott would not be amused."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 November 2021,1/10,It could have been way better. The decor and actors are well chosen but disappointed on the overall story. Too much clichés. I still finished the whole movie.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 November 2020,2/10,The Earlier version is superior to this one in every way
LITTLE WOMEN,26 April 2021,8/10,"The story was very slow, no character was able to convince me, Anne With An E, it is a series that does a better job."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 October 2020,10/10,"While not perfect, this film achieves at telling a interesting story about little women from 2 separate years. The movie is upbeat and happy when it needs to, but sad and dark when needed. The dialogue, directing, editing and specialy core are INCREDIBLE. I highly recomend this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 November 2021,9/10,"The movie have a great energie , I love how they tell the story and how they connect between the past and the present using Links, and the cast it's perfect soairse ronan and timothy challamet had good chimistry and iam sure they are the future of the acting, meryl streep like always stunning and all the cast even the supporting role they was great.But I don't like how they not tell all the stories of the girls they focus on two mostly .But the movie end and you feel soo happy ,great experience, a great movie about love and dreams and Passion."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 July 2020,10/10,"A movie about four sisters navigating early womanhood in 19th century America might seem irrelevant to present day audience, but this adaptation managed to fully capture my attention and left me wanting to re-watch it after I finished it, and this is coming from a non-American male millennial. This is a testament to how brilliant the cast of this movie were, and how Greta managed to create something rare. Saoirse Ronan was born for Jo's role, and Florence did great as Amy, the evolution of the relation between Jo and Amy, and Jo's internal and societal struggles felt so real.
Highly enjoyable movie for all audience."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,10/10,"After the film ended alm I could think was .... what just happened! This was one of the most beautifully filmed, well acted and directed, seamless, emotional films of the year or of many years. A fresh and deeply sincere take on a timeless and timely classic. E were stunned, moved, and deeply touched. Magnificent all around. Kudos to all for this new classic. ."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,,Such a pleasure to watch a wonderful feel good film. Granted I got confused by the end with the jumping back and forth but most the time you knew what was going on by the mood of everyone. Absolutely brilliant
LITTLE WOMEN,11 February 2020,9/10,"I am not fan of Greta's last work Ladybird . To me it was very a regular coming of age movie and i didn't concur with extremely rave reviews it received.
But her latest work is extremely good and almost perfect.
Watching this movie it is so obvious that it was a product of brilliant writing. She has reproduced the 19th century environment so masterfully without making it dull.
The story switches back & forth between present and past smoothly .Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh have done justice to their roles and rightly deserve their nominations.
Pugh is specially good in transitioning from a silly ,naughty teenager to a mature adult scene after scene .
All in all its a heartwarming happy movie with charming story at its heart and a definite re watch"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 May 2020,6/10,"I was disappointed with this version and i have seen them all. A lot of shouting girls talking over each other all the time. The back and forth between the different periods makes it even more all over the place. I gave it a 6 for the scenes, costumes and music but we are far from the version with Susan Sarandon and Wynona Rider."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 June 2020,2/10,"I've read the book. I've cherished the 1994 film since I was 14. This was... an abomination.The pacing was seriously awful. It flies past any sort of story building in the chaos of jumping forward and backward in time. It definitely assumes you know the story already, and zips through hoping you won't notice how terrible it is. It's like the movie was in a hurry to get away from itself.The personalities of the characters are weak, vapid, and annoying. The relationships between the characters, thin and hollow; zero chemistry between the lot of them. The acting seriously overdone with the exception of Meryl Streep (she alone was good... and I love Laura Dern, but her Marmie sucked). Amy was overwhelmingly annoying. Beth was unlikeable. Meg selfish and bland. Jo was pretty okish (except right after the beginning when she meets Laurie at the party, she over-did it a bit in that scene). Marmie was lacking in warmth or any feeling at all really. Laurie was busy trying to channel Christian Bale and doing an okish job of it, Frederich wasn't believable. John, and everyone else, utterly forgettable. *sigh* so disappointed.Skip this one, y'all."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 November 2021,4/10,"When actors in their twenties are playing 12 to sixteen year olds, all credibility is lost. Very slow, almost nothing seemed to happen for nearly an hour. The characters are unlikeable and the mother has no depth. All in all, unbelievable and uninteresting."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 August 2021,6/10,A nice adaptation of the book but way too confusing jumping back and forth the timeline with hardly any differential between them.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 February 2020,9/10,"Just a beautiful, simple, tender portrait of love, in all of its kinds."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 March 2020,4/10,The focus was so on feminism that they forgot the other stories. The book is told from the respective of Jo not Amy. Just my opinion.
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,2/10,I have walked out of fewer than a handful of movies in my entire life. I walked out of one today. Little Women. It's about as engaging is a bottle of Maalox. While it may quiet the stomach it leaves the lips all chalky white.
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,7/10,"Timothée Chalamet was made to play the role of Laurie. He couldn't be more perfect even if he tried to.
Quite disappointed in Emma Watson though. But overall a great ensemble that works really well under Greta Erwig's lens."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 March 2020,4/10,"If you're going to bother with yet another unnecessary remake of Little Women, the LEAST you could do is get the casting to reflect the actual characters. Jo was CHESTNUT-haired, not blonde. Amy was golden blonde, not sandy brown-haired. And WHY is nearly EVERY director so afraid to cast Professor Bauer as the appropriate age? Afraid nobody will buy their love story? The character was NOT YOUNG. He was least 25 years older than Jo."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,6/10,"Let me start saying that I've seen pretty much every single adaptation of Little Women (both movies and tclv shows) and I'm not one of the many that prefer the 1994 version above them all (despide I believe it's a masterpiece).
I went to see this movie because I wanted to see what ""new things"" this version would have brought also hoping in more feminist signature (which it did have partially) however it didn't score quite right..Let's start with the obvious: casting and characters.
This movie shows how a cast packed with massive talented actors/actresses doesn't guarantee success. Individually they are awesome but together don't really manage to create the atmosphere and transport this movie must to have!
Ronan is incredible in her own way but her accent disrupt the magic you are supposed to feel. She was a pure talent however doesn't score a 10/10 in a movie where she must fit. This is not A movie. This is THE movie where she has to become someone else in every single detail.Same goes for Emma. But worse. She struggles to deliver any pathos and performance that Meg deserves. Megs is not that woman. She doesn't look like a post civil war medium/high class first child woman. She doesn't act like it.. She doesn't struggle between been like other girls but with no resources. She is just.. there.Beth character was poorly written so I can't comment for the cast. Except for the age looking which -like for ALL characters is just wrong.Amy was the best gaining in this movie. She is the only character that provides more than any other movie and with a kick that deserves to be mentioned. She is the Amy of the book (but miss a bit the frivolity we all learnt to hate/love).Mrs March showed no love or attachment for her girls. Really doesn't feel like she would die for her girls. There is no Matriarchal leading effect. She is supposed to be the northern star for these girls who struggle to grow in a changing but limited society, however she is as useless as their father (which appears for 2 seconds and that's all).Teddy.. oh boy.. teddy..
What a shame. Timothy is a great performer. But he is not teddy. He is supposed to be strong, stubborn more than Jo. Here he looks more like her younger cousin confused with his gender. He doesn't look like he wants Jo. Looks like he wants to be one of the Little Women!The script based on flashbacks here is the biggest mistake. The novel and all movies play on one key winning piece: you grow with them, you learn to know them, you love them and suffer with them because the story is chronological! Please don't show me how they look in the future if I haven't seen them growing. This takes away the attachment. Doesn't make you crying like a baby when Beth dies. Doesn't make you understand why they do what they do. Doesn't even make you understand what's going on! (Wait is this when Beth Nearly dies or when she dies for real?.. no really.. wait.. let me look at Jo's hair so I can figure this out.. and bang you detached yourself from the emotional element of the moment)
Even without the back and forth I doubt I would have cried for Beth cause she was not existing. Is true Beth is the sister that wants to stay home, the introvert one but please give her the storyline she has!! Give her the role in the family she has. Show me how she gets Scarlett fever and why. Show me how she fades away breaking Jo's heart.
The additional scene by the beach was a pleasant addition. I loved the emotional impact of the moment when the two sister hold each other while the wind blows and Jo tells Beth ""I won't let it happen"".Final biggest disappointment was the lack of post civil war atmosphere and culture. These girls were too modern. Act out of time and disconnected by what in the real world happens (didn't help the fact that Jo's life in New York was barely shown).
There is no high society in decadence with rising concerns like slavery and appearance vs virtue.
Dresses were alright but dialogue and manners were out of place.Loved the more space given to the struggle of being a woman in a changing but difficult time. Loved Amy bringing this up as well (not just Jo).
Loved the funny back and forth with the editor and the creative process of Jo coming up with the book.Overall this remains a decent movie if book and previous adaptation (of which this one copies many exact sentences) are taken out. With it, well.. it's just mediocre. I scored it 6 because some great performances and because the story is what it is and some additions were very good.
However this is not a movie that will remembered as THE Little Women"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,5/10,"This one was different, which was nice, as long as you have a working knowledge of the plot. It starts at the end, and tells the story in a series of flashbacks. Even as someone who has read the book and seen three previous versions, I still had trouble figuring out where we were in the timeline. My friend had neither read the book, nor seen any of the movies - so it was very confusing for her.Also, it's hard to beat Claire Danes and Winona Ryder and Kirsten Dunst for emotional scenes.So - if you're looking for something different - this is it."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 January 2020,9/10,"Thourouly enjoyed this film, in spite of the fact that we were sat on the front row at the cinema and consequently had sore eyes, necks and backs.
All of the acting was superb and I love how the story was told with flashbacks to different times.
I can't wait to watch this again from the comfort of my sofa when it is released."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,7/10,"As someone who knows the story well and treasures the book, I have both positive and negative things to say about the film.The acting for all characters is amazing. One of the best-acted films I've ever seen.The myriad of feminist speeches about women having no place in the world are overkill. Those speeches are nowhere to be found in the book. Though a common theme of independence is woven throughout the novel, it is independence from being poor and talentless, not independence from men.Timothy Chalamet is an amazing portrayal of Laurie. I loved his charisma, brooding, and humor. He is perfect.Marmee's speech about being ashamed of her country is so, so contrary to the pride in and sacrifice for America that is portrayed in the novel. Marmee's speech actually goes, ""I gave my best to the country I love."" Nothing about race or shame.I loved the energy and sisterly bantering and playfulness. It is a great translation of the sisters' relationship, from loving to hating each other and all the in-between moments.It was odd to watch a 24-year-old woman play a 12-year-old Amy. I know she's been nominated and I do think she added so much to the character. But it felt weird to see a mature woman (with such a deep voice) acting so juvenile.The portrayal of Beth is twisted. She came across as mentally stunted instead of just shy. She also played the piano like an expert concert-pianist, which I thought was somewhat unrealistic for a 13-year-old who is never even said to have had lessons.The scenery, costume design, and music are beautiful. It's a truly stunning film for all the senses.My overall review: a magnificent film that is tainted by Hollywood liberalism. I'll stick to the 1994 version as the most true-to-story depiction without any added politics."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,9/10,What a great movie. Classic tale which is still compelling. The cast were wonderful.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 August 2020,3/10,"Watching this film, it was hard not to compare it to the 1994 version. There were so many similarities that it made me wonder, what was the point of this remake? There are so many period novels that have yet to grace the silver screen. This version, though, full of talented actors, felt forced and yet lacking at the same time. It did not possess the beautiful soundtrack that James Horner provided within its predecessor -- this version's soundtrack was entirely forgettable. The odd dancing scene between Ronan and Chalamet seemed more like two actors playing than two characters acting appropriately. And Beth's death scene was completely lost (did they move her body from the room while Jo slept? How odd). To this day, I can't hold back the tears as Claire Danes takes her last breath, as Beth. The younger generation needs to realize that films existed before they were born and discover the amazing talents within these movies and Hollywood needs to stop remaking films and create new."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,10/10,"Beyond excellent photography, efficient editing and directing, this movie captures the rich depth of characters the original book brings to life.
Not only will I effusively recommend to family, I intend to watch repeatedly myself."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 August 2020,2/10,"I've watched the 94 version since I was little, it's a classic for me and one of my favorite films. So when I saw the trailer to this I was curious to see how it compares to the version I grew up with.It felt rushed, unnatural and like it was trying too hard to be like the one from 94. I felt they completely miscast the characters, Florence Pugh was way too old to play Amy as a young girl. Emma Watson was overacting through most of it, her actions felt forced and not very natural.It was nearly impossible to figure out when the flashbacks were happening since it seemed like the fashion style hadn't changed much in the span of 8+ years. Meg was a very proper girl and the oldest of the four, yet her hair was always down or in braids, which seemed too youthful for her character.
During the scene where Jo and Laurie are watching Meg dance, waltz music plays, yet the dancing was not at all a waltz!All of the best scenes that were dramatic and really make the story special were completely rushed. I didn't even notice the part where Friedrich Bhaer says ""I have nothing to give you; my hands are empty."" and Jo takes his hands and says ""Not anymore."" It happened in less than a minute under the umbrella.I found myself laughing during the serious parts because of the absurdity of this movie. I truly wanted to like it. My advice would be to stick to the 94 version. It is untouchable."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,3/10,"Certain devices work well in books, but not movies and visa versa. In trying to be 100% faithful to the books we get flashbacks with characters we don't know and therefore don't care about... Ugh. I walked out after an hour of not caring - Save your time & money"
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,10/10,Outstanding performances by all the actors and wonderful storytelling. A must see!
LITTLE WOMEN,20 July 2020,9/10,"I really love this movie , I found it so real and modern and I've been so attached to it , it have an amazing cast with the best performance especially Saoirse Ronan as Jo , Florence pugh as Amy , it has very beautiful cinemathoghaphy... and all that will not happened without the director Greta Gerwig"
LITTLE WOMEN,20 April 2020,9/10,"As Louisa May Alcott wrote ""I've had lots of troubles so I write Jolly tales"". Little Women is a jolly tale and a jolly good one. It is a sweet and satisfying tale of 4 young women or the 'little women' as their father calls them. Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth all display desirable qualities and yet are unconventional and unique. No character is unidimensional, neither can we label Jo just as the free spirited young writer nor Amy as the tomboyish vengeful girl - because later you realize that Jo is sensitive and can expose her vulnerabilities while Amy can be considerate and ambitious at the same time. And the dimensions of emotions in this adaptation has been flawlessly played by its stellar cast - Emma Watson, Timothee Chalamet, Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan and it doesn't end here. The costumes and the mannerisms of the late nineteenth century are a delight to watch.Despite being an adaptation of such an old novel, the little women with their great ambitions, determination, struggles and dilemmas are both surreal and relatable"
LITTLE WOMEN,25 May 2020,,I adore the '94 version and keep it within reach; I couldn't even watch enough of this one to be satisfied with my opinion. Every time a movie review system gets popular it goes in the crapper.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,6/10,"Problem 1: The cast is bad. Ronan is ok, at least she has some facial similariries with Alcott. Scanlan, very good in Sharp Objects, Pugh and Watson are barely in the movie, nonfactors, although Scanlan has one moment as she thanks Laurence for the piano. Laura Dern is totally lost.
Best performance by Streep and Cooper.. Problem 2: No synergy between the sisters. I felt they all played their part for themselfs and not together. Well, Lara Dern... I laught hard when she first appeared and asked: What is she doing in this movie? Total failure.. Problem 3. Editing was too forced most of the time. Worked sometimes tough, i. e. when Beth died.The progressive aspects of the movie are not very well done. Felt forced in at the one and too 21th century cliche at the other hand. But i can live with it, although i felt that Ronan with her girlie bowler acted more like a cunning bootblack.
. Her end was noteable. I was ok with it. It fits the smart liveliness of the character, Alcott must have had.
Its sad that there are no discussions about aesthetic criteria like in the 94 adaptation, so that Friedrichs character is totally neglected, so that a huge part of Jo's character development is missing.To sum it up: 94 version is way better in all aspects."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 September 2020,9/10,"Little Women is one of a heart-warming movie with some memorable characters, I was really in love with Jo as I thought her character resembles me, lol. Also, I found many things to enjoy about this film; the quotable dialogues, cute outfits, charming sisterhood, the classic vintage vibes that will leave us a nice and pleasant feeling. Absolutely worth to watch"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 April 2021,10/10,"Greta le dio una visión nueva, sin duda alguna es la mejor versión de Mujercitas.En una sola película podemos ver a TREMENDOS ACTORES, como Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Timothee Chalamet,Meryl Streep., entre otros.Por primera vez, puedo decir que una película estuvo a la altura del libro."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 March 2021,2/10,Director wanted to be creative with his back and forths. Terrible failure which makes the movie not worth watching!
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,8/10,"Thoroughly enjoyable and heartfelt film. The film broadcasts an amazing set of actors including Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson and of course, many more. The acting is impeccable and the costume and setting also.
My single issue with this film is that it is continuously having flashbacks and it constantly hard to tell if I am watching a flashback or what is happening now in the present time.
Nevertheless I enjoyed it immensely especially the postmodern scene towards the end of the film.
In conclusion, I recommend you watch this film, I hope this review has helped you."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 May 2020,,Its just. Well if you want to sleep is amazing. Crap really
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,5/10,"It was ok, I've seen other versions but a friend I went with struggled to follow a little, due to unclear flashbacks, while I liked the cast, the ages were wrong and it all felt a little forced. One for watching at home not the cinema"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,9/10,"Many will rightly speak of the exceptional acting on display. Each of the 6 leading ladies, from Streep the matriarch, Dern the mother, and the four siblings are played with great artistry. Pugh is excellent, barely recognisable from her BBC dramas, but it's Ronan's performance that dominates and drives this movie.However, the lady that most impresses is Gerwig. This is a truly masterful piece of movie making. Every scene is framed, coloured, and scored with the eyes, ears and hand of someone who should be thrice her age, such is the perfection.The dialogue is exceptional, but the visual artistry is so strong that if the actors were to not speak their lines - though retaining the quite beautiful score - and an intertitle were captioned every few minutes the storytelling would remain as powerfulAnd that is what I felt watching it: this is Chaplin at his finest nearly 100 years after that genius's classic silent movies. (Liberal quantities of Capra and Preston Sturgess feelgood sprinkled on top.)If you love cinema you must see this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 November 2020,4/10,"If you like a historical movie with nice costumes and a lot of cheerful people in it, good acting, witty dialogues and a lot of hugging, then this is your movie. When you like a good story, you'll be bored very soon. At least I was."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 November 2020,5/10,"Its a pity the character of Amy.
She is really a little girl. The Actrice is too old to play Amy. Amy is 12 in the beginning of the book. You can't get a 23 year old actrice to play 12.
Why the flashbacks. Its difficult to follow.
It is not the best version of the story."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 December 2020,8/10,"Let me start by saying that the character of Jo March had a immense impact on my life as a young girl. I wanted to be Jo, she epitomised everything I wanted to be. As a 11 year old I wasn't really aware of what feminism was but loved Jo for her ideals and independence. I have seen every adaptation of this story and enjoyed most of them. This is in my opinion the best one yet. The core message of the story is clearer and sharper than in other versions, the light, the storytelling, the photography, the music... all perfect. The casting is also almost perfect, and here comes my one and only criticism of the movie. I just could not believe in Timothee Chalamet as Laurie. He looked like a young teenager skipping around the scenery. I know he is a good actor and I know that he has worked with Gerwig before (very effectively) but he was, in my opinion, totally unbelievable in the role"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,8/10,"It is buzzing of life, love and energy. It is incredibly well-shot. The story isn't linear, but the director uses plenty of clues to show the audience in what time we are, like the lighting to convey mood. The actors are amazing, full of force and true emotion. Especially Joe and Teddy have a great chemistry.It is worth a watch, but you have to enjoy the genre. It gets a bit soppy at the end, the exposition feels a bit forced, the feminist message can feel bit shoe-horned.
Although I like the point the main-protagonist made, that chasing her norm-defying dreams meant she was forced to be lonely. It comes right after her speech of women's ability, and the depressing conclusion was not seen in the trailer. She did solve that issue in a way that happened to work out perfectly.An absolutely gorgeous movie worth a watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 March 2020,1/10,"Such a boring film!!!!It's been done much better in the past and you can't help but wonder, if Greta Gerwig would be getting praise in any other time, than today.It's a stretch to call her a director (directress???), but then it was a stretch to call her an actress, as well.Shame for the cast, who did their best under the circumstances...Only pink haired feminists with more than two cats, need pay the price of admission..."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 April 2020,6/10,"I appreciate their aim to have originality and put a new spin on the story by starting with the end first. The biggest thing I didn't like was that of the story was 7 years prior, there should have been two different actresses portraying Amy. One age 13 and the other one who is 20. It just didn't work. The actress who played Amy was obviously too old. She even seems older than the actress playing Jo. That was my biggest irritation and I couldn't get past it throughout the whole movie.The other thing is the dialogue felt hurried more of the time. The lines felt said and not lived. It fell flat.The truth is I don't know how anything could do justice to the story as close as the Winona Ryder one. It was perfection."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,,"Love, family, closeness and sacrifice. Looking in each other's eyes. Conversations unflowering time. Anger spoken and unspoken. Feel what you live watching this film. Feel also what you have lost. We have lost. Santa Barbara premiere. A theatre where older souls frequent. As the credits began to roll after the film, elderly people were gone and lit up the aisles with their cell phones. Listen to the Cat Stevens song, ""Dying to Live."" Merry Christmas to all in gratitude for the true closeness and love which is present in our lives. and the rest checking their (imprisonment) cell phones. God Save the Queen.I miss you Claire Foy."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 January 2020,3/10,"The good points: Beautiful cinematography, august costume design, great background score and quite an extraordinary cast.
Now let's begin with the real nuisance. The movie is utter rubbish. The screenplay is nominated for an Oscar and I have got no idea how on earth it is even possible. It is too confusing and abrupt to be even considered.
There is no character development. Having such a stunning ensemble could have saved it out of its misery, but they couldn't.
The direction is kiddish. Without any director it could have been made the same way. After a movie like Lady Bird, this is her career-worst performance.
I have no idea how this movie is nominated for the best picture at the Oscars. Snubbing The Farewell, Hotel Mumbai, Pain and Glory, Just Mercy, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Uncut Gems, The Report, Queen and Slim, etc. and nominating this is such an unjust and biased judgement.
The cast is the only thing that somehow saved it from the total ruin."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,6/10,"The spirit and heart are not as strong. The flashbacks are a bit confusing. However, I am biased. I watched my VHS copy of the '94 version over and over in middle school and as an adult. The only role better in this version is that of Mr. Lawrence, Teddy's grandfather. Of course, Merle Streep should rival the actress in the role of Aunt March in the '94 version, but, alas, she doesn't. In short, if the 1994 version has a place in your heart then keep it there and skip this one. If you haven't seen it, watch the new one first."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2021,4/10,"This did not capture nor hold my attention, I was so disappointed in the cast, acting and disjointed story. I think the cast was the worst, they did not suit nor bring life to the characters."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,4/10,"I am truly baffled by the OTT praise for this film. At times I found it almost unwatchable. There are excellent actors present (apart from the irritating Chalomet) but the entire first act is too twee frothy. It does improve somewhat later in the film, hence the middling star rating, but the editing is jarring and the time sequencing is not helpful. The earlier film versions of Alcott's story are vastly superior. Average film"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"Greta Gerwig managed to take a book that has been adapted multiple times and given us something that comes across as completely original! The performances of the 4 main actresses come across as authentic sisterhood. While Watson & Ronan are exceptional (as well as the best known of the young actresses), it's Pugh and Scanlen that steal the show! The cinematography coupled with Desplat's score is breathtaking and should easily pick up multiple award nominations. While I am certain that it will go head to head with movies like The Irishman, this is the one that will stand the test of time. In my humble opinion, this movie is perfect and I can't wait to see it again."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 October 2021,10/10,"I mainly watched it because of Florence Pugh, I don't really watch these type of movies but this was very well put together movie. A lot of emotions from start to finish and a lot of details which I really liked. Overall just a fantastic job and amazing cast."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2020,1/10,"It seems but those stories of adversity and overcoming and that comes with the lesson of believing in yourself, will win everything.
It is not something more profound like Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky that comes to reflect on human fruition and desires with an analysis of the human condition.
It seems that feminists love to channel their frustrations and dreams into stories of suffering that end with overcoming as an escape valve."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,7/10,"Better than the book, which I recently read for the first time. Glad the movie fixed the ending."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,10/10,"This is a beautiful portrayal of the Little Women story. The costumes and acting are amazing! Because the plot constantly jumps back and forth between present time and past time in the girls' lives, it did get confusing for my friends who had not seen the original movie first. I recommend watching the first movie to get n understanding of the plot before watching this new 2019 version! But please don't fail to watch the 2019 version because it is made so well!"
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,1/10,"A sentimental film, very naive with a history of overcoming and trying to prove that it is independent in a need to assert itself."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,7/10,"That is about all there is to say about this. Nothing happens. They cut across times never telling you when confusing the audience. But it is so pretty to look at, even if they're all so unlikeable in this performance of it, it's still a good time. I would never watch this again though but for the only female movie in the box office you have to give it a bonus."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,8/10,"What a beautiful take on the book!
A great escape into a different world altogether.
The acting is phenomenal. It's funny, amusing, but full of emotion. A must-watch for all those who have read the book or want a little bit of a Pride and Prejudice kind of movie. But it is quite fun. It might be pretty long in duration but overall a wholesome watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,9/10,"I am not really into the drama genre but I am happy I choose to watch this one. Even if you don't normally watch these kind of movies, I am sure most of you will like this one.
It was really nice to see the dynamic between the four sisters. It is a warm movie, that makes you feel with the characters. You really start to like the family in the story, and the actors who play in it.It is a story about succes, failure, love, tragic. In short, everything everyday life has to offer. That is what makes it so successful in my eyes. You can relate quite a bit.The actors did a great job as well.
Worth the watch!"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 February 2020,3/10,"It's not bad, actually, but do we really still need movies like this? Since it based on the XIX century book, I really believe there's nothing fascinating or new in the movie now. Of course, it has beautiful costumes and great actors - but that's it. In general, it is very boring and meaningless"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 May 2020,9/10,"I decided to watch this film whilst expecting nothing good to come out of it. Oh how I was wrong.
After watching Gerwigs debut film 'Ladybird' and coming out delighted I thought I'd give her second film a shot.
It's was marvelous.
I fell in love with each character. Cried in every scene , and adored the cut scenes at the end which honoured Alcott's true story.
The best way to describe the film was warm.
The only real problem I had with it was a few problems with costume and hair which werent correct to the era but that's about it.Overall highly recommend. And to all the negative reviews here, go get a heart."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 April 2020,5/10,"The constant switching back and forth from present to past was confusing. The heavy makeup and lipstick on the March girls when they were younger was ridiculous! Amy was totally miscast as was Professor Baer who was supposed to have been much older than Jo. Meg hurting and humiliating her husband by complaining she was tired of being poor was hard to watch., because it's nothing like the book. If you want to watch an excellent adaptation of the book, watch the movie with Wynona Ryder and Claire Danes! Don't bother with this one."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 May 2020,6/10,"It accurately captures the essence of the novel. It dares to be independent without being cynical. It perfectly blends realistic thinking into the joy of everyone. It has the characteristics of the times and is full of universal feelings. Successfully circumvented the conservative defects and self-righteousness that are common in the adapted works. The group play performance is excellent, and Winona Ryder does not allow to support the center of the film, while the rest of the actors also perfectly display the character's characteristics.
Delicate and complete, it dilutes the major drama conflicts, and follows the director's life in the narrative like a running account. The perfect group drama. In less than 2 hours, the protagonist supporting characters seven or eight all showed their own personality characteristics. If you want to be picky, it may be that each character is not full enough, you can simply label it."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 September 2020,8/10,"Marriage isn't a neccessity of life,l couldn't agree more with Jo March,she is a wise girl and Ronan's performance touched me a lot.She is a excellent and talented actress."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,8/10,Why do they insist on having the women's hair down??? This would NEVER HAVE HAPPENED at this period in time. No women or girls would not have their hair in a braid or in a bun.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 July 2021,10/10,Saoirse Ronan deserved an oscar for this movie! Her character was amazing.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2021,1/10,"So much worse than the 1994 version.The cast looks nothing like the description in the book.Jo does not act boyish enough as she is supposed to, and she does not look boyish either.Amy, who is the youngest sister, looks older than everyone else, including Teddy. They have 24-years-old access playing 12-year-old kid! Her voice is deeper than her oldest sister Meg.Teddy is supposed to be Joe's age, but he looks like teenager when already married.The only person who looks and acts appropriate for their role is probably Beth.The storyline is a complete mess, keeps jumping back and forward between the first and second part of the book, and thus makes everything very confusing even for someone who was read the book, especially because the characters do not age, apparently, or change in any way.There are a lot of made up moments and dialogues throughout the movie, that do not appear in the book.The whole first part of the book - the actual 'Little women' part it's rushed through, and most of the important dialogues are cut off."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,8/10,"*Little Women*
With such a strong cast of Meryl Streep, Emma Watson, Saoirse, Laura Dern, Bob Odenkirk, and Timothee, there was obviously no way this film would fail in acting skills. I have watched Saoirse grow as an actress since her first film and her performance truly goes beyond expectation. The storyline is exactly what the book by Louisa tells. Harnessing acting skills to build a strong screenplay, and excellent editing skills that makes going back and forth in the story a cakewalk, this period drama keeps you stuck to your seat. I do believe the casting of Beth in the film could have been different because Eliza has a subtle villainous look that was rightly shown in the series Sharp Objects, however felt misplaced in this film. Overall, this story of poor grown up girls with their own yet intermingling stories along an engaging background score does get a few tears while watching.My rating 7.8 🌟"
LITTLE WOMEN,17 May 2020,2/10,"Come on, 7.9/10? Really? Confused and chaotic version of the novel. Probably nectar for the feminist, right-on, leftist, holier-than-men lobby but a poor movie. We were really looking forward to seeing it but ten minutes in and each of us wondering if we would be the one to say something first. Rubbish!"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,10/10,"Simply put, an Amy March that you can understand and don't despise! Florence Pugh is a great actress and played this character well. From young teenage years to adulthood, you actually get an Amy that you somewhat even like: believe me, that's saying a lot for us fans!Overall, this film had wonderful acting from ALL of the cast that includes amazing actresses like Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep, Eliza Stanlen and Laura Dern; wonderful directing and cinematography that made the scenes intimate, emotional, and clearly showed that the main bonds and characters were the four sisters (and their mother).They showed how all of them had a strong relationship with Laurie and showed how Amy liked him from day one (see above).I really enjoyed it and was enthralled the entire film. I highly recommend it."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 September 2020,4/10,I feel sorry for anyone who has not read the book or seen previous adaptations and sees this first. Just awful.
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,7/10,"I won't go over the plot as if you've read the book or seen any of the other 100 versions out there, you know what happens. The acting was great, particularly Florence Pugh, who has given us maybe the only version of Amy that is likeable. The things I didn't enjoy about this film were the extreme time jumps back and forth, which became confusing at certain points, and Timothee Chalomet. He's a good actor, but he has the face of a 12 year old, and that became incredibly distracting when he was trying to romance actresses that look about 15 years older than him."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,9/10,"LITTLE WOMEN
Directed by Greta Gerwig
Adapted by Greta Gerwig, based on Little Women by Louisa May Alcott
Photographed by Yorick Le SauxLittle Women is an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's titular novel. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, and Timothée Chalamet. It observes the domestic and personal struggles of four young women living in genteel poverty in New England during the American Civil War, as each girl attempts to live life on her own terms.This movie captured my heart and is one of the warmest and most earnest films of 2019. Each one of the March sisters is so well developed that I felt I knew each one, especially that of Jo (Ronan) and Amy (Pugh). Supporting characters are given the perfect amount of observation to allow us to understand their depth as well.Several scenes moved me to tears, some out of sadness and others out of love. The sincerity that Ronan and Pugh bring to their characters brings me feelings that I find are difficult to capture in written words. They are simply sublime, and probably my favorite characters in film from 2019. Jo's heartbreaking monologue in the attic is some of the best acting of the year, and proves Ronan is the up-and-coming actor to be reckoned with, followed closely by Pugh.I have neither read nor seen the novel or other film adaptations, so I cannot comment as so far as to how the structuring of those compare with this film. I will admit that it took me about thirty minutes to realize the time hopping narrative structure of Gerwig's film. Once I caught on, this back and forth ended up working surprisingly well, with mostly clear delineations between past and present, although at times this could have been clearer.All praise to the makeup artists and costume designers, however. The costumes in this movie are ravishing, and the makeup artists have done a splendid job of making the distinction in these actresses between the past and present. Amazing work. The nuance with which each of the lead actresses differentiates between the younger and older March sisters is impressively convincing.The cinematography is simple and beautiful, and perfectly serves the narrative. It is not showy or bombastic, but captures every scene excellently and with purpose.Greta Gerwig as director proves once again that she is a cinematic force to be reckoned with. She brings true humanity to each of her characters and is an expert in telling narratives of serious empathy, creating fresh and unique coming-of-age stories that are true pieces of art in their own right."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 January 2020,1/10,"So disappointed!!!
Why I had to see this movie?
The old one was epic!
When you do a remake you have at least try for something better and be sure of it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 February 2020,7/10,"Sometimes fine, and often very pretty. But ...
Sometimes the camera needs to look for and find the speaker. Dialogue floats around on its own. Big lines don't get the pauses or closeups they are asking for. Obvious shots are missing, like a last shot of Laurie back at Amy to indicate he is becoming aware that she loves him (as he is driven away). Meg, Marmee, and Laurie could be cast better. Marmee just looks concerned all the time. There's not enough of Laurie for two women to be in love with or to love two women.
And why not just tell the story in sequence, or with a simple long flashback after Friedrich gives Jo the bad news about what she has been writing? The jumps don't serve any inevitable purpose.
I do like how Chris Cooper has managed not only to stand like an old man but to stand like a person from the 19th century. But I like any movie with Chris Cooper.
On the other hand, any movie with Meryl Streep starts ten paces back from the starting line for me. I was tired of her after the first movie I saw her in, what with all the fidgeting and reactions to nothing in particular (except in Out of Africa, but there she got a major assist from Africa), and now she looks tired as well."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 September 2020,4/10,"Story was jumbled together and didn't set up the characters at all. The way this story was told was incoherent and it was hard to engage in any of the characters. The story shifts back and forth too fast for you to actually get to soak anything in.
The music was too cute and hoppy but added nothing too make you feel endeared to this family.
Overacted and I'll suited cast."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,3/10,Honestly it wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as the one with Winona Ryder. I didn't feel really connected to these versions of the characters and I didn't cry once through movie. It wasn't a terrible film but if you've seen the other version I'm sorry but Claire Danes Susan Sarandon Christian bail Kirsten dunst and Winona ? I mean come on all I could do was compare to that film and it didn't make me empathize with the characters like the previous one. Ugh It's getting really tiresome that all we have left in this world is to remake old movies remake old songs ...... check please I want off this ride
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,6/10,"I could have loved this version but the editing is awful. I guess it's the editing. SPOILER ALERT: The movie starts with Jo in the boarding house with Prof. Baer. You can immediately tell there is a potential for a relationship there so that when they flashback to Laurie you already can guess that's not going to work. I mean I've seen all the versions and read the book ten times and even I was confused with the back and forth. I took my 9 and 10 year old granddaughters and they had to constantly ask ""is this the present or past."" What's wrong with just following the book and filming in the right time sequence of events? And it especially didn't work because the actors were the same whether they were 14 or 20 so that didn't give you a hint. Just a disappointing version."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 February 2020,10/10,"This is the best adaptation of Little Women ever. The acting is top notch all around. Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timothee Chalamet in particular made their characters make sense like no others have before. Same for Eliza Scanlen. I don't think the story benefited from cutting up the timeline and showing it in flashbacks, but it didn't suffer much for it either."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 March 2020,10/10,"I am a person who reads a lot of books but never ever thought about touching 'Little Women' thinking that it'd be dull and boring. The cast was the only reason I thought about watching this movie. But, oh boy! Was I wrong! The pace of the movie was so quick and the flow was so stream-lined that there was not a moment where I was bored. The directing is pure genius especially with the light works. The warmth symbolized the different time periods so well and the transitions were just flawless. Outstanding movie I've seen in a while. And we all know how well this cast can do!!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,9/10,"Not my kind of movie, went with my wife. I've never had a movie move me so much. Several times I got teary-eyed. Gerwig did an excellent job keeping the movie pretty fast-paced for an adaptation of Little Women and the decisions she made were excellent. All of the performances were satisfactory or better. Laughter was frequent as well.I really cannot imagine a better adaptation of Little Women."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 March 2020,10/10,"What an awesome portrayal! It felt a bit hard to catch up with the scenes, but as the time evolved the simple story of a family came out to be an amazing one. Loved it! Saoirse Ronan, the best!"
LITTLE WOMEN,11 August 2020,10/10,"I love the version with Winona Ryder and I never thought I would appreciate a newer version as much , but I do!! Thoroughly enjoyable. Wonderful acting and I like what they did with itLittle Women was written 150 years ago and it's just as relevant today. It has stood the test of time and has warmed the hearts of and inspired many"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,The whole cast did a phenomenal job. The directing and cinematography was amazing. I'm absolutely in love with this version. Thanks Greta 🙏
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,9/10,"After watching the first fifteen minutes I thought, hmm am I gonna like this? By the end I was so invested in everything that was happening. It was brilliantly directed, great actors and lovely scenery. Overall would recommend 100%"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,3/10,"With all of the hype, I was looking forward to (and even expecting) an interesting, lively and entertaining show. Instead, it was quite....tedious....uneven....over-rated....sad to say (or see)."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,3/10,"Given all of the pre-release hype, I was very much looking forward to this remake version. Sadly, the big-screen result is tedious....uneven....overrated....and overall disappointing."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,6/10,"If you don't know the book, following this story is probably really tough. It starts in the middle of the book then jumps around with flashbacks in almost dizzying order, to the point where you don't know if Beth's scarlet fever recovery is real or not. And sorry - as someone who has read the book over 30 times, spent 50 years in book publishing, and is a huge advocate for women's empowerment, the end was complete nonsense. Gerwig's overlay of woman power doesn't ring true and I can guarantee that Alcott never had any such kind of copyright conversation with her publisher. So why ruin a beautiful story with such artifice except to push an agenda? Such a shame when there was a competent cast and clearly the resources to tell this beautiful story dramatically and powerfully on its own."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 October 2020,2/10,"I'm shocked and disappointed that this was rated well and nominated for so many awards. Acting wasn't that great, casting was meh, costumes weren't award winning... I could go on but overall this was terribly disappointing and dismal"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 March 2020,5/10,It was going back and forth too much. A little more chronology would have been better in my opinion.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,10/10,Emma Watson is incredible and so is the rest of the cast. The sets and costumes in this film are incredible. The director is Definitely one of the best new and upcoming filmmakers. This movie is great.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,8/10,"What a wonderful story and telling it.
Loved the movie and fell in love with Jo."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,7/10,"This happened too when I watched A Rainy Day in New York: Cringe every time when seeing Chalamet act like an adult and have this romantic scene with a female character. Yes, he is 24, but still (sadly for a film actor) looks like a child, a fledgling teenager at most. I'm certainly not a hater, but filmmakers, stop pampering this nice kid and find some other male actors that are suitable for your roles.Casting is problematic: Four daughters look radically different from each other and each speaks English with a different accent. How can the audience believe they are a family that have lived together for their whole lives? As the film progresses, you'll start to forget that ""they're not a family"", but that's mainly because the director started to focus on the character that Saoirse plays and let other roles fade into the background.Director Greta Gerwig, like what she did in Lady Bird, is very good at creating tensions through heated dialogues between characters and she is good at concluding her work. But holistically, Lady Bird, is like a good painting finished within a single breath, whereas little women, is something one strugglingly assembled with bits and pieces.Something is also wrong with the narrative: the switch between two timelines is not smooth, and misleading sometimes."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,5/10,"Ms Gerwig pseudo feminism is shameful and annoying. Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet were poor choices as Jo March and Laurie. The March girls are portrayed as spoiled brats and histerycal chickens. The film is not a comedy, but it seems so. Professor Baher was a complete flop. I will always revere Gillian Armstrong's movie and compelling plot. This one is forgettable."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 March 2021,7/10,"That was really emotional and memorable story about four little women. and i really liked how the plot was not linear and the viewer were moved from time to time to see the real story.however, during the whole movie (especially the first half) i couldn't get rid of feeling that i was watching a series of short and really fast scenes which were supposed only to picturize the book and not the verified and thought-out-to-the-details script of the film"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,,"They made this in 1994. Why make another one for. OK, they made for tv."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 October 2020,7/10,Very slow... the flashbacks n too n fro in time becomes just too confusing...actresses playing their younger selves just not all that believable... however the last 45 mins makes up for it but it is a tad self indulgent...
LITTLE WOMEN,13 June 2020,9/10,"The movie give you a comfortable feeling. The backsound and settings support the atmosphere. The director gave a beautiful directing job, script, and back & forth time-play. 😆"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 July 2020,9/10,"Little Women is a must watch for everyone, not just for girls! This version written and directed by Greta Gerwig is a version raw, honest and so beautifully told.The screenplay written by Greta Gerwig was really unique and honest. Gerwig stays true to the important elements of the classic Alcott novel but added a modern twist to the story. She used flashbacks that took place whenever a character experienced an event or visited a place that had been important to them in their childhood. That just made the story so personal to whoever was watching.Alexandre Desplat's original score boosts the coming-of-age theme and family atmosphere throughout the movie, especially during flashbacks. The costumes designed by Jacqueline Durran give the characters a more natural and slightly modern personality, different from what was usually worn in the 19th century."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2021,9/10,"A perfectly wonderful film about strong emotions, passion, talent and love. It's one of those rare movies where you both laugh and cry and feel for all the characters with their flaws and benefits.
The story jumps back and forth in time and at first it was a bit hard to follow. But eventually you get the hang of it and see how the then and now come together. It's an effective storytelling trick to keep momentum and I think it adds to the movie experience."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 November 2020,9/10,"It was a time when people still believed in love. Mother loved daughters, sisters loved sisters, neighbors loved neighbors, and gentlemen loved ladies."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2021,1/10,Why do people love this movie?? The cast is overrated and so annoying!! The main girl is annoying and so full of herself and I can't stand her sisters or Timothys Character!! I dont find any of them interesting nor do I care about their storylines. Don't waste your time!
LITTLE WOMEN,2 August 2021,7/10,I havent read the book but to be honest the story was pretty boring. The Actors were great though.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 August 2020,1/10,"I hated everything about it. It tried so desperately to be original but came out looking like Lady Bird in period costumes. The casting was painful, acting was like nails on a chalkboard & the direction was choppy and shallow. Do yourself a favor and skip this, watch the 1994 version instead, you won't be disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 April 2021,5/10,"I felt like some things were missed out and it suffered.I was unable to follow the Beth storyline as well as other stories as it kept flipping between past and present, I lost whether she had Scarlett fever or a weak heart.I also didn't like the Frederick plot as you never saw her fall in love with him. She meets him, he sees her at the theatre, critiques her work, then we're supposed to believe they are in love??"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 March 2021,1/10,"Goes from women screaming at each other, and in general, to mumbling. 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 November 2020,1/10,"What a disgusting adaptation of a classic novel. While I haven't read the book, I've watched the excellent 1994 movie adaptation, and found this movie to be utter garbage.This director, while having made at least one decent movie before, seems to have no clue here. She rushes the dialogue, cuts from scene to scene too abruptly, and seems to have not done anything beyond a first take (without any rehearsal) of many scenes.While the custome design and cinematography go a quarter of the way towards telling a story, the rushed dialogue and acting take you right out of the scene.I'm clueless as to how this jumbled up piece of lazy movie making has garnered so much praise and so many accolades. The only explanation might be that, just as the director herself, those who loved this film are better suited to watching and making tiktok videos and not feature films.For fans of effective storytelling (that makes sense), I'd highly recommend the 1994 movie version and not this pile of confusion of a remake. Save yourself the constant confusion of 7 year back and forth time jumps (without the characters changing one bit) and don't waste time on this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,6/10,"What makes us identify or sympathize with a character? Overcoming hardship; sacrifice; a human flaw; growth; making amends for a past misdeed; humility; compassion; suffering; remorse; integrity in the face of struggle; being good without being righteous--unless the countervailing force is evil. I find these qualities in short supply in Jo, Beth, Amy, and Meg. They come from tremendous advantage; they're hyper competitive and vindictive. Father comes home from the Civil War unscathed, the family whole again. Frustrated that she's merely ""very talented,"" Amy laments that she's ""not a genius""--then switches to another art form, at which, of course, she excels. Without much room for originality, as the novel has been converted to film several times already, Dir. Gerwig chooses a non-linear narrative and indulges colorfully luscious repasts, sumptuous costumes, and close-ups that flush the young women in boastful rants that the viewer is supposed to accept at face value--I'm great! Aren't I great? You're 'darn' right I am. I wanted to injure my sister with jealous rage, but I also mightily admit it. Etc. Saorise is a very good actress again, while Streep provides generational ballast, though she teeters on caricature throughout, albeit for humorous effect. Jo's curmudgeonly publisher is influenced by HIS daughters to launch, in effect, Jo's career, and she scores big for independent women everywhere by refusing to sell the copyright, giving him a second dash of comeuppance, his future success dependent on his support of Jo's. Beth's death to Scarlet Fever is the one tragedy, but after a few tears and funeral, the family moves beyond it and fast, catapulted by those precious drives to find their respective lots in life--in a movie that could have avowed that Daddy March's lot could easily have been death, maiming, or--at least--trauma from fighting in a brutal war. Or show mother losing her calm and not just admitting to one daughter in private that she has to 'work' hard at patience, for it doesn't come naturally. An avid movie goer, I rarely have my patience tested in the theater dark, but with no one with whom to identify or sympathize, I repeatedly lost interest."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 October 2020,5/10,"I loved this movie up until the end, but the end absolutely ruined it for me. I understand that it was based off a book and the ending was likely changed for the publisher, but it just didn't feel true to the characters at all and left my mind spinning. They absolutely sell you on Jo and Lourie, and although I understand and see the tragic realism of how he and the sister ended up married, I just hated the way it felt quickly rapped up with her ending up with the professor. It just didn't feel true or likely to me at all based on how her character was portrayed. Perhaps I will watch it again sometime in the future and relate to it better, but it just felt all wrong for me and was so disappointing."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,6/10,"This version of Little Women is a typical case of Oscar nominations hype when so called educated critics rush to give their highest rankings. I have seen better versions, this one is a bit dull in the middle. Also the constants flash backs in time didn't help the coherence of the movie either.
At best this serves the purpose of introducing the wonderful book to new audiences."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,5/10,"I have read the book but simply could not follow the movie. It jumped around in such a peripatetic way that we lost the plot. Great acting, just needed to be much, much easier to experience."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2020,10/10,Can't believe some people are giving 1 star to this masterpiece! This deserves 8.5+ rating ! This movie left me speechless!
LITTLE WOMEN,22 December 2019,4/10,"This movie is about coming of age in the 19th century and Hollywood chooses actresses of age 20, 23, 25 and 29 to portray teen girls that should be of ages 12 to 16?
Sorry, but this is so far off that it kills any authentic feeling right from the start."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 April 2020,8/10,"The handling of most of the characters was amazing. Amy, Beth, and Meg were portrayed so well. Jo was great also, but I am displeased that the director not to give us a lot of her relationship with Fritz."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 March 2020,9/10,"I've always loved the story and a new modern version was an exciting prospect. I really love the way it's produced, the actors are great, it's well worth seeing"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,10/10,"Some comments lament the movie has changed from the book (especially the ending). I heard a Greta Gerwig interview today where she explained she studied Louisa May Alcott and found out Alcott, in actuality, was pressured by her publishers, to marry Jo at the end of the book. Gerwig wanted to honor Alcott by ending it the way it really was meant to be. This knowledge made the movie so much better for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 October 2020,8/10,"I'm an avid movie watcher. However for the life of me, I never knew when the movie was in the past or when it was in the current time. There were very few cues. One time line had the main characters hair cut short, but soon that clue was clouded also.
Fortunately, this didn't ruin the story for me and I still had a good time. I had never seen the other movie versions. I had never read the book."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2021,5/10,I'm so glad I've read the books more than once as the jumping around made this really hard to follow. I watched with someone who wasn't familiar with the story and they really struggled to follow what was going on. Several changes from the books which disappointed me. The Winona Ryder version is much better.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 December 2019,1/10,"How many versions of this movie do we need? I'm sure that s version follows the book as well, but please, stop with so many remakes."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,10/10,Little Women checks off everything you could look for in a movie. Go see it.
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,9/10,"This is a good movie even though I didn't think I'd like it when I went. There's no real action or special effects but just a good ""sit back and watch"" movie. Very good acting and screen play."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2020,4/10,"While stylistically it works, I honestly found myself turning it off sometime after Meg marries John. Why? I found it boring. The acting came across as flat and forced, in my opinion. And Timothy Chalamet just did not fit the mold of Laurie. I did like Laura Dern as Marnie and Chris Cooper as Mr. Laurence, but something about Meryl Streep as Aunt March just rubbed me wrong. And I generally enjoy this genre of literature put on film, and was intrigued by the twist for Amy, but it just didn't pull me in."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,10/10,Awesome film! The youngsters definitely brought it all together adding life and quirkiness to the movie. I loved the portrayal of Jo challenging the gender roles and equality. Saoirse and Timothee were great together!!!
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,10/10,"And I don't say this often (if ever). It seemed to offer answers towards everything I feel as a twenty one year old woman. It hit me on a personal level like no other movie has ever done.Ronan's portrayal of Jo March makes us relate to the character the way one could only ever relate to characters in books where you can use much of your imagination. We can easily understand why she might be the best actress of our generation.There was a lot of crying, but in the good way that leaves you feeling whole towards the end. This movie is an incredible adaption of the book that represents all the struggles us women stand for."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 March 2021,6/10,"The film has good actors and good characters but it irritated me how Jo and Laurie didn't end up together, I know that Disneyesque endings are not the best always but they were matching perfectly, they had the same energy and enthusiasm.. And I am sure that Laurie didn't move on and won't move on, Both went for a traditional marriage to fill a gap but it was never perfect for them.. Laurie loved Amy's sister for years why the hell would he marry her at the end? and I hate how they made Jo to be just desperate for any man at the end, sending a letter to Laurie because she felt lonely not because she loved him then marrying an old friend because there was no other option! even Laurie and Amy marriage isn't a healthy one because she would always feel she was just a second option for Laurie and she even told him that.. Marriage choices just doesn't make sense for me"
LITTLE WOMEN,15 June 2020,1/10,"This is horrid. I have never read the book or seen any of the other adaptations, but because of corona I decided to rent this. There's 20 minutes of my life I'm not going to get back. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this, or watch it while you are very high and report back. I think that's the only way it could be interesting."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 June 2020,1/10,"I don't understand how anyone can enjoy this movie. The editing is horrible. The flashbacks felt totally unnecessary. Every character felt one dimensional. This is the first role where I can't stand Meryl Streep and wish she had never been cast. Additionally it is the second movie in a row I have seen of Greta Gerwig's where she writes and directs that I hate!! Lady Bird was just as awful. This movie makes me wonder if any of the actresses have any actual talent, which I'm sure most of them do. However I'm truly beginning to wonder about Emma Watson as an actress. Loved her because of Harry Potter, but her latest roles have been less then stellar. Please save yourself the time and energy it will take to watch this movie and read a book or do literally anything else. I had given up after 20 minutes and decided to come back and give it a second shot. I should have just gone to bed instead. Don't waste your time."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 July 2021,8/10,"Probably this is a film too subtle for average tastes. It a beautiful period piece and contains the cream of coming trans-am and euro acting talent. It crosses time to evoke hopes of childhood, disappointments of growing up and failed family life, almost Dickensian in spirit. Florence Pugh steals it but you cant really fault any of the female actors. Timothee Chamalet is properly cowed by the indomitable women of the story."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 March 2020,5/10,"I am from Europe. The book is not as known, as apreciated and as read here as it is across the ocean. We have a few other books here :) Went to the movies with a large group, I was the only one who has read the book. None of the people at the movies could understand the story line. It was a struggle to follow the time line, even for me. The movie was not meant for people who had not read the book.Other than that, great cast and acting.
English is my second language, sorry for any mistakes."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 February 2020,5/10,"Where to begin? This movie was a mess! The casting was horrible, the acting was awful, the screenplay was terrible, the music was lifeless, lazy cinematography, and the editing full of errors. I know this novel inside and out, and I can't tell what the director was trying to do here. What a waste! The only saving graces were the few original story elements that were accurate, the genuine acting by Watson and Saoirse, and a few randomly added comments about economic equity including showing the Hummels' poverty. That said, Laura Dern was a horrible Marmee and Chris Cooper was a terrible Mr. Laurence. Oh it pains me to see these beautiful characters so misrepresented! Besides the incredibly choppy and confusing timelines that deflated every opportunity for intimacy or connection, the actors were so clearly not their correct ages. Timothee looks like he's 13 years old throughout the movie, even at the end when's he's supposed to be holding his baby! And Emma Watson as Meg was ridiculous when all her sisters looked older than her, not to mention that they all looked like they were adopted from different families! How are we supposed to believe they're related?! They looked like they were picked from a local theatre troupe. Also annoying was the inconsistent language style, sometimes going for modern and quippy and other times trying to sound old and proper. It was so bad! With the drab music, the lazy acting, the lack of intimacy, the choppy storyline, we have no characters to care for. We feel nothing when Amy nearly drowns, or Jo turns Laurie down, or Beth passes away. Why would we? We weren't given any emotional investments to care for them. I really don't know what the director thought she was doing with this slap-in-the-face attempt to modernize one the best novels and stories in American history. I take no issue with modernization, but do it right for Pete's sake! If you want to see Little Women done right, see the one with Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Christian Bale."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,"It brought Alcott's novel to life once again especially when Jo's storyline (especially the ending) kind of blends in with Louisa May Alcott.
Greta's visual style improved (since Lady Bird) and the screenplay is heartwarming, heartbreaking and funny.
Really love the score and costumes.
The non linear structure was way better than I thought. You have to pay proper attention between past and present. You just can tell through the use of colour but mainly the hairstyles.
Of course the acting was amazing!!! What did you expect from a cast like this! Saoirse was a powerful lead as usual, including Pugh and Chalamet as well as supporting roles. Best ensemble of 2019."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 May 2020,3/10,"I loved the 1994 version. This is crap in comparison and quite boring. The writing, script and the lack of distinction between characters is what ruins it."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 April 2020,10/10,"I loved this movie so much I kept inviting friends to see it with me again. And five watches in the local theater later, I'm still amazed at the production quality, the storyline, and the character chemistry. It's one I'll never forget. This remake touches every emotion and if you don't have sisters, it will make you wish you had several. This is one to own for your collection of greats."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,1/10,"As someone who loves the novel, this movie is absolutely horrid.
I do NOT understand why everyone loves it so much.
The actress playing Amy is not even remotely fit for the part.
It's just... terrible.
The timeline flipping makes zero sense and is badly done.
Even though I hate Susan Sarandon, that version is 10/10.
Seriously, this movie is not good."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,10/10,"It was beautiful in the scenery, acting, writing, and of course in the actors. Best film I've seen this year."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,10/10,"Little Women is one of my all-time favorite books, and thank you, Greta Gerwig, for bringing it to life! Such a beautiful and moving story with an all-star cast and spectacular cinematography. Loved, loved, loved it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 September 2020,9/10,What a worming movie this is I m glad I watched this.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,6/10,I am watching this academy award nominated movie yes. They say this story is a one about girls for girls. Regardless it is a great story and remains as popular as ever.. with several movie versions and mini series. So its more of interest to me in seeing how this version has turned out. This screenplay is clever. There are good ideas surrounding this version. The problem for me is in the execution. Some of the acting is terrible. Cinematography is poor. Bad editing. It has a big budget but looks cheap. How can I say this? Well I went back to the 1994 version by Director Gillian Armstrong. Its still as fresh today as it was 25 years ago and back then they had to fight just to get it made. It went on to make stars of many actors. This version has the benefit of time and cultural changes but it seems to have been wasted. Emma Watson was terrible. Not deserving of a nomination in my opinion or was it just a consolation prize anyway. If you want men to come see this movie it needs a Gillian Armstrong directing it.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 August 2020,2/10,"I was so anticipating and looking forward to this new version and was so disappointed. The characters are off. Amy is too ""old"" for some of her behavior. When she's outside crying about the limes it seems so false and doesn't match her age... same thing with burning the manuscript. Their mother only talks about forgiveness but doesn't address Amy's behavior of vindictiveness, (and she had no reason to be mad -- she was having a tantrum because she couldn't get her way) and this would be more understandable for someone who's much younger. With her being older that changes the situation and she should have consequences for her behavior. Friedrich is too young. I realize that remakes try to be different but the ages are off. One minutes Amy tries to pass off her behavior as if she's too young to know better, and the next minute she's acting as an adult. I totally love Saoirse Ronan, but she didn't seem like a Jo to me. When Laurie proposes and falls apart he just seems co-dependent, and no sense of self-worth. Many talented people, but seems so mis-matched. So disappointed. The 1994 version is extremely more enjoyable."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,4/10,"I tried to go into the film with an open mind, but within the first 10 minutes I was annoyed. I found myself wanting to leave and rewatch the 1994 version. Sure the scenery, cinematography, score, etc. are gorgeous, but where is the elegance? The refinery in the mannerisms of the March sisters? I kept waiting for the actors to have the poise that, I assume, one would have back in that time period. I'm not saying that they need not show emotion or passion, but I felt as though there was a lack of grace, elegance, and authenticity within the character portrayals. It wasn't until 3/4 of the movie was over that I began to enjoy what I was watching. As a stand alone film, it has its charms, but I was left disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 November 2020,10/10,"No words to say:)
Just go and see..
U just luv d acting all r good
And u will wet ur eyes,i bet you!"
LITTLE WOMEN,26 April 2020,9/10,"My mum gave me Little Women by Louisa May Alcott on my 16th birthday and so naturally I was sceptical about watching this movie because I didn't want it to be ruined for me like what happened with Paper Towns and I am so glad that I took the risk of watching this movie because it was perfection. Apart from a few minor goofs and continuity errors which aren't even that visible this movie is perfection and I do not use that word often.
It was a movie about love about life about women's value in this society and everything that young women go through even now. I think it will inspire the youth and especially young women to go after what they want in life and not settle for what you've been stuck with in your lives even after a few setbacks.
Definitely recommended."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 April 2021,10/10,This film deserves more than a mere 1-10 star rating. The beauty captured and love inspired in it is only something you can sit with and hold. Words won't work. Praise won't do it justice. I loved it. That's all I know how to say; I loved it.
LITTLE WOMEN,2 April 2020,1/10,"I agree with the majority of the negative reviews here. Some of the cast were good, others poorly casted. Editing was a mess and served no purpose to the story except for two specific scenes where the juxtaposition was actually effective. Otherwise it just hindered the character development, audience attachment to the characters and the ability to understand the timeline and plot. Really disappointed as I thought I would love it. I also found it to be an inaccurate depiction of society at the time. I've read Little Women and the language they used in the book was much more old fashioned. This is set in the same time period as Gone with The Wind to put it in to perspective for you. It kind of broke the immersion when the characters acted or spoke in a way that didn't match the setting and time period. I can think of other critiques but the other reviews have all said it. It was watchable, just disappointing."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,9/10,"I will definitely introduce it to my mom and my girls.
I already imagined watching it many years later and still be touched as hell."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 January 2020,1/10,"This Movie, that I absolutely refuse to call Little Women, is a slap in the face to anyone that has read the book, loved the classic story and has grown up with these characters ; Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy!I am a fan of Greta Gerwig and of 'Lady Bird', which is why it was all the more unexpected that this movie turned out to be so disappointing and such a betrayal to me.
Especially as Greta herself has said that this story was first introduced to her as a child, so she knows what it means to grow up with these characters and this story.Let's start first with how the story was unfolded. Starting in future and jumping back to the past then jumping to the future??? It ruins the whole emersive experience that the true Little Women story provides.The reason that the story has attracted so many young girls is because that's when the story starts, when they are little girls and draws you in as they grow, learn and mature.Next, the dreadful casting of characters that do not capture the true essence of the sisters! The terrible idea to have younger Amy and older Amy played by the same actress makes the younger Amy extremely unlikeable. And although I am a fan of Saoirse Ronan, her portrayal of Jo was completely inadequate, scatter-brained and weak.The others so blended into the scenery they're not even worth critiquing with one exception. The one star that imdb forces you to at least give was given for Meryl Streep.Even if I could get behind the chaotic way in which the story was told and the drab choice of actors and actresses, I absolutely draw the line at Greta Gerwig's choice to merge the life of Louisa May Alcott and the character Jo March!
This is where the chunk of my feeling of betrayal comes from. If Greta wished to make that creative choice she has all right to do so but then Greta Gerwig cannot call this movie Little Women! Because it is not!!Greta has 'adapted' the original story to the point where the story has shifted perspective from the central theme being family to it being about women's rights.If this is the story Greta wanted to tell then she should have done a biographical movie about Louisa May Alcott without riding on the coat tails of Little Women!!!Greta Gerwig's explanation that she used materials from letters and diaries of Louisa May Alcott is just insulting. It's all the more reason that it should have been a biographical movie of Alcott's life.Critics and Reviewers are commenting on what a wonderful movie this is, and it may be in its own right, with important themes being represented, but it is not LITTLE WOMEN and should not be misrepresented as such!!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,9/10,"Can't remember enjoying a film so much, utterly incredible and beautiful piece of film work."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,9/10,"A film like this is what makes me a movie goer. I felt like I took a step back in time,, mesmerized by the cinematography, the musical score., and above all brilliant acting. What else is needed to say except, go see it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,9/10,"This movie has been one of my favourites that came out in 2019. This movie sent we on an emotional rollercoaster showing a new perspective to the story of little women.One of the things I really enjoyed about this movie is that they let you see a whole new perspective to Amy March. I love how Florence Pugh portrays Amy, especially in the scene where Amy visits the Laurence manor in the cold in the middle of the day. I really like Amy March, but since tis is the first Little women book or movie I have ever seen, I know many other people do not favour Amy.Another thing that was really great about this movie was the acting from Timothée Chalamet. As usual, Chalamet gives us a stunning performance and for me, really gives the audience a good picture of how Laurie is. I think that my favourite scene that he did was the scene where he confesses his love for Jo. I thought that him and Saoirse Ronan have amazing chemistry and they both do a spectacular job.the reason I didn't give this 10 stars is because I wish we saw a more of Beth March. Since she did die quite early on in the story and I think these adaptations should go deeper into her story, in my opinion.Overall, I loved this movie. And I recommend it too anyone, and I mean anyone. And I would love to watch it again as soon as it gets out of theaters."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2020,10/10,Saoirse Ronan is just wonderful! This is the best remake!
LITTLE WOMEN,26 February 2020,9/10,"I watched this with 5 other women from my family and it was such an eye opening movie in regards to the emotion felt as the women took on the challenged of personal life, family responsibility, and professional aspiration. I left feeling a sense of fullness in the sense that I could accomplish aspirations in all aspects of life."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 March 2020,5/10,"If I had not seen the Winona Ryder version, this would have been o.k.. But there is no comparison. The dialogue is not in keeping with the 19th century and neither is the way some of the characters are interpreted. They remind me of 21st century women, not 19th century women. The locations chosen, along with the interior shots, were excellent. Costuming was also accurate. The bottom line is that it basically lacks charm, the acting was better in the Ryder version, and the movie was not chopped up like this one."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,3/10,"I couldn't end the movie. I was board, so board, slow, nothing new, nice for girls seating around the table drinking tea."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 September 2020,8/10,"The entire cast portrayed their characters to another level; making you feel for them like you knew them your entire life. Greta Gerwig's second directed movie might be one of my favorites in recent years. I fell in love with the characters and their decisions. The story is so simple but it works wonders I want to see more movies like this where the decisions of characters truly make me mad; there needs to be more movies directed with such passion that makes you feel so related to the story.With Lady Bird in 2017 and now Little Women only two years later, I am very excited to see what Gerwig plans for in the near future. I also love how she casts Soarise Ronan in her movies, because of Lady Bird and Little Women she has become my favorite actress."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 December 2020,10/10,This was one of my favorites of the year! Truly a remarkable film in all aspects. Beautiful cinematography and great acting! Must watch. 10!
LITTLE WOMEN,13 April 2020,7/10,"My judgement of Little Woman was most certainly enhanced by the fact that I've never seen an adaptation of the novel, nor read the novel at all. Thus leaving me with a clean slate for opinion. Greta Gerwig's third directorial picture creates a historically authentic, well-acted, heartfelt film, brought to life by Its stellar cast."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 April 2020,9/10,"I loved the characters and how they related to each other. Unfortunately, it had been years since I read the book, so it took me some time to figure out who was who."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 April 2020,8/10,Great ending... film centres on women's individuality and their personal growth.It shows how society wants women to end up marrying and having kids ( specially the nineteenth century).The best thing about the movie is it didn't ended the way most of us want. Thankyou Greta Gerwig for not ending the movie into a romantic cliche.
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2021,10/10,"Awesome acting
Best story for families
No words to describe"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 March 2021,5/10,"Beautifully shot, gorgeous interiors and excellent cast - BUT - as I watched this movie I found the disjointed nature in the timeline to be irritating.
And, mainly as a result of this, I was unable to engage emotionally with any of the characters.
This could have been a great film, but I was left somewhat disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 December 2020,6/10,"Had there not been the '94 Little Women I would have given this movie a 8 or 9. But it's really hard not to compare it to the other movie. The actresses and actors are pretty good but Laura Dern (whom I usually really enjoy!) just couldn't convince me she was Marmee. The jumping back and forth 7-ish years also got a little annoying. But the costumes, props and sets where really good!
Overall it's a good film, it just can't hold a candle to the 1994 version."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2021,9/10,I watched this movie in the cinema and the whole experience was just unforgettable aside from me liking Emma the movie was ver fascinating and would definitely watch it again
LITTLE WOMEN,26 March 2021,8/10,I'm a big fan of strong lead female character type of movies. It's the best version of Little Women movie out there I think. The movie is important and sends a strong message to all young women to not stop believing in yourself and keep going.
LITTLE WOMEN,30 June 2021,10/10,A gorgeous film with a stunning cast and amazing cinematography. Kudos to greta gerwig for such an amazing film.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 October 2021,10/10,"Beautifully made, inspiring movie. I could watch it a million times and get emotional each time. I wish everyone on Earth could watch this movie. Every scene is just beautiful, true story of life and how dreams can come true if you are passionate. A thousand percent recommended watching!"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,7/10,"I love Little Women, the book, I have read it multiple times and know the story backwards. I watched this with my son who did not know the book or had ever seen another adaptation. Firstly the cinema was packed on a Tuesday morning! The mostly over 50 audience liked it and there were some laugh out loud moments. But I found myself feeling a little bored, particularly at the beginning. I just could not buy the casting of Beth and Amy as young teens. Amy's voice was way too deep for a 12 year old and a 20 something Beth feeding a doll was just weird. Also Jo running through the city showing her legs would surely have been very shocking at the time (as was her sitting with the professor legs all askew). But I did like the scenes in Europe where Florence Pugh came into her own and at this point was very believable. I also felt that Meg and Beth's stories were cut back a lot to allow more room for Jo and Amy, My son said he enjoyed it but then asked ""which sister died?""So visually excellent with good acting but hard to follow unless you know the story well."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,1/10,This is the worst of all versions of Little Women. Very boring movie....I don't like it.
LITTLE WOMEN,20 January 2020,2/10,Over rated. Slow and very very boring. I cannot understand how this movie has been nominated for an Oscar.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 October 2020,6/10,"I think I've seen just about every English / American version of LW available. Love them all. This one was lush, well cast (amazing cast!) and well done ... EXCEPT ... what in the world is the matter with telling the story in a linear manner? Why, why, WHY do the screenwriters and directors these days feel they need to tell everything in flashbacks? I do NOT love that."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,1/10,"I didn't know what was what, present or past or in between. It was very badly executed. Ok so I did work it out but I wasn't expecting to have to sit there trying to work things out. It was terrible. When the 4 of them were together the dialogue was just silly. Walked out halfway through. Waste of time."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,3/10,"If you want to see Little Women watch the 1994 version. It was perfectly cast and had a coherent plot line. This movie is poorly cast in a lot of roles. The back and forth timeline is confusing. You gain zero empathy for the characters. Beth's death is a blip, barely any emotion. I didn't shed a tear. Chalamet is unbelievable as Teddy. He looks like he's perpetually 16. Laura Dern is a terrible choice for Marmee. There was no established love story between Jo and Friedrich so when they get together it's just silly. The 94 version is not old enough to be unappealing to younger audiences and was so well done and cast and acted that this monstrosity was a was of time and energy. The fact that it got nominated for Best Picture is someone's idea of a joke. If you liked this movie try the 94 version and tell me I'm wrong."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,10/10,I've read the book a few dozen times. I loved the 2nd version most UNTIL now. This was excellent. The new flow worked well while keeping to the true story. Just loved it.
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,10/10,"Now this is the way ALL films should be made. Oscar worthy performances, breathtaking scenery and sets, gorgeous costumes and the plot was true to the story. Without going into a lot of detail and spoilers, it was the most beautiful version of this film I've seen this far. Gets my vote for Best Picture. Don't miss it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,6/10,"The director tries to do something interesting with the source material but ends up with a too long and ultimately boring / messy story. I think a masterful director with more experience would be able to pull off what Joe Wright did to Jane Austin. Greta Gerwig isn't there yet. Hyping her up not only does a disservice to female directors, it also stunts a young storyteller from getting the space she needs to hone her craft. The lack of Oscar votes are to do with the finished product, no the gender of the story or storyteller."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 July 2020,10/10,"This film is a rare jewel in the genre. The all-star, excellent cast carries an intelligent writing that manages to avoid clichés while reflecting great sensibility around the topics of friendship, purpose, love and of course, sisterhood. Perfectly directed too.
Full disclosure - I haven't read the book or seen the earlier movie(s?)."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 January 2020,10/10,It was funny. It was sweet. It made me fall in love with this family all over again. I loved the 90s version as a teen and I can't wait to have my daughter watch the original and this one with me when it comes out for streaming.I had to explain to my MIL which timeline we were in because she couldn't keep track with the flashbacks.
LITTLE WOMEN,9 February 2020,8/10,"I have never read the book nor seen any of the other movies.
People are complaining about the timeline but I followed it just fine.
Beautifully acted, gorgeous scenery and costumes. Their chemistry was great! It made me want to go hug my sister."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,5/10,"After reading all the raving reviews I find myself quite disappointed by the film. I didn't think the casting was great, to start with. I loved Saoirse Ronan as Jo but Emma Watson was not the Meg I would have chosen, after reading the book numerous times. Also Laura Dern as Marmee did not convince me at all when I think about the character from the book. I think Susan Sarandon did a much better job in portraying the loving but strict and holding it together character. I did like the change in the storyline though, with the flashbacks, interesting approach which worked very well. I hated that they made Jo write a letter to Laurie, suggesting she would marry him should he ask again. What was that about? This new version did not make me empathise with the characters, the only really touching scene for me was when Amy falls through the ice. The rest of the film left me a bit detached and not caring that much."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 March 2020,1/10,"Firstly, I've read the book and enjoyed it. I also like movies based from this era. However this modern take was superficial, kitsch and unbearably boring. The back ground music (which never ceased) was flatulent and grating. Not to mention the one dimensional characters who were cast incredibly poorly, I mean come on! The girls were dreadful and at least of two of them looked far too old for their roles. The exception of Laura Dern who I love..but I found even her performance in this tedious and uncomfortable to watch. I can't imagine where these good reviews are come from. If you're sitting on the fence because of it's (misleadingly) high rating, then I advise you to NOT waste your time."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,10/10,"Men must see the film LITTLE WOMEN currently in theatres (Opened Christmas Day).I just got back from seeing LITTLE WOMEN for the second time and, once again, I was so captivated by the performances and the beauty of the film. I enjoyed it even more the second time. It is a timeless story about family, togetherness, hope and ambition and mostly about love in all its many forms. Though I am blessed and content as a celibate priest there were moments in the film that I simply melted witnessing how feminine energy can captivate a person and how easy it would be to fall in love with any of the March women. There are a couple moments in the film where you see the male characters standing at attention in awe of the interaction of mother and daughters. The moments are priceless and I daresay must prove indicative of most people's reaction to the movie.
A note to married men and those seeking marriage: You will appreciate your wife and woman friend all the more after seeing this movie: The Wonder of the Feminine"" is in full display here --its strengths, its solidarity, its honesty about the friendship and competition among sisters--not so unlike that of brothers (Surprise!) and their love for men in the special sense of all humankind but also their appreciation and respect for the marked differences between us.This new film written and directed by Greta Gerwig also highlights the way echoes of the 19th Century limitations upon women continually need to be addressed for men and women in society today for we are not yet true partners at home, at work nor in our collective mission to make this a better world, lovingly, respectfully and with integrity. There's also some important social commentary about the proper and improper use of wealth but I'll let Meryl Streep's characterization of Aunt March spell that out for you. (Streep is amazing as always in a significantly minor role.)All performances are luminous and completely ""right,"" but three stand out for me: Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Florence Pugh as Amy and Laura Dern as ""Marmee"" (""mother""). Timothée Chalamet as Laurie, (""the boy next store"" and devoted friend) is also excellent, especially in the scene he confesses undying love to Jo. Gerwig's script gives them great opportunities to be ""REAL"" and the way the script and editing move back and from within a seven-year time period adds layers of perspective that adds to the insights this family drama offers. Cinematography, Set Design and Costumes are A+. A fine score, too, by Alexander Desplat.GO SEE THIS MOVIE with as many men and women and young people as you can. I'd say age 10 and up. And then read the book and DISCUSS it with women and men, boys and girls because it is not only about girlhood, womanhood but about life and death, love and ambition, inner and outer conflicts, timidity and boldness--i.e. it's for everyone. I believe it needs to be back on the school's reading lists, too. When I was a student teacher long ago, I put it on my reading list for high school freshmen but didn't get the chance to teach it. Perhaps it would have become a deterrent to my vocation. Evidently God had other plans for me, but I shall continue to appreciate and enjoy the story and the women in my life always and always."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,7/10,"So the Little Women story is how the very Little Women story ever became existence. It is beautifully handcrafted into a recursive manner so you never start the story or end it. The story might be about the life of a generic family. But your reality will blend with the story in the past, present and the future. So this reminded me of our reality. We have a past, present and future. But they are all in one ""Now."""
LITTLE WOMEN,3 December 2020,8/10,"I grew up reading all of Louisa May Alcott's books (try Eight Cousins and Rose in Bloom!!! so good <3), and watching the 1994 version of Little Women with Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, & Christian Bale et al. I think I must be stuck in my ways because I still prefer the 94 version (it's all the peeps from my generation!). But this version is simply gorgeous (my mother particularly loves the scene with Jo and Teddy dancing on the porch). The ending cracked me up - I really, really loved it as an homage to Alcott's real life.
I think the biggest strength of the 94 version is that they cast separate actors as young Amy (a young Kirsten Dunst) and adult Amy. Amazing as Florence Pugh is, Amy is supposed to be quite young when the book begins (the book states Beth is 13 & Amy is younger), and a lot of Amy's actions seem truly outrageous when an older child does them. Instead of seeming like a spoiled little girl, when Florence Pugh does some of the classic Amy storylines from the book, you can't help think that she's old enough to know better!"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 July 2020,5/10,"I grew up on the 90s version, but I watched this with an open mind because I truly love the story. I'm also a big fan of several of the actors. Unfortunately I really struggled with this adaptation. The chaotic dialogue, the penchant for rapid discourse, talking over each other, the switching back and forth between present and past... It was really not for me. Watchable but not a classic in my opinion."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 October 2020,9/10,"I have always mixed feeling before watching an adaptation that I have already seen before. I tend to compare the acting, the story.... But what a surprise! Even though I knew the story it felt like I'm watching an original. What an adaptation! Greta Gerwig, compliments! In addition, superb and strong acting, wow. Timothée Chalamet and Emma Watson were in my opinion the weakest act, but just because they were over-acted by grand performances by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen and Laura Dern. I loooved the intermezzo of ""how it's made"" style making a book, interesting and educational as well. What a great idea! One star less because of the over-sentimental ending, it did not suit to the rich story before."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,5/10,"Please watch the 1933 adaptation of the novel.
No one can top Hepburn's Jo.
Anyone who loves the novel will love this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,9/10,"As one who has not read the book, I cannot speak to the accuracy of this film, but I will attest to its authenticity. There is a warmth burning at its heart and it brings great light to its characters as well as awful shadow. I call this film generous because it gives the viewer so much. So much intelligence, so much kindness, so much sadness: so much to love and wonder. And it does all of it without being a ""romantic"" movie. It it is aware of the realities of women during this time period and treats marital situations with honesty, but also with grace. There is romance, but it is merely a part for these characters which I think is Gerwig's biggest accomplishment; to draw these women as more without the need to make them gritty, troubled, or with hubris. This film is a portrait of their lives painted with generosity without becoming poor. The cinematography is gorgeous, the casting is supreme, the writing memorable and the performance unforgettable. Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet are delightful on screen together and there is a general air of touching tenderness and welcoming mind in all the characters down to the extras. I tip my hat to this film and say bravo, Gerwig and company, bravo, to you and everyone who worked on it."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,10/10,"A wonderful film, incredible screenplay, beautiful character development. The dialog is so intelligent and thoughtful. Beautiful period piece, yet still timeless. Just go and see it."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 April 2020,2/10,"I watched this movie last night (had hoped to see it whilst still in cinemas but the timing didn't work out, so purchased the DVD). I'm a huge fan of the 1994 version and was initially sceptical about this remake, but after hearing good reviews, I held out hope that it would be good. It wasn't.Positives:
Majority of costumes were lovely.
I liked the scene where Jo starts writing ""Little Women"". I thought it was well done.
Emma Watson was in it.Negatives:
The heart, soul and warmth of the 1994 version was lacking. This movie played like a bunch of well known and talented actors pretending to be characters, which yes I get that technically that's what actors do all the time, but they weren't believable. They didn't embody their characters.There was nothing in this movie that made me feel like I want to see it again. I will be giving away my copy of the DVD.Very disappointed."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,2/10,I don't know how this got so many good reviews. I think it was not good especially having the same actress play the younger and older version of Amy. She played the part of younger Amy much to babyish for her age and looks. Then the actor who played Laurie and Marmee just can not act in general.
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,6/10,"Its not entirely boring but it kind of is but at the same time it was deeply inspiring. At its centre its not a film just for women its for everyone who has ambitions and are facing obstacles in the forms of oppression. Great set design, costumes, a proper period piece. Anyway cheers to the director
I'm happy to see frances doing well."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,6/10,This version of Little Women was good but could have been better. There was too much jumping back and forth from past to present which made it difficult to follow the story line especially for someone who doesn't already know the story.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,8/10,"To begin with, Greta Gerwig brought out the soul of a feel-good classic in this gorgeous remake; the end result is every bit as authentic and moving as it is uplifting. Saoirse Ronan is enchanting, as always, as the free-spirited, loving Jo. She delivers a soberly vulnerable dialogue towards the end of the movie that encapsulates Jo's confused relationships with intellectual freedom and conventional love. Amy (Pugh) and Laurie (Chalamet)'s developing attraction is another highlight.However, what dilutes the story's charm is its messy storyline, constantly shifting back and forth and disorienting the audience. At more than one point, the movie gets overlong and boring; it does not help that there are so many intersecting storylines. The neat couplings and picture-perfect ending do not feel that earned. However, in my opinion, the movie does pick up in the last third portion, when there is more momentum, intensity, and conflict.Overall, it is the best kind of feel-good Hollywood movie: ""chicken-soup-for-the-soul"" warmth coupled with sharp insights, thoughtful dynamic, and personable touches. A true Christmas delight."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 July 2020,7/10,"I was quite fond of the 1994 version which was very much in line with the Alcott family - to the point of the father being idiotic (IMHO). I do like this version showing how LMA was pressured into marrying off Jo, but the movie seemed to be a faint copy of the 1994 version. However, all of the actors were superb in their characters."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 May 2020,10/10,The main actors have nailed it to create a masterpiece of emotional daily life story
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,10/10,"So I literally just got home from this movie and I am speechless. I can't stop thinking about it and am literally stumbling across the keyboard writing this review (Apologies if any typos follow).I have never read the book this is based on, nor have I seen any of the countless adaptations that preceded this one. Having seen this, I don't feel the need to ever see another version.To break this down by technicals (acting, direction, music, visuals, yada yada yada), all of which were simply superb, would be a disservice to the journey I just experienced. This film captures the way we are with the people we love in such a way that I'm not sure I've ever truly experienced. It feels honest while also poetic. It puts a smile on your face that doesn't leave until it breaks your heart, and then guides you through both until the very last frame.It feels so of it's time, while simultaneously here and now. It's packed to the gills and full of urgency, and yet it never feels overstuffed or rushed. It's a small story of people, but one that feels grand and epic with its depth and emotion.Few films have touched me the way this one has. The emotion it distills from you with every frame is simply unbelievable, and this work of art cements Greta Gerwig as one of the greatest storytellers in film. I highly recommend to everyone that they should see this film. I knew almost nothing about it as I entered, and now it is all I can think about."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 March 2020,10/10,"Just an amazing movie. Perfection, one of the greatest adaptation's of all time. Thanks Greta for this pleasure."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 March 2020,6/10,"It all seemed to progress too quickly without the depth of some of the other adaptations. Also, while I adored Florence Pugh's portrayal of adult Amy, her adolescent Amy was grating. The ending was beautiful, especially in regards to Alcott's original intentions for the novel. And I loved the feminist quality of the dialogue."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 November 2020,7/10,"WHY won't Hollywood bother getting the hair right?!?!? I can't think of single fashion plate/period image of a woman with her down until what 1920?!? Granted I've no idea how a young woman wore her hair day to day in real life but I'm willing to bet it was the rare exception for it to be down & loose. Think about it there wasn't anything resembling normal shampoo until the 1890s or later
Why bother with that. Correct sets costumes if you can't get be bothered getting the hair right??"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 July 2020,7/10,"I love literary movies, which are increasingly rare, so kudos for making this movie. The costumes, sets and atmosphere were visually beautiful and historically accurate. That said, the director wanted to make the often-filmed story different from older versions by using flashbacks, but the scrambled time sequence doesn't work. It was choppy and didn't allow viewers to develop empathy with the characters & made the story hard to follow. The only characters that were fully developed were the 2 rival sisters; everyone else's role was too minor and didn't get enough screen time. Bottom line, I hope we get more movies of this type, but they would be more effective if the story was told more completely and directly."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,9/10,"For such a long time, i didnt have this feeling, the feeling that i actually care about the characters, i feel for them, smile for them and even cry for them. So yeah, im kind of in love with The Little Women."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"Gerwig did an amazing job with the script, screenplay and directing! The actors are all phenomenal and the film is beautiful. The editing and transitions from past to present give it depth and the story is an emotional and realistic one. Love, coming of age, and societal pressures are all explored and this film adaptation would make Alcott so proud. Must see, go watch it now! Oscar worthy indeed. :)"
LITTLE WOMEN,24 October 2021,6/10,"I appreciate all your effort to make this movie.The actors and actresses presented a good play.But I think this kind of story is not my type. Several lifes were followed and many things happened through a long period of time. It is good to know that the procees of going forward to the end was like a Straight line and made me bored.Anyway, I thank you again and wish you good luck."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,7/10,"I liked that the script was not drastically changed from previous versions. I'm a big fan of the story and have seen every version of the movies that has been made. I didn't truly love this version. The actress who played Amy wasn't as believable for playing younger sister, especially to Emma Watson. Josephine's character was too rough and gruff in this movie making it hard to believe her living in the time period the story is set in. It also dragged on forever after the death of Beth, causing the movie to be 2+hrs."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,10/10,I'd been eager to see this the moment it was announced and it never came close to disappointing me. Such a beautiful adaptation and portrayal of well known and complex characters. Well done to the Greta Gerwig and the cast and crew for re-creating such a masterpiece. I particularly fell in love with the way Pugh portrayed Amy; she turned the character I disliked as a child into one a relate to and aspire to be like as young adult.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 November 2021,2/10,Their creative take on the book and modernizing it to fit the political feminist view is not true to the book or to the author. The author and characters were transcendentalists not feminists there's a difference. Costumes sucked too.
LITTLE WOMEN,17 February 2020,8/10,"Having seen 'Little Women' I wondered why Yorick Le Saux wasn't nominated for cinematography at the Oscas 2020.I'll mention two scenes to support my view an d I urge you to watch them closely:
1. The scene where Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) comes to New York for the first time and we see her walking down the crowded streets. The remarkable thing about thiis scene is, that she's the only person in focus - all the other people seem blurred.2. The scenes on the beach. First, the flashback to the summer when all the sisters were spending summer together on the beach, accompanied by Laurie. Le Saux manages to make it look like a French impressionist painting come to live.
Which fits, right, because Louisa May Alcott wrote the book in the same time period.In marked contrast to the above mentioned scene, there's the scene on the beach of Jo and Amy (Florence Pugh), where Amy is suffering from illness. The camera has a very low standpoint while both women are seated in the sand and Jo tries to console her sister, although it's windy and grey.Awesome cinematography!"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2021,9/10,"Acting, direction and attention to detail are top notch"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,1/10,Boring ...boring...zzzzzzzzzsnore..pulling the wings off a fly would be more fun!
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,5/10,I've read Little Women a dozen times and seen every film version so I was really looking forward to this movie. I just didn't love it. I hated the back-and-forth - it's the beginning of the Civil War and in the next scene it's after the Civil War and then it's back to the past again. I thought the cast was excellent (especially Florence and Timothy) but I still prefer the 1994 version.
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,2/10,"I was almost crying at the end of this movie - and not in a good way. I cannot remember leaving the theater so angry and let-down. I had such high expectations as I read the book over and over as a young girl and have seen the film in all its incarnations. This cast was stellar and I think Gerwig is terrific in everything she does - until now.Anyone who isn't familiar with the story will have trouble. I know it by heart and I got confused. Gerwig jumps around frantically so there is no momentum and no thru-line. The characters were beautifully dressed in 1860's clothing and romped around like they were at a rock concert. If Jo hit Laurie one more time, I was going to scream. Nobody should ever hit people like that - repeatedly - and women certainly didn't behave that way during Civil War times. The death of Beth, one of the greatest deaths in literature and film, was a non-event. The add-ons in terms of feminist dialogue were tiresome and out of place. Not needed. If told properly, the story is all you need.I cannot recommend this film. Watch the other films of ""Little Women."" Better yet, read the book. I wish Gerwig had...."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 August 2020,10/10,"I have watched the film several times and is simply one of the best I've ever seen. From start to finish, I am drawn into EVERYTHING. The actors and actresses in the movie could not have played their roles any better. The color scheme using gold and blue to differentiate between the characters in their youth and then adulthood is brilliantly done. The depiction of family life is razor sharp accurate. Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen are extremely believable as sisters in the film and faithfully portray the characters in the book. Actually, if you watch them together doing interviews in regard to the film, they still have a sisterly chemistry. I almost have to remind myself that they're not biological sisters, the chemistry is that strong. Just awesome performances by the whole cast. In regard to the director Greta Gerwig, wow. There are just not enough positive adjectives to describe the work she did on this film. It is a mystery to me why this film did not win more awards than it did, although it was nominated for quite a few. It is a masterpiece from start to finish in every respect."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 September 2020,10/10,"I absolutely love it the movie , it's so amazing , an excellent remake of the classical movie . All of the actors did an excellent work doing their characters , for a long time I haven't watched such an incredible movie . This movie it's am truly masterpiece ."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 June 2020,7/10,"Greta Gerwig has a was to make and show characters quite despicable. They can react in the most suffering of ways in front of what appear to be the silliest of events. They can even seem to be so contradictory sometimes. They get into your skin, to your bones and you wonder why do you bother on keeping watching them.It all comes to they all being intrinsicaly so human. She manages to keep them on earth, each one as their own individual with each of their actions guided by their own principles and wants.This film is a cozy journey about the common people. About their downs and ups. About life.I was expecting nothing of the film, considering I disliked the director's previous well known work, Ladybird, but overall, I ended up enjoying the experience of watching this film.-Note about the time jumps between events in the film:The whole colour palette changes. Warm orangey tones for the past. Cold blues for the present, before the ending. It actually creates a nice contrast.I read some comments about people being weird out by the chronological disorder. I have to admit that I myself did not catch it from the start, but when I noticed it I thought it was silly of me to not have done it before. After that it took me 2 min or so to put everything in order in my mind.I have not read the original story and I'm not familiar with the events of it neither but I believe this is a good stand alone film is you see is as its own story."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 March 2020,3/10,This is by far the most boring and predictable film I've seen in a very long time. Really can not recommend watching it. There is almost no plot or climax - the only reason I didn't leave the cinema early was because of an old woman sitting on the edge of the seat row and I didn't wanna ruin her cinema experience.
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,9/10,"A modern twist on a classic.
Saoirse Ronan is outstanding
Timothée Chalamet is wonderful
Beautiful adaptation by Greta Gerwig
Absolutely loved it"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,6/10,"I've read all the great reviews on here and fully expected to feel the same. We did a 3 generations thing seeing the movie, me/grandma, daughter and granddaughter and we all were surprised to feel similar coming out. My 13 year old granddaughter felt it was boring and hard to follow and she lost interest halfway through. Which was definitely not the case when my daughter saw the Wynona version at a similar age.Both my daughter and I felt it criss crossed thru timelines without care for the viewer. There was little change to the characters visual looks with each look back or forward thru time. Tho we weren't confused at the flash backs and forwards, it was still disconcerting that they didn't age much with each scene change. And hardest of all was Timothy Chalomet's Laurie! He looked a constant skinny 19 yr old regardless of the time period.Again, can't fault the wonderful acting, but the direction/storytelling was all over the place!Warning: scene description.
Ex: the scene where Amy gets her hand whipped was so short you got none of the feeling for Amy you needed for the rest of the story. Even though she's self centered, the book and other movie versions I've seen, build Amy out with hearty scenes in a way you love her for all her faults.I do like that Greta Gerwig made an honest attempt to portray the ending more in line with what the author would have wanted. But unfortunately, by the end, the benefit on 13 year old coming of age girls is lost If you can't hold their attention."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 September 2021,5/10,"I loved the 1994 version. If it weren't for my knowledge of the plot and characters, I would have been thoroughly confused.The timeline jumps around and the characters aren't aged, no change of appearance/haircuts etc. Laurie looks 16 years old the whole way through.Significant moments are brushed over and you never get to connect with the characters. It's disappointing because I love so many of these actors.Saying that.. it was entertaining enough for me do my washing/ironing."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 May 2020,3/10,I love watching period movies but this didn't feel real at all. It did not transport me to a different time period. Did not make me feel anything. An underwhelming piece of art. The non-linearity makes it super confusing. Amy is over-acting as a child. I do not buy this 20 something woman as a 13-14 year old child. Only Jo's character is given the screentime to develop and it feels like the other sisters and the mother were just secondary characters.
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,"This film is a masterpiece, was made with such passion and honesty it makes me look differently about the world and gives me hope. This film was set during a time where women, people of color, gays, and transgenders struggled to pursue their passion without facing hardships and rejection but yet this film tells you in an honest and heartfelt way that if you keep going and turn your dreams into goals, you will make it.Thanks to its excellent cast, beautifully crafted screenplay and excellent directing, this re-adaptation of 'Little Women' is a force to be reckoned with.My Grade: A+."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,10/10,"Florence Pugh gave such an outstanding performance! This movie has everything: crying, laughing, sobbing and even more. Get ready for an emotional journey. Also, the production design is beautiful."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,1/10,"A lot of people put it perfectly already. Some of these 1 star reviews are great.
I'm in Hollywood, and I'm so disappointed with it.
This movie is terrible and deserves to fall to the wayside. There's not an ounce of talent or decent work in this film. Maybe a PA out there somewhere, but that would be about it. Greta needs to leave."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,10/10,"Takes a little getting into due to flashbacks, or is it my age? However superb acting, and the story coalesced as it went along. A powerful modern take on the female struggle for a full life in the Victorian era that still resonates today."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,4/10,"Incredibly sentimental, a noble and giving family that gives away their Christmas dinner to an even poorer family with cheer and no one can hold a grudge or anger for more than 48 hrs. I didn't hate it, but the 2+ hours dragged by. I prefer a little sour with my sweet but this movie was just too much sugary live love and goodness for me. I rolled my eyes so much they almost popped out of my head. I didn't care for Ladybird either so it's entirely possible that Greta Gerwig isn't my cup of tea."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,3/10,What could have been an amazing movie was marred by being totally disjointed! Found myself throwing my hands in the air not knowing where the script was going. Merck Streep was lacklustre. Source shone. Loved the beach scenes. Came out very disappointed indeed.
LITTLE WOMEN,13 April 2020,5/10,"The first half of this movie was a hot mess. Jumping around in the timeline so much it was hard to know what was happening when. If you were not familiar with the story already I'm not sure how you would follow at all. The second half settled down and was better. The acting was not great across the board. The dialogue seemed forced, inauthentic and just all over the place sometimes."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 March 2020,10/10,It actually so good and it made me cry...Better than i expected.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,4/10,Why cast four non-Americans for a quintessentially American story?
LITTLE WOMEN,2 January 2020,3/10,"All the characters were really cool and well developed. Also the dialogue in this movie and character interactions were really well done. In spite this it takes more than that to make a good movie. There was no plot it was just two and a half hours of character development. There was nothing to keep me entrapped in the movie. Also it was really confusing because it kept jumping around time lines from the present and future which made it really confusing, and the whole movie I thought that the girl who burned the novel and Amy were different people because in different time lines she looked very different. I was so bored but the things that the movie had it did really well on, it just did not have enough to be entertaining."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,7/10,"As a person learning English as a second language, Little women was the first English book I finished reading as a child and I really did enjoy it and that's why I went to the cinema today. This recent adaptation is the only one I've watched so I'm not sure if those earlier versions were better. I find it rather loyal to the book than other film adaptations I knew and I must admit that it is more vivid than the book as films do. However, it is really not enjoyable for me.The film's timeline would rapidly jump back and forth between the past and the...later past. It seems that the audiences were expected to have read the book thoroughly before entering the cinema, and those who were just looking for something family friendly to watch together on Christmas Day will probably be confused.As others have mentioned in their reviews, the actresses are older than the girls' age in the book, especially Amy. The actress for Amy is really a bit too mature for the relatively childish and a bit spoiled 12 years old little artist. Maybe this has something to do with some recent policy in Hollywood? I'm not sure.Last but not least, it's really not a good idea to follow up character death by something cheerful such as birds' singing in Bambi or in this case, a wedding. It ruins the emotion."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,1/10,This has to be the worst adaptation of Little Woman I have seen. The constant cutting between scenes and timeline gives the film no continuity and is extremely irritating and destroys any character development. I haven't felt like walking out of the cinema since Into The Woods but I almost did with this film. I'm actually annoyed the director has ruined this film imo. I would pay not to see this movie ever again.
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,4/10,"It's a great and warm story being told in movie, I agree. But the way how it's done is so womanish... no logic, almost no senseless chronology, countless and sudden flashbacks just made me feel my mind like a cloth in a washing machine. 4/10. Can not recommend this for majority."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,4/10,"I hated this film. I know all 4 books really well and this was a poor jumbled up mixture of the first three. The flash backs and flash forwards were confusing even though I knew the books. I don't even think the characters were very accurate, Apart from Meryl Streep who as Aunt Marsh was as usual brilliant."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,10/10,"In an era with so much inappropriate and disgusting messages in the movie industry, this movie is an absolute treat for me and my family! Clean--no swearing. No blood or gory violence.No sex references or scenes on any gender. The sophistication and level of beauty of a well-written and well-acted movie is a wonderful change. I encourage those to watch it if you are tired of horrible messages in movies. The only thing is the flashbacks may be hard to keep up, just be aware of filters and other indications of the timeline of the movie to notice if it in the past or present. But found the timeline very necessary and suspenful. Lovely movie for me and my family and can't recommend it enough. :):)"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 January 2020,7/10,"This adaptation of 'Little Women' isn't bad nor great. It was, what my friends and I call, a ""fine"" movie. It didn't over exceed nor fail to meet my expectations in any way.First I'll give my pros then I'll follow that up with my cons.I thought the movie did good in it's casting choice. I feel like everyone fit their parts perfectly (except Timothee Chalamet, however, I'll get into that later). Saoirse Ronan was a great lead in the movie and the support from the actresses playing her sister were believable. Seeing Emma Watson acting as a mother was interesting to say the least, but I wasn't uncomfortable by it. Saoirse Ronan really kills it in the scene where she's talking to her mother, played by Laura Dern, about lonliness and if Jo screwed up by not telling Laurie how she felt about him. The love between Laurie and Amy was believable. Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet had believable chemistry which isn't something that's so easy to have.Cons:I really enjoyed the quiet beginning of the movie and it got me sort of excited to to what I was about to see. Then, in the second scene, the music begins and it was sort of just cheesy cinematic music. The piano in the movie played by beth was beautiful and I don't want to count out the whole entirety of the movie's soundtrack. Timothee Chalamet... he acted in this movie. It didn't knock my socks off but it wasn't bad. He just played the same character he always plays just in a different time period. All the close ups and wide shots of him were fine. It was the long shots when he was supposed to be in his late twenties that threw me off. He's a very scrawny guy, and as in his movie, ""The King"", he couldn't really fit into the costumes very well. It was rather hysterical. However, I'm still excited to see where his newfound popularity in the movie industry takes him.I'd like to talk about the story structure of this film. It was rather confusing for me to follow. I was able to follow when they did flashbacks and when they were telling the story of the present, but it was sort of just thrown around too much and when I was trying too hard to put everything together it took out the enjoyment of watching the movie. The scene where the dad comes home was interesting. In order for the story to continue he had to be in it I get that, however, they sort of just threw him in the movie with a scene of Laurie doing yet another thing for the Little Women. If this movie was restructured to follow chronological order, or at least have the flashbacks a little less sudden, than I feel it would be easier to follow.Last but not least, I feel like they should've just ended the movie with Jo taking the deal of putting in the fictional marriage between her and the professor. After the book gets made and she gets her copy, just fade to black and credits. I didn't need to see the school up and running with a fake ending happening."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,2/10,"I was expecting so much from this adaptation given the very positive reviews but it was completely ruined by the decision to have two parallel timelines interwoven. This does seem to be the gimmick of the moment and spoils so many dramas. Rarely is it a good idea to do this and indeed it proved to be the case here. I would also add that the casting was far from ideal, Florence Pugh's deep husky voice was so out of place as the young Amy. Eliza Scanlen as Beth looked far younger than Amy and was as healthy a terminally ill young woman as I've ever seen. Timothée Chalamet looked uncomfortable as Laurie, not convincing as the love struck suitor of independent Jo. Saoirse Roman and James Norton gave by far the best performances but there were too many issues for the film to be enjoyable. Totally bemused that it has been so highly rated"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 March 2020,5/10,"Costumes are good, acting is good. Quality shot movie but, All they want is to find a husband and nothing else. Sooo boring!"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 May 2020,9/10,"A beautiful amalgamation of love, sharing, caring for each other and responsibilities. Great work by Greta Gerwig 👏🏻👏🏻"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 June 2020,,Beautiful and fascinating love story. 4 sisters finding the love in the middle of a civil war.
LITTLE WOMEN,10 April 2020,1/10,"First off, the title card had no business being where it was. Throwing in the title of the film on a book cover in the middle of basically a chase scene made no sense; It would have made way more sense being in the scene where the book was finally printed. Second, there was zero continuity and the timeline was messy. The constant jumping between timelines made it impossible to figure out what was happening. For example: First Beth is alive, and then she dies, and then the timeline jumps and suddenly she's alive again and it just throws you completely off guard.
Even if these glaring choices weren't in the movie, I would still hate it. Would rate 0/10 if I could."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 May 2020,6/10,"My wife begged me to watch it, and I sort knew what I was getting into. I thought the 2nd half had more drama, but the first half I had a really hard time getting into it. It's just a bit slow for me. I will say beautifully shot and executed with some real character depth. I can enjoy a feel good movie as much as anyone, but this one didn't resonate."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 July 2020,4/10,"I am shocked that this movie received such positive reviews. I found it clunky and unconvincing, to say the least. The majority of scenes were poorly directed/edited, too rushed, and I never felt I was back in the 1800's. Totally lacks the feel of similar English period pieces. Don't bother.......read the book !!"
LITTLE WOMEN,22 June 2020,7/10,"Beautiful sets, costumes and acting but the time changes, especially in the beginning, made it difficult for me to follow. In addition, the actresses looked very much alike, so it was hard for me to tell them apart. Other than that, it was an enjoyable movie. I loved the mother. She was a woman of great character."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 July 2020,2/10,"I thought with the caliber of the cast featured that I would LOVE this movie. Not so much. The constant over lapping dialogue and the back and forth between past and present made it annoying. When the scenes were supposed to make you feel joy or laughter, your left wanting. This particular adaptation of Little Woman was a little on the disappointing side. I turned it off halfway through. It was very dry. That being said, I did enjoy the actresses portrayals of the timeless characters, all but one, Florence Pugh. I honestly couldn't stand her flat, gravely, almost monotone voice. Her performance lacked emotion right along with her voice."
LITTLE WOMEN,30 May 2020,10/10,"I cannot say enough about my love for this adaptation. Greta Gerwig's BRILLIANCE in casting, scriptwriting and storytelling cannot be boosted enough.This adaptation gives fresh light and a spark which other adaptations envy - it is a vision of color, beauty and life lived well.Please, go watch this film from beginning to end with no interruptions - allow every second of it to be soaked up. You won't regret it."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 April 2020,6/10,"I enjoyed this movie but not as much as the one starring Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, and Kirsten Dunst. Maybe I was spoiled by that one but I really liked it better."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 November 2020,4/10,"I really liked the 1994 version of Little Women. 2019 version is poorly casted. I really liked Christian Bale als Laurie. The actor in this version looks way too young.
There was no chemistry on screen between the main characters. Everything went to fast back and forth in time. Don't think I'll watch this version again."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 November 2020,10/10,"Brimming with autumn leaves that shower the countryside, fizzing lines of dialogue that sails back and forth, and alexandre desplat's plucks of strings that conjure a dreamlike spell, little women washes over you as a warm cozy blanket and nourishes you as a swashing mug of hot chocolate.greta gerwig displays the dazzling bewilderment of youth, sprinkled out in uniformed wallops of glowing fantasies. she absorbs louisa may alcott's novel as her own, puppeteering the timelines by overlapping present and past, evoking a sense of memory and a beaming stream of thought. all while doing so, gerwig remains accurate to the pen and ink of alcott. she dissects the two hundred year old words, without unbounding it.saoirse ronan greatly contributes to this everlasting sense of coziness. her sky blue eyes float through every frame, yet her spirit feels entirely grounded to the nature of the story. each and every cast member adds a unique range of emotional color to the mix, but still persist in the same rainbow.jacqueline durran's 'tragically unaffordable' silk, gowns for balls, and tattered garments all splash in warm color. she has loosened the seams of expected period drama costumes, triumphantly adding disorder that allows the characters --and the audience-- to breathe.yorick lesaux's cinematography serves both as an ode the elegant craftsmanship of the era and a sparkle of complexity to the characters. most movies draw thick lines between who is simply good, and who is bad. the lighting, shining with a slight glow, blurs all those character traits, letting moments bleed through time.the symphonic arrangement of these elements combine to conjure a nostalgic spell, while also containing a sense of timelessness. every single moment is gorgeously textured, crafting something that feels as immediate and recognizable as real life. little women is a quilt of memories stitched together by the threads of love, care, and passion."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 April 2021,10/10,"I haven't read the book, but watching this made me want to.Everything about this is amazing. From the background score to the acting, direction and ohh the story line... Mind. Blown.You don't see many movies like this. This one's special. I know all that I'm saying is super vague but idk. Just watch it. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 July 2021,9/10,"First of all, I like to stand out Greta's ability to develop character, some lines in this film sound so much like someone making a description on them, like when you watch a movie and you start to make your mind about a character, but in this one, they say it themselves but she makes it so natural and it's so good for a movie like thisAnd above everything I have no words to say how incredible is the word that she does with the storyline order, like in the book everything is in order and it goes while the little women grow up, in the film she mixes their past and future and it's not confusing at all.Soirse acting is amazing, she is one of my favorites actresess, in the scene that Laurie is saying his feelings for her, everybody talks about how great Timothee was in this one, which he was his performance, especially in this scene, is just heartbreaking, but I just love how her whole face tells a lot like she doesn't need to make a whole big facial and voice thing, her whole face is just really expressive and is just as much heartbreaking for me as is for Laurie seriously.And this film talks about a lot of things, but one that always messes with me is the dreams thing. Like they all are artistic girls and they all have their talents and dreams but I love how it shows the different ways that they deal with it, like how Jo is willing to do everything to be a good writer, and how Meg despite having the dream of becoming an actress she doesn't act on it because she prefers to spend her life with her husband that she loves very much, and how she is really happy with it, and beth is so passionate about music but she is willing to do that just for the people she loves, her sisters. I just love that they show these kinds of differrents relationships with dreamsGreta Gerwig is an absolute genius this movie is as great and special as it is because of her."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 July 2020,4/10,"This version of Little Women includes all the iconic moments of the book and previous movie adaptations on the surface.An all-star cast - check. Orchard House setting in Concord Massachusetts--check. Beautiful costumes and well-loved vignettes - check and check.However, in this retelling (perhaps purposefully), Little Women is stripped of its structure and context to appease a modern audience. In her own words, writer and creator Greta Gerwig believed she was ""grounding"" the screenplay in Louisa May Alcott's mind; yet the movie quickly discards Alcott's upbringing and life experiences.One example is the lack of reference to John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, which served as an illustrative background cited throughout the first half of Little Women. Another notable example is the movie's treatment of Amy. In the book, when Amy burns Jo's manuscript out of spite and vengeance, her apology is heartfelt and simple, ""Please forgive me Jo; I am very, very sorry."" In the movie, Amy's apology includes further dialogue, seeking to justify her actions.Gerwig's choice of ending has garnered a lot of attention and with good reasons. It implies that Alcott's decision to marry off Jo to Professor Bhaer was due solely to pressure from her male publisher. As one who has read Little Women and researched Alcott, this interpretation is an oversimplification. The ending focuses on Jo's/Alcott's ownership and ambition for the novel and its characters. Alcott's purpose was always outwardly focused on the love and care of her family. The novel puts it best, ""Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another."""
LITTLE WOMEN,22 November 2021,10/10,"To see only the movie without first knowing the play / book, I thought it was a very entertaining movie that I enjoyed, all the actors are really great."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2020,8/10,The acting in this film is phenomenal. It's one of those rare gems where every actor/actress outshines the other in their own way. Unexplainable. A must see if you appreciate great acting and incredible storytelling.
LITTLE WOMEN,15 April 2020,10/10,Great storytelling and great cast. One if the best movies in a long time and the best version of this story. Moving and really a piece of art.
LITTLE WOMEN,25 June 2021,5/10,"This movie lacks soul. The casting was too ambitious and I found almost all the characters annoying and one dimensional. They lacked depth. The makers had their heart in the right place but I wasn't impressed overall. I'm a fan of Saoirse Ronan. I remember watching her in Atonement and The Lovely Bones and being extremely impressed but in this movie I didn't feel her performance. Anyhow, I think it's overrated and the hype that came with the well known cast worked to its favor."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,8/10,"The story is similar to the one in the book, including the main events. It's been a while since I read the book so I hope I didn't forget any main event. The actress of Jo is amazing! And the one that plays Amy.
The one thing that disappointed me was that the love story between Friedrich Bhaer and Jo was almost completely neglected! He barely says three sentences in the film, yet we need to understand why Jo is in love with him? In the book their relationship was much more elaborated. And that's too bad."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 March 2020,6/10,It doesn't have the depth of the 1994 version. I did like the actress who played Amy. I was disappointed..I really wanted a better version than 1994. It seamed rushed even though it was over two hours long.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,5/10,"While this version has all the elements from the book, it's all jumbled up. It bounces from time frame to time frame (it starts when Jo is in New York). Amy was mis-cast; the actress's voice was too mature for young Amy. Laura Dern and Meryl Streep portrayed their characters well. Scenery, costumes and music were fantastic but the jumping around took so much away from enjoyment of the film."
LITTLE WOMEN,19 April 2020,5/10,"Did anyone believe Laurie loved Jo? Or that Amy loved Laurie? At times I felt as though the script was very rushed, and they were just speaking their memorized lines. The 1994 version had it all (I really felt the connection between the family and the romantic relationships), and perhaps the world didn't need another remake. I have never left a review on IMDB, but I had to for this movie as I do not agree with the overall high rating."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 January 2020,10/10,"I love that greta's version of tells us more about the sisterhood, family, and being a woman. the romance between jo and march is still there, too, but it's not the first thing you see or feel when you watch the movie (for me at least). amy is still annoying as ever (just like in the 1994 version), but i love that meg and beth have more spotlights in this version, too. every words were written beautifully and touching. i love every single words that coming from each characters. i love how this movie ends, too, it's much happier and realistic. i love that its 2h15m long because i feel like greta is rushing to tell us the stories but she really took her time without boring us (me) at all.i didn't expect to love this movie that much considered that i really love the 1994 version, but this movie has the same stories and characters but i feels fresh and warm for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 March 2021,7/10,"I dont know what I expected, but I loved the 1994 version and was afraid of what they would do to the story in a reboot. But this movie was actually great. It seemed even more heartfelt and intense than the first. The bonds between the characters is very believeable and you really get to feel their heartaches, thrills and frustrations. The acting is as expected with the cast - they're great."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,"I have seen every film and TV version of Little Women since I was four. I've read the book 5000+ times and have a favorite copy of the book. I grew up watching the 90s film version with Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, etc, and my mom and sister and I watch it every Christmas together. But THIS adaptation.... This one is the very best, out of all of the adaptations. I just saw it today with my grandmother, and I cried, both happy and sad tears, all throughout this film. It is TRULY the adaptation that Louisa May Alcott would be so proud of. I loved how Greta did this. The cast was phenomenal, the music in it... Everything. Everything was amazing. I, like many others, went into this film already having a favorite adaptation, and I'll be honest, I was a teensy bit skeptical about whether this would be better than my favorite. But oh, it was. And this adaptation will now always be my favorite."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,2/10,"I grew up watching the 94' version with Sarandon and Ryder and I had high expectations for this new film. What a let down! Ronan was the only positive in the entire movie, she did a brilliant job with a mediocre script. There were so many details left out or wrong that throughout the movie I was clenching my fists in anger. I love the book, the story of how each of these little women grow up and learn through trial and error... this is all lost in this movie. It bounces back and forth, Amy is much too old and the character is absolutely ridiculous because of the age difference, we find out little to nothing about Laurie, and Jo and Bhaer don't even spend any time together?! This movie was a mess from the beginning and it could have been great with a few changes in casting and by not altering the original story. Poorly done!"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,8/10,"While the start was very slow, and despite being perhaps not the target demographic (being a man), I really got into it by the end. An exceptional story, with some fantastic performances from the cast. Would watch again."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,7/10,"Prior to seeing this movie, the extent of my knowledge of the book was from the TV show Friends. So i didn't know a lot but i love Timothee Chalamet and Saiorse Ronan. Great acting and enjoyable film however i thought the meta narrative. I didn't know (until after) whether this was how the book was written but thought throughout the film that this would be better as a chronological narrative. That said, i am looking at this from a completely ignorant perspective. This is the sole adaption that i have seen and i haven't read the book and i can't fault a shake up on the many previous adaptions. The acting was flawless and i was pleasantly surprised by the actress who plays Emma. I forget her name."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,9/10,"I just sat with my mom in a theater full of women and we all smiled, laughed, and boo-hooed through the whole movie. They take the classic story and tell it in a new and unexpected (and delightful) way. This captured what so many versions fail to capture which is the CHARM of the March sisters and Marmee and Laurie and Mr. Lawrence and all the characters we know and love! When I saw the trailer I wasn't sure it would really capture it, and I wasn't immediately thrilled by the choices of cast, but the movie was a joy to sit through and the cast was perfect!
READ THE BOOK (I must insist) and then go check out this movie with your best pals"
LITTLE WOMEN,11 March 2020,7/10,"Decent adaptation, i enjoyed the new 2019 version,
but i have several problems with it.First of all - all girls seem to be the same age. In 1994 version it was obvious who were older who were younger. Especially confusing was Amy in this new adaptation. She looks almost as one of the oldest sisters, so you find it strange why she can't go to theater with others or is treated well. When in 1994 version (12 year old) Dunst has her outbursts, it seems rather natural, she's still a child, she can't control her emotions and her selfishness, she's still learning how to do that. You can't even be really mad at her, she's kind of charming. While in new version Amy's same actions come across as truly mean!  Yet in the second part of the movie she is definitely better than Samantha Mathis (in 1994). Mathis is so stiff and cold you can't understand why Laurie stays with her. So yes, this lack of age difference between girls is for me the biggest problem with this adaptation.Second major weakness, in my opinion, is professor Bhaer. There's no kind of chemistry between him and Jo, he's cold, stiff, completely dead character. Even somewhat unpleasant, you don't feel like you want to be in the same room with him. Also.. such a bore! Gabriel Byrne (from 1994) has that something, you can see that inner spark, you can see what connects them with Jo, what is fascinating her. His brilliant mind, poetic spirit and also the warmth and kindness of his soul. Also must be said Byrne character is truer to the original book, where he is middle aged man already when they meet with Jo.I kind of liked new Beth, her very timid nature. I liked this movie showed more of her relationship with old mr.Laurence. Yet in this adaption it seemed she was ill and dying from the day she was born, as if she had no day in her life feeling well.Bale vs Chalamet - both are good. Bale was especially good match with Winona Rider, both being so wild, passionate and fair amount of crazy! Chalamet has more languid charm, but perhaps it's a good match with Saoirse Ronan. Bale might have just stole the show. Maybe. Chalamet seems to be a better match for Amy, and you don't feel really that sad seeing them getting married.
Winona Rider vs Saoirse Ronan - i love them both! They both are perfect in that role, both bringing something new to this character. Very strong and smart female leads, fabulous actresses! Much love to them!What i liked in 2019 version were scenes exploring more of Megs life after wedding. You can see her daily struggles and doubt creeping in on rainy days if she really made a right decision marrying John. It's so lifelike, so real. And very thought provoking, it's not always happily-ever-after even if you marry the one your heart and soul chooses.
Yet in general, Emma Watson doesn't come across as the oldest of the sisters, she doesn't have that subtle maturity what we see in 1994 Meg. To be honest her character in that film is rather forgettable.Laura Dern vs Susan Sarandon - both great choices!
As well as Meryl Streep and Mary Wicks as Aunt March.Another general confusion with new adaptation, it's not clear at all that Marches are doing financially not so well, or that Laurences are much better off, which was so clear in the 1994 adaptation. When Marches make decision to donate their Christmas morning meal to the Hummels (2019), you think what's the big deal, why are they even thinking so long about it. It doesn't feel like sacrifice at all.All this said, i still enjoyed this adaptation a lot! It has many new angles to the story and characters, which was a pleasure to watch.
Yet i must say Gillian Armstrong's ""Little Women"" from 1994 stays as my favourite. It's just perfect."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,2/10,A bunch of overrated actors playing a neverending and really boring piece of...
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,3/10,"Another movie with so much political on it.
I really tired of Ideology , Feminism , etc. On everything."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 February 2020,1/10,"This flick was so boring that I had to stop it about 1/3 into it. Aside from boring, how utterly disgusting to see young females experimenting and exercising their emotions such that they work toward perfecting an approach to having their base, ugly emotions lead, the mouth and rest of their bodies following."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,1/10,"I was really looking forward to Little Women but after sitting through what seemed like hours I left the cinema feeling quite let down. I knew nothing about the story having never read the book, nor have I seen previous film adaptions. My main gripe is that this particular version kept going back and forth between the past, present, and future making it nigh impossible to follow what on earth was going on. It felt like a chore to watch this movie and I suspect fans of the book or previous adaptations may enjoy it more than myself as they may be able to follow the plot (if there is indeed a plot). I really wouldn't recommend this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 March 2020,1/10,"Ok, I really do not understand what is good about this. Yes, we get it women had a tough time in those days. But besides that ....? There is NO plot, NO climax, NO surprise. What a waste of time."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,9/10,This is hands down the best adapted for screen version of this beautiful book. It follows it closer and the way they work the timeline actually makes the original story simpler to understand. I think a big part of it is that the actresses/actors all seem to be Intelligent enough that they actually had read the book before their performance. It really shows that they seem to know their characters. Plus the casting in and of itself is perfect.
LITTLE WOMEN,4 March 2020,7/10,"Another good adaptation of the classic story of Little Women which has been made into a film and a TV series many times before this. Although the story was familiar, it was enjoyable to watch this film. Some great casting choices such as Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet. Greta Gerwig is a great director, too. I'm giving this film a 7 just because the story isn't anything mindblowing or life-changing but I still did quite enjoy this adaptation."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 March 2020,5/10,"Its just all over the place, I tried to keep my eyes on this film but could't help it I just fell asleep. Perhaps this film should be played by other actresses???
I don't know. I'm sorry, its just bored."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 December 2020,6/10,"The need to be ""different"" and slice and shuffle the storytelling was bewildering and took away from the emotional buildup viewers get from any other version of the movie (I'm partial to 94 version) or the novel. Laura Dern's portrayal of marmee was nothing like an actual woman of the era would have behaved. You don't get the sense of the how close the girls were the way it's presented... in real life their parting was as they became adults, but the movie starts out with them already parted, and even as someone familiar with the novel and the other movies I was constantly confused about where we were in the timeline (related to Beth). Casting was a bit questionable age-wise - Laurie looked like a teenager throughout, younger than all the girls except Beth. The location was pretty flawless, and captured where the Alcotts actually lived fairly well.
I just hated all the time hopping. I wanted to love the movie (and bought a copy because I assumed I'd watch it as much as I watch the other versions, it ruined it for me."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,6/10,"This was very good. By all means a well made, well written and shot adaptation. But for me it didn't even come close to the '94 version with Winona Ryder. Each character was phenomenal in that old version, especially Claire Danes as Beth and Christian Bale as Laurie. Also the unforgettable Winona Ryder, of course, and Susan Sarandon. Kirsten Dunst as Amy...oh my goodness, absolutely exquisite.
Even though I enjoyed watching the new version, my preference remains firmly with the old. Though more simply told, perhaps, without flashbacks back and forth and fancy effects, to me it was richer in emotions and with much more memorable, more 'colorful' characters.
I enjoyed watching Amy in the new version, I just didn't understand why she was never little?... She was this mature woman both as a kid and an adult...very strange.
Anyway, you won't regret watching this, for sure. I just doubt I'll ever see it again. Whereas the '94 version I could watch another ten times, with pleasure. I guess that says it all."
LITTLE WOMEN,14 October 2020,3/10,"The story constantly jumps to different points in time, making it a chore to piece things together. That chore isn't too daunting, but with such a shallow screenplay and simplistic portrayals of each character, that task easily overshadows any enjoyment you might get from the film."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,"I was a little hesitant going in to see this movie as the 1994 version has been so dear to my heart❤.
To say I was pleased is an understatement!
Not only is this a brand new take on a beloved classic, it's visually stunning, superbly acted, and any minor adjustments in sequence and plots in no way diminishes or strays from the incredible characters Alcott gave us!
Just amazing!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,1/10,"There was so much goodness in the book that was left out or inaccurately portrayed in this film. It is not worth watching and if you know the story, it is an exercise in frustration to watch the movie. I hated the style of direction...the incongruity. Very badly done."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,10/10,"Little women is one of the best movies of the year.
The movie follows 4 sisters with different instincts for art. But it's not only that folks, this movie also made me laugh and cry in a glimpse of seconds and that's what a expect from a great masterpiece, it reflects a time when women couldn't follow their dreams in life and couldn't make their own way into it.
Honestly, this movie is so sensitive and complex at the same time with the most beautiful open shots you can imagine, great editing and beautiful direction!
If I could I would give a higher rating for little women"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,8/10,"I did like this movie but I definitely liked the original one better. I also usually like when movies flash back to the pass and then come back to current but in this particular one I found it somewhat confusing (even with me already knowing the plot). I also really missed some of the parts of the original movie that were not included in the new version. Like the really young Amy, this movie had the same actors playing all ages. There's also not very much storyline for Joe and Friedrich, which I felt was very important during the first one to explain Joe's character and path.It's was still a really good movie but I will probably just watch the original again, not this version."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,8/10,I was reluctant to see yet another version of Little Women but Im glad I did. Its honest and charming the best adaptation of it thus far. Very enjoyable and the best Jo by far!!!!
LITTLE WOMEN,18 March 2020,10/10,"Fantastic play, one of the very best of the decade definitely"
LITTLE WOMEN,31 January 2020,9/10,"I went to see this movie with low expectations, but thorougly enjoyed it.It is very moving, brilliantly acted."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 March 2020,7/10,"Beautiful, nice performance by Thimothee and Saoirse, but I still like the version by Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, Kristen Dunst, Claire Danes and Christian Bale much more. It came more to my heart, I cried more 🙈"
LITTLE WOMEN,25 June 2020,1/10,"I felt no sincere feeling or acting in the characters. I think the only part that was decent was the Laurie/Amy scenes, but so many get contrived and fake happy. Didn't enjoy it."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 May 2021,2/10,"Unlike most of the other reviews here I went into this movie with a fresh viewing lens, having never read the book or seen the 94 version. I do however adore period movies and can quote many of them word for word.I am beyond flabbergasted at most of the awards this movie is getting. Did we watch different movies!? BEST PICTURE? Best Supporting Actress for Florence??? Whilst watching I visibly cringed at the character Amy who clearly was meant to be a child.These amazing actors are poorly casted. Many of them are truly riveting in their other works- Timothee and Emma for eg, yet, in these characters I get nothing from them. How can Emma be cast as the eldest with 2 grown kids? How can we believe that Jo was in love with Friedrich?? The ending felt so choppy and underwhelming that I felt compelled to go watch the 94 version immediately after to try to understand the story.My oh My what a stark difference!! How can this 2019 version have more screen-time and say far less? My disdain only grew as I realized what an amazing story it really is and how much disservice was really done."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,6/10,"Okay. I've never read Louisa May Alcott's novel, but I'm a huge film fan and have seen the 1993 version (3 times) as well as the 1930's Katherine Hepburn version and this effort pales in comparison. The film's structure is a mess. Flashing back and forth often confused me and many of the scenes were rushed and poorly edited. The relationships between Jo and Laurie and Jo and her Frenchman were totally undeveloped and as a result how could anyone care about their outcomes. The work of the cast was fine, but not as good as Sarandon, Ryder, Danes, Bale, Stoltz, Byrne, etal. from the '93 version. Streep was excellent as always, but her's was a relatively minor character. The fault lies here with Gerwig's direction and the editing. I highly recommend watching the '93 version, which was directed, I believe, by Gillian Armstrong. That is a classic."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 June 2021,5/10,"For someone who loved the book, I found the movie extremely hard to watch for a couple reasons. The biggest reason is the chronology. If you have never read the book, certain scenes would be rather confusing. Secondly, Amy was absolutely miscasted. She was far too old to be playing the youngest sister and her acting was terrible."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 January 2020,10/10,"This was my favourite childhood read and I went to the cinema in full 'critic mode'. But I was absolutely blown away, enchanted, laughed and cried and remembered why I so loved this story. Casting was perfect, music, cinematography divine."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,8/10,"Very good performance by all crew, especially Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh. The melancholy that Timothee has added to Laurie's character gives it a sincere darkness that makes the character and his behavior more believable. Florence's dual character in the story, both as a young girl as well as a lady are portrayed well.
Laurie and Amy's character bring coherency and strengthen the story.
The lack of unnecessary dialogue, especially in the romantic scenes have been a more befitting choice, especially between Laurie and Amy where we see a skip in the dialogue, replaced by silence. Joe's ""I tried and I failed"" gives a good explanation, a good add-on to her reasons for her decision and a good complication to her later changing her mind. Her disappointment upon hearing the news is fantastic. This is More believable and tangible. I'm comparing it to the unnatural joy of Joe in The previous Version.
Comedy well incorporated and funny.
A little slogan in the end about domestic struggles. Good point, but Decreases the naturalness of the scene.
The movie does address the fact that the ending was not intended by the writer herself in an audience-pleasing manner. Still pleasant for its genre.
And we must not overlook the good music composed for this movie that suits the scenes well."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,10/10,"I don't generally write reviews, I don't remember the last time I written a review on IMDb or if at all tbh. But reading some of the low reviews baffled me.The linear structure is really easy to grasp if you pay attention. Maybe you sneezed or was playing on your phone for a bit or looked down while eating your snacks or went on a potty break.Here's an assistant guide to watch the movie:The past: Vibrant warm colors on screen, the hairstyle of the actresses esp Jo March is down.The present: Darker, cold color tones. The hair is up esp Jo March.But if you watch the transitions you should generally be able to differentiate the past from the present without even the guide. But the guide should be able to reinforce hahaThe two timelines made the movie so refreshing! A remake that makes me forget it's a remake. Every one on this production team deserves an Oscar nomination. Greta did it again. Pugh was not believable as a child but was great as the adult Amy. Laura was a great mom! Timothée played a great Laurie! Emma was a great Meg! Eliza was a great Beth! Saoirse was a super great Jo! Watch this great movie, you'll be rewarded with tears, laughters, and hugs"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,10/10,"Brighter color tones, longer hair/short haircut (esp Jo) means it's in the past. Darker tones, hair up: means the movie is in the present.It's so easy to follow, so I hope this help.Awesome movie and awesome cast. Remake didn't feel like a remake because Greta did it so well!"
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2021,8/10,"I have no experience with the source material, but for me this film almost achiveved true greatness, had it not been for it's wholesome, created ending. The drama of the girls were actually there, but this romcom-like salvation felt out of place and created. It was really a shame, because the characters were great, the storyline, and (especially) the way the story was represented (in multiple timelines) was great. The editing to me was sometimes a bit too rushed, but overall I get it they didn't want a 3 hour monstrocity to be the end product. So: really good, almost great film. Worth a watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,7/10,Other than the fact that the actress playing Amy wasn't believable to be a 12 yr old at any point I really enjoyed it. It was fairly accurate to the book and I liked there take on mixing some of the authors actual challenges while publishing the book.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 April 2020,4/10,"The Good: the costuming, cinematography and story.
The Mediocre: the casting. There is no chemistry at all between actors. Feels very disjointed. The acting: believe it or not, I found the acting to be poor and unbelievable. Even Meryl Streep is so-so.Bottom line: I found it rather boring and disjointed while the acting poor to mediocre."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 June 2020,10/10,"I didn't know anything about the book before watching it and I was so shocked on how powerful this movie was. The ending was done so beautifully that I couldn't get annoyed by the fact that Jo also got married in a way, because we were shown that it wasn't actually the reality of their true story...I just don't know how to express how I'm feeling now... empowered and happy I think! I could relate a lot to Jo and everything about every single character was so genuine and familiar."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,10/10,"I was hesitant about seeing this version because I love the 1994 version and Little Women is one of my favorite books, but this version is a must see."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 August 2020,6/10,"I love this story, and I very much enjoyed the 1994 version, this version has excellent acting but the back/forth in time simply does not serve the story well. I'm not sure what motivated them to try that technique here but this would be a fine film without it."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 February 2020,3/10,"I have read the book and found the film an unfathomable mess. It seems to be another one of those films made of a classic story in which the director is seeking to prove how they can ""Modernise"" an already great story. I understand that it moves backward and forward in time, but the characters in this film never seem to change with the passing of years ,(the father seems to appear and disappear at will). I feel it could have been a great film with a bit more care paid to the plot, instead of which it just seems to be another one of those films ""Brought up to date"" because it is thought that a young audience needs help to understand the way things were done in the era when the book was written."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 January 2020,3/10,"I might be the only person to feel this way, but I did not enjoy this film.
For starters I was not a fan of the disjointed timeline. The movie starts with Jo visiting a publisher and then travelling back to visit her sick sister Amy. From here the the movie constantly switches from Jo's current situation to flashbacks of her childhood, making it a bit hard to follow. With all the jumping back and forward in time you don't clearly get to see the girls grow up and their relationships develop, and a lot of the stories from their childhood seem rushed.
Also, Jo's love for Frederick is not convincing. You don't get to see their relationship develop as they get barely any screen time together. The movie shows them meeting for the first time, arguing over her stories, then next thing you know they are in love.Overall I was disappointed with this remake."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 July 2021,9/10,"An absolutely lovely film that demonstrates the transition from childhood into womanhood with both grace and realism. Sobbed through the beginning of the second half right through the end. One of the most realistic portrayals of life as a young woman I have ever seen, and Jo was particularly relatable."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 January 2020,4/10,A bunch of women whining about their circumstances rather than the strong women I grew up loving. Acting sounded like a dramatic reading rather than believable. The formidable Aunt March was reduced to a high paid walk on. First half confusing unless you are a fan of the book because it flashes back and forth so you only get glimpses rather than true character development. Watch 1994 movie or masterpiece theatre miniseries instead.
LITTLE WOMEN,5 November 2020,3/10,"Having watched and loved the 1994 ""Little Women"" film, I was able to follow the story line. My husband however, was completely lost with the backwards and forwards movement through time. The ages of the actors and actresses are not suited to their roles. Amy March seems ridiculous behaving like a ten year old when her voice alone gives away that she is certainly an adult. On the other hand Laury looks far too young for the role. Then there is the matter of the script... the talking is so fast paced that it feels they answer each other before the other person has even finished their statement, giving it a very scripted feel. The script is also very poor in some places. Meg calls her husband a ""poor boy"" which seems very out of place. There is no depth developed with the characters. Everything seems frivolous. The characters have also been changed and are almost dislikable, which I never felt in the previous version. For example, Amy's apology to Jo is shockingly unremorseful. Weak execution of the story, weak acting, weak script."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 January 2020,9/10,"It has a very strong dramitical story along with a cute love triangle story.Also after some incidents there is a happy part.This film is about life and opportunities,limitations and dreams and reality .Overall, it's cute family story which gives one pleasure and also it has a nice kind of happy ending."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,4/10,"I don't understand why she had a whole speach about how 'women aren't just about love.. and beauty'. When practically in the same sentence, she accepted the ending of the story by her character getting married??????????????? I mean what????? (I haven't read the book, but I can't possibly understand how this is supposed to make women look good?)
The order (flashbacks) were also a bit confusing at times, and some scenes were a bit odd and had no explanation or reason for being there.
I would also like to note that Meryl Streep and Laura Dern were amazing and deserved more screen time."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 April 2020,6/10,"Story jumps around to inconsistently, poor photography, Saorse and Timothee though are particularly good. All feels too theatrical and dull!"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,2/10,"Wow. What is happening to the movie critics these days? This was an awful film, and they didnt even notice. Is this what is taken for art these days? Firstly, the writing was incredibly poor and the dialogue stilted and unnatural, likely because it reflected the book too literally and was not adequately adapted to a movie screenplay. Secondly, the direction was very poor. There were major gaps in the plot making it seem incoherent at times. It left the viewer disoriented. Thirdly, the acting was only fair to midling. These are lightweight actors and they did nothing to anchor a poorly written screenplay. The only good parts were the costumes and cinematography. I love period piece dramas. This was my first Little Woman experience. But sadly, this was a waste of a couple of hours."
LITTLE WOMEN,9 January 2020,3/10,"I went into this having never read the book nor ever seeing any previously filmed versions. I left confused. Confused as to why it has been getting such good reviews and also confused by the narrative.
My understanding of the story based on what I saw is that of an affluent family of four adult women who are envious of their more wealthy neighbour who takes pity on them for some reason. One of the women gets sick and then gets better but then seems to mysteriously die. There is a teenage boy with whom a couple of the women seem to have feelings for. There is snow on the ground in many scenes but nobody is cold. Oh and one of the women meets a guy with a French accent once and then he appears in the future and they decide to be married.
After reading comments here it seems I got it all wrong. That could be my fault as I felt my mind wandering at times. Or it could be the way the movie was structured. The whole film takes place as a series of short scenes in a seemingly random order. This means (at least for me), there was no character development at all. I spent a lot of time wondering where in the timeline of events each random scene was supposed to be taking place. I honestly don't understand the need for telling the story that way. Perhaps that's how it is in the book but I don't think it works the way it was put together here.
I might enjoy this movie more once I am familiar with the story but as an introduction to Little Women, it didn't work for me I'm afraid."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 February 2020,10/10,"The movie I have truly enjoyed watching in 2019. Compelling adaptation by Greta Gerwig. Great ensemble of actors with strong chemistry (lots of Oscar winners & nominees too). Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh were standouts and worthy of their Oscar nominations. Timothee Chalamet was so charming as Laurie - perfect for the role. The costumes and musical score were brilliant. A feel good, smart, funny and warmhearted movie which was just a pleasure to watch. I wish Greta was nominated for the directing part as she deserved it."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"Delightful, smart, and worth seeing. Little Women is one of my 10 favorite books-I've read it several times. I came to the film with high hopes and was not disappointed. The music deserves mention. Loved it."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,9/10,"My only wish for this movie is that it would be longer. It was a true delight - lovely cinematography, music and gosh the wrITING. Awesome acting as well. Can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig directs next and what the actors will go on to be in."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 January 2020,10/10,"Greta gets over each movie, I hope Barbie reaches the level of her predecessors."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 March 2020,5/10,"I really regret paying for this movie. The acting is decent, that's about it. I had really hoped this was going to be a harrowing tale of female empowerment during the American Revolution. Instead, it's just another repetitive, boring, predictable, sappy hollywood love story. There was too much emphasis put on the relationship with Laurie. Too much interaction with men. I wanted to see how women interacted with each other, in society, in their day to day. The struggles and stigmas they faced. I was hoping to hear great monologues about the oppression women faced at the time and perhaps a passionate firing up that would lead to the women's rights movements of modern times.
There's more to a woman's story than who she falls in love with and who she marries. I was expecting a lot more from this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,10/10,"This is the most artistic movie I have ever watched and the perfect way to end the year. From the jumps between childhood and adulthood ,which makes the story easier to understand; to the outstanding cast who couldn't have been better selected, this is a movie worth seeing.
Amazing performances from Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, and others. The cinematography was good and the way she gives all the childhood scenes a gold tint was very clever. To top it of, Alexandre Desplat composers another beautiful soundtrack.
Overall it's a heart-warming, highly quotable, 10/10 family movie worth the watch."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 December 2020,9/10,The only thing I feel watching this movie is love and more love
LITTLE WOMEN,16 December 2019,5/10,"Wanted to like this film so badly. The sets and costumes are beautiful as well as all the actors, but the performances are lacking. So much over acting and yet by the end of the film you can't get yourself to care about any of them. None of the characters are really developed so at the end none of the couplings make sense. Real shame, lots of talent."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,1/10,"If you've read the book you might like this film. But if you haven't it's pure torture that seems to run forever. There's no clear plot or direction, just random segments assembled without reference to chronology. After battling to stay awake for hours I left the theatre asking myself ""what was the point?"""
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,10/10,Very interestingly good you will fall in love with all the characters and its sticks to the original idea with some of it own doings 💡😀
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,7/10,"I really enjoyed this film and almost found myself missing it once I left the cinema - it really did capture the homely feeling that you experience when reading the book. However, I found the male characters (except Laurie) in the film to be somewhat cardboard, especially the girls' father and Frederick. I personally thought that the difference in scenes from the present and past was made clear, however others who watched it with me said that they did not think this was made clear enough at some points. Emma Watson's acting was also not her best, however this was balanced out by Saoirse Ronan who was brilliant as always. A 7/10 at least and would definitely recommend watching."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,1/10,"This was probably one of the most poorly casted movies I've ever seen. The acting felt extremely forced and you felt no attachment to the characters. If I hadn't grown up watching the other version with Susan Sarandon and Wynona Ryder, I would have no idea what the birth order was (a huge part of the story) or even what was going on in general. The flashbacks make everything confusing and leave no room for character development. The scenes that were meant to be powerful and emotional were cringe worthy. Part of the what makes Little Women such a beloved story is watching these girls grow up and seeing how each one of their dreams, personalities, and value of family make them into the women they grow up to be. None of these characters were likeable!!! And don't even get me started on Marmi.Jo writing a letter to Laurie about wanting him back? Where did that come from? It just made the story weirder and Amy wasn't even sorry! Friedrich and Jo barely spend any time together and then she's running after him in the rain? Nothing made sense. Amy had to be at least 10 years older than Beth which made everything uncomfortable, especially when Amy was running around like a 12 year old but she's actually 30. And yes, Beth is supposed to be a quiet character, but in this version she doesn't even have a personality. So much so that her death hardly makes a dent in the plot of the story. There was also no actual evidence that the March family was poor (a huge part of the story), and as it progresses, the plot becomes much more about making money and less about the risks and bravery it requires in finding your identity as a woman in society."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,3/10,"When something is unrealistically depicted, I get annoyed and then lose interest. The false narrative of blacks and whites socializing together in Concord Massachusetts in the mid nineteenth century is ridiculous: a scene with blacks and whites at a dance in Concord. Really? Then in another scene of the busy N.Y.C. streets, they are shown dressed in fine clothing. I wish our history was as egalitarian as that at that time or even 100 years later. Another incongruous detail is in the attic of the so-called poor March family. This is where the March sisters put on their improvized skits. On the wall of the attic is an elaborate curtain arrangement, when one of the sisters couldn't afford the fabric for a new dress.Then at the end when Jo March had become a successful author, she opened a progressive school, that was shown to be integrated. If you want to believe that, look at the history of even the very liberal and progressive Oberlin College, which had its own resistance to racial integration throughout the nineteenth century.Let's not sugar coat history to make the story line more compelling."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,2/10,To much time jumping and grandstanding. Doesn't do justice to the story.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,1/10,I am so upset with this film. Great acting but the storyline was ruined. The ending of this film was unbelievably disappointing.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,10/10,"This adaptation of the classic novel might be the best one yet.
It's joyful and fresh with amazing performances from every single cast member especially Saoirse Ronan and this year's best discovery Florence Pugh
Don't want to say more go check it out you won't regret it"
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,10/10,"Okay... I've never written a review but I needed to for this! This is one of the lovliest movies I have EVER seen!!! Me and my mom cried through the whole thing! If you are considering seeing this please do, it is amazing and hartwarming! (Bring a box of tissues!)"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,1/10,"Shame on Frozen and Disney for ruining anything dealing with romantic love. This version is not what Alcott intended at all. And when has loving someone become so horrific? Changing words and adapting it so it looks as if romantic love of another human being, whether it be a man or a woman is so incredibly wrong? Too bad Hollywood hasn't fallen into the ocean yet. DO NOT WASTE S SECOND ON THIS FILM!!!"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,2/10,"I went to this movie expecting something truly exceptional, given the multitude of fawning reviews over it. I was profoundly disappointed. This film is so inferior to the 1994 adaptation of the novel that it would be laughable but for all the fawning reviews that lend to this film a misleading impression of great merit.In her attempt to produce a ""hip"" retelling of the novel, Gerwig completely trashes it. Her overtly political, in-your-face script loses all the nuance that makes Alcott's novel both powerful and timeless. Gerwigs hits you over the head with a sledgehammer of feminist tropes while eschewing the complexity and richness of treatment that lies at the core of the Alcott novel.It does not help that the script utterly fails to develop any of the romantic relationships. Friedrich (who, inexplicably, has a French accent) pops up at the end for a romantic liason with Jo that comes out of nowhere. Meg's and Amy's relationships are similarly bereft of developed foundation. This may in part be explained by Gerwig's affected contrivance of telling the story through a mishmash of flashbacks that leave one's head spinning as to where in the world we are and what time frame we are in. It is an abject failure as a plot device.On top of all this, the film is poorly cast. The actors who play Meg and Jo regularly break into their native British accents, destroying any illusion of authenticity. The male characters are especially weak. Timothee Chalamet is just not credible as Laurie, while the aforementioned Friedrich would have been a little more believable had he at least been given a German accent. The actor is also far too young to play the middle-aged character of the novel. Laura Dern fails to impress as Marmee, though her performance is also hampered by Gerwig's wince-inducing script. The only actor who comes across well is Saoirse Ronan, but even she is let down by the screenplay.Anyone interested in a proper adaptation of the novel should watch the 1994 version instead. It may not be ""hip"", but it sure has substance that this film lacks."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,3/10,"I feel compelled to write a review as I am genuinely shocked by the generous reviews this film has received. Little Women is one of my all time favourite stories and even though I absolutely loved the 1994 adaptation (Winona Ryder's Jo is flawless; Thomas Newman's soundtrack is perfection) I was willing to see this new adaptation with an open mind.I was thoroughly disappointed. Greta Gerwig hasn't done a terrible job, but this is not a great film. Saoirse Ronan delivers a good performance as Jo and captures her spirited and forthright nature well. The scenes between Mr Laurence and Beth are lovely and tender. But so much of the heart and substance of the story is lost in the misdirected quest for a stylish period piece.The non linear narrative fails completely and only succeeds in the loss of the development of key relationships and emotional connection. Like Friedrich and Jo; we barely see anything of them together to make the conclusion of their relationship believable. I found their declaration of love, the 'under the umbrella' scene inauthentic as I just didn't by their chemistry or connection. Laurie and Amy. Again, I didn't by their love connection. All we got were scenes of Amy and her puppy love for Laurie, and him being a mess.The end of Beth is coldly dealt with, she deserved more than simply contrasting it against a scene when she was ill before and got better. What makes the end of Beth so gut-wrenching is that we should get to see the true strength off Beth as she accepts her fate; it is lost in the handling of those scenes.And what on earth was Gerwig thinking in having Florence Pugh playing young Amy?! It did not work. She was clearly too old and failed in showing the sweet side of Amy. Also, Timothee Chamalet was completely miscast as Laurie. His interpretation was too whiny and immature. I did not see the growth of his character.I could go on, but the conclusion is, Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women is mediocre and forgettable. It does not live up to the hype. Just because it is directed and acted by the current darlings of young Hollywood, does not make it good. For an adaptation that delivers on acting, heart and substance, the 1994 version is all you need."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,"Amazing performances from all the cast, particularly Timothee Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan. Loved the adaptation, exceeded my expectations by far"
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,10/10,This was a unique take on a classic story that was as heartfelt and cutting as the book. Loved it.
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,9/10,"I absolutely adored this film. Released in Australia on New Years Day 2020, Greta Gerwig's adaptation is an early contender for my top film of the year, and one that will be very hard to beat.This was my first taste of the story, never having previously read Alcott's novel, or seen any of the earlier adaptations, which likely aided my viewing. With no preconceived idea for how the story should go, it was easy to sit back and enjoy this film on its own merits.I don't often enjoy films with jumbled timelines, and this was a concern of mine early on during Little Women. However, Gerwig's script and direction was enough to win me over quickly. Ultimately, I don't think this structure hurts the film, and actually boosts its narrative.This film is required to blend a lot of genres into just over 2 hours. Whether it's the romance, the drama and grief exposed through loss, or the comedy cleverly placed throughout, this film succeeds at each of them. Gerwig delivers a true roller coaster of emotions in this one.The stellar cast assembled for this film should be enough to convince anyone to go see it. The casting of the March children is particularly well done, their on screen chemistry as sisters is essential to the films success.There is a moment early in the film where Meg hurts her ankle dancing. When she arrives home, the hustle to assist her from all the family members is an inspiring moment. In this scene, the cast's abilities are in full show and it leads to an incredible sequence.Of course, it's not all smooth sailing for Little Women. While the film is at its best with the March girls together, it struggles at time when they are alone. These moments offer a slower side to the story, which don't always land as well as they perhaps should.Saoirse Ronan's performance as Jo March is, of course, a standout performance. As the most ambitious of the children, it's a joy to watch her succeed. Although the success is earned, it is a strange feeling when everything goes her way suddenly at the films end.Meanwhile, it was very strange seeing Emma Watson play the role of Meg March. Meg is content to shelve her talent as an actress in favour of settling down with a husband and children. While she does this for love, Watson is the last person I would think of to play that role.Amy March, played by the rising Florence Pugh, is a perculiar character. She strives to be an artist, but seemingly only for the money and fame. At the same time, she seeks marriage as an economic proposition. Despite the vanity though, it's hard not to enjoy Pugh's screen time.Australian Eliza Stanley as the youngest sister, Beth, is perhaps the most surprising performance. Alongside an experienced cast, Scanlen is able to hold her own and streak the scene at various moments. Her performance as a child on her death bed was haunting and impactful.But it is Laurie, played by Timothee Chalamet, who perhaps plays the most crucial role in the film. He is present throughout and seems, at times, unsure of which March sister to pursue. His almost villainous role is helped by a strong performance. He is a blast to watch onscreen.All things considered, Little Women is a wonderful and enjoyable film with incredible direction and design. With a phenomenal cast and crew, it's tough to find anything truly wrong with this film. It's certainly deserving of its many award nominations."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 January 2020,9/10,"Despite being a simple story about a simple family, Little Women became a surprise hit that shook me to my core. There are movies that are good because of their graphics, or cast, or music, but Little Women is fantastic because of its genuinely raw portrayal of how we react as humanity and changed the way I see the world and the relationships I make.I walked in thinking the film would be rather dull, a boring story about a poor family in the middle of Massachusetts doesn't sound all that interesting, but the way Greta Gerwig, the director (also known for other feminist-esque films like Lady Bird and 20th Century Women), shows how every word spoken and create a bond between two people that changes the way one lives for the rest of their lives.You also get so involved in the characters - every action they do is so interesting because, in a world where not much happens, every little thing matters. The reason I walked out of the film in awe is because of its rawness - the way most movies show relationships are not exactly how they work in real life. But Little Women said every thought about love that we never dare to say to others out loud, while also challenging what it meant to be a woman during the Civil War.It's not only the astounding acting that makes this movie top-notch - it's the production. Bringing in so many famous and fantastic actors - Saoirse Ronan, and Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep - to name a few, one would already be able to say the film would be successful.And the set design! The beautiful site it was filmed is already mind-blowing, but the immense attention to detail that makes every meal show so craving you'll be starving by the end of it. With nine nominations in the critic choice awards and a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie definitely knocks it out of the park with critics.All in all, if you're a person who likes action and danger, this movie may not be your cup of tea, but I urge everyone who has emotions (which is everyone, I hope) to see it. It evokes the surreal feeling that we are not so much different than others while also maintaining the simplistic, happy-go-lucky feeling we all yearn to achieve in one way or another."
LITTLE WOMEN,5 August 2020,1/10,"I really tried to watch this movie. But I only got through 38:17 of it before I turned it off. It's slow, jumpy and lacking. Amy March shouldn't be a 30 year old playing a 12 year old; at least they picked two Amy's in the '94 adaptation. I can't stand her blasé attitude. Didn't even figure out the other girls they all seem the same age. I'll stick with the Susan Sarandon/Wynona Ryder version."
LITTLE WOMEN,15 January 2020,4/10,"I love Laura Dern but she was more like the older sister than Marmee. Lipstick and long flowing hair? Her lack of formality when Laurie brought Meg and Jo home from the dance? Also felt Timothy Chalamet was was too young for Laurie. He never seemed right in the part. Also why not have an older actor for Fredrich Bahaer? Why a hunk? Bob Odenkirk as Father March? Snickered at that. Hated the lack of respect to the period details. The hair not put up for Meg and Jo at the dance. Long flowing hair was for children. These were irksome, but I did enjoy the movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2020,1/10,"This film prompted me to download IMDB and leave my first review. I am BAFFLED as to why it's nominated for so many awards.1. The weird timeline.
I get that nowadays not a lot of movies are presented in a linear fashion, and that Little Women has already been presented in chronological order time and again, so kudos to them for trying to do at least one thing differently. And it might have worked if there were clearer distinctions between past and present, or if the order of the scenes at least made sense artistically. All the characters looked EXACTLY the same in both the present scenes and the ones taking place seven years earlier, which was disorienting and made it difficult to tell when we'd jumped to a different time or not. Not only did they not make big changes, such as making any attempt whatsoever to make Amy look younger in the past scenes (she's meant to be 13, but she looks 30! Why not use a different actor?), but they also didn't make subtle changes, e.g. changing their hair slightly or giving Laurie some facial hair when he's meant to be older. It was a miracle when Jo cut her hair because I momentarily had a way of distinguishing which time period we were in. As there were no visual cues, it was left entirely up to the actors to capture the age difference through their performance, which meant we got a 30yo Florence Pugh play-acting as a precocious child half the film, and a 15yo looking Timothee Chalamet play-acting as a drunk/aimless gentleman, looking like a boy wearing his Dad's wedding suit to prom.2. Odd casting
Let's address the elephant in the room...Bob Odenkirk as Daddy March. He didn't do a bad job, but he seemed so odd in the role and it was distracting. Any second I expected him to jump out and yell ""BETTER CALL SAUL!"" That aside, his presence as the patriarch of the family was wasted. We wait three quarters of the film for this man to get back from the war, and when he does he hardly has any lines or personality. I wanted to see the male presence in the house that contributed to who these girls were. We've got four strong daughters here, I think it's safe to say the one male role model in their house probably played an important part in that and I would have liked to see that come together in a way that made more sense. Missed opportunity.
Timothee Chalamet on the surface seems like a good choice for Laurie. He is endearing and has a boyhood charm that is very watchable, plus he seems to be a strong actor (this is the first film I've seen of his). However, I think he was unable to capture some really essential aspects of Laurie's character, such as his loneliness and initial shyness. And by the time he was supposed to have reached manhood, he didn't look different and he didn't really behave any different. I was really hoping that we would finally have an adaptation in which his relationship with Amy finally made sense. Because Laurie's arc is that A) he loves this family and will do anything to be part of it, B) he mistakes the close bond of friendship with Jo for romantic love, and C) he finally learns what love is when he and Amy are in Europe, away from the family and finally free to find their own identity. I wanted to finally see them fall in love organically, but instead it felt very much like the classic old ""well I can't have Jo so her sister will do"". 🙄 . Then, when he tells Jo about his and Amy's relationship and asks if they can still be friends, there was an absolute missed opportunity for Jo to say ""No - because you're my brother now"". AND THEN THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE TOO! Plus it wouldn't be as awkward that he's with Amy now! And all this brings me to my third point.3 Fake Woke-ness
I preface this by saying I am a feminist, and was very much looking forward to seeing a modern adaptation of what is already one of the most powerful stories for, by and about women in all of literature. Instead, I got a couple of cliched bits of dialogue about how marrying is an economic decision for women and an altered ending because LORD FORBID Jo should be a fully rounded woman who learns that she can have both love AND independence 🤦‍♀️ . Changing Jo's ending doesn't make it more feminist, it just robs her of her arc. She's allowed to be stubborn, ambitious and independent AS WELL AS lonely, contradictory and confused because that's how real people are! It's what makes her a whole character and not just a caricature. It was such a tokenistic move. Plus, I resent the fact that they've been promoting this as though it's the ending Louisa May Alcott would have wanted - says who?? It paints her as a fool to assume she wasn't in charge of her own decisions when crafting her novel and ultimately it seems to me that it is the opposite of supportive to undercut her work like this and then patronise her memory.
Also, if this retelling was truly meant to prioritise these women's stories and make them real and relevant, why was Beth still a blip in the plot to make us cry at the climax and essentially nothing more? She still had no personality, hardly any lines, no human flaws or failings that would have made her a real, whole person. I wanted so bad to see her get angry, or to see her get jealous, just once. Like real people do. She's been given a rough lot in life, but we never hear her talk about how she has come to terms with her own mortality, or her fear of the unknown. We don't hear her fears, her triumphs, her bitterness, her resentment. She's just...nothing. Just the perfect little quiet angel and nothing more. And for a movie that claims to be putting women's stories front and centre, it's astounding to me that they would sell Beth's story so short in 2019 the same way all previous iterations have. Another missed opportunity.
The mum was basically the same. I wanted to know how she copes with four girls, no money and the fear that her husband might not come home. Why is she with Mr. March to begin with? How did they meet? Why does she love him? Does she not get lonely and angry and tired? And if so why do we not see any of it?? Can't one of these characters be a whole rounded person?? Is that too much to ask?!
And my final nitpick on the fake woke-ness is the token diversity. There's a weird scene where Marmie and several African American servants are packing supplies for the war. I can't remember the dialogue exactly, but Marmie says something along the lines of ""I used to be quite ashamed of my country"". And an African American woman (this is her only line of dialogue mind you) says ""with all due respect, I think you still got a lot to be ashamed of"".Wow! They went there! Go, Greta Gerwig, you stick it to the white man! Rub their noses in their atrocities! But don't give the black character a name or any more lines or any other purpose than to make you feel like a better ally....Honestly, what were they thinking when they decided to write that in? Are they patting themselves on the back right now for giving one person of colour a line of dialogue?To conclude, I'll list some of my more minor issues:
Emma Watson's accent
No screen time at all was devoted to helping us understand why Meg fell in love with John
Why did they add in Jo writing that letter to Laurie saying she'd marry him if he still wanted? And why did Gerwig think it was cool for her strong, independent Jo to do that, but not end up with the man she actually loved?
It was unclear why Laurie was being so salty to Meg at her debutante. I know that happens in the book, but in the book it's because she's putting on airs and acting like someone she's not. As far as I could tell, in this one she was just having fun and going along with it; she wasn't being snooty or arrogant or anything that would have warranted Laurie's treatment. And it's just little things like that that make me question all of Gerwig's direction. So much of the acting and the dialogue was just missing a naturalness, a reality that would have made it add up. At the end of the day, it felt like acting and it felt like dialogue. That's not a good thing.
The set/costuming/cinematography offered absolutely nothing unique or original to the story. Itwas pretty and there was attention paid to detail in the mise en scene, but there were no striking shots or stand out scenes. It was just kinda basic and uninteresting.Redeeming qualities:
Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep played their roles excellently. Meryl Streep more than any of the other women in the film managed to capture both a sternness and a gentleness, a stubbornness as well as understanding. She made it clear that Aunt March wanted what was best for her family's survival but that she knew these girls would ultimately make their own decisions in life. And she managed to capture the mix of pride and disappointment that that character had - which is just the sort of contradictory quality that real people have and which I would have liked to see in all the other cast members. Because at the end of the day, there's a bit of a battle in all of us and neither side ever fully wins. Meg wants to be a rich society lady with fancy dresses, but she also wants to be a good wife and mother and lead a simple life. Jo wants a career and independence but she also deep down wants human connection and an ending she was promised in all the stories she reads and loves. This is the sort of inner conflict that makes for all the best characters in any story. So why was Meryl Streep, with a role so small and mostly dedicated to comic relief, the only one to achieve this?I was going to give the film 3 stars because 1 seemed harsh, but the more I think about it, the less I can think of how it has earned two extra stars. Because honestly, it hasn't. I wanted so much more out of this film. I wanted a version of Little Women fit for the new decade and I did not get it."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,10/10,"The books of Little Women and Good Wives have the most wonderful characters that are so dear to the hearts of so many people, there have been so many adaptations to film of these books and most have been wonderful however none compare to this version. It has been so well cast, written, directed that it is now without doubt my all time favourite version. I have never rated a film 10/10 but this is the first film that I have ever see that deserves it."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,6/10,"This film of the book Little Women (and its sequel Little Wives) is beautifully shot, and well acted and directed, but some of the adaptation really jarred with me - a fan of the books since childhood. The romance between Laurie and Amy was clumsy and poorly written, whereas in the book it was gentle (apart from Amy's ""despicable"" lecture to Laurie) and poetic. Also, Jo's regret at turning down Laurie's proposal in the book barely existed, but in the film was made into a major story arc. Professor Bauer and his relationship with Jo was poorly depicted in the film, too.
If you don't care about the books, you'll enjoy the movie. If staying true to the books is important to you, this film will disappoint."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,1/10,"Can't believe the injustice of the film why did he marry her, an absolute shambles really. Did like the film up until the last hour or so just felt a bit hard done by with the ending, I mean what's wrong with a happy ending would that really have been so bad."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,1/10,It was the most boring film I have ever watched 1/10.
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2020,10/10,"Normally I don't like movies that are playing at the time of romanticism and impressionism. But this one is incredibly sensitive, the story is captivating, the characters are authentic and the actors are great. The jumps between the different times give the viewer the opportunity to understand actions and their consequences directly, or to understand the cause of events. Really worth seeing!"
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2020,8/10,"Nothing too much and nothing too dramatic. the story is just right in some kind of ways yet it still find a way to stressed me out. andddd i kinda got a nostalgic vibes from this movie that made me think of my past problems! lol i love it overall, not to mention how details are the wardrobes and the art decos. 🌼"
LITTLE WOMEN,11 February 2020,1/10,"The most boring thing ever, i don't know why this thing lasts so god damn long, i gave it a try but fell asleep 5 time (and i was at the movies), you should go and see this film, cuz it will solve all youre insomnia problema, i'll sleep like a horse"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 February 2020,3/10,"It's a beautiful film. Almost perfectly cast. But from insertions of things like a random scene where we are told we should be ashamed of our country to the 50/50 faithfulness to the actual book set out in scene after scene, once again we see someone trading on an American classic with an adaptation that is ruinous for true fans. I'm especially - ESPECIALLY - let down by the last love scene in which the book's heroine has a romantic and private moment that the film adaptation turns into a gossipy, contrived sister scene. UGH.IMO redemptive moments include casting and relationship moments between Beth and Jo. Really loved the casting and performance of Laura Dern as Marmee. And it's beautiful - scene, set, costuming, landscapes.Poor casting of ""young"" Amy forces us to see an obviously mature woman in grade school and being told she's not old enough to go to social events. UGH.Poor casting of ""Teddy"" forces us to watch a boyish actor pretend to be grown up and attempt to woo grownupAmy, whose facial and voice expressions throughout the film are so flat that chemistry with any of the other actors is nearly impossible. UGH.Relationship moments of Jo and her ""Baer"" are nearly all adulterated. UGH.If you haven't read the book you'll soon be lost with the constant flashbacks and forwards of the story. UGH.Overall I'm sad at the treatment of this classic American novel, but not surprised since there has yet to be a truly faithful treatment of this story. Do better."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2020,5/10,"Nice but I didn't have a ""wow"" feeling watching the film."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 February 2020,10/10,"I was waiting for this movie to come out. Mainly because of the incredible cast. So I was expecting a lot. But this film blew me away. I loved it! It had everything in it.The acting was absolutely outstanding. They had the perfect cast for this film. Saoirse Ronan does a phenomenal job with the character Jo. You can relate to Jo and understand her. You get drawn into her life and her family. You can understand the connection that the family has and the strong bond that they have.
The movie feels perfect, everything is right. The atmosphere is very unique and that is what I loved in this movie.So I would say do yourself a favour and go watch it because I think you will not be disappointed"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 February 2020,1/10,"I didn't think it was possible but they managed to turn a beloved American classic tale of family, faith, marriage and self-sacrifice into nothing more than a feminist manifesto albeit in a very pretty package. I was very disappointed. The morals the book teaches are timeless, soul-filling and truly inspiring. This movie seeks only to pursue its own aim of feminist outrage. How destructive and completely disgraceful to Louisa May Alcott, her life's work, and her memory."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 June 2020,4/10,"I'm one of those who have already seen the 1994 version, not only once but countless times. Even then, I gave a fair chance to this movie and watched with an open and unbiased mind yet, it disappointed me immensely on several levels. I bet that anyone who had already seen the 1994 version will never give a high rating to this movie; however, those who haven't seen it can do this since the book is really great. I'm not going in detail but just recommending that do watch the 1994 version of Little Women and then this movie and you'll know the difference yourself."
LITTLE WOMEN,12 March 2020,8/10,"This is my first time to review any movie or series. I usually love reading others reviews. But this time I really felt like sharing my own thoughts!
I really really loved this adaptation by Greta Gerwig. I have to admit that in the beginning of the movie I didn't like it. Cause the way of telling the story was different then I was used to. I have seen the 94 version and the series from 2017.
But then I really loved it!
Here are some things I really liked:1. The actors. I think Saoirse Ronan did an amazing job. And I liked Laura Dern as the mother. And I have never really liked the character of Friedrich, don't know why. But this time I did. That last scene under the umberella was amazing. I think we came to know him a bit more in this adaptation.
2. The realtionship between Amy and Laurie. This version told that story better.
3. How much Mr. Lawrence loved Beth, seeing her as her own daughter. Their story touched my heart.
4. The ending. My heart was so full of emotions when they were printing Jo's book.I cried a lot in this movie. The music, the colors, the seasons, the love and of course the death of Beth. I felt like Joey in Friends when he was reading Little Women, and he understands that Beth is dying.There is one tiny detail that I was struggling with in the movie.
Timothée did a good job playing Laurie, but there was just something missing. I like his character so much, so I think in my eyes Christian Bale will always be the Laurie I think of.Sorry if I did a bad job reviewing this movie. My first time"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 June 2021,6/10,The movie wasn't terrible the 1994 little women is definitely better I kinda found this one hard to follow with all the back and forth it did.
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,10/10,"As someone who does not appreciate constant flashbacks littered throughout a film, I must say that this film has changed my mind on the matter. The strong tone and color contrasts between past and present scenes through the establishment of clear tones differentiating time periods throughout the narrative provided a mesmerizing experience that was satisfying and powerful. In addition to the careful detail of period costuming in this film, Little Women certainly satisfies the history geeks like myself."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2020,3/10,This movie is very confusing because of all the cuts to different periods of time in the story. It is highly overrated.
LITTLE WOMEN,15 April 2020,10/10,One of the best movies I have watched in years. Got to pay attention because it does go back and forth in time. Love Saoirse Ronan
LITTLE WOMEN,18 April 2020,10/10,"The directing of Greta Gerwig was awesome. It's not just a simple feminism movie like any other movies. But this movie has really deep meaning not like other drama genres. I first read Little Women when I was young but I had no feeling about it. After I saw this movie because of these wonderful cast members, (emma watson, timothee chalamet, saoirse ronan, meryl streep, laura dern, florence pugh and etc) I though about this book and movie is talking about. It was a awesome movie. It was one of my favorites and..it's just sooooo wonderful movie for every people"
LITTLE WOMEN,19 April 2020,9/10,"I'll begin by saying I have had absolutely 0 relationship to the little women phenomenon and my only knowledge of it was from a few mentions (and spoilers) from popular 90s sitcom ""Friends"". Luckily it was a long time ago and I hadn't remembered a single spoiler. I also knew that it had a cult like following and was dearly beloved by woman who demographically are less represented in popular culture. Myself, being a man I hadn't considered this story or collection of characters to be up my alley of interests and ashamfully so. I decided this Oscar season that I would watch every movie nominated in the best picture category. This being a lower anticipation to most of the movies on the list I left it until second last (only ahead of Ford v Ferrari). The movie locked me in the moment Jo accepted the sale of her story with the revisions she hadn't wanted. I was hooked. I was locked in. Never for a second after was I out of this movie. From every single performance, the score, the costume design, the characters Louisa May Alcott had created or adapted. From the masterful direction from a director off to an incredible start. Coming off her debut with the very successful lady bird she completely one ups the entire scope of filmmaking with Little Women. Greta Gerwig manages to pace this movie so well having scene after scene blend into one another never giving you a moment to disconnect. After researching the backround and history of Little Women I realize how much Greta's screen play changes the story telling from the original. I wonder how the sworn allegiances of the Little Women army took to these non linear approaches. Often times long time fans will be resistent to certain changes to what they have come to love however for a first time exposure like myself I found the approach so engaging and perfectly timed. Everything happening from each time line is playing so well off what you know from previous scenes and anticipate for future scenes. There was almost a mystery about it that had me hooked to find out more and I was never let down. Everything eventually comes around full circle and fills my questions with answers. The ending we got was not the ending I was begging for the entire movie and I slightly felt cheated. It wasn't what I had wanted and yet it was such a masterful ending to the story. Although I beleive I have interpreted it wrong I got the sense that the scene in the rain when Jo kisses the professor that it's direction was so different from the rest of the movie, that it was very cliche and hollywooded up making me beleive it wasn't a reality. Alongside the agreement to write that in as a last chapter it seemed to fit well so it's how I decided to take it. After research I've discovered she does actually get married however the author to whom the books is semi autobiographical to did not get married nor bare children. With that knowledge and interviews with Greta have revealed a meta commentary within the scene of Jo selling her book in which she reveals that the ending of the book that everyone seems to dismiss is all just a part of the economic exchange of her work which is also at the soul of this movie. Money matters.P.S. as per the title, I loved this movie so much I have decided it will be something I watch minimum once per year and what better time then the Christmas season! Enjoy this wonderful picture."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 April 2020,10/10,I would watch it again for sure it made sure to keep it going you know. it was like just overall good.
LITTLE WOMEN,25 April 2020,7/10,"I had high expectations for the movie. Because I absolutely love the book ""Little Women""! But I'm only giving it 6 stars and here are reasons why: first, some positives: excellent cinematography, choice of actors (especially Laurie and Jo. Laurie is portrayed as rich, idle and handsome. Just like in the book. Jo is passionate and charming! The actor did very well. I am slightly disappointed in Amy, because she's supposed to be ""tall and slim"", but her actings made up for that). Also, I'll give credit for the details such as the interior design and the design of the characters clothing and hair. Meg always looks sweet elegant and classy (her dresses and hair always look very ""house wify"" and beautiful). Jo looks like a tomboy (her hair is always flying everywhere), Amy is elegant but with a twist and creativity (her hair is always braided interestingly, and her dress style and patterns unique). Okay, here comes the negatives: first, although I do like the characters, they all seem a bit too old and sound old (except for Beth). The clothing also seem a bit too modern. Second, THE STORYLINE. (SPOILERS ALERT) To begin with, it was not supposed to be so romantic. Little Women is a story about common everyday life (as the movie states itself). Jo and Frederick did not fall in love when they first met. Their love for each other built up over a period of time. Why were they staring at each other when Jo was walking into the house? It isn't good manners, especially toward a stranger (but it's romantic, and that's ""what sells""!) Next, the portrayal of Jo. This is what makes me upset. Jo is determined, strong and passionate. But she is absolutely not arrogant. Jo will not talk to Frederick (or anyone) like that when they criticized her works! She did not (in the book) and will not change her mind about Laurie. Changing her mind is not like her, especially when she knows exactly why they cannot be together. She does not marry because she is lonely! She does not marry because she wants to marry, but because she found the right man! If it wasn't for Frederick, she would have remained single for the rest of her life! Jo is not fickle and dependent (it is almost like an insult to Jo when the movie portrays her writing a letter to Laurie stating she is changing her mind). She knows what she wants and that's why we love her. I quite liked the beginning of the movie. But the ending is just not good and not ""Jo"". I'll give it 6 stars for the credit it deserves, for it is a beautiful movie and wonderfully done. But taking out 4 stars for Jo!"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 September 2020,9/10,"This film is so beautiful!!!
Everything is amazing, I love it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,16 May 2020,9/10,"When I saw the trailer of this movie, I felt impressed for the cast. I really liked the movies of Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet, their performances are gripping. Then, someone said me that this movie is based on a novel published in 1868 by Louisa May Alcott, that made this film more interesting because when I read the sinopsis I thought this book was very revolutionary for their time. The film approach a variety of topics, among them, the empowerment of women and the family love. So I had many reasons to see this film.The director is Greta Gerwig, I didn't know much about her, I just knew she was the director and writer of Lady Bird. She won a Gold Globe and was nominated for the Oscars with this film, so I thought: ""Little Women"" will be fascinating too. About the settings, I love films that are located in ancient times (S. XIX), everything is elegant, and the clothes are nice; specifically in this movie, the dresses were so beautiful.About the plot (spoiler alert) the performance and the character of Joe was exciting, she is a very strong, comprehensive and kind woman, she always care about her family and her friends, for that time her way of thinking was out of the ordinary, I really like the phrase that she said to her mom ""Women have minds and souls as well as just hearts, and they've got ambition and talent as well as just beauty. And I'm sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for. I'm so sick of it! But I'm so lonely"". She is absolutely right, and even in our time some people don't understand this. I wanted she to end together with Laurie, but I think she would do this just to not end alone.Something I didn't liked about the story was that the relationship between Amy and Laurie was to fast an unnatural (in the movie) and that makes you feel unsatisfied with this relationship, wishing that Laurie ended with Joe. Meanwhile, in the novel, Amy and Laurie had a long time together and then fell in love, more natural! On the other hand, I think the writers gave enough time of the story to show the sisterly love; I didn't think I would be crying at the end of the movie.Overall, it's a great dramatic film, is exciting, you laugh, cry and feel a lot of emotions. I recommend it for the entire family."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 May 2020,3/10,"A lot of things weren't in the book. Why is Beth portrayed as slightly dumb or infantile? She is sick a lot and likes being home, she isn't slow. Aunt March is not the father's sister like the movie assumes, she is ""great"" Aunt March. And did they have donuts in the 1800's? We grew up reading the books and watching the first movie, which was precious and so well acted. We just laughed through this movie because of how bad it was at times. It wasn't a terrible movie if you aren't basing it off the books, it's fine. But if you've seen the first movie this dulls in comparison."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 June 2020,7/10,"One of my favorite books is little women and I must say that the movie was really good, I specially love how the actors are perfect for every each character. Actually when I found out that Timothee was going to be playing Laurie I was a little concern because Laurie is such a cheerful character and I just couldn´t imagine Timothee being like that because I always thought that he was so serious, but I miss judged him because he was amazing as Laurie and I can´t think of anybody else who could have played that role. And the dressing was magnificent she totally deserved that oscar"
LITTLE WOMEN,24 July 2020,3/10,"This is the worst remake of any film ever. The film is all over the place and brushes past pivotal moments from the book.
It was a struggle to get through this."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 July 2020,10/10,"My book readers know that this movie is the one that is closest to the book. I have watched the 1994 one, which is very famous because of its stellar cast that includes Winona Ryder, Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon, amongst others. But this one is the best one yet, not only is it closer to the book, but it also has a fresh new take with today's most known actors. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the costumes and the screenplay are simply amazing. And for those that have a problem with how it jumps back and forth, movie lovers might have noticed the change of tones, when the movie is showing the past you can see warm tones and when showing the present it shows cold tones. Greta's take on it is simply fresh and amazing, and with a cast like this one, well you are bound to love this movie and be moved by it."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 September 2020,8/10,"A film that makes us question our morale. An empowering tale that Greta Gerwig has given us no choice but get to get so invested in, the twists and turns of the brilliant novel put you on the edge of the seat. Genius."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 October 2020,10/10,There was some feeling held my heart tight from beginning to end of this movie.. I laughed with joy and as time passed I couldn't help myself stop crying.. must watch.. I love it a little pinch more than I already did because we are three girls at home.. this movie simply made me miss home.. maamaa.. and wish I could love my people a little bit more.. jo was such a vibe🖤
LITTLE WOMEN,28 October 2020,1/10,"I chose not to finish the film due to poor casting. ""Amy's"" speaking voice is so deep, I don't know why they did not cast younger girls for the flash back scenes like the 1994 version.
It was a stretch to believe Amy was upset over limes and being struck by her teacher when it sounds like she smoked a pack to calm her nerves, on her walk home. Awful awful awful acting. I love Emma Watson and honestly only rented the movie to see her part, but it wasn't enough to keep me invested.
Very thankful we didn't pay $50+ to load the family up and see the film in theaters.
I didn't want it to be a carbon copy of the beloved '94 film; I was excited to see a new take, but the acting was very off and felt forced. I also thought Laurie's character looked 15 or 16; definitely not old enough to be traveling Europe alone. I guess you just can't beat hearing the voices of Winona Ryder and Christian Bale."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2020,1/10,"The movie is a complete mess, to say the least. Disappointment is the best word that can be said about it. Characters are flat, and most important there is absolutely no any story or storyline, the director is helpless. A movie that couldn't be saved even by Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper...This movie will convince you to never read the book if you haven't already (which is unfortunate). It's an insult to the Oscars this movies was even nominated. (The Parasite film was only slightly better.) The blunt feminism statements don't make the movie any better
Thank you for losing 2 hours of my life.PS: Nice costumes and a well-deserved oscar for that"
LITTLE WOMEN,10 November 2020,1/10,"Like many of the reviews here stated, I downloaded imdb for the first time just so I could review this movie. I am seriously surprised at the amount of positive reviews for this movie, but I know they must be fake to boost its rating. I have many things to talk about.First: the accents. I was so confused in the beginning before I realized it wasn't intentional. At first, I thought saoirse ronan (jo March) was doing a different accent than her co-stars before I realized she was struggling to hide her real Irish accent. Emma watson seemed to have a bit of trouble too but not like saoirse. It also threw my off how a lot of them sounded like we do today. The revolution was only 100 years before this so I would expect some sort of British-American accent mix but that's not what we got,Second: the cast. I feel like casting took four random white actresses and expected me to think they would work together as close sisters just because their white. There was no chemistry and all the scenes where they are giggling and laughing and playing around felt forced and there was still no chemistry. Saoirse was probably the best out of all of them with the woman who played Beth behind. It was really painful to watch a 24 year old (who looks 30) Florence Pugh play the youngest of the sisters. It was hard to watch her act like a child when she seemed like she was that age in real life 15 years ago. Emma Watson was ok I guess, nothing really stood out. Laura dern as mammie was ok too, nothing special. Meryl Streep did fine but something felt off. Probably just the bad script. Timothee Chalamet was fine too but he just seemed really young, and he looked way too young to be married to Florence pugh's character.Third: the non-linear timeline. I literally had no clue what the heck was going on. I only caught on when I noticed that amy March had a bang in the flashback and didn't when it was present time. There was literally nothing done to distinguish them from seven years in the past to the present. It was annoying and if I want to understand what happened more (which I don't) I'm going to have to go back and rewatch.Something that also didn't sit right with me was the one black woman having one line in that one singular scene. It was really some white savior type stuff going on there and it was very poorly done.I didn't read the books, so I can't go into detail about how the ending was different and pathetic compared to the books and how jo's love interest should've been German instead of French, but this movie was honestly very bad. Just because you have an ensemble cast, it doesn't mean they're going to mesh well together, and you can see that here in this movie. Please don't waste your time. Watch the one from the 90's - the chemistry is there and it's much more well done."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 November 2020,1/10,"If you are unfamiliar with the story of Little Women, stop right now and go watch the 1994 version with Wynona Ryder. You will get a coherent storyline and relatable characters. I'm not even sure where to start with how awful this version is.I wanted to love this movie. I have read Little Women every year since I was about 12 years old. I adore the older versions of the movie. It's a feel good story that has no hidden agenda. It's beauty is captured in its simplicity. This movie is, quite frankly, an insult to the author and millions of fans. Louisa May Alcott is rolling in her grave.1. It starts in the middle of the book. I was willing to give some leeway, as it is an adaptation and credited to the director, not the author. I was still mildly confused until they did the first flashback. At that point, I realized what was going on and still had trouble following the frenetic back and forth timeline that was created. This is a story meant to be told in chronological order or you lose significant pieces of it's beauty. The point is the simplicity and the growth of the March sisters - you are supposed to come to love them. You are supposed to appreciate their character growth. You are supposed be heartbroken when they are and cry happy tears when they do. You are supposed to FEEL something (aside from disgust).
2. Because of the cut and paste version of the story, there is almost no audience connection with any of the characters. The director assumes you know the storyline and already love the characters - and still manages to make them look like caricatures. No one ages. No one changes. This is most disturbing with Amy who begins the book as a 12 year old and ends it in her mid twenties. Florence Pugh is a wonderful actress, and as grown Amy is as lovely and accomplished as one could wish. As a child, she's creepy and off-putting. This is one of many things that pulls you out of the story and right into ""WTF is happening?""
3. Aside from Saoirse Ronan, the casting was terrible. Teddy Lawrence is NEVER supposed to be a mindless dandy. Professor Bhaer is not a heartthrob. Beth IS a lovely, shy girl whose death should leave you shattered and weeping. Marmee is the strength of this family. She loves her daughters fiercely and would protect them from all of life's hurts, but she encourages their independence and respects their individuality, she's not just...there.
4. Leave the classic stories alone. If you want a feminist manifesto, write your own. Do not hijack someone else's work and twist it in such a disgusting manner. The ending completely ruined the character of Jo (the only one we can even hope to connect with), turning her into a mercenary who is just in it for the cash, not an adoring sister who finds a story to tell in the simplicity of her own life and who respects her family and upbringing. This Jo is disgusting and borderline offensive in the treatment of her own work. She suddenly, and without warning, morphs into a spoiled 21st century child with all the depth and personality of a particularly stupid turnip.This movie ripped my heart out, for all the wrong reasons. I left it feeling abandoned. I was devastated that such a remarkable cast was subjected to such awful directing and a script that was barely coherent. They all deserve better than this. We ALL deserve better than this. Please, if you have any respect, do not allow Greta Gerwig near another classic story."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 December 2020,1/10,"I've seen every version ever made- film and animated, and I've been reading the novel since I was 8 years old. I can understand they were trying to give a fresh go of it with the timeline jumping, but it just did not work the way they intended.
Everything was rushed, everyone was stepping all over each other's lines, and the characters seemed badly watered down. I don't expect anyone new to this story to understand or even like it.
I hate that I disliked this so much. So disappointing."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2020,1/10,"I know this is what's considered trolling... I'm not proud. I just wonder if anyone that watched the 1994 version actually liked this?Winona Rider and Christian Bale will forever be Jo and Laurie to me... I knew I would have a hard time liking this movie as much with different characters, but I wanted to give it a chance as I loved not just the 90s movie, but the book, and having seen ""call me by your name"" I thought Timothee wasn't a terrible choice to pull the emotional strings that Laurie should pull. But I ended up feeling like all the casting was pretty ridiculous (all four sisters appeared to be the same age, looked nothing alike...). The acting seems out of place, and cheesy. It seemed more modern than it should; less of a time-piece with their rainbow colored dresses. There was no character development, and with all of the time-hopping, it removed all of the emotion of the story... half of the big moments took place in the first few scenes, out of order, before you could care about any of the relationships and what those statements meant. If you hadn't watched the other versions, I'm not sure you would understand what was happening and when as they didn't clarify ""5 years later"" or ""5 years earlier."" But most importantly, that took away from making you feel the heartache between Jo and Laurie, the loss of Beth.I think the 94 version was one that shapes you as you grow up watching it - it was serious and warm and all of the things. The two can't compare in my eyes.."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2020,9/10,"Gerwig's adaptation of the classic gave a heartfelt insight to what sisterhood is all about. It captures an entire spectrum of emotions and delivers a strong message that transcends generational differences. An uplifting and heartwarming coming of age story that doesn't shy away from the tragedies and hardships of life. Venturing through scenes of nostalgia, what if's and could-have-beens gives the audience more than enough understanding of the characters' motives and feelings throughout the film. An unforgettable piece brought to life with stunning performances from the entire cast, it's as fun and poetic as it is achingly real."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 September 2021,9/10,"I watched this with my family and wasn't expecting us all to like it that much.. but wow this film captivated all of us! My dad who prefers sci-fi movies and my sister who prefers animation, even my mom who hates movies, were all so invested into this movie! I loved it as well but I'm not giving it a full 10 stars because I despised the male characters LOL they were unbearable."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 February 2021,9/10,"This version of Little Women was a beautifully composed cast of talented characters and acting. Not to mention the great Emma Watson. I feel like every single person chosen for this particular movie in this story carried an important role. The storyline is the almost the exact same as the 1994 version. There are a few other details thrown in there, but overall, anyone who likes a good laugh, a deep message, and some romance will wholeheartedly enjoy this 1"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 February 2021,2/10,"Little Women (1994) is my favorite movie of all time, I cry every time I watch it. I have watched and appreciated many Little Women remakes over the years but this version of the movie was awful. I felt no connection to any of the characters as it didn't give me time to connect and watch the bond between the sisters and Mother grow. And the story line was so choppy and fast it was very hard to follow even though I already know the story by heart. Such a waste of an amazing cast. Don't waste your time with this version of the movie. If you want to watch a great remake of a classic film then stick to the 1994 one."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 April 2021,3/10,"People can't follow the story, because the story is jumping, and The people don't now, what is the real time.The story, the pictures and the actor, actress is very good.Thx."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 April 2021,5/10,"I was totally blown away in some parts of this movie
But in my opinion another parts didn't make sense."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 April 2021,4/10,"I have read the book, and eventhough this film seems closer to the book I liked the 94 adaptation better.The cinematography and costumes are lovely. But the display of the timeline is confusing and the character development is poor, it didn't allow any powerful nor lasting performances by the cast. In my opinion Jo was the only choice of casting that was beautifuly performed. Saorse Ronan is fantastic as Jo, her attempt to carry the movie was OK but it was just too much. Sadly the rest weren't allowed to shine. Teddy/Laurie was a good casting choice but limited, he looked too young throughout, when time has passed his character looked exactly the same no attempt was made to make his actions or his physique look older. Amy looked older than any of them. And it just all seem convoluted. Maybe good for first timers."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 June 2021,10/10,"I will make this short and sweet, but I absolutely adored this film. From the carting which I thought was superb, to having Greta Gerwig direct it, to the setting and soundtrack. I found it to be a mighty improvement to the 94' Little Women which I thought was rushed with missed opportunities and improper casting. The characters in the remake allowed you to have so much more empathy for them, and having had sisters of my own, brought about the sisterly relationships spot on, from the love to hate. It breaks my heart to see all the hateful reviews but I assume they must just be closed minded with family issues."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 May 2021,10/10,"The film was very impressive and good With excellent games and good handling, strong story and beautiful locations."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 August 2021,10/10,"I've never read the novel upon which this movie was based. I have though seen 4 previous movie productions including the impeccable Katherine Hepburn version wonderfully acted by all & directed masterfully by George Cukor. It is the benchmark to which all other productions of this movie are compared. It is a pleasure to report that this 2019 interpretation, exquisitely directed by Greta Gerwig (cannot believe she wasn't Oscar nominated! Shame on you Academy!), is a superb accomplishment by all involved. The lives of 4 distinctively different and independent women butting heads with the traditional expected roles of women in the mid to late 1800s are beautifully delineated in this 2+ hour film. Saoirse Ronan, one of the most brilliant actresses of her generation, is incandescent as Jo March, a truly high spirited girl who listens only to her head & heart no matter how much it flies against the ""expected norms & expectations"" of women of her day. She listens to the beat of her own drummer. She is more than ably assisted by the excellent performances of Florence Pugh as Amy, Eliza Scanlen as Beth & by Emma Watson ( a few minor hiccups aside ) as Meg. Laura Dern as Maurmie has rarely been better than she is here, Meryl Streep sublime as cantankerous Aunt March & finally Timothee Chalamet as Laurie/Teddy who is terrific as the disobeying, raucous boy who by movie's end has developed into a responsible & sensible married man & father. All of the other supporting players are excellent in their respective roles. The storytelling is done through wonderfully transitioned scenes from the past to the present & vice versa without skipping a beat or leaving the viewer confused. The transitions are seemless & due to the brilliance of Gerwig's direction. The costumes are perfect, the settings beautifully mounted & the cinematography gorgeous with different lightings for certain situations & scenes. There isn't a false note in this movie. It is a beautifully realized production with humor, delicacy when needed & with a great deal of emotion, particularly in the 2nd half of the movie. Be prepared to shed a few tears during this movie as I did. But the tears are not forced through some contrivance in the movie; they are genuine , natural emotions for real life situations where tears are expected & natural. This is a movie everyone should see & enjoy, just have a kleenex or two handy. Ultimately it is an uplifting, life affirming movie & perfect viewing during these times of isolation, civil discord & Covid. Bravo to Gerwig, cast & crew!"
LITTLE WOMEN,22 June 2021,6/10,"First off, I will say that I think this may have been one of the truer adaptations of the book that I've seen. Most of the scenes independently were quite beautiful: the cinematography, score as well as dialogue between characters made parts of the film truly compelling. Also, a lot was included that the other adaptations missed, which I really enjoyed. I also think the casting of most of the chatacters was not as bad as some of the other negative reviews have claimed. Florence Pugh as Amy - for example - was outstanding.I think that is why watching it was at times torturous; because the choice to tell the story non- chronologically, for me, more than detracted from the potential excellence of the film! It absolutely ruined the spirit and poignancy of the story. It really feels as though this decision was made for the sake of being different. I can at times see what she was trying to do, but I'm sorry - it didnt do this classic tale any justice and it didn't do justice to all of the well executed scenes.For me, what lies at the heart of Little Women is watching the childhood bond of the sisters and their dreams and fears, and witnessing their transition into womanhood, which makes you truly feel their triumphs, struggles and of course the ultimate devastating loss of Beth.But the flashbacks and flash-forwards disrupt their own poignancy and it is just so frustrating to watch. The scenes between Beth and Jo were beautiful, but you don't feel the beauty because you haven't experienced parts of the years of their bond. Not to mention that the happy highs are then also ruined because they are told alongside the devastation of the future. This is not true to life either. Life is filled with seasons of joy and seasons of sadness, but the sadness is more devastating because of the memories of the joy, but as the viewer, you are not with the characters. You dont have enough context, so you don't feel as much as you would have if you'd been on their journey to that point.There were some other problems, but not enough to make me dislike the film to the extent of some of the other negative reviewers. No, pretty much all four stars that I removed are for the extremely poor decision of not relaying the story chronologically, because it really ruined what had so much wonderful potential.What I would really LOVE to see is a re- release of the movie with the scenes reorganised chronoligically. Maybe I'm wrong, but I then think this would have been deserving of it's critical acclaim."

LITTLE WOMEN,6 November 2021,10/10,"This film is very beautiful. Amazing cinematography, wonderful actors. It's a film that always brings me comfort no matter how many times I watch it and it's something I always recommend when someone asks for movie recommendations. 'Little Women' has been done multiple times, and for someone who has seen almost all of the adaptations, I think this is the best one yet. But I don't believe it can be remade again. This should be the movie that comes to your mind whenever you hear 'Little Women'. I don't think there will ever be a better adaptation than this again."
LITTLE WOMEN,24 September 2021,2/10,"I found this movie poorly made and not true to the essence of the novel and original movie. The little women are in several scenes portrayed as being catty / ditzy and immature, however in the same scenes in the 1994 version, the scenes are more realistic and true to life and true to the nature of the characters. ..and much more enjoyable to watchI am a huge fan of the original 1994 Little women with Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Christian Bale, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Eric Stoltz, Mary Wickes.Director: Gillian ArmstrongI cannot say enough good about 1994 Little Women: amazing acting, plot, script, cinematography, music, lines so many memorable and quotable lines. A must see! An absolute masterpiece!And to quote Aunt March regarding quality of 2019 Little Women ""I cannot say the same about you"""
LITTLE WOMEN,18 December 2019,10/10,"As a fan who grew up on the 1994 version (born in 93) I thoroughly enjoyed this version. I was shocked to walk out of the theatre and realise 2 hours had passed. There were plenty of memorable scenes mixed with new perspectives that didn't ruin it in any way. My only issue was it was sometimes hard to tell what scenes were the flash backs, but again, that didn't remove from the movie at all."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 November 2021,10/10,"This film is a wonderful adaption of the book that is as relevant now as when it was written. The casting is perfect; the actors wonderfully represent the characters and Greta Gerwig's directing ensures the film never looses focus or pace. It is a terrific insight into relationships, heartbreak and the plight of women frustrated by the world they find themselves in."
LITTLE WOMEN,11 January 2020,9/10,"I went to see this film with high expectations, given all the praise it's received and I wasn't disappointed. It was an absolute joy to watch and I left the cinema feeling moved and uplifted.The story itself was exquisitely told and with obvious love for both the narrative and the characters themselves. The film starts with Jo approaching a publisher in order to sell some of her stories. We are then taken back 7 years to see the March sisters as younger girls and through a series of further jumps back and forth in time are able to perceive both the young women these sisters become and the childhood experiences that moulded and shaped them. In the hands of a lesser writer/director these leaps through time could have been jarring and awkward but Greta Gerwig weaves each strand together effortlessly to create a beautiful whole.The casting is perfect and each and every actor shines in their respective roles. Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Timothée Chalamet as Laurie and Florence Pugh as Amy particularly stand out. The relationships between Laurie and Jo and later between Laurie and Amy feel genuine and believable. You can understand why ultimately Laurie and Amy are the better match but also why Laurie would be attracted to both these sisters.
However, also noteworthy are the portrayals of Marmee, Beth and Old Mr Laurence, which is as much down the high quality of the writing as it is the acting. Marmee has a big heart but comes across as real not overly saccharine and Beth is shy, awkward and young for her age rather than a goodie two shoes. Chris Cooper as old Mr Lawrence is kind and thoughtful and not what you'd expect from a man who usually plays such tough, hard characters.Overall, this is a gloriously evocative film that makes you laugh, makes you cry and utterly envelopes you in the world of the March family and the love that binds them all together."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 September 2020,5/10,"I found the movie to be very annoying. It does have beautiful costumes and cinematography, but that's about all I liked about it. The time-frame goes continuously back and forth, which is too disruptive for the narrative and as such I find it impossible to connect with the movie. But the worse for me was that almost every actor seems to be miscast. From Florence Pugh, who has too thick a voice to play the youngest March sister (it sounds much too mature for a child, and she also doesn't look like the 12 years old she's supposed to be when the story begins) to Timothee Chalet who looks like a 13 years old (which makes ridiculous his appearance as a married Laurie), nobody seems to fit their parts. Laura Dern lacks Marmee's strong personality, Saoirse Ronan looks too ethereal to play fierce Jo while Emma Watson looks too lively to play the calm and wise Meg (I would've switch the parts between these two) and Chris Cooper is not ""dated"" enough to play Mr Laurence. Eliza Scanlen looked good as Beth but her part was very much scaled down and didn't make much impact (if any) in the end. I was very disappointed in this version."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 August 2020,1/10,"I am a huge fan of the books and of the 1994 film. I absolutely hated this! As much as I love the cast members individually and in other productions, I didnt think any of them suited the roles they were given for this film.
The jumping back and forth drove me nuts, and certain character traits did not sit with the originally character descriptions. For example i think Marmee came off way too flighty and childlike, when originally she is so supposed to seem to have knowledge beyond her years and be very grounded but friendly.
I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie..."
LITTLE WOMEN,25 April 2020,3/10,"Yes, just that. No soul, no effort. A complete disappointment"
LITTLE WOMEN,2 February 2020,9/10,"I was ready to be upset at Beth's death but honestly that was nothing compared to the emotions Saiorce Ronan, Emma Watson, Emma Pugh and Lorna Dern draw out in this movie - sorry Beth (unknown actress)but you were out-acted all the way - and you had the heartstrings role.Beautiful cinematography and amazing use of colour to enliven and enhance the beautiful emotionality of this film. I'd read the books but wasn't prepared for the beauty and love in this version. Supporting males were fabulous but this is little women after all and the girls (except Beth - unknown actress) were outstanding.A five tissue movie.
."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2020,1/10,"Extremely boring. No structure, whatsoever, no intrigue, the characters are dull and weird ocassionally. A bunch of great actresses and actors, a melllange of replicas, little strories and, oh my god, never original. A deja vu and predictable quotes borrowed from Wuthering heights, Jane Eyre, Pride and prejudice, Gone with the wind etc"
LITTLE WOMEN,30 December 2019,5/10,"It's not a bad film, but the 1994 version with Wynona Ryder and Christian Bale etc was a much much better film. Most of the characters are well cast, but the director/writer Greta Gerwig has turned it into a feminist polemic. A little less emphasis on the feminism would have made it more true to its era. I didn't like how the story isn't told in a linear fashion. She jumps all around back and forth in time for no discernible reason. It does NOT enhance the plot. The scene where Amy tells the Laurie character off(at a formal party no less) about what a disappointment he has become with his dissolution & pining for Jo, seems staged and overdone in this version. It doesn't feel authentic.In terms of plot I liked much better the way the romance between Jo and Professor Baer was treated in the 1994 film. In this one their interaction is given short shrift and it's almost not convincing that they even like each other all that much and would end up together. The scene of Winona Ryder & Gabriel Byrne under an umbrella hands clasped in the 1994 film was the perfect ending.Most of the music is pretty forgettable unlike the 1994 film which I felt was very much enhanced by the musical soundtrack. All the critics are raving about it but I stick by my assessment that Gillian Armstrong's direction of the 1994 film was better. She captured the adventurous spirit of the Jo character, and her longing for a life of adventure that isn't in the traditional woman's role without a confusing shuffling of the order of the plot. No doubt it will be nominated for gobs of awards. I won't be rooting for it. I liked Gerwig's Lady Bird film last year but it was over rated too. I think because she is the darling of the indie movies, critics over praise her work.I encourage all to see the 1994 version and see if you don't agree with me."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,2/10,"I do not understand the rave reviews for this film. The actors, in their (late) 20's playing prepubescent children was unbelievable and frankly offputting. The girls' hysterical screeching and patter took away from Alcott May's wonderful story."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 July 2020,10/10,"I loved this adaptation, I have watched all
Of the little women films, and loved everyone ... and for me this movie was the answer to my cries
Of what happens next, and now I can rest easy because all
If the bits that were missing have been filled in."
LITTLE WOMEN,16 January 2020,10/10,"A line at the 12:30 show? All here to see Little Women I joked. Yes, they were & some seeing it again. Best movie I've seen in ten years. Word will get around, it'll be a best seller and then this will be one that we watch every Christmas with the grands. Don't be the last on your block to see it."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,5/10,"Due to the short scenes, it felt like the cinematic equivalent of watching a series of TikTok videos making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters. Redeemed, somewhat, by some good acting and cinematography."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 December 2020,3/10,"First of all little women? The actresses are mid 20s and 30s for 14, 16, 18 and 20 years old charactersAnd what is up with the back and forth time line! That DESTROYED the feeling of the novel, one moment you are mourning the death of Beth and on the next scene boom! You are on Meg's wedding.The novel and the 1994 version where magic! The sense of it all was wonderful!Theres a lot of the relationship between sisters missing."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 March 2020,4/10,"No offense but all these 8-10 ratings for this movie are a false to boost of the overall rating. This movie was a sad production directed by Greta Gerwig in an attempt to make the young actors what the 1994 movie was to so many. That one had one of the most magical castings and depicted Louisa May Alcott's novel in a close realistic way, with Winona Rider and Christian Bale as the best leads. Watch the 1994 version instead and you're sure to enjoy it instead of this imitation that takes this eras women's stance a bit too much farther the the writers intent."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 January 2020,3/10,"Most men will suffer permanent brain damage when watching this movie. Yes, it is less damaging than watching a Rambo movie, but still very damaging. A complete and continuous torture."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 June 2020,9/10,"Back in December 2019 I read Little Women for the first time. It quickly became a favorite and yet I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. The ending didn't seem right to me. Like Jo says in this movie ""she says this whole book that she doesn't want to marry"", and yet she does. I later read that Louisa May Alcott didn't want Jo to get married but she was told that she had to. Just like Jo is told in the movie. And so when Jo ended up getting married it felt out of character.Even though Jo falls in love in the end of this movie it doesn't focus on it as much as in the book. Instead we get to see Jo happy, surrounded by her family and the kids she had made a school for. We don't even get to she if she and Freidrich gets married. I feel that in a way this movie gives us the ending we wanted from the book. And that's why I loved it!"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 January 2020,10/10,"I loved everything about this movie. It's beautifully acted. This is the best performance I've ever seen from Laura Dern as well as Saoirse Ronan. I thought Ronan was astounding. She made me feel every emotion her character was going through. It feels like a modern telling of a Classic Story. By far the best telling of this story, in my opinion. So so good. Bravo Greta Gerwig!"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 July 2020,1/10,"This is my first written review with over 1500 movies rated so it should tell you how mad did this movie made me. A total disgrace to the story, the characters, their personalities. From the way that the story is told going back and forth, from the horrible casting, you cant even figure out who is the oldest sister, they all look the same age, which makes the taking out of school amy scene totally ridiculous since it should have being done by a way younger actress. From the start this movie made me ache, how they teared this story up, the 1994 movie was marvelous, this is just a total disgrace, dont waste your time."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 January 2020,9/10,Gerwig triumphs. Fantastic script and cast and a great remake of this classic tale. Well worth a look
LITTLE WOMEN,2 May 2020,4/10,"Lovely acting. Good directing. Beautiful camera work. But a pointless film unless you love the novel and want to see an incoherent pastiche of scenes from the text strung together without narrative. It's like the bourish friend who always asks ""Hey... Remember when she...?"""
LITTLE WOMEN,14 February 2020,7/10,"Sloppy storytelling & editing: hard to tell what are current events and what are flashbacks. I have not read the book or seen other movies based on the book, so relied exclusively on this movie for the story, and it failed totally in presenting a comprehensible plot.Acting is excellent, though."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 February 2020,6/10,"This could be a good movie, but it's at least 20 minutes too long. It's just repeating it self to much. So if you take a nap in the middle you don't miss out anything."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 January 2020,4/10,"The movie fails to mount any real feelings in the viewer because the dialog is too ""theatrical"". I get that it is deliberate and that it is true to the book and the era in which it is written, but this - together with the short cutting of the emotional scenes - creates a filter between the actors and the audience. You never really get under their skin and doesn't feel the joy or the pain experienced by the characters. Beth's death and her funeral are particularly bland. Likewise, the love scenes are uninspired and don't offer anything towards raising real feelings in the viewer. All the scenes intended to make you feel something are just cut to short.
The start is a rollercoaster of dialog and jumping around - atypical of four girls in that age - and set the scene for something reminding of children's television. The movie does improve as it unfolds though - and settles on a slightly more fitting tempo.The actors are ranging from OK to great. Especially Saoirse Ronan is doing a good job, but she has a difficult job stirring up any emotions through the messy cut and unfortunate pace.On the positive side, the time swapping works well, with a slightly different ""scene colour"" in the yellowish earlier years and the blueish adult period 7 years later. The scenography is excellent."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 July 2020,8/10,"As stunning as this film is, this story will be much more digestible if you read it on the page first. There are two parts to this book; the first when the girls are young teenagers, and the second which takes place three years later as young adults. The movie isn't shot chronologically, so it goes back and forth very often. I personally think this may be confusing if you didn't read the book from beginning to end. Just my own tip for anyone wondering if they should read the book first. I was so glad I did.The music is to die for. This compositions are deeply rooted in the scenes and glide through the story effortlessly. During the shots with very little dialogue, the music is enough to tell the story on its own.I watched this with my mom :) it was beautiful."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,10/10,"If you loved the adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, you'll love this!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 October 2020,10/10,I think it wouldn't be unrealistic to think that the producers would do anything to manipulate the IMDB viewer reviews after making a million dollar movie. They wouldn't risk scoring 3.0 on IMDB.If you go and read the 3.0 point reviews for 2019 version of Little Women you would get a realistic view and the perfect definition of a failed movie.The only reason I give 10 stars is that you can read this and get a better idea of this terrible version of Little Women.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 April 2020,4/10,"I am such a fan of the Little Women book as well as the 1994 adaptation of the movie. As a young women I used to watch the movie's 1994 version almost everyday, every chance I got, and it really made a huge impact on my life.. I watched the 2019 version today and I just do not really know what to say.. There are so many thoughts going through my head hopefully I can articulate them well. First of all I have so much respect for Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Florence Pugh, of course our queen Meryl Streep however this version of the Little Women completely lacked emotion.. There was so many disconnections between the story line.. We did not get important details of the March family's values and history in Concorde in this version as we did in the 1994 version, which makes you connect with them on a greater level. Each character's storyline and development except for Saoirse's Jo seemed like it was not thought of as much as it should have been.. It seems like it delivers important female right issues however it just leaps over them when the older version delivers the same messages in a single scene.. I do not know I have so much more to say.. Christian Bale was so much more in tune with Laurie's character and he shows how he is such an important part of the March family, unfortunately Chalemet totally did not work. I do not even want to get into the character analysis of Beth because I will go on and on and on..
The scenes.. I am so sad about the way the storyline was told in the scenes, it felt so shallow, the details and feelings we saw, felt in the 1994 version was nowhere to be found.. and I am again so sorry to say the time leap ruined it even more..
I am so sad to see that this version with so many actors and actresses I admire left me heartbroken over the execution of my favourite film.
Honestly I watched the 1994 version to get me out of my shock and to see if I was overreacting however I was not.. for me I will pretend I did not watch this version and simply choose to forget about it.."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,3/10,"I was so disappointed in the mess made of one of my favourite books and films I nearly cried.1. The back and forth format was messy and gave away the ending. We knew from the outset that Jo rejected Laurie, met Fred and Meg married Mr Brook before we met them. One of the great heart wrenching parts of the book was falling in love with Jo and Laurie, then her refusal of his proposal and their subsequent marriages.2 The casting was wrong. The actress who played Amy was great for the adult Amy but too old for young Amy. She was supposed to be twelve years old! Emma Watson looked younger than all of them, yet she was playing Meg? I'd expected her for Jo or maybe Beth. Sairse is a great actress and did well enough as Jo, but the actress playing Beth was also more absent than gentle and shy. Laura Dern as Marmee was okay though felt odd. But the direction and depiction of their father was odd. Laurie was a disappointment too. He seemed too young, petulant and childish to play adult Laurie and didn't mature as he did in the book, just suddenly went from whiny playboy to proposing to Amy.Overall it was a pretty film, if terribly disjointed. In our group of six people, only one of the two who hadn't read the book or seen the previous films actually liked it. The rest of us felt betrayed."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 May 2020,2/10,"The movie loosely follows the book which is its downfall. It starts at the end of the book so the build-up of certain characters and situations is totally lost. The actresses are completely miscast. The movie bounces from present to past. With no discernible age difference in their portrayal of their characters it takes a minute to figure out what timeline you're in.If you want to watch an exemplary Little Women, rent the 1994 version with Wynona Ryder. It has magic and heart. Which this 2019 version is sorely lacking."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 January 2020,4/10,"What was this movie? I saw it last night. Let me list the issues. 1. Amy looks like she is 20, even when she is supposed be a child with a deep husky smiley cyrus voice.
2. Laurie looks like he is 15 the whole time. Even when Amy is supposed to look like a child she always looks older than him.
3. They dumbed down and modernized the script. Even moments of reality tv like speaking. With Modern American accents.
4. They did that flashback type movie, starts with Jo in in NY and flashes from the past to the future. It's done sloppy and unless you read the book or watch the other versions, it's hard to follow.
5. No one is German....even Professor Bhear, he is french. The Hummels are American
6. All around boring movie with too many fails to be good."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,3/10,"I'm a big fan of Little Women, especially the book. I love the 1994 version of the movie, but I'm not a snob, I've enjoyed other versions, including the PBS series last year with Maya Hawke.This one was AWFUL. It was so miscast I couldn't get past it. Florence Pugh as older Amy was wonderful, but she was ridiculously absurd as Young Amy. Seeing a grown woman stomp and wail like a child was so off-putting I was cringing out of my skin. She looked positively psychotic as she fed Jo's manuscript to the flames one page at a time. In comparison, when Kirsten Dunst dumps Jo's manuscripts into the flames, she looks like a spoiled child having a tantrum, as she should.Timothee Chalamet seems like a very charming and likable actor that I would enjoy in another movie, but he did not work for me as Laurie. He was so tiny and youthful-looking , and he had no chemistry with either Ronan or Pugh.I adore Emma Watson, but she did not fit for me as Meg. At no time did she seem like the older sister.Saoirse Ronan was wonderful. I love her, and she did a great job as Jo.Beth was so forgettable. Probably not the actresses fault, but more to do with the storytelling. I should have been broken hearted by her loss, but I was not.I never got a sense that this was a close family, knit together by love and poverty. I never felt a connection between Laurie and any of the characters. I'd have loved to see Beth and Mr. Laurence's relationship a bit more, but I did enjoy seeing him sit and listen to her lovely playing, and I was very moved by his inability to visit the house when she was gone.The non-linear storytelling didn't work for me, mostly because there wasn't anything to visually distinguish between the various time periods. No one looked any older, nothing changed. Amy stopped stomping and she didn't have bangs. That was about it.One of the worst things was the way that Beth's death was handled. Because it was cut back and forth with her initial illness, you never got that soaring relief that she survived scarlet fever that you usually get from the book and earlier movies. And then you didn't really get to mourn her death, because shortly after her death, it was cut with a flashback to when she was alive. It really cut the emotional stakes.I'm honestly surprised it is getting such good reviews. I don't understand that at all. I would have enjoyed it more, and compared it to the superior 1994 version less, if it had selected some different scenes from the book to include. It felt like an almost shot-by-shot remake, pasted together differently and a few changes to the source material shoehorned in. I'm baffled by the praise.I give it three stars for Saoirse Ronan, Chris Cooper, and Meryl Streep. I liked the sets and the scenery. I liked that Jo was ambidextrous like Alcott, that was a fun addition to show. I loved the scene of the publisher's little girls rushing in to find out what would happen to the LIttle Women.(Does anyone else feel silly spoiler-marking a 150 year old plot?)"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 May 2020,7/10,"I am a long time fan of the 1994 film version of The Little Women and this one falls short and lacks the pacing it takes to really bond with the characters and to know each one intimately. There is countless jumping back and forth between present day and past memories which wasn't a huge issue. I could tell them apart, but it was honestly just too much back and forth.I thought the acting was superb and each person really portrayed their character with accuracy. I also have to be the one to say it, but I don't like that they had the same actress play Amy in the present day and in the memories. She is supposed to be twelve years old in the flashbacks yet they have a grown woman playing her role. Throwing tantrums; whining, crying, and basically doing everything that would be more fitting for a young actress to portray. It felt cringy to see a woman in her mid-twenties acting as a twelve year old.Other than that one major critique which ruined Amy's character for me, I enjoyed the film and would suggest watching for yourself!"
LITTLE WOMEN,3 August 2020,5/10,"I wanted to love this, but it fell flat compared to the 1994 version and to the book. The relationships felt forced and the story seemed more about struggles as women than the bonds we make as family and friends, which to me is a most important aspect in the book. The cast is amazing, but didn't seem to fit, and was not a fan of having an older actress portray Amy all the way through. Though the timeline was confusing, it wasn't too difficult to follow and the ""romantic"" twist at the end was an interesting turn that I could live with. Overall, not a bad film, but if you want the heart and soul of Little Women, this version is missing it."
LITTLE WOMEN,13 February 2020,10/10,I absolutely loved Little Women and its mostly because I had the sense of connection between the actresses. The casting is absolutely fantastic. Each one of them are perfectly fitting for the role they're playing.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,1/10,"Great & timeless story to work with, enjoyed prior versions, wanted so to love this one, but this schizophrenic, jerky time travel is obnoxious. Old/young, here/there, up/down, what the heck was the director thinking? Truly perplexed that most found this so enjoyable; i couldn't stand to sit through it; thirty-seven minutes was too much, and left."
LITTLE WOMEN,7 May 2021,3/10,"I did not expect anything before watching this movie but I needed to come here and check what everybody else thought about it (because I could not concentrate to watch the movie after the 10th min). I agree with the reviewers who mentioned about the lack of chemistry, accent problems and ages of Amy and Laurie (Amy looked older than other sisters)."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,"Wow! Saorise Ronan is the real deal, a giant in a sea of normal-sized talents. And this is a near-perfect film with Gerwig's script and direction. There has been much made of the fact that critics aren't kind to movies about girls and their concerns. They're right, of course, just as 100 years ago the great Willa Cather was overshadowed by manly writers like Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway because her tales were often about girls and women. Just go see this flick and enjoy the story, the costumes, the lighting, the settings, the 19th century manners, the plot turns, and the love behind the story that made the book a classic in the first place. The acting is superb. And make sure young girls see it, too."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 April 2020,9/10,"I just finished my second viewing of Little Women (2019) and have nothing but high praise for this timeless tale adaptation. One of my favorites from 2019, this film is very deserving of the six academy award nominations it garnered. Based on the novel and writings of Louisa May Alcott, the story follows the lives of the March sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, & Amy - each with passions, wants, and desires all their own.Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet give wonderful performances as Jo March and Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence. Their interactions and playful banter is charming to watch unfold.I also enjoyed Greta Gerwig's storytelling flair. Using a non-linear narrative full of interlocking flashbacks, Gerwig jumps back and forth between time periods frequently. Warm color palettes evoking the past and cool-toned hues signifying the present. I enjoyed this modern twist on the story and lets us as the audience experience the delightful memories and sorrow realities all in one sequence.Overall, I was very impressed with this film from every aspect. The cinematography was visually stunning. The characters were terrifically cast and breathed life into every scene. And lastly, the soundtrack, costume design, & production design were a cohesive masterpiece. Bravo and great job by all involved!"
LITTLE WOMEN,12 April 2020,6/10,"Little Women has never been my favourite book nor movie in the past but I must admit that when the cast list was released for this remake I could not help but get excited. So with an open mind and a cast I could get behind I gave this film a try and was let down more then I had been in the past. I found the directorial styling less then desirable with the camera work often out of focus, bouncy or rough. Worst of all the cast I was so excited about, as they are all so talented, did not give me the emotion I so craved. I think that bouncing back and forth in the timeline perhaps did not help build that emotional connection that in past renditions made you cry when Beth passed, made you feel for Jo that I just didn't find in this version of the film despite the actors talents. One thing I did enjoy was the fact that Greta Gerwig hit the note on the lack of women's rights and that even the actual author of the book this is based on was forced to write it in a certain manner appropriate for the time period. Due to this saving grace of the ending I have given it a better review then had it not contain that ending. Sadly disappointed in the lack of emotion I got while watching and lack of connection in between the characters."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 April 2020,8/10,"I loved the story how it took to where they stopped from the previous movie and how they captured some important parts
Also, the cast is amazing!
But i have to say i didn't life Florence pugh as Amy!
Timothee chalamet i am in love with him in this character and his acting! He did a fantastic job as laurie i just loved him!"
LITTLE WOMEN,23 February 2020,7/10,"The dress is beautiful and plot is compact,but storyline seems to week"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2020,,"I see a few reviewers mentioning the cinematography, but not enough. I, too, found the back-and-forth timeline a little irritating, and I don't think it really added anything much, but the scene composition and lighting was just extraordinary - worth seeing the film just for its beauty. One of the beach scenes looked like an impressionist painting - fantastic. Reminded me of some of the natural lighting and candlelight scenes from Barry Lyndon. Overall - pleased we watched it, and no feeling of having wasted my time. Did I come away with that feeling that I could easily watch it again (my acid test of film greatness) - probably not."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,10/10,Highly recommend and one of my favorite movies to date. Beautiful adaptation that brings the profound literary themes of the book to life. I felt moved in every single scene. Definitely deserves Oscar!
LITTLE WOMEN,8 February 2020,9/10,"My most favorite movie version of the book is the one from '94. So I was a bit anxious to go see this one. But I must say, it's really worth watching.This version is more playfully filmed and has more creative moments (camera).
I had to get used to it, but that says more about me than about the movie. After 15 minutes I didn't notice anymore. I loved the atmosphere that was created, the colors, the sound.The acting was stunning. Although there al lot of stars in this movie. The individual characters and also the chemistry between them really fascinate you. I was very happily surprised by that. Saoirse was outstanding for me. The supporting cast was very good (although I though that Laura Dern was a bit misplaced in her role).I didn't really listened to the music, because I was completely taken by the performances, so I must go see the movie once more, just for the music.To me, this was one of the best movies I've seen in the last 12 months.
And I would recommend it to anyone who can appreciate an easy paced movie with stunning performances."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,2/10,"This is the feminist version of ""Little Women."" It's too long and I got bored. Rent the
Winona Ryder version instead."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 January 2020,9/10,"Great acting & writing , beautiful convincing visuals, loved it. Timothee & Saoirse Ronan are wonderful together, however Florence Pugh steals the film; even in scenes with Meryl Streep!"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,4/10,"This will not be beautifully written because my brain still hurts from watching it last night.. but you will get the just of it.As a woman, one thing that has always inspired me about Little Women is how strong they were. This movie makes them out to be goofy and silly. Marmie was reduced and to me she was the hub of strength and goodness to her daughters so much so that they aspired to be like her. You didn't get that in this movie. There was no emotional pull in any of the scenes. The only time I was emotionally engaged was when they visited the Hummels and even then I wasn't totally emotionally invested. The acting was not good at all and the casting was all wrong. Laurie looked like a small preteen boy through out the whole movie. Amy felt like a 35 year old the whole movie and in the scenes with her at school and getting her hand spanked, instead of her being genuinely hurt physically and emotionally, she acted like a small child (in a 35 year olds voice and body) throwing a tantrum and it was hard to watch. They made these girls seem money hungry and silly and not women fighting for women's rights and to be seen and taken just as seriously as a man.. that is an utter failure in my opinion especially in this day in time when girls need to see strong women as role models. The fathers roll being filled by Better call Saul's, Bob Odenkirk was not so hot either. Bless his heart, he tried though. I just will never see him as anything other than Saul and I'm sure others will feel the same. All in all, it felt like a modern day rom com in period attire. The movie was visually beautiful and so that is why I gave it more stars. The scenery, music, and costumes were beautiful. I didn't like how the movie was chopped into pieces and scattered about. If new to Little Women, you will be so confused by how it goes back and forth in time, especially since the actors do not change or progressively grow up, which is a huge part of the book and films before it. I say, just save your money and rent this one from Redbox in a few months. Go to amazon and buy the 1994 version."
LITTLE WOMEN,1 February 2020,10/10,"Definitely one of 2019's best movies,It brought me to tears,I felt joy and sadness,Ifelt that I am joo
The actresses all are so good and I loved every minute watching it,I'd love to buy the novel and feel all this again picturing the movie in my head
Loved it"
LITTLE WOMEN,14 January 2020,9/10,"Written and directed by the genius Greta Gerwig based on the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott; Little women keeps the essence the novel that was written in late 19th century and tells the story of four sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy)
the casting by Kathy Driscoll and Francine Maisler brings the whole experience to another dimension.
Greta's choice of using a series of flashbacks to tell the story of the four sisters help with illusion of the actors age. you almost ignore the fact that adults playing these characters were supposed to be teenagers or mere children at the start of the story and you rather get to feel the emotions portrayed by the actors.
The ensemble cast portrays their characters with such panache that you don't feel you are watching something set 1800's but something that is timeless.
A special nod to Florence Pugh for certainly capturing Amy's certainty and Saoirse Ronan for being as ferocious as Jo and for Timothée Chalamet being the amazing actor he is ( yes in my opinion he was far better than Christian Bale) and last but not least for casting Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhaer ( no where in the novel it was mentioned that he is too old like the adaption in 1994)"
LITTLE WOMEN,28 March 2021,1/10,If you want to watch a film that ruins a beloved classic book this is the film for you.
LITTLE WOMEN,27 December 2019,1/10,Was very disappointed with the film it jumped around so much if I hadn't know the story so well I would have been completely lost. It was also so dark couldn't see half the time what was happening on screen. I wouldn't recommend this to true lovers of the original story as it bears little resemblance to the books
LITTLE WOMEN,25 December 2019,10/10,"This is the best screen adaptation of Little Women that I've ever seen, and I've seen every one (both film and TV - single episode and series) made in English, even horridly ""modernized"" versions.I read Little Women for the first time when I was 9 years old. I reread it at least once a year for the next 10 years and every few years for the next couple of decades. I modeled my behavior and attitudes on the March girls the way they modeled their behavior on Pilgrims Progress (an element of the book thankfully left out of this adaptation). To my mind, this film adaptation is truer to the spirit of this book, while channeling ideas from other Alcott favorites of mine (An Old Fashioned Girl and Rose in Bloom) and from Alcott's own life. My favorite moment of the film comes near the very end, a scene between Jo and her publisher, that does not come from the books, but represents Alcott life and intent faithfully.And oh yes, the sound track is exquisite."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,10/10,This film is perfect from start to finish ! Thank you Greta Gerwig x
LITTLE WOMEN,25 March 2020,2/10,"I saw this plays in cartoon when I was a child and this plays is absolutely different from what I remember! Acts are so strong but I do not like the plays, It's poor I think, Sorry about this review but it's my opinion.."
LITTLE WOMEN,27 January 2020,7/10,"I am confused as to why this movie rates so well... the story is wonderful but the acting compared to the 1994 version was poor (apart from a few). There wasn't the same level of passion in characters, and the bond between the sisters wasn't convincing. Wrong casting choice for the mother and father in this movie!! Teddy had no charisma. How do you go from Christian Bale to this actor? Didn't feel any chemistry between characters. We barely saw Beth say a word."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 May 2020,8/10,"When choosed this movie to watch I didn't know about the plot and the cast.
Just went for it as I've heard it's based on a YA novel. I love watching book based movies.I was suprised when I've found all my fav female cast in a single movie, from Meryl Streep to Saoirse Ronan, loved all of their's acting.Feminist veiw was seen in this movie in a realistic view, which is really good from my POV.And last thing I like to say is, I'll recommend it to any classic coming-of-age lovers, not the cheezy rom-com lover ones."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 January 2020,1/10,"I have never written an IMdB review before, but I feel this is the right film to start with.
I went to the theatre knowing there were flashbacks and flashforwards and I truly wasn't against them. Then I saw the movie.
By chopping up the storyline, Gerwig left no room for character development, right from the beginning we know how they ended up and how their personalities as women and not girls are. And that personal development is one of the charms of the story.
Then come all the historical sugarcoat, all the long speeches which are painful to hear and very bad written and the film gets worse. I found very odd that with all the care put in production design in this movie it is always autumn. Those things could be overlooked really, the script could not.
When did Jo say she was sorry for rejecting Laurie?? Never. And then, she just married off some French guy because her editor told her to? They made Baher younger than ever and duller than ever. The whole point of Baher is he is romantic and educated, confident where Jo is doubtful and bashful where she's strong. Here he is just a person she happens to know and then suddenly is told to marry. I think Gerwig mistook Alcott for Jo.
Honestly I didn't like Florence Pugh. It wasn't a question of the eternal problem of the age (something only the 94 version solved succesfully), there was something amiss with her perfomance or her script, I don't really know. Emma Watson was fine. So was Beth, although she had very few things to do save dying. There was almost no music in the film, music represents youth, and goes away when Beth dies, but there was very little if any in the movie.
The rest of the cast was ok, save the accents. Chalamet should learn to sit up properly on a chair, though. Not like a XXI boy dropped off in the XiX"
LITTLE WOMEN,13 November 2020,6/10,"I think you have to love the source to love the film. I always found the book twee and hard to connect to, I thought this adaptation might give me a way in but watching it just felt like doing homework from school. It's well made and beautifully shot but I won't be rewatching"
LITTLE WOMEN,27 March 2020,9/10,"It's hard to make movie from romance, but they did it .
Congratulations"
LITTLE WOMEN,9 March 2020,1/10,It's more than a bad movie 😡
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,6/10,"Acting - lovely
Casting - close. Beth was a miss
Cinematography - lovely
Set, costumes, locations - wonderful
Editing - Way, way off the mark.
Give all the footage to a sensitive expert story teller and start over. The movements between current times and paste were poorly demarcated. The background music was obvious pap and sap.
All that to say, there is a beautiful movie in all that effort if it could only be re-edited for continuity and an elegant flow."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 June 2021,6/10,"To be completely honest, this movie was incredibly boring and dragged on forever. And I love both the book and historical dramas in general. I would normally give this a 4 or 5, but I'm giving it an extra star because I bumped into my girl Saoirse in the checkout line of the Urban Outfitters in my local mall while they were in town filming. She was so cool."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,1/10,I wanted to enjoy this movie but I found it to be so poorly edited that it was almost incomprehensible. I was glad I had read the book when I was ten or I would have been completely confused. I know the thing these days is to not make a movie that is linear but this was ridiculous. One scene features Beth's funeral and the very next scene is Meg's wedding with Beth in attendance. Really. I was not alone in my confusion. I heard another woman say she liked the movie but she never knew where she was. I'm sure there are going to be many who disagree with me and that's fine.
LITTLE WOMEN,10 May 2020,4/10,"If you have read or re-read the novel recently, you will understand how not in line with the novel are few characters. The story doesnt go in a chronological way, its moving too fast and I feel it will be just pure difficult to follow if you havent seen the old movie or read the book."
LITTLE WOMEN,20 April 2020,4/10,"This retelling relies too much on the audiences prior knowledge of the characters and story line. While that may be a safe bet with a story like Little Women, every story told should be able to stand on its own. This one jumps backwards and forwards in time and expects you to know the characters too much. Poor story telling of a great story"
LITTLE WOMEN,21 June 2020,5/10,"Most of the cast is excellent and cinematography is beautiful, but the chronological narrative is a MESS.Someone should take the work to rearrange the scenes in the movie, and then the story could go back to be the epic ""little women""."
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,1/10,The positive reviews must be some kind of conspiracy against the art form of cinema.
LITTLE WOMEN,8 March 2020,1/10,"Good people in this. Poor story and script. Watch paint dry, it's more interesting."
LITTLE WOMEN,3 January 2020,4/10,"I don't know what everyone else on this site saw but it must have been a different movie. I am a huge fan of the 1994 Little Women. I did what I could to scrub my mind of the past movie to try and experience this movie with fresh eyes. This movie had more jump cuts than an action movie, in this context I mean with all the flashbacks from the past to present. It was all over the place and in no chronological order so anyone could make sense of. If I hadn't watched the previous film I would have absolutely no idea what is going on. These jump cuts also are a disservice to the pacing and emotions needing to be conveyed in this film. You couldn't get attached to any of the characters. It's a brilliant cast, and excellent cinematography but I feel its all wasted on the structure of this film."
LITTLE WOMEN,2 June 2020,10/10,"This movie was fantastic and I've enjoyed every second of this movie.this movie is one of the greatest movie in 2019 and maybe in Decade.All part of this movie was great,Screenplay,Directing,Acting(especially Saoirse Ronan).If you have un enjoyable life you must watch this movie."
LITTLE WOMEN,10 February 2020,10/10,"Truly a movie filled with such depth and beauty, I felt as though I was reading a book on the screen. Every performance was excellent and the movie left me feeling joyful, uplifted and genuinely entertained."
LITTLE WOMEN,28 December 2019,9/10,"I went for Meryl Streep and Saoirse Ronan,and they didn't disappoint, but I was blown away by the seamless fluidity of the storytelling, the gorgeous cinematography, and the entire ensemble. Florence Pugh was a fantastic Amy- her low voice a bit disconcerting at first but eventually seemed perfect, lending a depth I'd never before realized was in the character. Laura Dern and Chris Cooper didn't have enough to do, but were both charming. Meryl Streep lent a stoicism to Aunt March that turned her into a 3D character rather than the scary old lady of my childhood imaginings. Timothee Chalamet was stupendous and just so real. And now for Saoirse Ronan. It's best actress time for her, no doubt. It's a shoo-in. She made me weep. Brilliant."
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,9/10,"I am blown away. I've been an avid fan of Gerwig for ages but this is some of her best work yet. It's not just another remake, but it's also true to the novel. Just see it."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 January 2020,8/10,"Although visually it is a very lavish production, bringing the whole period stunningly to life, with great performances by all the stars, I found the device of jumping backwards and forwards in time so very many times, very challenging to watch. I have been thinking about whether I would take a young person to see this, as a coming of age film, and really wonder if they would be able to work the time periods out, especially as the young women did not always seem so different in age."
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,1/10,Complicated to understand as much as the book is clear.
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,,"Saoirse Ronan exudes intelligence and inner strength, but she doesn't have the joyful energy and warmth to be the perfect Jo March. Winona was. Dunst and Danes were also better as young Amy and Beth, Bale as Laurie and Sarandon as a tough but wise and loving Marmee. As for the unusual and nervous montage, I don't see how it enhances the story. Same for the ambiguous meta ending that brings more confusion than emotional depth and clarity. It's not a bad movie in itself, I just don't see what it brings to the table when better versions already exist. I hope this version won't overshadow them."
LITTLE WOMEN,31 December 2019,10/10,This movie was amazing. Amazing actors and actresses. Could not have asked for anything better. Kept your attention through out the whole 2 hr movie. I would recommend this movie over and over again
LITTLE WOMEN,10 January 2020,10/10,"If I could have, I would have rated it 11 out of 10.
Faithful to the story; realistic and detailed costumes; actors in harmony, able to create the family atmosphere you get reading the books; pleasant photography; powerful messages... I could sum up in one word: unforgettable. Period.
Thanks Greta for this version of Little Women, for another masterpiece! Thanks Saoirse for this passionate, pure-hearted, sensible, strong, inspiring, perfectly-imperfect Jo!"
LITTLE WOMEN,7 February 2020,1/10,I was wondering if there was a way to rate it with 0 stars. This movie is boring from the beginning to the end. The acting is very bad. It was so boring and meaningless that I thought I was watching this movie for 10 hours. I am also disappointed because this movie is nominated for some Oscars.
LITTLE WOMEN,16 May 2020,1/10,"A big fan of Little Women, the book & previous films, I was really looking forward to this movie & watched with my daughter. I knew the story & I found it confusing. My daughter didn't know the story & had no clue what was going on. It kept jumping forward & backwards in time & I found the characters quite shallow, the actresses who played them not really fitting in, with the possible exception of Jo. I was also quite saddened by the ending which left a feeling of incompleteness & almost a mockery of the original story."
LITTLE WOMEN,8 January 2020,8/10,"Really well done, didn't expect before going to theatre but the director has been able to mix a great performance from all the actors with a well-done screenplay. Not the normal Little Woman, a personal version of Greta Gerwig."
LITTLE WOMEN,17 December 2019,10/10,This movie is just good for the soul. The parts were beautifully cast and the directing/music/cinematography blends so naturally that you truly feel like you're taking a step back in time. This really does do the book justice. A great job all-around and one that won't disappoint-- go see it!
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,5/10,"This was not the Alcott's Little Women, the tone and character of the cast is a total misfit and wouldn't fit in with the original work at all. The girls did not act like any ladies Marmee would be proud of. So many additional scenes not true to the book, who would ADD to Alcott?! There was no beautiful character development between Beth and Jo to make the death of Beth anything significant. Save your time and money and watch the 1994 version, true to the book w beautiful and accurate character portrayal and a wonderful score!"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 January 2021,9/10,"Garden seen when boy will say little women to love her and she is saying no no no !!!!!
Much more real thing
It's true between to friends when one is boy and another is girl"
LITTLE WOMEN,3 July 2020,9/10,"A feel good movie.Must watch for those out there.The story of 4 sisters filled with love,cute fights,Hard work and above all determination of the ones who suffered highest for others.."
LITTLE WOMEN,18 May 2021,1/10,"I cannot understand how this film has been so lauded. I thought it was an absolute mess. By losing the linear narrative there is none of the character development and relationship building necessary for this story. It also creates a very confusing muddle of timelines not helped by a cast who never age.To avoid spoilers, the saddest part of the book became the most laughable part of the film with a very asinine 'mirrored' sequence. This was not helped by the non linear narrative which had already forwarned us of this, removing any jeopardy.The family was supposed to be quite poor yet their clothes were sumptious. I'm not sure if Jacqueline Durran has read 'Little Women' but she really didn't get the spirit of the book.Liberties were taken with the storyline, understandable when adapting a book to screen, but the ending was one schlocky step too far. It turned into an epsiode of Friends (just replace the airport with a railway station).All in all the film was a complete hash and I was left feeling utterly annoyed."
LITTLE WOMEN,29 December 2019,10/10,Thought I would write a review to say I went to see this with my wife as someone who knew the story but hasn't seen any previous adaptations and I was blown away by this movie. I thought the acting was amazing especially Jo and the stories emotional and I would love to see this again.
LITTLE WOMEN,4 January 2020,3/10,"I found it too slow, not mucb happening, Only towards the end it picked up"
LITTLE WOMEN,18 August 2020,1/10,"I tried, and tried to watch this movie but it did not keep my interest. Too much past, to present and back and forth. I didn't even make it through 1/4 of the movie. I loved the 1949 and 1994 versions. This movie needed much more flow. :("
LITTLE WOMEN,19 April 2021,5/10,"Why mess with perfection? I literally had to stop the movie after 5 minutes because I thought I had put in a second disc and had missed the first half of the story. The flashback mode of storytelling did not work well at all, it was simply confusing, and that's coming from someone who has read the book at least a dozen times. I only followed the story because I already knew it. It makes no sense told out of order. I don't see how anyone who didn't know the story would follow this.That said I cried a lot-the acting was wonderful. The actors, the costumes, the sets, the music, all wonderful. But I really wish they had started at the beginning and you got to know these little women as they grew. Also the story line with the professor was rushed and really made no sense as it was told. Did I enjoy it? I guess I did. Did I rewrite it in my head and wish I could just chop it up and put it together chronologically? 100%Lastly, I do like the focus they put on what life was like for a woman back then, and how much we have gained. It was in many ways a very empowering film for a girl or woman to watch. It made it very relevant to today almost a call to further arms, as it were, to continue the fight. I did like that."
LITTLE WOMEN,23 August 2020,3/10,"I'll admit it, I love the 1994 version, but I had so much hope for this one. Unfortunately with the mixed up storyline and what seemed link no real emotional connection between the characters, I was disappointed. Lots of hugging does not make up for real emotions. Beth and her characters story were completely lost by the disjointed timeline. I really didn't like Chalamet as Laurie and Amy wasn't young enough to believe. All in all a good try but once again a director who thought they knew better than the source material."
LITTLE WOMEN,21 January 2020,10/10,Gerwig's adaptation of the classic novel had me in tears the entire way through. By focusing the story on all four of the March girls through the eyes of Jo she truly gives the four different women their own unique perspectives and stories. The talents of the actors and the clear directorial vision truly shine in this incredible film.
LITTLE WOMEN,11 February 2020,10/10,"Finally fills in the cracks of all the little storylines I wanted to see in a different, more developed light. I especially love the extended take on Amy, which actually had me liking her by the end. Well done. Beautifully acted. Beautifully directed. Please take on some more classics!"
LITTLE WOMEN,6 February 2020,5/10,This film has such awful editing. It goes back and forth back and forth and does not have a straight time line. They attempted to do a Tarantino and it turned out awful.
LITTLE WOMEN,14 March 2020,9/10,I dont like cheezy happy endings but I love this one! This is perfect for me. The movie really spoke to me on many levels especially Joe's thouths and opinions. I cried my eyes out and I laughed from the bottom. I enjoyed the diverse journeys of each one of them. Not mentioning the good acting. Ah i miss it when people fought for real natural rights.
LITTLE WOMEN,26 December 2019,5/10,"The film deserves kudos for its authentic period feel, and there are brief moments in which it truly engages, but overall, the plot line is all over the place, and no amount of well-choreographed young woman group chaos can overcome this. None of the characters was ever sufficiently developed to make me feel connected to them. I have no idea how this film compares to the myriad other productions of the same title - perhaps it's superior, and I have not read the novel, but I know what I like in movies, and this ain't it. Wish I could get my two+ hours back."
LITTLE WOMEN,22 November 2021,2/10,"I think there were meant to be flashbacks, but I couldn't tell the difference between those and current events. The youngest daughter was played by the same actress (I think), so seeing an adult play a child in one scene and then play her adult self in the next was very weird. Very pretty to look at, though."
