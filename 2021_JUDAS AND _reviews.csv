JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 August 2021,8/10,"The FBI, led by J. Edgar Hoover, is focused on taking down the Black Panther Party and other leftist movements. Agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) pushes car thief Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) to be his informant and to infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party. It is led by charismatic Chairman Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) who is trying to improve Chicago and battle the racist police force.There is an obvious connection to today's events. It's of its time and the present-day time. It's definitely taking a point of view but one can't really argue against it. For sure, it's slanted. Roy Mitchell is the key to finding balance but Jesse Plemons doesn't give him enough depth. He has one fascinating talk about Emmett Till. That's an interesting road to go for that character but it feels like he stops short. He turns into just another callous racist cop when he could be deeper. As for the other characters, Stanfield is the standout and Kaluuya is the saint. Both are great in their roles. This is a very compelling story and its relevance makes it more powerful."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 September 2021,6/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is an American English-language movie that premiered in 2021, so really recent indeed and I got the chance to see this on the big screen the other day. I was also a bit surprised how the open air theater was really packed that day compared to previous days. It probably also had to do with the good weather, not just with this movie, even if I do not want to take anything away from it in terms of quality. The movie runs for over two hours and that makes it a fairly long movie. There is pretty much every awards season one movie with focus on African Americans that really scores big, frequently two or even three films as well, and this is the one from the 2020/2021 awards season. It took home many, many awards, including two Oscars. One was for Daniel Kaluuya and that was no surprise because he dominated the awards season really from beginning to end and was the only safe Oscar win on Academy Award night if we look at the four acting categories. The second Oscar went to Best Song and that was surely a surprise because if I remember correctly, the song from this film that indeed won was only number 4 in terms of probability with the bookmakers. I must say I am still a bit baffled by that win. Did not find the song particularly memorable. Maybe it had to do with the subject, but even there they recently went for Elton John over songs about slavery, so yeah it stays a mystery. Apart from that, the film was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Screenplay and there was another acting nomination in the category that Kaluuya won, plus finally a nomination for the cinematography, the one category where maybe the biggest Oscar night upset happened. If we look at Best Supporting Actor though, it is a bit debatable if Kaluuya was really supporting. He was probably no less lead than in Get Out. In that film, by the way, Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield were starring together as well with the latter's character really not having a lot of screen time. In this film here, Stanfield is lead, not open for discussion. Even with Kaluuya getting first credit and Stanfield being nominated for a supporting Oscar, he is 100% lead.The man (yep, a man, you cannot be sure with this name) behind this movie most of all was writer and director Shaka King. Some short film works, a stoner movie, some television work and now this. Really shows you that it does not matter what you worked on in the past. He was definitely in the right spot at the right time and even the Best Director nomination was not far away. But this year, they picked women and Asian Americans mostly instead. That's okay. King was one of three writers here too. The other two are no big names either. One has worked on a few fairly famous television shows and the other was more of an actor in the past. Definitely a breakthrough for all of them with the Oscar nomination(s) here. And I do not mind the writing nomination at all. It's a tensely written movie with nice attention to detail and I enjoyed the watch as I stated in the title of my review already. I really struggle to this day with the film's title though. Of course, they want Kaluuya's character to be seen as somebody groundbreaking, a great speaker with lots of willpower and dedication, but the comparison to a KKK leader that we hear on several occasions from the bad guy is not entirely absurd. Let's be very clear here. The Black Panthers were a group of radicals. It's absolutely wrong to compare Fred Hamton to the Messiah, i.e. To Jesus Christ. The ways in which he connected groups and managed to do away with boundaries may be one parallel, but his take on the White race is nothing to be proud of at all. Of course, the movie, in times like these with Hollywood more liberal than ever, cannot depict the character as an antagonist. By the way, with the Fred Hampton inclusion here, you could watch this film together with another new movie (that was also nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar), namely The Trial of the Chicago 7. Hampton is part of that film too, obviously played by a different actor.Anyway, I am not too happy with Kaluuya's win. Nothing wrong with the actor or performance, but yeah, this category has become a bit of a category where they focus on Black actors receiving awards. I mean this is fine if they really give the best performance, but the absurdity of Kaaluya not getting in for lead or especially Stanfield being campaigned as supporting is really an embarrassment. As for Kaaluya, I guess they awarded more the character he portrayed than really the acting performance with how much of a strong leader Hampton was. Interesting also to see what career paths his partner (romantic) and his son took after Hampton's death. We find out about that before the closing credits. I cannot talk a lot more about the cast here, simply because I do not know most of the actors. Two exceptions though. Martin Sheen is one, but his role and screen time are so limited that even his biggest fans may overlook him. This could also have to do with the make-up I guess. But Jesse Plemons from Breaking Bad gets a well-deserved mention. He plays the third-biggest character and has not a lot to work with, but when there is something like the scene when he is supposed to talk about his daughter or when he basically blackmails Stanfield's character to get what he wants, he is really nailing his parts so well. Would have been nice to see him nominated in the supporting category because he really belonged there in terms of screen time and his character's significance, but also in terms of how good his performance was. It's kinda hilarious he is now having a better career than basically everybody from Breaking Bad and that may also include Cranston, but then again Plemons is much younger than all the other key players, even Paul. But yeah, I guess the latter was the one you could have expected to break through after the end of the show, but nope it's Plemons reaping all the success and I am optimistic he will be nominated for an Oscar too one day. This film is another piece of evidence that he is on the right track. I also liked the scene in which he joined the rally/speech and acts like everybody else when he supports Hampton with his voice and fists.Aside from that, you get the usual. Some romance linked to Hampton's character and he is even about to become a dad. Inclusions of other influential Black leaders getting killed, which is a bit of a build-up to Hampton's death, but the Judas component is also omnipresent as Stanfield's character is really only an offender to some extent. He basically does not have much of a choice. Also once again because they cannot depict the Black character as a real antagonist with the state Hollywood is in right now. He may have robbed these other Blacks, which makes sense they showed it this way because Black-on-White crime was not really an option. The talk about a badge being more dangerous than a gun was kinda interesting though, even if perhaps a bit too obvious. But yeah, later on Stanfield's character is also threatened by Plemons' that he will reveal his identity which would certainly result in him being killed by his own men. Just like how it happened to somebody else before that. Or actually it didn't as we find out in another exhibit of how Plemons' team are the really bad guys here. They let somebody else happily get away with murder if it works in their favor. Of course, Stanfield's character is still impressed by Kaluuya's, which further adds to the intention that we should see him as a likable guy too, even with how he tries to sneak out of the building and how he eventually is the reason for Kaluuya's character's death. He gives the latter the drink that has him deep asleep. He tells Plemons' character what the apartment or house looks like in detail. He does not pull the trigger on Hampton in the end, but kinda indirectly he does. Or you could say he was just a pawn and if not he, then somebody else would have done it. There the film also offers interesting aspects at the very end when we see the real life version of Stanfield's character and what he has to say about all that. Not likable at all with how he sees himself there, but you can also wonder how much of it was his true self with his (apparent?) suicide following the night of these massive revelations.Okay, that's pretty much it. Overall, there is unfortunately a great deal of agenda with this movie, but it's still tense and entertaining and sometimes even thrilling, so no real hesitation for me here in giving this a positive recommendation. Still, you should only watch it for entertainment reasons and not if you are looking for historic accuracy. The attention to detail is quite nice though. I mentioned some examples, but you could also take the one other Black fella he meets at the club and who is maybe just another pawn. You will probably focus on the woman there initially, but she is just a side character to these two men. How the other man gives him his fake badge from early on was also interesting, even if the sound effects coming with this moment were surely a bit over the top. Yeah, I think the positive here is more frequent than the negative and especially Stanfield and Plemons turn it into quality for the most part. Try to look beyond scenes like those in which we see Kaluuya's character turn his enemies into companions or how unlikely it was there that a guy from the car scam from very early on was around and you can enjoy the watch here too. I still think it is a bit (or more) of a shame that the movie did not put more objectivity on display, but tried to fit certain agendas. I am not surprised though. So yeah, decent film all in all, but nothing more and the awards attention and also the ratings here on imdb and other websites are far too high. It's watchable though, highly at times. There's worse ways to spend 125 minutes I guess. But also better ways and better (2021) movies."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,31 May 2021,6/10,"There is a lot of extrajudicial killings in Judas and the Black Messiah.It being set in America in 1969 should be cause for concern. The murders were carried out by the FBI and local police forces.The film examines the rise of young Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya.) The fiery and passionate Illinois chairman of the Black Panther Party.To J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen under a ton of make up) any black man wanting racial equality either peacefully or violently should be terminated with extreme prejudice.William O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) is the small time car thief who pretended to be an FBI agent. He is coerced by an FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) to be a mole in the Illinois Black Panthers.O'Neal sees Mitchell as a role model. He is a man who never seems to have had one. At least Mitchell might be someone who believes in civil rights. Although Hoover and the FBI do their best to corrupt his world view.Kaluuya has the showier part with his blazing speeches, you can appreciate Hampton's passion and zeal. No wonder Kaluuya became the first British black actor to win an Oscar.Stanfield has the trickier part and his role was underwritten. I felt distant with his scenes and I thought the film never got his angle, just whose side was he really on. It's a question Mitchell asks at one point.The film loses something when Hampton is not present. It should had been his movie and I felt if director Shaka King wanted to focus on O'Neal. He should had followed his life more more after Hampton's death.The movie is framed with O'Neal giving an interview for a PBS documentary called Eyes on the Prize 2 broadcast in 1987. O'Neal comes clean about his role as an informer. He committed suicide on the night his episode was shown."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 February 2021,8/10,"This is the story of Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya ) who lead the Chicago branch. He had one too many bills. It is also the story of Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) the FBI informant who assisted in getting Fred assassinated by the FBI and Chicago Police. The story starts with Fred already as a leader and with Bill getting arrested and becoming an informant.I imagine the role of the traitor was a tough one for LaKeith Stanfield who came through as a reluctant informant. While the film touches on the black struggle, he is not weighed down with being preachy , just letting the facts speak for themselves.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 July 2021,9/10,"Black Panthers - a quite complex group with a lot of history and a lot of things being done to them for what they overall stand for. And the movie on hand here is also quite complex. Because while we understand from the title what the two main characters are standing for, it is not as easy as that.Also this is seen more from the perspective of the ""Judas"" character. Which I reckon you might think of as a bad or good thing. I'd say it works very well for the movie. Now I should also say that I am not or rather was not aware of the story or what actually happened and the real life characters and how it actually all played out.Having said that, the movie does a very good job getting us into the head of that one main character. Even if we may not be entirely sure of his motivations or think we're not, he's out there to save his own skin - survival and all that. There is one scene where ""Wild Bill"" seemingly is completely furious and yells and all that ... just to change his complete behavious when he gets out and in his car. He starts to smile, he's almost kind of proud of his performance. Something that another character also points out to him (Academy Award being mentioned).So the acting is really good. And the Oscar nominations, but also the win are testament of that. Finally cinemas are open again and we are able to watch movies like this in Germany. Very well structured with some back and forth and some extra pointers and explanation of what happens after the movie is over ... a quite intriguing story to say the least ... and one that probably will make you mad ... for all the right reasons. Still a long way to go ... but reminders like this movie right here (hopefully) help."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 April 2021,7/10,"This is a good companion film to a competitor in this year's Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"". Both deal with civil unrest and the fight for racial justice at a time in our nation's history that more and more seems to resemble our present day. History recalls Fred Hampton as a fiery activist, and his portrayal on screen by Daniel Kaluuya depicts a dedicated if controversial leader in the Black Panther Party. It's frightening to see his calling for violence in the streets and death to 'the pigs' in the face of overwhelming odds against a superior police force. On the flip side, it's just as frightening to witness the tactics used by the FBI and it's agents to coerce Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) into a position to rat out his brothers in the cause. Leading the charge was FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who had complete disdain for the Panthers and virtually anyone who didn't conform to his brand of patriotism. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I learned it was Martin Sheen depicting Hoover; his face was so weirdly made up I would never have recognized him. Over all, I can't help but feel the timing of this movie can only bring further divisiveness to a country already split in two on virtually every point of political ideology, and feel inclined to echo Special Agent Roy Mitchell's (Jesse Plemons) poignant remark to the reluctant O'Neal - ""I'm all for civil rights, but you can't cheat your way to equality""."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 February 2021,10/10,"For years I had heard about Fred Hampton. As a community organizer in 1960s Chicago, he was influential in uniting various groups in an armed struggle. Not surprisingly, this made him a prime target of the police.Shaka King's ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" focuses both on Hampton and on William O'Neal, a car thief hired by the FBI to infiltrate the Black Panthers. What the movie really introduced me to was the passion with which Hampton gave his speeches in calling for revolution, as well as how the FBI manipulated O'Neal into betraying Hampton.Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Hampton. His fiery orations make you feel as if you're present in his audience. The rest of the cast is mainly there to support him, namely LaKeith Stanfield as O'Neal. Nonetheless, it's an excellent movie, showing the power of one the US's most important political movements, and the government's aim of crushing it (make no mistake: J. Edgar Hoover - played by Martin Sheen in the movie - was a truly evil person). As Hampton said, you can kill a revolutionary, but you can't kill the revolution."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 March 2021,7/10,"I saw the positive review by Mark Kermode on the BBC News, and then the nominations were announced for Awards Season, and I'm glad this was getting a good amount of attention, it made me much keener to watch it. Basically, set in the late 1960s, seventeen-year-old petty criminal William ""Bill"" O'Neal (Oscar nominated LaKeith Stanfield) is arrested in Chicago for attempting a car hijack whilst posing as a federal officer. FBI Special Agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) approached him and offers to have the charges dropped if O'Neal works undercover for the bureau. O'Neal is assigned to infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP) and its leader, Fred Hampton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Daniel Kaluuya). O'Neal begins to grow close to Hampton, who works to form alliances with rival gangs and militia groups while extending community outreach through the BPP's Free Breakfast for Children Program. Hampton's persuasive skills in the chapel eventually help to form the multiracial Rainbow Coalition. Hampton also falls in love with BPP member Deborah Johnson (BAFTA nominated Dominique Fishback). O'Neal begins to relay intel to Mitchell, who in return compensates him with money. O'Neal learns later from Mitchell that George Sams (Terayle Hill), a fugitive Party member, has been hiding out in the local BPP office and is an informant, allowing the bureau to obtain search warrants. After Hampton is arrested and imprisoned, O'Neal begins to rise through the ranks and is promoted to security captain. When a shootout between the Chicago Police and the BPP occurs at the chapter office, O'Neal sneaks out as the office is bombed by the police. Afterward, Mitchell rejects O'Neal when he wants to quit being an informant. After Hampton is released from prison while appealing his charges, he reunites with Deborah who reveals she is pregnant with his child. BPP member Jake Winters (Algee Smith) is enraged learning of the death of fellow member Jimmy Palmer (Ashton Sanders), who was hospitalised after being shot by a police officer, Palmer is killed while being transferred to another hospital. Winters engages in a shootout with police, killing several officers before being gunned down himself. After Hampton's appeal was rejected, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen) orders Hampton be ""neutralised"" before he returns to prison. Mitchell corners O'Neal into helping with the plan, threatening to expose him to the BPP as an informant, and O'Neal reluctantly agrees to help. O'Neal is later handed sedatives and ordered to drug Hampton's drink. The next evening, BPP members gather at Hampton's apartment before he is taken to prison. Hampton is offered money from an allied gang leader to flee the country, but he turns it down and instead uses the money to establish a trust under Jake's name. As the evening progresses, O'Neal reluctantly drugs Hampton's drink and leaves soon after. Hours later, officers and agents raid the apartment and shoot Hampton dead, also taking Deborah and others into custody. Later, O'Neal meets with Mitchell, giving him money and keys to a gas station he owns. O'Neal attempts to quit again, but reluctantly accepts the money and keys. It ends with archive footage of Hampton's speeches, his funeral procession, and an interview O'Neal gave in 1989. The epilogue explains that O'Neal continued to work as an informant within the BPP before committing suicide. A lawsuit was filed against the FBI in 1970 and twelve years later was settled for $1.85 million. Today, Fred Hampton Jr. And his mother serve as chairman and board member of the Black Panther Party Cubs. Also starring Darrell Britt-Gibson as Bobby Rush, Get Out's Lil Rel Howery as Wayne, and Dominique Thorne as Judy Harmon. Kaluuya is superb as the charismatic and fearsome civil rights activist, Stanfield is equally good as the man spying on the organisation, and in his short time, Sheen is well cast as the monstrous Hoover. I'm not going to pretend I know (or care) a lot about politics or religion, but with Black Lives Matter and equality issues in recent news, this film feels like it came at the right moment, as it perfectly captures the period, the tumultuous times of racial injustice, with great performances, a thriller-like atmosphere, style, and humanity, it is a watchable biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""Fight for You"" by H. E. R. (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, and Best Casting. Very good!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 April 2021,,It is a intense and sad film about the fight for civil rights. Great acting. It's a good watch.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 September 2021,7/10,"As a relative newcomer (i.e. Non-American) to the stories surrounding Fred Hampton, I approached this with some degree of scepticism. I was not a fan of ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"" (2020) and was expecting something along similar lines. Thankfully, this is a completely different style of film that attempts to explore, explain and develop much more about the personalities involved. The premiss here being that the FBI plant a man (""O'Neal"") amongst his brethren to help them keep tabs on the activities of their man of interest. Both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya as the hugely charismatic Hampton excel in their roles. It's not a straightforword good v evil, or even black v white style of story. Shaka King has created a much more nuanced assessment of the men, the system, the prejudices and intolerances - across the board - in a way that is raw yet refined. Does the end always justify the means? Are we in the realms of saints and sinners, or are there just those who sin a bit less - or a bit more justifiably? These are questions we are asked and for which we are encouraged to draw our own conclusions. Perhaps I would have liked a more substantial performance from Martin Sheen as J. Edgar Hoover - not for star purposes, but because i felt the story could have benefitted from more exposure to the views and policies of a man (on behalf of a Government) who clearly had an agenda that here is rather undercooked. Still, it is a fine example of provocative film making that shies not from some of the least savoury aspects of human nature. Well worth a watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 May 2021,7/10,"In 1969 a small-time crook, Bill O'Neal, is arrested by the FBI and given a way out of a several-year prison sentence: infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers and report on their activities. The FBI is particularly interested in the Chairman of the chapter, Fred Hampton, as he is viewed as a revolutionary and a threat to national security. O'Neal's main task is to bring down Hampton.An interesting and thought-provoking drama, based on a true story. Shows well the confrontational relationship, a war, essentially, that existed between African-American activists and the police at the time. Shows also the needless bloodshed it caused, largely by the police, and the excessive, heavy-handed, illegal methods used by the police.Not entirely engaging though. While the police are clearly in the wrong, the Black Panthers are hardly angels either. For all the good they do in black communities, their militantism just adds fuel to the fire. This makes it difficult to get squarely behind them and Fred Hampton.The obvious person to support is Bill O'Neal, the man stuck in the middle of all this but, while LaKeith Stanfield puts in a solid performance as O'Neal, his character isn't given enough depth to make us truly support him. The other issue for the O'Neal character is that Daniel Kaluuya puts in a superb, spellbinding performance as Hampton, overshadowing Stanfield/O'Neal.Overall, interesting and edifying but not brilliant."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 February 2021,9/10,". . . J. Edgar Hooker, aka Mary Silk-Slip. Though Mary remains a curse word among informed U.S. citizens for ruthlessly slaughtering John Garfield, Ethel Rosenberg, Errol Flynn, Malcolm X, JFK, M.L.King, Jr., Jimmy Hoffa, Norma Jean Baker, Walter Reuther and Bob Kennedy, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH highlights his assassination of Fred Hampton, 21. The always eponymous Warner Bros. use JUDAS to warn viewers that agents of the Federal Butchers Ilk have mercilessly murdered at least 100 average U.S. patriots such as ourselves for each famous personage they've rubbed out like Mr. Hampton. The prolific prognosticators of Warner predict that as long as the rogue agency is allowed to maintain the criminal culture instigated by Mary Silk-Slip, while erecting buildings and statues in his sordid memory, America has more in common with a KGB-controlled Red Commie Kremlin dictatorship than with any brand of Democracy, no matter how diminished. As Fred and the Warner seers say, ""Capitalism has just one goal: To exploit the People."""
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 March 2021,9/10,"Watching ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" for me was more academic than entertainment. Some years ago I read the Jeffrey Haas book titled ""The Assassination of Fred Hampton,"" so I was apprised of all the events surrounding Fred Hampton's death. More importantly, I went through several stages of anger when reading the book which prepared me for the movie. So, the question for me going in was: how will the movie measure up factually to the book I read?I say that the movie was brilliant. It was a fair and honest assessment of the Black Panther Party (BPP) especially at that time and it was a fair representation of Fred Hampton (played by Daniel Kaluuya). As far as the Judas in this saga, William O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield), I knew very little about him and I didn't care to know much about him. I knew all I needed to know: he provided the floor plan of Fred's home for Chicago P.D. to bust in and kill Fred in his sleep. Still, ""Judas"" gives the audience a deeper look into the life of O'Neal just before his involvement with the BPP up until the fateful day on December 4, 1969. We get a picture of a confused man who, while working for the FBI, seems to want to help the BPP in its goals. But, in all of his confusion he remains selfish in that self-preservation comes first for him.Fred Hampton, on the other hand, is the total opposite. Self-preservation and selfishness is not a part of his DNA. And what needs to be remembered is that Fred Hampton was only twenty-one when he was killed. He was a bright, charismatic, and sincere young man who accomplished much good and could've accomplished so much more, and I think ""Judas"" did a phenomenal job portraying that.I'm biased, I know. I have an affinity for Fred Hampton and the BPP though I wasn't alive during their reign, so any positive portrayals I'd probably like. Having said that, I still look for accuracy and I've read enough to be able to spot BS. Every movie is going to add dramatizations and an event here and there to increase the drama and I think that's acceptable so long as it doesn't significantly alter the facts. ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" toes the fact-line and also entertains."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 June 2021,7/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee's ""BlackKklansman"" from a couple of years ago. But whereas Lee's film was angry, funny, and fabulously entertaining, ""Judas"" is more somber and feels saddled with the burden of being IMPORTANT.Daniel Kaluuya received most of the attention and the Oscar for playing Fred Hampton, leader of the Black Panthers who was assassinated as part of an FBI raid. But it's Lakeith Stanfield, as the film's titular Judas, who impressed me more. Kaluuya's performance consists of a series of loud speeches, but Stanfield is the character with the story arc, a man who must live with his decision to act as an FBI informant. Stanfield was at least nominated along with Kaluuya, but true to Academy form, loud and showy always triumphs over quiet and thoughtful.It's a solid bit of movie making, but it's lacking something that could have made it a blaze of outrage rather than the tsk tsk tsking history lesson that it is.The end credits song ""Fight for You"" brought the film a second Oscar, while it scored additional nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.Grade: B+"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Electrifying. Towering. Ferocious. Choose whatever superlative you prefer to describe Daniel Kaluuya's performance as Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. Remarkably, Mr. Kaluuya captures Hampton's legendary oratory skills, and his stage presence reminds of Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning turn as Idi Amin in THE KING OF SCOTLAND (2006). And the most stunning part is that this isn't even really a story about Hampton. Director Shaka King, who co-wrote the script with Will Berson from a story by the Lucas brothers, Kenneth and Keith, actually devotes more time to Bill O'Neal, the FBI informant played by LaKeith Stanfield (SHORT TERM 12, 2013).The film opens with a montage of activists in the 1960s, including Bobby Seale, and transitions right into a 1968 FBI symposium where director J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen in botched make-up) tells the auditorium full of agents that the Black Panthers are the greatest security threat to America. From there we watch as Bill O'Neal, wearing a trench coat and fedora, steals a car from a group of men in a pool hall simply by waving an FBI badge. When he's apprehended, it's that badge, not the car, that puts young O'Neal (he was 19 at the time) in the precarious situation of going to prison or accepting (actual) FBI Agent Roy Mitchell's (Jesse Plemons, I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS, 2020) offer to infiltrate the Black Panthers as a federal informant.One of the film's most memorable lines occurs when Agent Mitchell asks O'Neal why he impersonated an agent. The reply: because ""a badge is scarier than a gun"". It's a belief that still holds true more than 50 years later. And that sentiment is a key part of Mr. King's film. Blatant racism within law enforcement is on display through both the Chicago Police Department's harassment, and the FBI (and Hoover's) strategy to prevent the rise of black people.As fascinating as Hampton and O'Neal are as characters (and real life men), the script falters in a couple of ways. We never really get to know Hampton except as the fire and brimstone speaker on stage. As impressive as that is, it's a mystery to us how this 21 year old man became so inspirational and skilled at forming alliances. His ""rainbow coalition"" goal to unite local groups to battle 'the establishment' is remarkable, but we are left to wonder if feeding the poor and opening a local medical center were possible through any method other than all-out war. And if so, why the stock pile of guns? Another letdown with the script is that we are not shown how O'Neal manages to become so quickly trusted, and promoted to head of security.Most of this is told through the eyes of O'Neal, and Stanfield is terrific at capturing the internal conflict and constant danger. Included here are dramatic recreations of O'Neal's interview on a 1989 PBS documentary entitled ""Eyes on the Prize 2"", and he admits to considering Agent Mitchell a role model. Unfortunately, the movie never shows this type of connection between the men. Rather, it's an awkward and forced bond between two men, neither of which are comfortable with the actions required of their situation. That's not to say the two don't share some tense moments, because they do. Especially effective is when Mitchell explains to O'Neal that the Black Panthers are the same, and equally destructive, as the Ku Klux Klan.Writer-director King and writers Berson, Lucas, and Lucas are all best known for their TV work, so this is a huge step forward for them. It's a powerful movie that explains some of the Black Panther ideology and how it was treated by law enforcement. The ""War versus Politics"" explanation cuts to the bone, as do the actual clips played over the opening and closing credits. Dominique Fishback deserves mention for her terrific supporting turn as Hampton's girlfriend, especially in her final scene. If you've ever wondered about the responsibility of leading a revolution, or the inner turmoil of being a snitch, then you'll find some answers in this memorable film from Shaka King.

JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 August 2021,8/10,"Learning more about the Black Panther movement is one of the reasons to watch this fast-moving film directed By Shaka King. While most history books paint the Black Panthers in a negative light, the admirable politics and ideology of that movement are finally given a chance to surface here for the general populace.Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), a young, charismatic activist, becomes Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party - putting him directly in the crosshairs of the government, the FBI, and the Chicago Police. But to destroy the revolution, the authorities are going to need a man inside - that man is career thief William O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) placed by his handler Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons). The result of that insertion is the tragic death of Hampton.The blaccent dialogue speeds out and is at many times blurred: subtitles save the day in many of the especially fast scenes. Casting Martin Sheen as J. Edgar Hoover is questionable, but he is on screen for only moment. The cast is uniformly excellent - especially Daniel Kaluuya, LaKeith Stanfield, and Dominique Fishback (who plays Hampton's wife). To understand the dialogue requires intense concentration, even from British actor Kaluuya. Despite flaws, the film is important to see and to view the Black Panthers in a better light."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 February 2021,,"What most of us know going into Judas and the Black Messiah is that the 1969 Illinois chairman of The Black Panther party, Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), is destined to be assassinated like his counterpart Malcolm X and in the spirit of Martin Luther King. What we don't know is that Fred was only 21, shy, a father-to-be, and a warm-hearted devotee of human rights.Director Shaka King's docudrama is strongest when Fred interacts with his fellow revolutionaries like Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield), albeit Bill will turn out to be an informant for the FBI and contribute to Fred's death. As Fred encourages his colleagues to violent overthrow, he is light as air in his embrace of those closest to him, especially his love and future mother of his boy, Dominique (Deborah Johnson).Writers King and Will Berson carefully show the ambivalences that permeate the parlous circumstances, such as Fred's awareness of his life in danger versus the blinding need to put himself in harm's way to further the cause for liberation of Black people. And the torn allegiance of Bill to his role as informant versus his growing affection for the movement. And agent Roy Mitchell's (Jesse Plemons) lack of affect when he guides Roy to Fred's death but our suspicion that he is becoming sympathetic to the cause.The camera is our guide--it takes us up close to the participants, making us as claustrophobic as they while the doom slowly approaches. In other words, drama is present even in the cold reality of bloody history.Kaluuya and Stanfield should be nominated for Oscars as should the film. Yet the real winner will be the audience, which will have a front row seat to history and a heavy heart for those brave young idealists who gave the full measure to their dreams."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,6/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is one film to watch for historical purposes as it's showcase of how one leader and group fought for what they believed in. Plus the film is even more relevant in today's times and culture with the issues of the police and African American community. The movie set back in 60's Chicago tells the rise and times of one Fred Hampton(in a pretty good performance from Daniel Kaluuya) and the Black Panther Party. Seen are the struggles and social doubts that the people had when dealing with wanting to live just a normal way of life in their communities and neighborhoods. Hampton an outspoken and freedom seeking leader just wanted change and equal rights for people of color yet was misunderstood by the establishment and the federal government from big dog J. Edgar Hoover on down as they wanted to wipe out the party for good.The film is full of drama and emotion with of course some scenes of guns, knives, and violence and the underbelly and subplot wild card character is found in one Bill O' Neal(LaKeith Stanfield) who follows along with Hampton and the Party only his means and efforts as an FBI informant is a dark cloud over the heads of all involved. Overall this film is pretty good historical storytelling that's informative and relevant with today's culture and times clearly it should be one picture that any movie or history buff should view."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,8/10,"""The film exudes the vibes of vigor, solemnity and righteousness exemplified by the recent African-American political cinema (like Ava DuVernay's SELMA 2014, for instance), racism is a dyed-in-the-wool precondition, and execrably unjust atrocities are ubiquitously subjected to the downtrodden and minorities. One might wonder, for those who are woke enough and repulsed to the core towards the congenital and systemically corrupted human barbarity, what is exactly the appeal here apart from broadening one's horizons? The quintessential preaching-to-the-choir dilemma.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 April 2021,5/10,"I'm definitely in the minority here, but this movie about the events leading up to the government assassination of a black leader never really clicked with me.One issue is practical; I found it difficult to understand what certain characters were saying. This was particularly true of Daniel Kaluuya. From the video at the end I think Kaluuya does a good job of speaking in Hampton's voice, but as Jennifer Jason Leigh's long ago performance as Dorothy Parker showed us, emulating the voice of someone who is difficult to understand can really hurt a movie.I also - and I think this is only partly because of the tricky accent - didn't really understand Hampton. Sure, he's a noble guy who wants to help people and feels the violence of systemic racism and terror must be answered with violence if necessary, but where did this come from? What was the process and circumstances that brought him here. It's not that I don't understand what was going on in general, but the movie doesn't really work to create a context.Bill O'Neal is also hard to get. This is true of the real man, but it makes for a movie in which the two main characters are enigmas and the only one supplying real heart and humanity is Dominique Fishback as his wife. It would have been a better movie if she had been the focal point rather than O'Neal.In the same way, the movie doesn't really give a solid context for the Black Panthers, which comes across as a weird mix of school, soup kitchen, and army. Were they about self defense or violent revolution? Which was more important to them, the guns or the schools?Perhaps there aren't clear answers. Perhaps the Black Panthers didn't have a coherent philosophy and Hampton never explained himself. But I just couldn't connect with the movie, and was often bored by it, although it improved as it went along.I can't recommend it and don't understand how it got nominated for an Oscar, but as I say, I'm clearly in the minority."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 August 2021,7/10,"Essentially a two-hander concerning both prominent Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and hustler-turned-FBI-informant Bill O'Neal, 'Judas And The Black Messiah (2021)' tells one of the many frustrating tales surrounding the US government's shady but nowadays not-so-secret efforts to quash any form of racial equality within its jurisdiction. O'Neal is, for the most part, the piece's POV character, acting as a way for the audience see behind the scenes of both the Black Panther party and the FBI's efforts the crush it. That doesn't mean that Hampton is relegated to a lesser role, though; he dominates the screen whenever he's present, yet he's humanised in such a way that he comes across as much more than a series of rousing speeches and steadfast negotiations. Both characters are played almost to perfection, their respective actors - Kaluuya and Stanfield - encapsulating the dualities and nuances that the script demands. It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day. The narrative is really upsetting - angering, even - because it tells the tale of a total massacre of justice; the betrayals of the picture - which extend beyond its title's bold metaphor - hit you where it hurts. 7/10."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,8/10,"A knowledge of American history over the last fifty years and, in particular, a knowledge of what went down in the Black Panther Movement would help but is far from essential in getting a great deal out of Shaka King's superb new film ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" which tells the story of how Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was betrayed by F.B.I. informant Bill O'Neal leading to his assassination by J. Edgar Hoover's thugs supposedly acting in the name of the law. It's a shocking story and since I wasn't aware of these events before I suppose I approached the film like a piece of good fiction, (it's certainly not trying to be a documentary), and it grips like any really good thriller should.A terrific Daniel Kaluuya, (in Oscar-worthy form), is Hampton and the consistently brilliant LaKeith Stanfield is just as good as his Judas while Jessie Plemons has his best big-screen role to date as the F.B.I. agent who recruits O'Neal. Dominque Fishback is also very good as the activist who falls for Hampton and has his son. This is an actor's piece in the best sense of the term and it's beautifully shot by Sean Bobbitt. Of course, it's also a deeply political film and the audience for political films is limited and without that prior knowledge I spoke of, you might find some of it confusing but as a thriller about betrayal and as an expose of how ruthless governments can be, (nothing new there, of course), it works superbly and ultimately that's all that matters. How much of it actually happened in the way King tells it I have no idea but it certainly feels right and it deserves to be widely seen."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 April 2021,8/10,"I would say that was excellent served film. I liked content, it got my attention whole 2 hours. The movie wasn't too long for me, maybe, even too short because it was interesting to watch. I like that in nowadays( 2020-2021) there's more and more movies created based on black culture. There are more black people in films and they can finally receive decent acknowledgement at Oscar's and other nominees. Acting was marvelous, everyone did great job. This movie is second best of this year that I've seen so far( Justice league in first). I believe that this film deserves atleast 8 Imdb but haters gona hate, it's very relevant in today's culture. Sad ending, sad story but good movie, really worth to watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a remarkable piece of history to make into a movie, regardless of the veracity of its arguably and relatively flattering portrayal of the Black Panthers and the depiction of the killing of Fred Hampton as an assassination by police and the FBI and beyond the religious properties bestowed upon its Judas and black messiah. That's because it's reflexively about the art of public performance, as well as propaganda, whether from the Panthers or feds. And it's to the writers and director Shaka King's credit how they develop the story and titular dichotomy. One, William O'Neal, as played by Lakeith Stanfield, is a conman who pretends to be a G-man and is subsequently turned to be an FBI informant who pretends to be a Black Panther. Stanfield, an actor, playing an actor twice over. The other, Hampton, a Panther Chicago chairman, portrayed by Daniel Kaluuya, is treated as the more authentic one, except as him and the organization are painted by the government as terrorists the equivalent of the Klan.Moreover, the drama is framed by an interview in a PBS documentary episode from ""Eyes on the Prize."" There's an entire other ""war and politics"" going on here beside the social commentary on race and police, of authenticity and fiction playing out between the characters within the picture, as well as with the adjacent documentary film-within-the-film. Because of this, the eventual and usual based-on-a-true-story switch to real archival footage is considerably more intriguing. It's a shame that the straightforward depiction of Sorkinisms as history in ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" (2020), where Hampton and Bobby Seale also received short shrift, should receive more awards attention than something like this that engages with the boundaries of fact and fiction (or that it should over a better courtroom drama such as ""Mangrove"" (2020), but I digress).The only potentially major fault in this regard with ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" may be that it gives too much time to the uncomplicated enacted history of the FBI. I wonder whether the government's slander and conspiracy against Hampton and the Panthers would've been better served by less, including less of Martin Sheen in loads of make-up as J. Edgar Hoover. And, as much as I'm beginning to admire the acting of Jesse Plemons (who was also impressive in ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" (2020)), he and the rest of the FBI characters lack the subtlety to not interfere with the otherwise delicate balance between fact and fiction, right and wrong, pretending one thing and performing another.Kaluuya really threatens, if not entirely accomplishes, to steal the show here. His Hampton is a well, if widely, fleshed-out character, whether delivering controversial and charismatic rhetoric seeming to incite police killings or refusing to take part in violence in practice, instead focusing on organizing community aid and multi-racial recruitment, as well as starting a family with Dominique Fishback's Deborah Johnson, her the poet (interesting, too, that the last time I saw her, she was a rap artist in ""Project Power"" (2020)) to his sometimes careless but effective public speaking. Stanfield's O'Neal is somewhat underdeveloped by comparison, although the actor is good in the role, if not quite the Academy Award level that Plemons's FBI agent suggests at one point. Unlike Hampton, he's not given a home life--at least not until the implication of such in the documentary interview. So, we have a main protagonist who acts in three words, of ordinary crime (importantly, ever the actor, a con and not an armed robbery), as G-man, and as Black Panther, but who has no true home, no real identity. Perhaps, that's the point. If Hampton is humanized beyond the malicious FBI narrative and the charismatic orator, maybe O'Neal it's suggested could be anyone--indeed, pretended to be different identities--while never fully embodying any full character, resistant to picking sides in the war, not giving the politics much thought."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 March 2021,,"Bolstered by two powerhouse performances from two of the brightest acting talents working in Hollywood today, Judas and the Black Messiah is a potent & provocative slice of American history that renders the life & legacy of Fred Hampton on film with endless zeal, charged intensity & bracing authenticity, and definitely ranks amongst the first cinematic gems of 2021.Co-written & directed by Shaka King, this biopic is crafted with as much restraint as it seethes with rage and King does a brilliant job at placing & highlighting the issues of the present in this dramatisation of the past. The plot stays compelling, the script retains its sharp edge & King's direction exhibits deft composure from start to finish, plus neat work in other aspects help uplift the narrative even more.The finest aspect however are the performances. Daniel Kaluuya has an undeniable aura about him and his screen presence here makes his commanding performance as Black Panther Party's deputy chairman all the more convincing. Lakeith Stanfield plays the informant whose betrayal leads to Hampston's assassination at the hands of the FBI and his input is just as impressive as Kaluuya. Jesse Plemons is always reliable and he's no different here.Overall, Judas and the Black Messiah packs a raw power & vicious energy which it channels through its sophisticated imagery & skilful storytelling to offer a biopic that not only honours the life of Fred Hampston but also emboldens everything he stood for. An incisive indictment of the oppression & injustice of minorities in America and its corrupt system's incessant need to silence any voice of reason & revolution that rises from the subjugation, Judas and the Black Messiah comes recommended."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 April 2021,9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" (2021) is a real movie about real things - so to speak. I was surprised by how this movie that tells a very true story but at the same time a very distant one from were i live got me by surprise and kept me involved in its story from start till finish. This is a universal story i think, and not one made just for specific place and audience.Performances by Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield were superb. I also liked acting by an always reliable Jesse Plemons - they all deserves awards. Also at running time 2 h this movie never dragged and was superbly involving for me from a get go. All in all this film was a real deal."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 February 2021,8/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch a man who is an informant of the FBI infiltrating the Black Panther Party. He has to gain their trust and give the information he has to the FBI. His work is very difficult and many times is on the ledge.I liked this movie very much because it was very interesting, full of suspense and it contained many great scenes. Regarding the direction which was made by Shaka King, it was very good and he created a great mysterious atmosphere that was kept through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of both Daniel Kaluuya who played as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield who played as Bill O'Neal were simply amazing and I believe they elevated the movie. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Jesse Plemons' who played as Roy Mitchell. To sum up, I have to say that ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a great biography movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,8/10,"4 out of 5 stars.Judas and the Black Messiah is a good biographical drama film about BIll (Lakeith Stanfield) impersonating as an FBI towards other african americans to steal there cars. When he is captured by Roy (Jesse Plemons) and becomes an informant to infiltrate the black panther party that is run by Fred (Daniel Kaluuya).Good plot. Strong drama. The film does play very similar to The Departed film with Lakeith Stanfield going undercover with Black panther party. While they believe there is a rat in there organization which Bill is trying to stay hidden away. While the police law enforcement are continuously taunting and discriminating them.Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya delivers powerful performances. The film does have some intense and thrillinf direction. With a moving script about people being discriminated for there race.The film does lose its momentum by the time it reaches its third act. Otherwise, it is a good film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 March 2021,8/10,"The tragic story of charismatic Black Panther party chairman Fred Hampton isn't a tale that is as well known to the general public as some of the other high profile activists of the late 60's and 70's but the true story of Hampton and one of his offsiders (also an F.B.I informant) Bill O'Neal makes for thrilling and important viewing in Shaka King's feature.Produced by Hollywood heavy hitter Ryan Coogler and starring two of the most promising young talents in the industry (both recently Oscar nominated for their turns here) in the form of Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya and the always interesting rapper turned actor LaKeith Stanfield, Judas and the Black Messiah is a top notch and quality production that works both as an insightful drama and an at times pulse-pounding thriller.Filmed with an energy and verve that remains constantly moving throughout, King gets stuck straight into the meat of the tale as we follow Stanfield's petty criminal with not much of a conscience O'Neal get sprung and offered the choice of jail-time or undercover work that will see him working for Jesse Plemon's career thinking agent Roy Mitchell who wants to take down Kaluuya's Hampton before the inspiring leader is able to build up too much of a following/army.Most elements and side players take a back seat here to what is a commanding and awards worthy performance from Kaluuya who chews the scenery in a good way here as Hampton and whether his rallying his people via inspiring rallies or merely spending one on one time with those close to him, Kaluuya is magnetic here and wonderfully plays off a more subdued Stanfield who has a tricky task of playing the hard too read O'Neal but does so with aplomb as his free thinking and self-centered man begins to understand there are causes far greater than his at stake in this life he lives.In what's a major plus for the film, these characters remain the anchor to King's tale throughout and Messiah never once feels as though its beginning to get overly preachy or agenda driven with King and his performers allowing this tale to speak for itself and in doing so, the heavy hits that lay in store for viewers hit harder and in a more personable way than other similar tales that lose sight of their heart and soul, making Messiah a unique feeling experience that tells a tale for a our now in a fresh way, delivered with a passion and integrity that should see it remain relevant for years yet to come.Final Say -A powerful dramatic thriller based in fact that features some quality performances and announces Shaka King to Hollywood and the world, Judas and the Black Messiah is fiery affair that engages from its opening frame right up until its sombre end.4 stolen cars out of 5"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 July 2021,6/10,"For starters, excellent casting and performances, but I had trouble understanding Daniel Kaluuya when he was talking faster than an auctioneer.The directing and cinematography were decent, but the score was too loud and overbearing in some parts.But my main issue was the writing; it felt like an uneven collection of episodes, none flowing well from one to another, with a downplayed narrative, simultaneously overreaching and underachieving the story's message, which results in an informative but unenlightening screenplay."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,7/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah (2021) :
Movie Review -If you are looking for the first sensational film of the year 2021 in Hollywood then Judas and the Black Messiah could be one of the worth try. It's been many years since we are seeing the revolutionary subject being taken by the filmmakers to explore and analyse the historical events which might be unknown and unheard by many people around the globe. Taking this trend forward, director Shaka King has brought a heart-breaking chapter from Black Panther Party's revolutionary movement. The overall nature of the film takes you to the intense world, from where there's no exist for two busy Hours.Judas and the Black Messiah is a American biographical drama about the betrayal of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party in late-1960s Chicago, at the hands of William O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), an FBI informant. Some people knows a lot about it already, some knows nothing at all so it is very much possible that the verdict of this could get mixed response from both the sides. On the other hand neutral audience will be Bound to ride along with it as the powerful narrative does not fall short anywhere.Most of the times biographicals go wrong with the conviction trying to conceal the explosive and disturbing facts but Judas And The Black Messiah don't fall for it. That uncompromised vision and maverick structure of the story finds an authentic way to touch the emotions of the audience. Even the screenplay remains engaging throughout the runtime despite several slow moving chapters and that's where the intensifying nature of the storytelling emerges victorious. The dialogues are powerful, poignant and has heart at the right place. You can feel the emotions when Hampton says the following quote in his speech, ""You can murder a liberator, but you can't murder the liberation. You can murder a freedom fighter but you can't murder Freedom."" It's bit hard to understand sometimes with that typical accent but the essence of it required the same.Daniel Kaluuya as Chairman Hampton delivers a mind-blowing act. Throughout the film you just can't take your eyes off him, yes he's that powerful. Lakeith Stanfield in the second lead performs all the natural duties exactly the same as it was meant to be. The best after these two are Jesse Plemons and Dominique Fishback in the supporting roles. Whenever any intense scene needed an extra boost in the form of technical support, the background score rises like a sunshine.Shaka King's direction should be considered on serious level for the conviction he brought in the story. Even though the climax doesn't hit the high bar, whatever we see before it is worth watching and by far enough. The structural engineering of the film gets all the things right with its utter careful nature. In a nutshell, Judas And The Black Messiah provides more than enough to the viewers and also exposes a lot of scams from the revolutionary event without hesitating for a moment. Watch it.RATING - 7/10*"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,"Amazing acting n top notch cinematography.From the beginning and as the synopsis suggest, we as audiences are already informed about the ending but the real deal is the way it happened in reality, that really shook me up man.This movie aint par with The Trial of the Chicago 7 as far as entertainment is concerned but it is definitely very informative and made me read about the trials n tribulations the African Americans faced.
These fellas are the true champions of everything in life."

JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 May 2021,8/10,"This is American history. Leaves me behind stunned after having watched it. I knew this racist part of history would be shocking and violent, but seeing an entire movie about it, hits home quite a bit harder than simply reading about it in history books, therefore I would recommend this movie to anyone interested into civil rights struggle during the sixties and seventies.Subtle, slowburning and excellent direction. Great acting performances.At the end of this movie the documentary ""The Eye of Prize"" was credited. It is a documentary tv series about the civil rights struggle."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" (2021 release; 126 min.) brings the story of up-and-coming Black movement leader Fred Hampton, and FBI informant Bill O'Neal. As the film opens, we are reminded this is ""Inspired by True Events"". We are in ""Chicago 1968"", not long after MLK's murder incited riots across the country. We meet Bill, who impersonates an FBI agent in an attempt to steal a car. He gets caught and real FBI agent Roy Mitchell dangles an offer to Bill: become an FBI informant and infiltrate the local Black Panthers Party, or serve 5 years in jail for impersonating a federal officer. Reluctantly Bill agrees. Meanwhile, in the Illinois Black Panther Party, chairman Fred is restless. ""I am a revolutionary!', he tells the Black Panthers Party followers. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after being in development hell for years, the movie finally was made with writer-director Shaka King, making his feature length debut. And what a debut it is! The story of the Chicago Black Panthers is a reminder of the difficult and at times appalling times this country went through in the late 60s from a Black movement and civil rights perspective. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (here portrayed in a small but remarkable role by Martin Sheen) was an outright bigot and racist who claimed with a straight face that the biggest threat faced by this country was not the Russians or the Chinese, but ""the rise of a Black messiah"" (Hoover's exact words). Then there is the tragic situation of Bill O'Neal, who is put in an impossible position with no good choices. The movie puts it in the right perspective, without exaggerating or being overly dramatic about it. Then there is Fred Hampton, played dynamically by British actor Daniel Kaluuya (""Queen & Slim""). Kaluuya is already mentioned frequently in the Oscar Award discussions, and rightfully so. Last but certainly not least, there is a boatload of great music in the film, both as to the original score (from veteran Mark Isham) and as to song placements, leading to not one but two soundtrack albums (the original score, and the songs ""inspired"" by the film).""Judas and the Black Messiah"" premiered a few weeks ago at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate critical acclaim and buzz. The movie opened this weekend in theaters, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, about 10 people, which is on the higher side of what I typically see these days in theaters as we continue to deal with COVID-19 raging in this country, and with the rest of the movieplex pretty much resembling a ghost town. Meanwhile if you have any interest in Black movement/civil rights issues of the late 60s, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 April 2021,6/10,"I almost went to see 'Judas and the Black Messiah' in theatres but ultimately decided to watch it on HBOmax instead. I think that was a wise decision in hindsight. I like my cinema movies to have a little bit of x-factor and be an entertaining ""popcorn"" flick if you will. This movie was instead a grind. I understand true stories have an obligation to be faithful to the real events, but when they're this dull I don't think anyone would mind you spicing them up a bit.Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield have each been nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for this film. I'm not sure how I feel about that. It's not that they were bad - they were terrific. But they were also both in almost the entire film. How can anyone who was actually in a supporting role compete with that? Kaluuya will likely take home the award for this reason and it just doesn't sit quite right with me.This isn't a bad film, it's just not a fun watch. Between the clear political agenda the film has and the fact that there isn't a likeable character anywhere in sight there just wasn't a lot to enjoy from an audience perspective. How well it is made and performed paves over a lot of those cracks luckily. But this is still not a film I will recommending people rush out and see."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,10 May 2021,10/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a movie the Mrs. And I caught at the movies just after the holidays. The storyline is told from the eyes of Bill O'Neil who made an agreement with the American authorities to infiltrate the Black Panthers in exchange for his freedom. He infiltrates the local Chicago chapter and meets a quickly rising man, Fred Hampton, who is pushing for schools, hospitals and a health system to support the black Americans in Chicago underserved by the American government. Fred relies heavily on Bill to be his driver and right hand as he gains momentum on various initiatives and starts recruiting outside of black Americans to other groups who are not supported by America. As momentum grows on Fred's movement so does the case Bill and the American government is building against him. This movie is directed by Shaka King (Newly Weeds) and stars Daniel Kaluuya (Queen & Slim), LaKeith Stanfield (Selma), Dominique Fishback (The Hate U Give), Martin Sheen (Dead Zone) and Jesse Plemons (The Irishman). This movie is outstanding in every way. The use of music, the cinematography, the acting, the camera angles, the focus on the expression of people's faces as things are unfolding and even how they work the original interviews into the credits...all movie gold. Even the messages throughout the film are fantastic. It's is hard to believe Hampton was just a kid doing all of this. This is an epic masterpiece and a must see. I easily score this a 10/10."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 March 2021,,"While the acting is good, the deadly pacing kills the drama in this historical look at the Black Panthers and the FBI snitch who helped set up a series of police raids that led to many deaths.Martin Sheen injects some life into the proceedings as creepy J. Edgar Hoover, but Jesse Plemons is like walking death as the FBI agent who coerces Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) into being a rat.Daniel Kaluuya practically speaks in tongues and I could decipher only about half of what he said as Fred Hampton, the target of the FBI raids in Chicago's branch of the Panthers.Violent but not very interesting."

This movie is based on the true story of Fred Hampton, the Chairman of the Chicago, Illinois Black Panther Party during the 1960's & 70's. Daniel plays Fred. LaKeith plays William O'neal, the man recruited by the F.B.I. to infiltrate the Black Panthers and inform on Daniel and his associates. Martin plays the head of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover-in almost unrecognizable make_up-and Jesse plays the F.B.I. agent that is blackmailing LaKeith to be a rat. Punches are not pulled, as far as storytelling goes. As our former president once said, 'There is good and bad on both sides.' Daniel is shown as uniting people of different races at his meetings-he gets people of all colors, including white and brown to attend-and he also has militant people working for him that want nothing more than to bring bloodshed to 'The Man'. Some of the normally thought of as good guys are shown doing.....well, let's just say, less than good guy deeds. The end credits inform you of what happened to certain people after the events of the movie are over.
It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental for anyone not familiar with all the details."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 March 2021,8/10,"With 6 Oscar Nominations earlier this week Judas and The Black Messiah has been gaining great praise and today I found the time to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film tells the story of how a police informant infiltrated The Black Panther organisation and became connected to the leader.Main Character
Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor and he plays the leader of The Black Panther movement Fred Hampton and he is fantastic. You see the real passion he has for this character and film and it makes Hampton such a great person and Kaluuya gets everything out of it with a charismatic performance that was well worth is Oscar Nomination. LaKeith Stanfield plays the FBI informant Bill O'Neal and he is also superb, you see how his character is really stuck between two worlds and his loyalty and freedom. He gives a really strong performance that works well along Kaluuya's and both of them really shine and he also deserves his nomination.Supporting Characters
Jesse Plemons plays the FBI agent and he is really good, Plemons is just a great actor and it is nice to see him getting more roles, especially interesting ones like in this film. Dominique Fishback plays a member of The Panther movement and she is great, a really powerful performance from a pretty inexperienced actress and it is a bit of a shame that she didn't get more recognition for her really strong performance. Even Michael Sheen is great in his small role in this film, playing a pretty bad guy effectively. The cast is easily the best thing in this film and this is one of the best acted films in recent times and it deserves the appreciation it gets.Story
The story is interesting, showing the development of The Black Panther movement and the people that are involved in it. Also the character development is great, due in large parts to the performances but the plot is well showed and well respected with the real life events that took place. However, I can't deny that at times the story felt a bit too vast, it focuses on certain characters and elements that are underdeveloped and it does bog the film down and take away the focus off our two main characters for a portion of the film.Script
The script is really well written, the dialogue is really strong and the drama hits the levels that it very much needs. Also the film does a really good job of showing the group develop and how our two lead characters are portrayed and showed to people from all different ways of life.Style
The film has some heavy hitting scenes, especially showing the clash between the Black Panther group and the police force. It is thrilling, engaging and at times pretty horrific showing these ideologies going against each other and just how bad it was. Though I also think this film is a bit slow with its pacing, boring isn't the right world but it definitely drags at times and it does hold the film back from really hitting the highest of levels.Overall
Overall, this is a great film that does a really good job in showing this movement and the really strong performances involved. Judas and The Black Messiah is a film that should be seen and if you are interested in the story behind The Black Panther movement then this is one that will be up your alley."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,1/10,"This film start with a man ""Bill"" been interviewed, and the people rapping scene! As turnout, this film is about Bill need to help the FBI to take down The Black Panther Party lead by Fred! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the interview scene, overuse of the speech scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the calling with phone scene, overuse of the arguing scene, and overuse of the walking scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the shooting scene in the film have blood at certain point, but overall too messy, and occur too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Fred been killed! Bill gifted with a gas station! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,29 October 2021,6/10,"Stanfield plays O'Neal, a thief who enters into a plea bargain with the FBI (Plemons) to infiltrate the Illinois chapter of the black panthers lead by the charismatic Fred Hampton played by Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya.The film focussed largely on the emotional trauma experienced by Stansfield ie 6 years in prison or working against the group and its chairman he comes to admire. He gives a excellent, often understated performance in contrast to Kaluuya's electrifying turn as Hampton, who although the real subject of the film is viewed mostly from Stansfield's perspective. Plemons role is a peculiar one, at once outraged at Hoover's methods, but then resigned to them and seemingly accepting even supporting them - this sometimes seems hard to follow.Overall a dramatic and not always easy to watch 2 hander which nevertheless remains compelling throughout and importantly highlights the power of the notorious Hoover and his apparent sanction of governmental murder to suit what he saw as the greater good. In this it is truly damning."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 February 2021,9/10,"Incredible performances make this film such a gut punch.
This is one hell of a great piece of cinema! The rythm of it's editing, the character development, the perfectly intertwined storyline of each character, secondaey or protagonist, every piece of the film, no matter how small, worked in a perfectly engrained matter to always feed in to the main storyline, and with it, feed the social commentary which is the centerpoint of it all.This is a masterclass on great cinema all around, whatever aspect of the film you wish to consider, from it's acting to the directing, it all is achieved to a very tight level of perfection!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 March 2021,3/10,It is slow and just never gets engaging. The moral dilemma of Bill O'Neal was too barebones and forced and I've seen the crooked government portrayed in films way better and more interesting. There's just nothing truly compelling in this film.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 March 2021,8/10,"It succeeds with its story, the acting, the ending, its message, and the majority of its details. The performances by the entire cast alone are reason enough to watch this movie multiple times. The film highlights how citizens can be manipulated or influenced to turn on their fellow citizens with the use of propaganda and other tactics. Will society continue to allow this to happen or will they stand up and fight? That is up to us to decide."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 March 2021,8/10,"As the Black Lives Matter movement continues to be reviled by certain segments of the population, Warner Brothers must have the most innate timing ever by releasing this hot button film which depicts the purported revolutionaries of a bygone era to great effect. Drawing on the parable of Jesus from the New Testament & his eventual betrayer Judas Escariot, we have true figures Fred Hampton, played by Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya, leader of the Black Panther party for his sector who's has been infiltrated by one William O'Neal, played by Lakeith Stansfield, a petty car thief caught by the authorities & forced by the FBI to become a Panther so he can subvert their aims on their say so. Of course if you remember your Sunday school teachings, you know Stansfield will do any & every thing to get his job done as long as he ends up in the clear w/his 30 pieces of silver (in real life he got a gas station for his deeds). Kaluuya is nothing short of a living fire brand doing any & every thing in his own power to speak truth to the ills of the nation & hopefully to have a legacy (his wife & son survived to carry on the fight) which will help his people while Stansfield plays the informant like a frayed nerve, jumpy at every sound or shadow, fearing his time will come due as he's pressured by his handler, played by Jesse Plemons, to tighten the vice by agonizing increments. Also starring Dominique Fishback (last seen in Project Power & The Deuce) as Kaluuya's wife & Martin Sheen here playing J. Edgar Hoover (ironically he's played JFK as well)."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 March 2021,7/10,"Absolutely stellar performances in this film, especially from Kaluuya and Stanfield. Honestly, with the two of them I feel like we're getting glimpses at the future acting stars in Hollywood because I've yet to see either of them in something where they're not delivering. Those two aside, the rest of the cast here is solid as well with no real low notes to speak of. This is an acting film, 100% driven by performances and yet that leads into the reason I don't love it as much as a lot of people seem to. These characters are all so fascinating and I feel like, in an effort to capture the movement going on, the film fails to live with these characters enough. When the credits rolled I felt unsatisfied with the amount of time spent with them and not in a ""Oh my god I could watch another three movies with these guys"" kind of way. So much is happening here that I never felt I got enough time to really focus on the journey some of these people are taking. Stanfield specifically feels like he's on a Donnie Brasco-esque journey of self discovery but rather than moving along in a natural, steady pace it seems like his character jumps from stage to stage in his progression and I so wanted to see more of the turmoil and struggle he was going through.Thinking on that now, I wonder if this would've been better off as a limited miniseries just because there is so much to cover and trying to push it all into one movie doesn't give enough time for all of it. Even a 5 hour long miniseries would've given enough time to really capture all the complexities, the dilemmas facing these characters and I think would've been devastatingly powerful.As it stands, Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a phenomenal display of acting talent but a bit of a misstep in terms of story and plotting and that latter hangup really prevents the strengths of this movie from being as powerful as I feel they could have been. I know I'm in the minority here, I know people are loving this movie and they absolutely should. It's solid and has an very prescient message. I just can't help but wonder about the greatness that could have been. Still recommend everyone watch this. It's worth it. I just didn't find myself swept up into the hype machine."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 November 2021,9/10,"Now that is what I call good cinema. Top level acting, great script, shot and produced well. Only if was released during the holidays because this film is way too epic to be an early in the year release."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 February 2021,9/10,"Whilst the plot is definitely familiar, Judas and the Black Messiah is still an incredible drama that's emotional, devastating and relevant. Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield both give phenomenal performances. Dominique Fishback is incredible and Jesse Plemons is great. Shaka King's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The music by Mark Isham and Craig Harris is really good."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,7/10,"IN BRIEF: An earnest but flawed exposé with a star turn by Daniel Kaluuya as the Messiah.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) It seems it is more than just documented facts that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI illegally investigated any Black subversive protest groups during the 60's, with the Black Panther Party as their No. 1 target. Recent films seem obsesses with that matter (One Night in Miami, MLK/FBI, The Trial of the Chicago Seven, the soon-to-be -released The United States vs, Billie Holiday). You can now add to the fold, Shaka King's searing indictment, Judas and the Messiah.This bio-pic tells the true story of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), chairman of the BPP, who is ultimately betrayed by an FBI informant, William O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield). The film chronicles Mr. Hampton's life and death with a searing performance by Mr. Kaiuuya as the doomed crusader. There is no doubt that this performance will be recognized this award season. (More on that later.)We follow Mr. Hampton's journey from to skillful orator to full-blown leader, his sweet relationship with Deborah (Dominique Fishback), and his so-called friendship with William. We also view Mr. O'Neal's involvement in petty crimes and criminal activities before he becomes the stoolie for FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons, under the behest of J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen, with heavily applied make-up that borders on buffoonery).The script by Mr. King and Will Berson is a bit of a jumble and skims the surface before presenting its case. The movie allows a more liberal point of view from the filmmakers and crew in retrospect. The director/writer interweaves archival footage to his biographical tale most astutely and knows how to film his action scenes to full throttle effect. He does not shirk from showing the violence from both the police brutality and the Panthers' own militant stance and pro-gun attitude. The director envisions his drama like an unfolding gangster saga, with fluid camerawork and stylish flourishes, although his decision to use an annoying atonal music score just add more injury to one's eardrums. All in all, the film still resonates with its factual baseline and superb acting in general. One cannot discount the redacted facts and the shady cover-up that are now part of historical record.This is an honest but empathetic view of the Black struggle which shows the desperate violent lengths the Black Panthers would go for their cult-like cause which almost seems to justify Hoover's insistence about this group's dangerous origins and his underhanded tactics in taking this group out. But the portrayal of the FBI and their fearful leader is strictly one-dimensional. The Feds are predictable cardboard bad guys that become absurd caricatures rather than real figures. That seriously hinders the film's impact.The film loses much of its momentum whenever Fred's story is pushed aside in favor of showcasing scenes of O'Neal's issues and the FBI arch villainy. The reliable Mr. Pleson is fine as the cold and calculating FBI agent, but Mr. Sheen is miscast as Hoover. Granted, the waxy make-up doesn't help his performance. It only makes him look like a supporting cast member of The Sopranos than J. Edgar. The screenplay would have been wiser to eliminate the physicality of this well known figure entirely.In accurately conveying the 60's era of racial unrest, the main Judas role is underdeveloped. Mr. Stanfield is very good as William and the actor tries to fill in the gaps to this solitary loser, but, as written, O'Neal is more a series of nervous tics and fearful glances than a real person who one cares about.What the film does best is honoring its Black Messiah and his Lady Madonna storyline. As previously stated, Mr. Kaluuya is sensational. His role has more depth and emotional nuance. Mr. Hampton's revolutionary speech after his arrest is totally mesmerizing in its delivery. But it is the film's quieter scenes with Mr. Kaluuya and the captivating Ms. Fishburne that provide the gravitas needed. They are the emotional core. Their final scene is a heartbreaker and staged so powerfully in its straightforward use of graphic violence and human cruelty.Well crafted and skillfully performed, Judas and the Messiah has many strong moments scattered between some scenes of loose and meandering storytelling. It takes a while to build its narrative, but it does so by its tragic end. (GRADE: B-)NOTE: The R&B song during the closing credits, Fight for You, is a real winner. Take a listen."

REVIEW
Topics like these are very charged these day and so I worried this might be a bit too focused in its delivery of the equal rights movement. Surprisingly though, the movie takes that powerful message and opens it up quite well to be inspirational. Judas and the Black Messiah shows the importance of motivation and fighting for a right, with a powerful figurehead who seemed focused on the true goal of revolution. Though a bit wild at times, the movie keeps the serious tone to why movements occur and just what this time was fighting for that books can only fill so well, but more on that later.
The travel back in time has the special effects to support it, a great setting taking you back into the segregation era with cars, establishments, and music all mixing to immerse you into the world. My favorite part had to be the costumes, historical wear and tear embedded with a modern twist that is fashionable and representative of the war these political figure heads made. Simple I know, and probably not what most people go for a movie for, but I got to give the props department their dues for their choices and pulling me into the movie further.
What's even better though is the presentation of this movie. A multi-angle approach keeps this film engaging as you see three big perspectives during the Black Panthers' fight against segregation and harm against their fellow man. Fred Hamptons tale (Kaluuya) shows the importance of being a leader, the coordination and organization between rival clans, and several other moral driven components that you like to see in these movies. Bill O Neal (Stanfield) has the interesting approach of a man caught between so many worlds and the responsibilities he must balance to accomplish the goals set by those worlds. And the third is the general perspective itself, shedding light on the fight from the layman in a way that makes you feel as if you are also witnessing history with just a HD twist. These changes through the story can be confusing at times, but otherwise is great bridge to link our characters together and develop this group on many levels. This movie spares no punches in helping shape their characters, from secondary assistants and agents, to the master players themselves, so much layering for a 2 hour film. While more could have been done, it accomplished the balanced goal I enjoy in movies and I hope to dig up some more information about their lives. Even better comes the investment in these characters, not just because they are actual people who inspired change, but more so because the stakes are pretty high if you don't know the history. Judas and the Black Messiah has a number of suspenseful moments, layered in different manners thanks to the multi-angle approach we discussed earlier. Trying to sort out the truth, intense stand offs with rival revolutionaries, and close calls from the police are all moments that had me engaged to see the fate of our characters. Though if you have read my review before, you know I like a good fight scene and this movie does have those. No, they are not the spectacles of choreographed superpower battles I like, but that does not mean they don't have merit. Gun fights in particular are pretty intense in this movie, not in terms of the cleverness, but in how realistic they are in this recreated world. Like Game of Thrones, you might not know who will make it to the next mission, and that bit of danger helps keep things interesting for me.
Of course the acting deserves a lot of credit too, with all members playing their characters well and for the most part not overdoing it like they could have. Kaluuya as always brings a fantastic game to the mix, serious and calculating during the speaking moments, and then amping it up to passionate heights when his motivational moments come to play. Stanfield as well is amazing, and he might have been my favorite performance of this bunch because of the role his character played. From the comparison of several footage to his performance, he matched mannerisms and tones of the character which was not easy given everything he was involved with during these times. Again so many people to give props too, but I need to get to my dislikes.Despite technology improvements, some movies still stink at sound capturing and balance. Primarily during some off the lectures and talking moments, this film had the mumble syndrome requiring me to increase my sound to hear the jargon and vernacular important for this film. Only then would the volume increase to higher amounts as they shouted and got into the heat of battle. I'll say I had no problems with the cursing in this movie, as the overuse of some severe language rang high through the 2 hour film. I now it's a cultural representation of the times, and it is realistic, but... in a movie I'm okay taking liberties to come up with some clever fillers and discussion than swearing. Outside of the sound the only other things I found myself seeing as limitations were the pacing at times and some bias at key moments. For the pace, the movie actually moves well thanks to shifting the involvement around. However, there are times, primarily about 50 minutes in where things slip off the path and get too bogged down that it throws the pacing off. I really felt it at the end of the movie the most, where only the last 15 minutes saved me from falling asleep given how much last minute stuff they tried to put into the film. In terms of the bias, there are a few portrayals that make some characters a bit over the top as the enemies of the political movement and others a bit too much like heroes. Given how well the movie handled this topic, I wished they could have cut most of this out, but then again, history reveals some dark things about people so I'll have to research more. It's these moments that I feel are dividing the group down the middle in reviews and stirring the pot, but fortunately the movie has more than this.The VERDICT:From this writer's perspective, Judas and the Black Messiah is indeed a powerful film that has politic fervor embedded in almost every minute. Knowing this, if you take the dive you'll find a well put together movie not only in the look and feel of going back in time, but in powerful displays of fighting for changes that shaped our country. With a unique multi-tiered approach, some engaging suspense moments, and actors who deliver the vision of the director, you'll find an incredible cinema piece worthy of the praise. However, the movie still has some technical issues to smooth out, alongside changing up the cursing (for those who don't like heavy language avoid please). In addition some pacing and bias issues requires a little work for me as well, but overall the adventure was not a bad use of 2 hours.My scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,6/10,"The film itself was very interesting, it's a good story and the acting was good. I didn't like the pace of the film though it was slow in places and seemed to drag. Overall not bad but could of been better."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 April 2021,10/10,"This is a powerful movie, stunning in the fact that it depicts a period of American history, seldom told. The script is tight. The performances are engaging. The story is transforming. Nominated for 6 Oscars (2021). I give this film a 10 (powerful) out of 10. {Drama, History}"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,8/10,"Led by two extremely solid performances from Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield and sensible direction from Shaka King, Judas and the Black Messiah makes for incredibly powerful cinema. This is an emotionally moving piece of work centered around the Black Panthers Party in 1968, particularly FBI informant - Bill O'Neal (Stanfield), and the Chairman of the Chicago chapter of the BPP - Fred Hampton (Kaluuya). After The Trial of the Chicago 7 in 2020 (which I loved!), I was quite curious to see if a ballsy filmmaker could shed light on the Black Power movement. And I got my answer just a few months later.It's a two-person show indeed, and they're so damn good here - the Academy needs to take a serious look. Bill O'Neal's inner turmoil is conveyed brilliantly by Stanfield while Hampton's firebrand personality is portrayed exceptionally well by Kaluuya. Dominique Fishback, who was last seen in Project Power, also showcases the right amount of restraint in her character Deborah. The screenplay too, has ample tensive and hard-hitting moments. It makes us want to know these two men all the more. It slows down a bit in the middle, but that's when we get to dive deeper into the minds of Hampton and O'Neal. The dialogues too, are razor-sharp. They hit the exact intended spots and leave you with crimson marks.Judas and the Black Messiah is must-see cinema. I honestly would have enjoyed an extra 30 minutes of detailing, but even in its current version, it's such a twisted, heart-breaking, and nuanced story told compellingly. The musical score (Mark Isham, Craig Harris) also deserves praise aplenty. Colour and closeups (DoP Sean Bobbitt) add so much to the visual layers of the film. Who can forget that wildly effective final shot (of Deborah's face)? This is an important film that needs to be viewed by everyone."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 June 2021,6/10,"From a technical perspective, Judas and the black Messiah is a fine movie. The directing, editing, cinematography, score, etc were all fine. It's hard to criticise any of it. However, I couldn't get into it. There was nothing about any of it that stood out as particularly impressive or memorable. Even the screenplay, which has received lots of praise, was just ok. Where the film was strongest in my opinion was in the performances, but even then I have a couple of major issues. Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield are co-leads in this film. Kaluuya gave a really good performance. Same goes for Stanfield, displaying the inner conflict O'Neil felt as he got closer to the inner workings of the Black Panthers. Other impressive performances came from Dominique Fishback, who plays Hampton's girlfriend Deborah Johnson; and Jesse Plemons, who brought an enigmatic presence to his FBI agent character. Overall, apart from the good performances, Judas and the black Messiah failed to impressed or stunned me in any way, which was disappointing."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,8/10,"... especially as the events portrayed continue to play out in various guises, in various nation states throughout the world today, the oppressors performing familiar rituals as olde as any you care to conjure. Great performances from LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya ensure this insight into prejudice, racism and control really does hit the mark and shames the so called land of the free."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 April 2021,8/10,"Riveting, gut-wrenching, infuriating. This will go down as one of the greatest true films of our time, talked about endlessly in the decades to come -- mark my words."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,19 April 2021,,"The FBI was so terrified by the left in the 60s and early 70s that they recruited (and often coerced) people to infiltrate and undermine organized groups like the Black Panthers even against their own self-interest. In this telling, the Judas is two bit car thief Bill O'Neil (LaKeith Stanfield) and the Messiah is the Panthers' Chicago branch leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya).Director Shaka King collaborated with three writers in fashioning a screenplay which both overreaches and underachieves in trying to tell the tale. O'Neil is the puppet of FBI officer Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) who answers to none other than the force's Director, J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen almost unrecognizable under mounds of makeup). Hampton is portrayed as not only the spiritual leader of the local Panthers, but, also its instructor and chief negotiator in trying to unify other minority groups in the city. The ultimate goal is fighting back against police brutality - by any means necessary - in the parlance of the time.JUDAS tries to cover too much territory, with characters entering and exiting without establishing their real import to the story. The structure is also too conventional with far too much time spent on facts and figures, and not enough on character development -- nor creating a true narrative that drives the drama. No disrespect to Sheen or his performance (which is good), but, those scenes are simply superfluous. The viewer knows that the FBI is controlling O'Neil through Mitchell and that's sufficient. What's missing is showing made O'Neil tick. Hampton is given more room to develop as he interacts with the group members and forms a relationship with a writer and activist, Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback).Stanfield is very strong here as O'Neil despite the script's insufficient grounding of his character. Kaluuya is also quite good as Hampton, but, for the first time in his American career, his natural English accent noticeably gets in the way at times. In addition, the lead actors are each a full decade older than the real life people they are portraying. Hampton should be a young firebrand, not the mature leader who often appears here as a mentor, almost a father figure. The real O'Neil was seventeen. A callow teenager, not an experienced con. Casting years older than the character they play is common in Hollywood, but, this is a particularly acute and damaging pair of examples. It robs the movie of much of its intrinsic power. A battle of wills and morality played out (and to) very young boys of color, not men.The legacy of the Black Panthers is complicated. The free breakfasts, education and empowerment still has resonance today, but, so does the violence. That story certainly isn't helped by the muddled storytelling here. There are powerful moments depicted, and the tragedy is there for all to see. JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH is too prosaic in its approach. There should be fire and urgency. It plays it too safe, something which Fred Hampton never did."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,6/10,"There's definitely a bunch of interesting stories to tell about the Black Panthers and their battle for civil rights, but while it's hard to put my finger on the exact reason why, I felt that Judas and the Black Messiah wasn't quite as good at telling its story as I was hoping it might be. I think one of the biggest problems I had with this script is the fact that it is bisected down the middle, and doesn't stick with a singular narrative. On the one hand, it is about Fred Hampton and his rise to leadership in the Black Panther party. This is a powerful story and one that I think could keep an audience riveted for the full run-time of a film. I thought Daniel Kaluuya did a superb job of portraying this man who could appear larger than life, while still keeping him grounded so we could relate to him. I found some of the intimate moments he has in the film to be the most compelling aspect of the entire plot because it contrasted nicely with his big personality when in front of a crowd. Fred Hampton's story is what worked best for me, and I would have enjoyed exploring his journey the entire time, along with the general rise and fall of the Black Panthers movement.Yet there is another story being told here, and it wouldn't be hard to argue that this is intended to be the main plot of the entire film. This is where we learn about Bill O'Neal and how he rose up the ladder of the Black Panthers while still being an informant for the FBI. I know that it can be interesting to take a look at this journey, but it didn't connect with me as deeply. For starters, drawing the analogy to ""Judas"" feels flawed, because this was not a man who belonged to the Black Panther party before being recruited by the FBI. He's basically an undercover agent, and that makes it hard to feel tension or stress for him the entire time. The movie makes it crystal clear that he is in the wrong for what he is doing, so why should I care if he is unmasked. LaKeith Stanfield even plays him a bit weaselly and conniving, which just makes him even less likable. I will say that I appreciated the way this film utilized Jesse Plemons' character, because it is rare for a movie like this to show a white person with some conflicted feelings (typically they are all shown as pure evil and 100% racist.) There is a decent movie in Judas and the Black Messiah, I just wish there wasn't also a lackluster movie in there."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 June 2021,6/10,"I will confess that I know next to nothing about Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party. That being said, films like this rarely set out to be objective or unbiased. As is clear from the title, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH wears its politics on its sleeve. It has a point of view, and I can understand and appreciate that. That being said, there really was no narrative drive. People talked, things happened, but there was little sense of urgency or creeping doom. There were good performances, particularly by the two leads, and a few conversations that do a better job at polemic through subtlety than the sloganeering and rallies. What the FBI did to the Black Panthers (and many other ""subversive"" groups) was pretty horrible, and yet I find myself wondering whether or not Fred Hampton was a person worth lionizing in the way this film attempts, not unlike the many attempts of the media nowadays to turn the latest victim of a police-involved shooting into a martyr but leaving out the context of why they were in that situation to begin with. Overall, I will say that this film was never boring, yet oddly tame considering the explosive potential of the real-life source material. On a more positive note, I loved the soundtrack, which was very evocative and earthy."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 May 2021,7/10,"Isn't it funny how I only had a passing understanding of the Black Panther party until this last year, when it featured in two Oscar-nominated movies? Granted, it was more of a secondary plot point in The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020), so the movie where it was the star of the show was none other than Judas and the Black Messiah (2021). But, regardless of the coincidence, I did learn a lot about the Black Panther party through this movie and continue to hate the past that straight white males have created for others.Judas and the Black Messiah's title is quite fitting considering the unification that Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) managed to create in Chicago in the late '60s. I was shocked to see some of the groups of people he managed to bring together, even if it made sense for them to rise up against the system of white privilege that had kept them oppressed for so long. But, of course, the ""insider mole"" plot has been done to death before, so even if this was how it really went down, it felt too reminiscent of other movies that came before it.Overall, though, Judas and the Black Messiah is an engaging film with some moments of great tension and great anger at injustice. One of my other qualms, though, is how I felt it wasn't easy to understand what many of the characters were saying because their dialects were so thick. Some subtitles might have been useful. Additionally, the movie didn't really feel like it was about Fred Hampton, but rather about the people around him, like Bill O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield) and Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback). As such, it felt distracted in these side plots when it should have been a little more focused.An eye-opening history lesson on the Black Panther party, I give Judas and the Black Messiah 3.5 stars out of 5."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 March 2021,10/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is the true story of Bill O'Neal(LaKeith Stanfield). Bill is an FBI informant, who is instructed to spy on the Black Panther Party and its chairman, Fred Hampton(Daniel Kaluuya). As he gets closer to the party and Fred, Bill is lost and doesn't know what to do.Judas and the Black Messiah is a mind-blowing film. Director Shaka King has given us a biopic, that pays tribute to all the unsung heroes of the Black Panther Party. The performances are the highlight of the film. LaKeith Stanfield is spectacular as Bill O'Neal. Stanfield portrays his character's emotional turmoil, with ease & aplomb. Daniel Kaluuya is outstanding as Fred Hampton. Kaluuya nails his portrayal of the inspirational leader. Jesse Plemons is unforgettable as Roy Mitchell. Dominique Fishback is phenomenal as Deborah Johnson. The supporting cast is superb. Judas and the Black Messiah deserves all the awards nominations and the accolades it has already received. A must watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 February 2021,7/10,"Ever since Daniel Kaluuya burst onto the scene in 2017's GET OUT, he has been an actor to watch - one who's brilliance bursts off the screen in whatever project he is in.This brilliance shines brightly in his latest effort JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH that teams him up with his GET OUT co-star LaKeith Stanfield in the true story of 1960's Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton (Kaluuya) and his friend/Security Chief, Bill O'Neal (Stanfield) who just happens to be an FBI informant.Directed and Written by Shaka King, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH tells an important, under-told story of the African-American struggle in the wild, changing times of America in the 1960's.Kaluuya's performance as Hampton is up to the challenge of a story this big and bold - his Fred Hampton is charismatic and involving, drawing all into his world. He's a bigger-than-life icon that demands attention whenever Kaluuya/Hampton is on the stage. I expect an Oscar nomination (at least) for this performance.The problem with this film is that Kaluuya's Hampton is such a strong and commanding presence that the rest of the story and characters pale in comparison to him.Such is the case with Stanfield's portrayal of O'Neal. I really like LaKeith Stanfield as a performer and was really looking forward to seeing him and Kaluuya go toe-to-toe, but his character is swallowed up in the largess of the Hampton character and, so, I never connected or sympathized with him. I don't blame this on the actor, I blame this on the script and the direction of King, making the O'Neal character weak - especially when he is up against Hampton.The character/actor that WAS able to hold their own with Kaluuya/Hampton is Dominique Fishback as Hampton's lover (and mother of his child), Deborah Johnson. The scenes of Hampton and Johnson together were sharp and interesting - perhaps because Hampton was toned down, but also because Fishback's portrayal of Johnson was strong enough to stand up to Kaluuya's portrayal of Hampton.In addition, Kaluuya's performance is so strong in this film that it is noticeable when it is absent, so when his character is sent to prison (and disappears) for the middle 1/3 of this film, the movie drags considerably.Finally, the film hits a plateau at about the 4/5 mark and doesn't really build to a crescendo at the end - an ending that should be powerful, but just sorts of lies there.All-in-all, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH is worth seeing for the powerful performance by Daniel Kaluuya that more than makes up for the shortcomings of the rest of the film.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 April 2021,8/10,"The 'Judas' in ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is Bill O'Neil (LaKeith Stanfield). He works as an informer for FBI man Mitchell (Jesse Plemons), who has him over a barrel for impersonating an FBI officer. Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) runs the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther party and O'Neil is a trusted comrade on the inside.Will O'Neil - always concerned that 'snitches get stiches' - stay on the side of 'the pigs', or be influenced by the ideals and good deeds of Chairman Fred?Positives:
Before this movie, I really had no idea what the Black Panthers were or how they operated. (If pushed, I would have tagged them as ""internal terrorists"" or similar). So this movie was really valuable to me in further understanding their role as a political movement. And their use of community programmes - focused, for example, around child nutrition and health improvements in inner cities - was a revelation.Given the BLM movement, and further 'blue-on-black' shootings, the film is timely. (Even more so for me, since the George Floyd trial verdict came out last night). ""The United States vs Billie Holiday"" showed how brutally the civil rights movement was put down by the authorities in the 40's. This shows the same thing happened in the 70's too. It's again a movie that leaves you angry and frustrated at how poorly the black community have been abused in America. I guess counter to that is the positive view that things HAVE evidently improved significantly since then, albeit that the US is still on this journey.Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Oscars are both Stanfield and Kaluuya. (This is a highly debatable point, since arguably both of these gents are lead actors in the movie!) Both of them deliver outstanding performances, and Kaluuya has already picked up the BAFTA. Kaluuya demonstrates a huge amount of energy and charisma, particularly during the delivery of his stirring speeches. But Stanfield delivers a superbly nuanced performance, and perhaps impressed me even more.Also deserved, in a movie predominantly featuring a black cast, is recognition of the ever-excellent Jesse Plemons. As the steely-eyed FBI family man, he's chilling to watch.Negatives:
I had issues with the sound mixing here. I found some of the dialogue - already hard for me to follow sometimes due to the speed of delivery and the accents - drowned out by background music and foley sounds.Martin Sheen's make-up as J. Edgar Hoover was rather over-the-top and detracted from the role. (Sheen is in little more than a few cameo scenes).Summary Thoughts:
I'm pleased I've managed to see this impressive Oscar contender before Sunday's Academy Awards event. Interestingly, I noticed that historical advisors on the movie were Deborah Johnson (played here beautifully by Dominique Fishback) and the baby she was carrying (now Fred Hampton Jnr.).As well as the two Supporting Actor nominations, it's also up for Best Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography (Sean Bobbitt) and Best Song (for ""Fight for You"", played over the end titles, and very good).(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 March 2021,6/10,"They trying to keep us in a state of trauma. Meanwhile they just landed a rover on Mars, and we still trauma bonding through movies intended to keep us in a perpetual state of anger, after ""roots the remake, it was over for me. My thing with these types of movies, struggle movies, is that most of times after people see them, they feel this need to ""do something"" to sort of get justice for these horrible things and because they believe their intentions are good(which they are), they use this righteous zeal to blindly push some extreme ideals that goes well beyond the problem they are trying to fix cause they think will help prevent this kind of stuff from happening again."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 March 2021,8/10,"A historical piece about Fred Hampton as well as the Black Panthers in Chicago. The story here was very interesting, because we have an African American working with the FBI against his own people. I was not aware of this story, and I was glad to learn about the character of Fred Hampton through this movie.Daniel Kaluuya was so good. Through his passionate acting, he captured the character of Hampton as an electrifying and inspirational orator who genuinely wanted freedom for all people. I enjoyed his presence in every scene he was in. LaKeith Stanfield as the Judas was also good. I bought that he was very reluctant in participating in the operation, and also how scared he was of getting caught.The movie showed the harsh condition and oppression that the FBI had against the revolutionary. The violence and brutality were shocking and unbelievable.My only problem was that I wish I could learn more about the work of Fred Hampton. The movie was very quick in showing how popular and influential he was, but I wanted more from that.Overall, a brutal yet educational film about one of the great revolutionaries that more people should know about. 8.5/10"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 April 2021,6/10,"My Review-
Judas and The Black Messiah
My Rating 6/10
The lower than average rating is not because of poor performances it reflects my experience and enjoyment of the film itself.I found the broad Afro American accents especially Daniel Kalluuya at times incomprehensible and if I see this film again I'll use subtitles. At times it
sounded to at times like an extra long wrap performance.I remember years ago America requested subtitles for some Australian films like
as they found our dialect difficult well the tables have turned somewhat.I certainly acknowledge the very good performances by both Daniel Kalluuya as Fred Hampton Leader of The Black Panther Activist Organisation in Illinois and La Keith Stansfield as the FBI informant Bill O'Neil.Judas and The Black Messiah lives up to its title another film based on true facts and characters. The story takes place in the late 1960's when Fred Hampton, a young, charismatic activist, becomes Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party - putting him directly in the crosshairs of the government, the FBI, led by J. Edgar Hoover and the Chicago Police. But to destroy the revolution, the authorities are going to need a man on the inside and that man is William O'Neil who under threat of prison for a minor offence is recruited by FBI agent Roy Mitchell ( Jesse Plemons) and ""sells his soul to the devil.Martin Sheen is almost unrecognisable as the diabolical excuse for a human being FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover whose reign of terror knew no boundaries.I'm not a fan of the shaky cam action in movies and a lot of the violent scenes in the film use this technique I find it really distracting.With both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya receiving Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" becomes the first film to have multiple black performers nominated in this category for the same film.I can understand why LaKeith Stanfield stated in an interview that he needed therapy after his portrayal of William O'Neal.Here we are over half a Century after these events and racial violence in America is still as virulent and hateful as ever helped along of course by the easy access to guns plus White Supremacist Groups and hopefully a minority of corrupt rogue Police.Judas and the Black Messiah is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture which it is definitely not it may pick up one of its Supporting Actor nominations it's success depends on how the conscience of the Academy is affected by its story and how Politically motivated the Academy is this year and that applies to a number of the nominated movies of 2021.No one is pretending that The Black Panther Party was a non violent organisation from its inception in October 1966 The Black Panther Party's core practice was its open carry armed citizens' patrols (""copwatching"") to monitor the behavior of officers of the Oakland Police Department and challenge police brutality in the city.It did however In 1969, sponsor a variety of community social programs which became a core activity. The Party instituted the Free Breakfast for Children Programs to address food injustice, and community health clinics for education and treatment of diseases including sickle cell anemia, tuberculosis, and later HIV/AIDs. It advocated for class struggle, with the party representing the proletarian vanguard until dissolution in 1982.All I can think of in summing up this sad movie are the words to
Blowin' In The Wind written in 1962 and the answer is still Blowin' In The Wind
Song by Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the HeartbreakersYes, and how many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?And how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?And how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 March 2021,7/10,"By alluding to the history's most nefarious story of betrayal, the title gives away that the movie draws a modern parallel between William O'Neal and Judas Iscariot. In such a risk-taking move that could easily spoil the ending, we can assume that the story here has more than meets the eye. The real significance of the story doesn't lie in its relevance or in the sense of ""history repeats itself"" per se, but rather in the fact we recognise that. This is what makes it all the more shocking and shameful.With all that being said, the movie itself is quite daring. Hollywood has made quite a few films about The Black Panther Party recently, but the relative dearth-as far as I'm concerned-have tackled the story of life and death of Illinois Black Panther Party chairman Fred Hampton. It is no easy feat, but what's even harder is neither villainising O'Neal's character nor absolving him from culpability. In other words, the movie doesn't take sides when it comes to the two lead characters, portrayed by LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya who gave astounding performances that further cement their status as two of the best actors working today. Stanfield perfected his character's uncertainty to a tee, while Kaluuya showcases his acting chops in full swing whether at his most theaterical or understated moments.However, the movie can be accused of playing it safe storytelling-wise. Apart from the few opening minutes that instantly hooked me, the progression of events couldn't have been more pedestrian. I could feel a blood-boiling energy that has something of Spike Lee about it, but it seems quite repressed because the plot is restrained. Thankfully, the second half let this energy loose, regaining the sense of intrigue the movie has been lacking in except in its stylish moments, and acceletating tension of the plot in the process.Another qualm I have with this is how Mitchell, the FBI agent, tries to convince O'Neal to become an informant literally by saying that the KKK and the Black Panthers are no different. I mean, really? Regardless, this movie is definitely my biggest surprise of 2020, especially since I didn't even have the urge to watch it because the trailer made it feel like one of these style-no-substance movies that are entirely dependent on flaunting their anger to drive home their moral value.(7.5/10)"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 August 2021,7/10,"This movie is about Fred Hampton and his life in the Black Panther Party. Each big events of his life is represented there. So if you want to know more of this man and his fight against racism and discrimination and the life of this man, this movie it can be quite good and have some dramatic moment as the life of Fred Hampton. I enjoyed it and recommend."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,19 April 2021,6/10,"Well made and all but I feel like I've seen this movie before. This movie isn't really that original in it's story. So on it's own it's a fine film, but overall I just wan't that interested.6/10: ab."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,9/10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Judas and the Black Messiah was a last-minute addition to this year's Sundance, which basically changed every list about the most anticipated films of the festival, including my own. The buzz surrounding its Oscar chances, the remarkable cast, and mainly its important narrative based on true events were more than enough reasons to generate an undeniably powerful hype. When I watch movies inspired by real people and/or true stories, I want them to teach me about the historical moment they're depicting. I want to finish my viewing sessions and know more than what I did at its beginning. I want the film to be enlightening, thought-provoking, and, most of all, impactful.I'm just a young white man living in Portugal with no previous knowledge of who Fred Hampton was or what he did. The closest I got to learning something about him was during last year's The Trial of the Chicago 7, but that movie wasn't even focused on the Black Panther Party, let alone one of his most important revolutionaries. My voice is far from being meaningful in regards to this film, and I will share Black critics' articles that I find to be worthy of investing your time in reading. However, I do have an opinion about this movie, and I'm in my right to share it. I find Shaka King's flick to have all of the qualities I mentioned above and much more. One of the best films of the festival, and I'm not risking it by writing it will end up as one of my favorite movies of the year.In all honesty, I found myself struggling to completely understand Fred Hampton's intent during the first half or so. His goals are clear and can be summed up in simply trying to offer everyone a better life, one that was fair and where everyone was treated equally. My issue wasn't in his motivations or beliefs, but on the violent, murderous path that Hampton was *apparently* inciting people to take - I repeat, I didn't know a single thing about the real story nor Hampton himself. However, Daniel Kaluuya's very first words as the character stuck with me until now - ""We're not gonna fight fire with fire, we're gonna fight it with water. We're not gonna fight racism with racism. We're gonna fight it with solidarity. We're not gonna fight capitalism with Black capitalism. We're gonna fight it with socialism"" - and he kept developing this idea, which I find incredibly timely.The scene that ultimately cleared my perception of Hampton's ideas was when William O'Neal takes the latter's most famous speech at the end of the second act in its most literal sense, which leaves Hampton baffled and shocked at O'Neal's interpretation of his words. Hampton's reaction, as well as a more emotional moment with the mother of his child, Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback), was the click I needed to fully comprehend the revolutionary's desires. This is one of the best compliments I can offer Shaka King and Will Berson's exquisite, detailed screenplay. It doesn't make Hampton a flawless superhero that never makes mistakes but instead depicts him as a human being who fought for everyone's rights. The latter is closer to being a Messiah than the former.The intricate narrative might feel a bit too heavy for some viewers, but it packs extraordinarily energetic, inspirational, chill-inducing speeches that I won't forget that soon. Both Hampton and O'Neal raise sensitive themes that will definitely leave the audience thinking and discussing them throughout the year. Despite it being the longest film of the festival, its two-hour runtime feels adequate and well-paced. In addition to this, the terrific, ""in your face"" cinematography (Sean Bobbitt) focuses on the actors' performances, not giving a chance to the viewers to be distracted with anything else besides the characters' words. The emotional investment in the characters elevates the well-edited (Kristan Sprague) shooting sequences that left me on the edge of my seat (couch), which ultimately serves as a huge praise to the movie's writing.I left the cast for last. Now, I know 2021 just started, but if Daniel Kaluuya isn't nominated in every single awards show for the respective Best Supporting Actor category, I'll riot. I've yet to witness a less-than-great display from this unbelievably talented actor. Kaluuya is exceptionally captivating from the very first time he shows up on-screen and never drops his level. Lakeith Stanfield is also brilliant as a conflicted William O'Neal, delivering an extremely complex portrayal of someone who has to deal with actions he knows are wrong. Dominique Fishback and Jesse Plemons (Roy Mitchell, an FBI agent) also deserve a shoutout.Judas and the Black Messiah deserves all the hype it's been getting and some more. Shaka King and Will Berson deliver a film inspired by true events with all the qualities this type of movie needs: enlightening, inspirational, thought-provoking, and tremendously impactful. Boasting what I'm sure will end up as one of the year's best performances (Daniel Kaluuya), the story of Fred Hampton and William O'Neal is told through an incredibly captivating narrative, filled to the brim with absolutely epic, riveting, chill-inducing speeches and dialogues that will leave no viewer indifferent. Both characters bring timely themes back to the spotlight, hopefully generating a critical discourse regarding freedom, human rights, and equality. Besides Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield deserves massive praise, and I can't forget about the lingering, character-driven cinematography that elevates every single scene. Final shoutout to Mark Isham and Craig Harris's unforgettable, addictive score that plays a significant role in the narrative.Rating: A"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 April 2021,9/10,"""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is a historical drama based on the life and betrayal of Black Panther Party member Fred Hampton. Starring Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield, it is a confrontational recreation of an important series of events from several decades ago that still feels highly relevant today.In 1968 in Chicago, young Bill O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield) is arrested for attempting to steal a car while impersonating a police officer. Facing six and a half years in jail, Bill receives an offer from FBI agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) to instead work undercover for him in exchange for having the charges dropped entirely. Bill accepts the deal and is soon assigned to infiltrate his local chapter of the Black Panther Party, keeping tabs on their new leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), as he is becoming an increasing concern for the bureau.From their founding in the late 60s to their dissolution in the early 80s, the Black Panther Party (BPP) has been an interesting yet controversial topic of discussion among many modern historians. Likewise, their divisive legacy has spawned a number of feature films about their accomplishments, offering various accounts of how successful they were at spreading their message. ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is one such film and it excels greatly at showing how the group were frequently at odds with the opposition, whether it be corrupt law enforcement or even their own government. The film's unrelenting look into the discrimination that African-Americans had to put up with during such a turbulent time in American history is jarring to say the least, mainly due to how little has changed since then. It is often said that history has a habit of repeating itself and with the way things are in the world right now, that certainly seems to be the case. In one scene, we are forced to watch uncomfortably as the police hurl racial epithets at any black people passing by under the guise that they are doing so as a result of the chaos the BPP have brought to the city. This of course mirrors similar events pertaining to the widespread protests that began in 2020, showing that little progress in race relations has been made since the 1960s. Although I am not American myself, the film did a solid job of inserting an outsider like me into that time period and reminded me that this is an issue I should be paying attention to regardless. This made me realise that if a non-American can appreciate what this film has to offer, then it has succeeded in getting its message across.In only his second feature film, Shaka King has already established himself as a director to keep an eye on. His creative use of cinematography as well as his attention to detail in several scenes felt so natural that you'd swear a veteran filmmaker was helming a picture like this. In fact, as I was watching, I couldn't help but get the feeling that this film could easily have been made by the likes of Spike Lee. Subject matter like this appears to be right up Lee's alley, from it being based on real-life historical events, the ever-growing racial tension between blacks and whites, and even the intersplicing of actual news footage during the epilogue. While I am a fan of most of Lee's ""Joints"", one thing that bothers me from time to time is his habit of getting carried away with sensationalism. Lee's films often gravitate towards generalising all white people to feel terrible about what they have done rather than offering constructive ways for both blacks and whites to work together to look past their physical differences. Thankfully, King does not fall into this trap, rather presenting this true story as a moment in history rather than a counter-attack against all white people as Lee tends to do. It would be interesting if Lee and King would ever work together on a future project, as it could make for an entertaining combination.The acting in this film is superb with both Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield each giving memorable performances. Kaluuya embodies the role of Fred Hampton with such charisma and authority that it is near-impossible to not become drawn into every word he says. From giving a loud, impassioned speech or even just a simple conversation with a friend, the moment this man starts talking, we immediately understand how important he is. Stanfield, on the other hand, plays Bill O'Neal as someone who is uncertain at first but becomes enamoured by what the BPP believes in and what motivates its members. Despite the high risk of being exposed, O'Neal continues to alternate between being an undercover informant and a high-ranking BPP member. The very fact that he is constantly questioning his loyalty to either cause shows that the film is presenting a non-biased look into how each side is giving valid reasons as to why they believe in what they do and Stanfield manages to communicate this dilemma in a way that anyone can relate.In conclusion, the Black Panther Party has understandably left an indelible mark on modern history. The group's unorthodox tactics of preaching their beliefs and the fallout from the consequences of their actions have helped cement their legacy as one of the most controversial activists of all time. Whether you agree with their methods or not, this film definitely presents a worthy look into how the group functioned during this important time for America. So long as racism remains a persistent and universal issue, there will be plenty more films to come regarding a topic like this.I rate it 8.5/10."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,8/10,"The two main acting performances really carry this film. Kaluuya and Stanfield both do tremendous work and make this film a compelling watch. It's a tough. depressing movie to watch, but it feels appropriately timed with its release. It's inevitable to compare this to another recent film containing some of the same characters, The Trial of the Chicago 7. While Chicago 7 is a more enjoyable watch and really zips along with energy, Judas is more unflinching in its reality and less ""Hollywood."" This isn't to say there aren't the typical story beats you expect in a film like this, but it overall feels more impactful."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,8/10,"When I saw ""The Trial of the Chicago 7"" less than a year ago, I commented that there was likely a more interesting movie to be made about Fred Hampton. Well, here it is! This film avoids all the traps of traditional biopics. Its tight timeline and electric performances distinguished it from similar stories that wind up feeling like nothing more than historical dramatization. I knew how this movie would end. I knew the basic story of the main character. And yet I hung on every moment. Kaluuya is that good, and Stanfield is that good. More importantly, the filmmakers are smart enough to figure out that this could be a story of betrayal, advocacy, loyalty, and fear...something that transcended one person's story. What results is something both universal and uniquely relevant to the present day. This movie deserves whatever awards it wins."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,7/10,"In a day and age where acknowledgement of marginalized American citizens has become more prevalent than ever, films like Judas and the Black Messiah feel like necessary additions to the struggles of the black panther movement in the late 60s and early 70s. With beloved actors Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield and a healthy distribution from HBO Max backing the project up, this film is surely to be a contender for the eventual 2021 oscars. So what makes this film worthy of not only critical appraisal, but also Kaluuya's Screen Actor Guild award?As the film depicts the rise and fall of revolutionary activist Fred Hampton (Kaluuya), what makes the film striking is how it presents all these details in a powerfully bold manner. Not unlike the movements from Malcolm X or Bobby Seale, the way Hampton struck fear and determination through his brash speeches allowed the movements for racial justice to grow bigger and bigger over the years. Considering just how many enemies Hampton had on his shoulders as much as allies, it made the movement he helped lead that much more of a target to the racist FBI. And yet, this movie itself is just as focused on FBI informant William O'Neal (Stanfield) coaxing with Hampton in an attempt to reimburse his status to lead in on the movement, even if it does cost him the solid relationship he builds with Hampton. While one could argue O'Neal's special agent handler Roy Mitchell doesn't quite have the same developed amount of substantive screen time as he could have to make O'Neal's time with him memorable, at the end of the day, the relationship between O'Neal and Hampton wins by default in terms of plot points.One could even argue the movie is at its peak in sequences rather than the whole. While the scenes of Hampton's partner Deborah Johnson are gorgeously romantic and all the more heartbreaking as the film goes on, the scenes with Martin Sheen portraying J. Edgar Hoover are so hamfistedly jingoistic that it comes off more as a parody than a serious stake. Fortunately, Sean Bobbitt's phenomenal cinematography and Kristan Sprague's tight editing allows the pacing of these scenes to smooth well enough, even if some are written and performed better than others. Also, director Shaka King does not hold back on displaying just how violent this film can get in depicting what the panthers and FBI get themselves into, as it allows more of a gut punch to the viewers than first expected. It seems that today, the views people have towards the federal police have grown steadily worse overtime, especially from the views of African Americans. So with films like this, showcasing the paranoid induced violence sticks out like a necessary evil that should not be forgotten anytime again.If you own HBO Max and you're in the mood for a solid biopic on racial injustice and ambivalence being its own downfall, Judas and the Black Messiah is a healthy contender. It's debatable if the movie will stand the test of time as one of the great biopics on black historical events, but nevertheless, it will hopefully make a cultural impact in this still ongoing pandemic. With many audiences desperately in need of being reeducated on black history, this film will mark a triumphant return to the month's prevalence in reminding us why we shouldn't take these objective tales for granted."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 November 2021,4/10,"After his first 5yr imprisonment, Hampton et al should have rethought or shelved their plans for BPP and free clinic. But no, they keep the same approach. And, Hampton winds up going back to prison and fail again. Brilliant."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 March 2021,9/10,"After seeing The Trial of the Chicago 7, I read about the people involved and came across Fred Hampton's story which really fascinated me. I believe Judas and the Black Messiah did it justice.Judas and the Black Messiah follows Bill O'Neal, a man who becomes an FBI informant to gain inside information on the Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton.After watching the first trailer, I got goosebumps. Even after repeat viewings of the trailer, I still got goosebumps. No trailer has made me feel like that before and so I was anticipating this film for a long time. This film was unflinching in its portrayal of its events and I loved every bit of it. It may be a disappointment to some as Fred Hampton isn't in the film as much as you would think but I thought showing this story through the perspective of O'Neal was a great choice. Bill O'Neal was an interesting person who did make choices that were questionable and I liked the conflict that built over time between his allegiance to the FBI and the Black Panther Party. Lakeith Stanfield gives one of his best performances here as O'Neal. There are so many layers and nuances in his performance to give an idea of what his character is like. Despite knowing the story, I was still stunned by some of the things O'Neal does and somehow Stanfield still manages to make him somewhat sympathetic by the end.The main attraction here is Daniel Kaluuya who is mesmerising as Fred Hampton. He pulls off the accent brilliantly and adds so much charisma and power to the dialogue by Will Berson and Shaka King. A particular scene where he's speaking to a large group of people is made so powerful by the energy and confidence Kaluuya brings to each word that comes out of his mouth. I couldn't believe this was the same man from Get Out. This is the biggest chance for him to win a Best Supporting Actor award and I hope he does. Jesse Plemons is also amazing here. I'm so happy his career is flourishing. Dominique Fishback is also fantastic and brings a level of emotion to the film.For a second feature, this is really impressive from Shaka King. I see a great amount of confidence in his direction and writing and I'm hoping to see more of him in the future. There are a couple of shootout scenes and its depiction of violence was hard-hitting and held a substantial amount of weight to it. The score is very unusual but at the same time I liked the way it was used in the film.All in all, Judas and the Black Messiah is a powerful film. It brings to a light an important time in history and educates us on someone that wasn't that well known. With striking performances from Kaluuya and Stanfield, this is a film that should be watched."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,9/10,"""Words are beautiful, but action is supreme.""Judas and the Black Messiah has taken storm since its release. It tells the story of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, and his fateful betrayal by FBI informant William O'Neal. At its release during the Sundance Film Festival this year, I was lucky enough to see this. After seeing almost 30 movies, I felt the fatigue at that point and didn't feel as strongly about the film. I did give it a higher score than I felt initially because I knew that I would like it more had not felt the way I did. Let me tell you, watching this a second time was phenomenal. Shaka King made an incredible piece of work. It exceeds as a thriller. The whole time I felt like I was on the edge of my seat. The scenes are so intense and it's King's great direction. I love how the technical aspects are presented. Firstly, the score is both unnerving and fitting for the time period. The cinematography looks stunning and is shot in a way to make you feel like you're apart of the story. And the editing only helps with the thrill of it. King also wrote the screenplay along with Will Berson. The dialogue is really good. Sometimes with biopics, writers are more focused on the factual aspect that they forget to use dialogue to further develop these characters in a meaningful way. All the characters, or rather real people, had a connection with the audience. And I really like how they don't necessarily take one side to the story. Yes, we're supposed to side more with the Black Panthers, and we do the whole time, but it also shows how it could get extreme sometimes with Fred Hampton's views.Speaking of Fred Hampton, Daniel Kaluuya is phenomenal. There's no possibly way he won't win the Oscar. This is one of the performances that sticks with you long after watching. He captured Hampton's essence perfectly. Another great performance comes from Dominique Fishback as Deborah Johnson. Her performance is going to make her a well-known actress in the future. LaKeith Stanfield also gives a wonderful performance as always. You can see the conflict in his eyes the whole time. This is just one of the best ensembles recently. There really isn't much to hate here. I had a pacing issue at one point, but the film is stellar. I can't imagine anyone really hating this, unless they have a vendetta against the Black Panthers or something. Even CinemaScore gave it an A. As the Oscars approach soon, I'd hope that this gets the attention it deserves. Though it hasn't been showing up at many awards (other than Kaluuya), it's accessible to all with its release in theaters and HBOMax. Also the reviews have all been positive except just a few. I think Judas and the Black Messiah is one of the best thrillers out there and will be remembered as one of the best of the 2020s."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 June 2021,7/10,O'Neal goes undercover in the black panthers and finds himself torn between love and giving up the party to his handler.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 October 2021,8/10,"Even without the great technical elements of this film, the story really does speak for itself. It is a stain on the history of the United States and on humanity, and is a painful and poignant watch. This is made all the more powerful by the brilliant technical elements of the film.Firstly the cast are spot on. Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield rightly deserve all the praise they received, and Jesse Plemons always makes every film he is in better without exception.The direction is crisp and clean, the score powerful, the design of the whole film nice and polished. It is a very well put together film.The only criticism I can really level against this film, and the reason I only scored it an 8, is that it felt a bit surface level and lacked a bit of focus. It didn't always seem sure whether it wanted to be about Fred Hampton or Bill O'Neal. Whether it wanted to function as a biopic or more of a wider historical commentary. This isn't a huge problem as what was in the film was very well done, but it does seem there was perhaps a bit of a missed opportunity to drill down into events a bit more. Maybe the film would have benefitted from an extra 20 minutes.The story itself makes this film a must watch as it is so gripping and unbelievable. Add into this the brilliant performances and clean and polished feel of the film and it really is a stellar watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 May 2021,9/10,"Powerful and important movie! Well made and very well acted! Daniel Kaluuya is amazing as Fred Hampton! He blows up the screen and his intensity just punched me in the gut in every screen! In a similar fashion, but in a smaller role, Dominique Thorne, as Judy Harmon, is brilliant in her own way! The Judas in this movie made me want to puke, and what he did in real life to this man, and his family, was reprehensible. The real life clips at the end, and the information about what happened to the people in this movie, were incredibly intense. Bravo to the filmmakers, bravo!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 March 2021,7/10,"Both are based on the true story which happened in Chicago in 1968 and 1969, so two movies give the whole picture of what it was like in Chicago in late 60s. Social oppression, protest in reaction, police's excessive force of use, discrimination against the weaker are the words to describe atmosphere around that time. It's interesting to compare and contrast how Fred Hampton is realized in two movies. Other than that, there are many things to compare and contrast both contents and the forms.'Judas and the Black Messiah' is disappointing that the director could have done so much more with such an important historical figure (similar with 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'). The screenwriting is stretched and elongated. The momentum and the tension have to be built up for December 4th Monroe Massacre where all the powerful emotions burst. However, the director fails not only to build up but also to have a great ending.P.S. History speaks that William O'Neal is still a weak coward then and now."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,3 May 2021,7/10,"First the good side. Even after 50 years it is still a cutting-edge piece of US history - absolutely captivating and with two outstanding acting performances by LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya.The narrative perspective is great unusual. Not a conventional biopic. Because we jump into the investigators' perspective. Instead of sketching William O'Neal as a nasty traitor, the director shows him as an empathic young man who is cornered by the FBI.Well, bad side: the story has unfortunately been told a hundred times. In addition, as a viewer, despite the brilliant acting performance, at some point you lose track of everything: who is who here and who is threatening whom? There is little character development and many scenes are far too long. All in all a classic Oscar film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 April 2021,8/10,"In the way it captures the injustice, high stakes, and high-running emotions of the revolution it triumphs, and loudly-the music, the sounds, the performances all scream for your attention (see especially Hampton's welcome home speech). As a whole it feels a bit scattered though, with obligatory-feeling side plots (see Jake's revenge), teased but discarded character dynamics (see Roy's discomfort with Hoover), and a titular relationship that doesn't quite live up to its dramatic potential.7.5/10."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 February 2021,8/10,"It's strange, how long it can take for histories to emerge from the mist of time. I didn't know of Fred Hampton, Bill O'Neal, and the FBI-manufactured thread that connected them in tragedy. It's surprising that such a powerful story hasn't made it to film before now. Or maybe not so surprising.Anyway, the tale is now told in JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH. It has a terrific cast, led by LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya, with fine support, particularly from Jesse Plemmons, Dominique Fishback, Ashton Sanders and Alysia Joy Powell. There's a large number of named characters, some of whom start off as secondary but who return to take up important roles in the story. The script although pretty good overall, doesn't help us get to know them all as well as it might, given the overall running time. In most respects, however, the screenplay sets out the issues -- including principles behind the Black Panthers' politics -- with clarity. Jesse Plemmon's character apart, the FBI is not presented with any depth, but since what we know about the organisation under J. Edgar Hoover suggests paranoia lay behind whatever it undertook, I doubt whether Martin Sheen's portrayal of the man is wide off the mark.Kaluuya's Hampton is granted opportunties to function as a multi-dimensional human being, as both a public and a private man. This is completely as it should be: the consequences of how he was betrayed were felt in both realms. Stansfield's O'Neal, by comparison, has more limited scope -- there's no romantic relationship to act as a counterweight to his dealings with either the Panthers or the FBI. The weight of the roles differ also in the virtuosic speeches that Kaluuya gets to deliver, opportunities not open to Stansfield. They are equally superb performers, but I suspect that Kaluuya will get more kudos due to the nature of his role.It's a well directed, photographed and designed movie, and the score by Mark Isham and Craig Harris is excellent."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 July 2021,7/10,"Biopics about revolutionaries usually find their way to Academy Award nominations, and in many cases, wins. So it's not surprising that Shaka King's story about the leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party did just this earlier this year. The most deserving win was for Daniel Kaluuya, who took home best supporting actor thanks to his emphatic performance as Fred Hampton.The reason 'Messiah' works is because it focuses on a specific time and place that represented a much broader period of strife. In doing so, we really got to know the faces on the screen, from Hampton to the FBI double agent who infiltrates the party (LaKeith Stanfield). The film also does a good job painting a picture of what it was like during this period during the civil rights movement, and things are made even more real given the stark similarities from our own recent history.'Judas and the Black Messiah' is a well-done social commentary that takes real-life controversial subject matter and makes it understandable to many who either were not aware of it or who were born long after this time in our nation's history."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 March 2021,10/10,Daniel and Lakeith did an absolutely fantastic job in Judas and the black messiah. You could tell that they were in their roles and could really get into them. This was just a work of art. Best movie I have seen so far in 2021. I highly recommend this movie.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,7/10,"This movie can be complementary to ""The Trial of the Chicago Seven"", and it deepen the story of the Black Panthers party, and how were subject to injustices by the FBI and the Police Department, in an historical time where racism was extremely bad and costed a lot of innocent lives. Such a tragedy, that here is portrayed in a realistic and bloody way. Definitely not an easy watch.Daniel Kaluuya's performance was simply amazing, he has such an intense energy during stage scenes, and he simply nailed Freddy Hampton characterization. For sure one of the best portrayal of the first part of 2021, he completely captured me. Also LaKeith Stanfield did a good job. Bill O'Neill, a man that in order to run away from crime charges, was infiltrated by the FBI into the Black Panthers headquarters, in order to provide information to authorities and avoid prison. However he will pay a really high toll, and the real guy, not able to handle anymore this weight, decided to end his own life. He was really on a though spot, but the FBI definitely used him to do the dirty job. Unfair agency strategies are very often reported in the film and, even if these are well known facts, it is still disgusting what the USA were able to do, in order to meet their own agenda.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is very balanced, it never tried to paint Hampton as a hero, director managed to be impartial, by highlighting both negative and positive aspect of the movement: the main objective was definitely noble, but means used were not always orthodox. No politically correctness involved here, and I am happy that WB just let the director tell the story in his own way by presenting real facts. I am extremely satisfied with this movie and I highly suggest to watch it, together with the Netflix original, mentioned at the beginning."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 March 2021,4/10,"The truth seemed boring to me this movie, obviously the story is shocking, but this movie is not good, slow and boring."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 July 2021,7/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah was an overall well made film, but it feels like it's missing something. The story had a lot of potential, with it being adapted from real events, but the plot lacked cohesion. I think the screenplay could've been much better. The narrative felt directionless at times, and there's not really a main character. The film puts its focus on too many characters at the same time, and in turn, not developing a character with much depth.Aside from the poorly written screenplay, Judas and the Black Messiah was very well produced. The directing and cinematography was great. The film was very flashy with its visuals, and I appreciate that every scene had an equal level of attention to detail. The acting was really good too, nothing special, but it works perfectly within the film. And I think the score was one of the best parts about the film.In the end, I ended up really liking Judas and the Black Messiah. It's great on a technical level, but the script was poorly handled. Judas and the Black Messiah is nothing too special, but it's definitely a film that's worth checking out if you're interested."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,,"As a biopic, this story is gripping not just for its narrative, but for its history. Judas and the Black Messiah illustrates the racist and terrifying world of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The story follows Bill, who becomes an informant for the FBI (a snitch) to bring down the Black Panther party. It is gripping to see Bill struggle with both identifying with the Party, and his leader, Fred Hampton, and at the same time, be the force to bring them down. The fact that this is based on a true story makes the whole thing even more compelling. I thought the colors of the film were beautiful, and the performances were gripping."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 October 2021,8/10,"...films about a subject matter though I had heard of was not familiar withDaniel Kaluuya was so worthy of his Oscar Win, with just as good support from Lakeith Stanfield."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 February 2021,7/10,Judas in the black messiah was directed by Shaka King and tells the story of Bill O'Neill(laKeith Stanfield) and how do you ever traded Illinois Black Panther Chapter to spy on the leader Fred Hampton(Daniel Kaluuya). The movie succeeds and showing off showing off the struggles African-Americans and the black panther party faced during the times. While several of the scenes are well acted and full of tension. Most of the characters are well liked. But the movie keeps it focused on William and Fred as it should. Both Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield offer wonderful performances. The overall the film is more based around O'Neill rather than Hampton and of course it's going to make some people mad but still The movie still offers a good story story The music is well performed. Though despite these things in the movie I feel that there could've been more. You'll get a fair amount of scenes involving O'Neill and Hampton but you don't really get that many scenes in which William and Fred interact with each other to make the betrayal seem more personal. The film doesn't hit that epic standard that other civil rights film such as Malcolm X with Denzel Washington or Gandhi with Ben Kingsley have achieved.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 March 2021,6/10,The trailer is more impactful than the film. It is a good film though.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 April 2021,8/10,"So far, the best film released in 2021. The biggest similarity between the Messiah and Fred Hampton is the fact that both were murdered. As for the similarity between Judas Iscariot and Bill O'Neal, i's the fact that they committed suicide. The real villain, if the script is faithful to the truth, was serial killer J. Edgar Hoover."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,7/10,"""You ain't tell me it was going to be like this. These ain't no terrorists,"" LaKeith Stanfield, playing FBI informant William O'Neal, says. ""They're terrorizing me!""""Their aim is to sow hatred and inspire terror,"" Jesse Plemons' Roy Mitchell replies. ""No different than the Klan.""""Judas and the Black Messiah"" hooks its viewers quickly, and early, spattering its playing field with sympathetic, conflicted characters on both ends of the spectrum. Careful not to demonize one group over the other, the film plays its cards by displaying them - you quickly get a feeling of where everyone lies, where their morals are, and why they're taking action. Never glamorizing or portraying violence as the answer, but instead a cycle that only results in more, and increased, violence, the movie demonstrates power in people and peaceful rebellion; a major part of the plot was how the Black Panthers were avid servers of their community, setting up medical centers and facilities to feed and care for hungry children. And by centering its story around LaKeith Stanfield's Bill, a character in a situation stressful beyond belief, ""Judas"" knows how to keep its audience engaged. On the other hand, a slightly jam-packed plot detracts from the overall viewing experience, and it's clear that the movie needed much more time to breathe.First things first - let's talk acting: ""Judas"" has some of the best, most natural acting I've seen in a long time, because, frankly, barely anyone felt like they were acting. Throw an old-timey filter on here or shoot on pristine film for a grainy look, call it a documentary, and I'd be convinced that it actually was. Besides for a few moments where the FBI villains sit in a room, smoking cigars, and laugh maniacally, practically everyone in this film acted like a real person, and the phenomenal performances is perhaps the main draw of the film. Jesse Plemons was great as an FBI agent who wasn't portrayed as a one-note villain at all. Showing a surprising level of sympathy and humanity, he was as much of a victim of the system as anyone else, thrown in too deep where he couldn't stop even if he wanted. Daniel Kaluuya from ""Get Out"" fame was amazing as Fred Hampton, also portrayed as a layered character. At points calling for the death of police officers, at others display horror when people express their desire to act on his previous words, Fred is shown to be multi-layered, always trying to do what he feels is best for the people. LaKeith Stanfield performs a very nuanced role, acting as a character who can literally not deny what his higher ups tell him to do - this leads to many anxiety inducing moments where he clearly feels disgusted at what he's commanded to do, but knows the repercussions of saying no may be worse than taking the action he's been told. Going from someone who feels excited by his newfound money and materialistic possessions to someone who starts displaying a noticeable amount of guilt for the toll gaining those possessions and cash is taking on him, LaKeith is in line for Oscar, along with a majority of the cast. Yes, the acting is truly great, but is brought down by the overly stuffed plot.Make no mistake, the plot of this movie is riveting, and you'll want to see it through to completion. However, there is so much going on here that, even though the movie moves at a quick pace, it is evident that the film as a whole would've benefited from more screen-time. There are about three movies worth of plot here, jammed into a two-hour run time, which doesn't do justice to all the story. For example, LaKeith's Bill has the inevitable turning point where he starts to feel sympathy for the Panther's and their cause, but where specifically, and what caused the turning point, is not clearly shown. Yes, you can make inferences and perhaps guess to try and pinpoint it, but more time for a clearer explanation would've done wonders in making Bill more sympathetic, and for making viewers feel more anxiety as he continues his double-cross. Similarly, at times the movie shows the Panther's engaged in violence against police officers, sometimes justified, and others not. I would've really liked to see Fred's reaction to this behavior to see if he condoned or condemned it, but the movie doesn't really explore his reaction to the violence his words may be indirectly influencing.Visually, the movie looked fantastic, if a bit dark at times. I was worried the movie would incorporate the ever popular Hollywood shine that movies set in the 60's love to use to make everything look overly high-definition and bright, but thankfully, ""Judas"" didn't. Everything looks appropriately moody, and the film has a noticeable directorial flair to it. Also, I really want to shout out the soundtrack, because it was fantastic. The use of music in this movie was almost perfect, and really added to the cinematic feel of the film.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" has a story that, as a whole, is engaging, keeping me entertained for the entire film; as I said, the movie moves quickly, and never really slows down - there's always something new around the corner to keep you sucked in. However, the breakneck pace and relatively short length is also the film's biggest detriment, reducing the amount of emotional resonance that a longer film could've conveyed. Should you rush out to see this in theatres? The music and cinematic direction would definitely be enhanced on the big screen, but if your only option is to stream it, you'll be sure to enjoy the excellent acting and tense story at home."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 April 2021,8/10,"So far this is definitely my pick for Best Picture. I'd never even heard of Fred Hampton before, and just now I went on an information dump on everything about the Black Panthers, which I think is one of the best things a biopic can do - get you interested in the person it's about.And it does that with some amazing performances from everyone involved, especially Daniel and Lakeith (even if neither of them are the main character apparently, fix your nonsense Academy), a great soundtrack, and an even better newcomer director, Shaka King, who did a bloody fantastic job on this.Don't really have much more to say to be honest, it's just a really damn good film, although I did think of one way they could have elevated it into serious masterpiece territory: whether Bill agreed with the Black Panthers or was brainwashed by the usual American propaganda (cause I hate to break it to you, but societal change doesn't come from asking nicely), delve into that more, because I never felt like I properly understood where his allegiance actually was.If he didn't like the Black Panthers, make the character an example of how good America is at gaslighting its citizens, or just a thoroughly detestable protagonist, and if he did, show what being forced to narc on their leader is doing to him psychologically. It doesn't ruin the film not having this, but I can only imagine it being raised to best film of the year territory if they did go that route.Still though, this is the first Best Picture nom I've seen this year that I would be very happy taking home the award, and I think it's got a really good chance too, so for now, I'm just...happy."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 February 2021,8/10,"It was start at really good way, idk everythings seems really smooth. Especially the cinematography. But as the stories goes it start to become just ""good movie"", a common good move. it has potential to be great but some just loose after the story got more heat.All the act was increadeably good. i used to plan give it 7, but somehow that ending credit make some spark."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 August 2021,8/10,"Very good success on the part of Warner, this movie should be seen by many people. It is not only a criticism of racism in the USA but it also criticizes capitalism and how it corrupts society and even its ideals.The performances are spectacular, it is a very revealing story with good photography, good editing, it is very well directed, I think the only problem is the script that is possibly a little difficult to understand, to locate the protagonist of the story and it has some stumbling blocks in the story with parts a bit slow but minimal. Music plays an important role in the movie, it is definitely the 2021 movie that no one should miss, LaKeith and Daniel Kaluuya are spectacular."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 April 2021,1/10,"This is exactly the kind of film that gets an 'empathy' nomination. A half baked, slow paced, poorly made boring film. The execution is just terrible and the story is a less than 5 minute script dragged over 2 long hours. Those rating this film 9's and 10's do y'all have any sense? Rating such a stupid and time waste of a film so highly. The story is nothing we are not aware of, so at least the execution should be good. But gosh, is this the most boring film I've watched! Wasted and spoiled my Sunday watching this horribly made film.This director should not make any note films. He doesn't know what he is doing. The ridiculous shoot out scenes were tedious to get through as was most of the film. The shoot out scenes reminded me of the painful to watch Bollywood gangster movies. In fact, even they were done in a better way. The film lacked energy and even the acting, except Fred's character were dull and awful."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 April 2021,9/10,"Daniel Kaluuya is the front-runner for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year and rightly so for this mesmeric portrayal of real-life Black rights leader Fred Hampton.Set in 1960s Chicago fresh after a governmental crackdown on leaders like Huey Newton and Eldridge Carver, Judas and the Black Messiah is a harrowing tale of an FBI mole infiltrating the local Black Panthers chapter with the sole mandate of bringing down their leader, the charismatic Hampton.The movie' climax sequence hits you like a ton of bricks with the amount of police brutality and systemic racism the Black rights movements of the 60s and 70s had to put up with, on full display.I must confess that I was not well-read on this era of the Civil Rights movement. Director Shaka King's narration left such a haunting impression that I went back and read through the tragic cases of Emmett Till and other atrocities committed during the Jim Crow era, and the more you read, the more shaken you are.Pathbreaking cinema. Kaluuya and Lakeith Steinfeld didn't act but rather lived as Hampton and O'Neal. Sensational.Available on BookMyShow Stream and YouTube premium. A must-watch!#MovieReview #JudasAndTheBlackMessiah #DanielKaluuya #OscarNomiee #BestPicture #BookMyShowStream #YouTubePremium."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 April 2021,7/10,"Wow, these guys really deserve an award. Kaluuya's performance was the best I've seen so far this year, just incredible and absolute convincing. Stanfield on the other hand was very impressive as well. The movie didn't really grip me cuz of the plot or story wise but the absolute top notch performances from the cast to retell this story. This is a must watch to see Hollywood's young talents."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"It's beautiful, important and well made. The story, which is a real one, is interesting, powerful, and important because it's historically accurate and tackles serious topics like racism and injustice. Performances by Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya are superb and Oscar-worthy. Judas And The Black Messiah is a nice heavy thrilling biopic, if you love this genre Id highly recommend it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 March 2021,7/10,I did not know much about this story. So this film was very interesting to watch and learn. All the performances are great and well done. The film is well paced and does not have a dull moment.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 April 2021,1/10,"I'm sure the entire cast of this SchlockFest consider this Powerful and Compelling. Just as I consider cliches to be BS. When is Hollywood going to WTFU? Never! But that's okay because they're the ones losing money on SJW Pet Projects like this. Meanwhile, NO ONE watched The Oscars. Boo hoo! And this Pile Of Celluloid Gar-Bage will Never make it into the $5.00 Blowout Bin at Wallmart! Unless it's selling for .99 Cents. And you can buy good coasters for less!Wow! And it made less than 7 Million Worldwide. Stunning & Brave!Now wasn't that a POWERFUL review. That's a rhetorical question!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,7/10,"Judas and The Black Messiah (2021)Two things that come to mind when hearing the name Judas: Jesus Christ and betrayal. Judas loved Jesus, he believed in his ideas, he was his close friend and yet he betrayed him for 30 silver coins. After being arrested by the FBI, Bill O'Neal finds himself joining the Black Panthers as a spy. Initially, he doesn't care about their struggle as he is in it purely to avoid incarceration. However, once Fred Hampton's revolutionary ideas manage to crawl into his mind, Bill finds himself at a moral crossroad.On one side, he likes staying out of jail while getting paid by the FBI; on the other, he feels the rebellious spirit coursing through his veins as he gets closer and closer to The Black Messiah and LaKeith plays that part to perfection. Daniel Kaluuya gives a volcanic performance as Fred Hampton and yet it felt like a miscasting despite his tremendous energy. The real 21 year old Fred looked like a man of knowledge with wisdom beaming out of his eyes; the same couldn't be felt about Daniel who is also 10 years older. Furthermore, instead of delving deeper into Fred's life, the movie limits his time while choosing to focus on shootouts.What is important in any revolutionary film, specially if it aims to be realistic, is to portray both sides of the coin and I think this movie doesn't achieve that objective. Instead of focusing on counter politics, Bill's motivations or Fred's backstory, the film runs all over the place as events and characters are introduced without any development simply for the sake of adding layers and creating noise.Despite losing it's focus, the movie successfully establishes a core idea which will hopefully inspire peole to read about these events. Aesthetically, the film felt immersive as the revolutionary spirit was flowing through the screen; Kendrick Lamar's Hiii Power would have fit nicely here. Giving credit where credit is due, the movoe stayed true to the title by managing to make it all about Judas and his weakness. On the day when he was tasked with the ultimate betrayal, Bill burst into tears just as Judas cried when he had to betray Jesus and in a way, that felt poetic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and Tv shows"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 March 2021,9/10,"Bill ONeal played by LaKeith Stanfield infiltrates the Black Panther party after he gets arrested by the FBI for impersonating an officer. They want him to go after Fred Hampton a charismatic leader of the Black Panther party played brilliantly by Daniel Kaluuya. He is amazing in this role as a young leader of the party with rousing speeches and very convincing rhetoric. The film has a real Martin Scorsese vibe similar to films he did like The Departed. It has some great dialogue and incredible performances. I believe Kaluuya will win best supporting actor. The film is very slickly directed and I loved the score. The film also has so really emotional moments, I think this is one of the best films of the early part of this year."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"Fred Hampton was only 21-years-old when he was murdered by Cook County police in an illegal home raid in 1969. He was drugged with a sedative to prevent him from fighting back and shot twice in the head while sleeping in front of his nine-month pregnant partner, Deborah Johnson.Even though he died young, Hampton had already accomplished more than many of us could ever dream. As chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, Hampton founded the multicultural organization, the Rainbow Coalition, and allied his party with other Chicago groups in an effort to end street violence and instigate social change. He was a born leader and speaker, moving hundreds with his words at the protests and educational courses he led.Now, after fifty years since his untimely death, Hampton is getting the biopic treatment in ""Judas and the Black Messiah"".The British-born Daniel Kaluuya portrays Hampton in a performance that can only be described as electrifying. Kaluuya has already made himself known with his lead performance in Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and a supporting turn as a sadistic hitman in Steve McQueen's ""Widows"". Here, Kaluuya elevates his game even further as he channels both the powerfulness Hampton carried in public and the tenderness he had in private. There isn't one second you're not glued to him while he's on screen. An Oscar nomination is bound to happen and a win would be deserved.Playing Judas to Hampton's Black Messiah is LaKeith Stanfield (also in ""Get Out"" as the brainwashed Andre King). Stanfield plays William O'Neal, who was a petty Chicago criminal who became an informant for the FBI as he rose the ranks within the Black Panthers. O'Neal was the one that sedated Hampton in exchange for $200,000, an act he never considered a betrayal. Stanfield rises close to the level of Kaluuya as he gives a twitchy and layered performance that is nothing short of a career-best.Directed and co-written by Shaka King, ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" meets both criteria of a biopic, which is to be both entertaining and informative beyond the top-layer Wikipedia facts. We learn about Hampton through O'Neal, as we watch him ascend from the bottom to the top within the party, interacting with Hampton at various points in history.King doesn't commit the sin of falling head over heels with his subject. Like the Messiah in the holy book, Hampton had his demons that he had to constantly wrestle with. King takes a similar approach that Steven Spielberg took with ""Lincoln"", where we get a compelling real-life hero and learn about what they had to overcome both externally and internally. This treatment also extends to O'Neal, whom King doesn't wholly vilify or pardon. We're shown the path O'Neal initially led himself down and how he saw an opportunity to work for the FBI. While it's an easy decision to make, King lets the audience decide how to perceive O'Neal's actions.With Steve McQueen's go-to cinematographer Sean Bobbitt in his crew, King makes this one of the most surprisingly gorgeous movies of the year. Incorporating a mixture of long takes and over-saturation, King and Bobbitt perfectly illustrate the vibrant urban setting. And the jazz-infused score carries the sharp tension with its low trombones.At just over two hours long, King carries his film with great energy from beginning to end. Expertly filmed action is interspersed throughout as well as sharply edited speeches that contain more action than the actual shootouts. Even when King falters for a few brief moments at the beginning of the third act, he picks himself back up and delivers an utterly spine-chilling and infuriating ending that properly uses the clichéd element of postscript.""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is an all-powerful work from director Shaka King and the two leads of Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield. Both timely and historical, this biopic will surely land near the top of my best-of-year list and is not one to miss."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 April 2021,8/10,"It's horrofying what humans can do to other humans, how can we try someone else like an object? Or even with dogs, cats animals in general, how can we all treat like this??? There's still racism, there's still violence in both sides of the coin, we have to stop, LET'S STOP, living with horror is not living, as an argentinian, we live times like these in our country, in the 1976 DICTATORSHIP, people lived in fear, u wake up with militaries shooting at you or ur kids, just cause they thought u were from a party or something, THISE MOVIES WORK SO THIS WON'T EVER REPEAT AGAIN, TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO ADVANCE AS SOCIETY, AS HUMAN BEINGS, and it shows how sadastic humans can be, no matter whan side u are at, and my boy Lakeith Stanfield stole the whole movie, he's one of the best actors we have in this generation, just give him the Oscar already! And more protagnic roles."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 November 2021,8/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a powerful film, nobody will be thinking after watching it, It's not a typical biopic, it's a showcase of the real problems in the world, the story is small in impacting the world, but the massage is so globe and every real human being can really understand it massage. Shaka King pulled the impossible, by bringing the story of the Black Panthers and Fred Hampton to the big screen using the capitalists money."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 October 2021,4/10,"Important enough story to tell, just poorly handled.Acting was good although dialogue was unintelligible at times. Art direction and cinematography really got the feel of the times.Just left me cold because of script problems."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 July 2021,9/10,"Relevant and mind blowing real story. Strong writing , strong acting. I was afraid it will be just another cash grab on backs of black victims , but no. Really good and smart movie with a heart behind it. LaKeith is the only one overacting but still very human and relatable as every single on that brilliant cast."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,9/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is one of those movies that doesn't feel like a movie at all, but an experience so mesmerizing you feel like you are a reluctant passenger observing real life events.The acting is just superb. The performances by LaKeith Stanfield as Bill O'Neal and especially Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton were outstanding. I still remember watching Daniel Kaluuya in an early season of Black Mirror, in 2011. It's a joy to watch someone outdo themselves in movie after movie.The script is amazing. That scene where J. Edgar Hoover (a mostly recognizable Martin Sheen) asks a massively loaded question to O'Neal's handler Roy (played by Jesse Plemons) was beyond tense. Hoover is pure evil.Judas delivers the most seething social commentary since Blindspotting."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 March 2021,7/10,"This arresting film tells the story of a key leader of the Black Panther Party and the law enforcement's efforts to curtail and eradicate the group's presence in the United States in the late 1960s. The first key protagonist is William ""Bill"" O'Neal, a small-time Chicago criminal who after getting caught by the police, agrees with the FBI to become an informant against the Black Panthers. The second protagonist is Fred Hampton, the dynamic, charismatic leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who is O'Neal's assigned target.Among the film's strengths are a stunning recreation of racial violence the country was grappling with, especially in late 1960s Chicago. It makes that era and that city seem like a hellish war zone for anyone of minority descent or with no political voice. The film's sense of dread and tempo remain virtually constant. After watching this film, it's hard to imagine a scarier time and place.The only disappointing aspect was the film's choice of emphasis. The narrative takes too much of the focus away from Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya in a volcanic performance, albeit one that occasionally requires subtitles) and keeps it on O'Neal (a sympathetic and tormented Lakeith Stanfield). We get to know O'Neal's story quite well but Hampton remains a bit of an enigma. Jesse Plemons is exceptionally menacing in a supporting turn as a slimy FBI agent who puts O'Neal to work as an informant. Martin Sheen is wasted in a minimal, almost pointless role as J. Edgar Hoover. Dominique Fishback is quite moving as Hampton's love interest.Although this film didn't convey everything I wanted to know about this part of history, I found it a good starting point. A story as powerful and scary as this one doesn't always come to life as brilliantly on film as it does here. Strongly recommended."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,7/10,"Not sure why they make Bill O'Neal to be judas, but in this movie he is portrayed as a true american hero. He saved many lives for his work against the black panthers serving the FBI for many years. And this movie sets that straight. very good acting, camerawork and production quality. Very annoying music in the intro is the only bad thing"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,"The entire cast acting was exceptional and worthy of Cinema industry accolades! Adaptions were similar to the events without upsetting the audience even more with the hundreds of innocent lives interrupted and taken by agencies created to protect the people! Fred Hampton, Breonna Taylor and countless others murdered without any judicial consequences."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 March 2021,9/10,"This was the first film I saw in the theaters this year. I don't think it is something you need to see in theaters but it is defiantly a film I would recommend to see there.Judas And The Black Messiah is about Bill O'Neal (LaKieth Stanfield) who commits a crime. While in jail he meets a FBI agent named Ray Mitchell (Jesse Plemons). He gives him an offer to spy on the Black Panthers and try to make sure they don't do anything crazy. He then meets Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) and hears him give a speech and is persuaded that they aren't the worst people.Judas And The Black Messiah is one the movies that is going to HBOMax and the theaters. I would say to watch it in the theaters just because of many of the speech scenes. They made me feel inspired in the cinemas. Not many movies do that. I watched those scenes outside of the theater and I didn't feel the same emotion I did there. If you are on the fence about where to watch it, go to the theaters. Anyway, the story I have a feeling will be one of the best we get this year. It looks like the year will be clouded by superhero films, action movies, and reboots so there won't e too much original stuff. It is al being shoved to January and February. It is sort of disappointing. The story was fantastic besides for this one out of place dream sequence. It just showed something we already knew and could have been cut out of the film. The story though, couldn't have been made any better.It is almost impossible to say the acting isn't good with all this talent (unless the movie is Cats). Daniel Kaluuya won a Golden Globe for his work. It was totally deserved. LaKieth Stanfield is starting to become a well known name as well. Jesse Plemons had a big step up from his last film, The Irishman. He was just a side character in that movie, but in this film he had a way bigger part and he knocked it out of the park. Overall, the acting was amazing.This film was packed to the brim with intense scenes. Physically and mentally. The scene all the way at the end even combined the two. This is another reason why I would go to the movies to see this film. There were a few shootouts that shoved you to the end of your seat. A few scenes in the film also just made the characters you like look cool. It wasn't done using violence but more of just walking around sort of like in Malcolm X.The score was something that surprised me. If you saw the trailers, you would know that the film had the cool sounding beat but that wasn't used in the movie. Instead they went for a completely different approach with the score. The used more of a bass than electric. They also abused drums in many scenes of the film. The score was something that was sort of rejoicing to hear in some scenes but then forced your heart to pump in others.Judas And The Black Messiah is defiantly worth your time because of the acting and story. I would defiantly try to see it in the theaters if you can but it isn't something that will be completely ruined on you TV at home."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"Shaka King's well-made, gritty drama serves as a deeply thought-provoking look at the intersection of racial tensions and betrayal. Lakeith Stanfield plays William O'Neal, an FBI informant investigating Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya,) who was the chair of the Black Panther Party in Illinois. As O'Neal closes in more on Hampton and his inner circle, he is faced with a deep crisis as to whether to turn in valuable information on Hampton to authorities. The film is a tightly-made analysis of racial unrest as well as the true horrors of white supremacy and the systemic functions that uphold it.The performances are outstanding across the board, conveying clear emotion and vital urgency in their roles. Kaluuya is particularly outstanding as Hampton, and his acting brings each scene he is in to a gripping, powerful crescendo. I always thought Kaluuya was an outstanding actor after seeing his leading performance in ""Get Out"" as well as his menacing supporting performance as a criminal villain in Steve McQueen's ""Widows,"" but here he is able to authentically and completely show a unique new range of his acting talents. The film's gritty cinematography is powerful and sublime, enhancing the mood of the film. Well-written dialogue not only serves as a form of character development here, but also clearly to provoke thoughts. King's direction and sense of tone are both also great, showing an outstanding sense of dramatic tension. While the film's pacing can sometimes be a bit uneven, the film's narrative is overall finely crafted--and well worth seeing. 8/10"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,31 August 2021,,"While technically appearing in 2021 'Judas and the Black Messiah' fell into that realm of 2020 Academy Award eligible films due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film is a biopic of Fred Hampton who was the Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther party in the late 1960's in Chicago. The film garnered much acclaim for its timely story as well as fierce acting by the entire cast. It is directed by Shaka King who is a student of Spike Lee's. He doesn't have much of track record with 'Judas' being his only notable directing achievement, but based off the critical success of this film I hope to see him branch out into further directorial endeavors. The film earned six Oscar nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards and won two including Best Supporting Actor for Daniel Kaluuya's riveting portrayal of Hampton, but Lakeith Stanfield's performance was equally as good earning him a nomination as well.In 1968 we meet Bill O'Neal, played by Lakeith Stanfield, who is a petty criminal using a fake badge to execute car robberies. He gets arrested and due to impersonating a federal agent he lands on the FBI's radar. He is given a choice by Special Agent Roy Mitchell, played by Jesse Plemons. He can either go to jail or become an FBI informant specifically infiltrating the Black Panthers and getting close to Fred Hampton who the FBI (read J. Edgar Hoover) had a keen interest in. O'Neal takes the deal and winds up becoming a very prominent member of the Illinois Black Panthers all the while snitching on his Black Panther compatriots. Hampton continues to rise to prominence struggling to make a difference in a very tumultuous time in our nation's history. Hampton is imprisoned on a seemingly bogus charge, and is released on appeal. He is slated to return to prison when his appeal is denied, but the FBI launches a plot, with specific instructions from Hoover, to raid Hampton's apartment and kill him. To ensure this goes smoothly they have O'Neal drug Hampton so he never even wakes during the raid even when police officers drag him into a hallway, realize he is alive and shoot him in the head. The film states at the end O'Neal worked as an FBI informant until his death, and Hampton's widow and son went on to continue efforts in the Black Panthers.The direction, writing and acting in this film are all first rate, but really it is the shocking true story driving the plot that is really the core gut punch of this film. I understand that all of this knowledge is out there and exists, but there are still so many stories we are unaware of especially me, as a white male, when it comes to many minority histories. I was vaguely aware of the name Fred Hampton before this film, but I am not sure I could have told you the significance. After watching this I can tell you I will never forget it. This is basically a provable case of political assassination carried out by the FBI which is so incredibly heinous that it is almost indescribable. They targeted someone who was not only advocating for the rights of African Americans, but as the film demonstrates was bringing together people of all races and social classes as well as working to feed the hungry and nurture the sick. This film serves as an interesting companion piece to 'Trial of the Chicago 7' as that also takes place during late 1960's Chicago with Bobby Seale being a part of that trial and the death of Hampton actually occurring during the events of that film. The other fascinating aspect to 'Judas and the Black Messiah' is the character of O'Neal who started as a completely apolitical, out for himself entity. I thought being in that culture and with those people that he would start to be affected, but by all accounts his entire journey was an act and he truly was a Judas to this black messiah. Maybe it all caught up with him in the end though as his eventual destination was suicide.Eric's Grade: A."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 August 2021,5/10,"Characterizing 21 year old Fred Hampton as a messiah is typical of the self-promoting narcissism of the 1960s New Left, when the term ""guru"" became current. Young people often take themselves very seriously. This movie may appeal to a young audience for whom the presentation of FBI spying and provocations may seem like a revelation. But it's ho-hum for the old left. This show might be better screened abroad, where they would use subtitles. The actors are very good, but too much of the dialogue is unintelligible."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,10 March 2021,9/10,"A truly exceptional piece of filmmaking. I was surprised that this was Director Shaka King's 2nd Feature Film and it was this good. Daniel Kaluuya is my lock in for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscar's this year and he definitely deserves it. So far, Kaluuya's performance is my favorite of 2021 and it will probably be that way for a while. He brings a lot of emotion to this role that I haven't seen him do in a long time. It's obvious that he cares a lot about this project. Lakeith Stanfield also did an incredible job too. He's outshined bu Kaluuya in some scenes but you can't deny the powerhouse of emotion he brings to his scene. Jesse Plemons is an actor I'm definitely keeping my eye on as he seems to be the Philip Seymour Hoffman of his generation. From what I researched and listened to, this film is very historical accurate with maybe one or two exceptions here and there but it presents everything in an incredibly tense, outstanding, and emotional way. If you know the story of Fred Hampton then you know what happens to him and the way the film portrays this is anger inducing and incredibly emotional at the same time. This is all thanks to the writing and how the film is shot. The film looks great. The way some of the shots are set up is fantastic because of how much it shows and how much it doesn't show. This is an emotional powerhouse of a film that I would definitely recommend even if you're not fully engaged in this subject."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,19 April 2021,4/10,"Great performance, but the movie was too damn slow that I made it to half of the movie then gave up."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,8/10,"This movie had way more action than I thought, reminded me of ""Heat"" in a way. There are moments where a group of people have to fight or defend an area, and it is well done.Acting is good of course, pacing is great, and overall this movie wasn't so ""in your face"" and ""preachy.""9/10"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,9/10,"It's not too often you get a film this impactful, powerful, beautiful, or emotional. You really gotta cherish films like this. The score gives this film such a life and such a specific tone that makes every second feel full of life. And speaking of full of life: The acting. The whole cast did absolutely phenomenal, especially Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield. Stop whatever you're doing and watch this film. Definitely one of the best of 2021 and it's only February."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 October 2021,6/10,"To be Surprise it was great to watch a black movie without keeping making ""White jokes"" let's face it, Hollywood writers don't like white people do they? The movie was far better than what I thought it would be. If you do choose to watch, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 May 2021,7/10,"It has been a challenging subject for the filmmakers to discuss the topic about racism and the oppressions or the problems associated with the Blacks especially the Blacks in America and also we have been witnessing that kind of films from on. Judas and the Black Messiah is something about it but flavors a biographical representation of life and events of some peculiar personalities in terms of history. To be specific, it is about Black Panther party and through it the film portrays the life its Deputy Chairman Fred Hampton, who is the Messiah. Along with his life the story also get its attention to the Judas, Bill O'Neal. One in the sense is the protagonist and the other is the antagonist (not in the original way). The movie shows the political atmosphere of America in 65's and the ideologies and activities of Black Panther Party. The communist slanting of the party is also quoted as well Fred appears similarly like Che Guevara. Its about betrayal and ultimately the assassination of Fred. Bill's thoughts and his memories gave color to the movie like a documentarily portrayal at the end. Not much surprised about the Academy Award for Daniel Kaluuya for the depiction of Fred Hampton and I like LaKeith Stanfield acting as Bill O'Neal."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 April 2021,9/10,"An electrifying and spectacular film that through the strength and magic of cinema, denounces the abuses of people who at the time fought for their people and who unfortunately continue to do so, not only establishing itself as one of the best films ever, but managing to be the bearer of profound and devastating messages. The film through the telling of the story manages to shine and to be a real manifesto for the struggle of men who have done everything possible to say ""I am a human and I have a value"", in this case a community of black people who have suffered injustices and abuses without a valid reason. Judas and the Black Messiah is directed by Shaka King with extreme intelligence and tact, with creativity and honesty; excellent choice of the cinematography and music that enhance the scenes and emotions of the brilliant cast (including Jesse Plemons, always a pleasure to see him acting), but above all the impeccable and perfect LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya who lead the film with commitment, honesty and dedication, once again managing to establish themselves among the best actors of contemporary cinema, not only increasing the value of the film, but creating a real acting masterclass. Judas and the Black Messiah is rich in elements that blend between reality and cinema, but in this case is nothing more than a single and well-defined world to be taken as an example and therefore as a purpose to follow, as well as the characters of the true story tried to do."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,8/10,"William O' Neal and J. Edgar Hoover are the most notorious Snitches I have ever seen. Talk about setting up the Black Panthers as Terrorist. Fred Hampton's tragic story about loving his people. How he tried to educate the people about how bad the political and justice system is. Daniel Kaluuya, a phenomenal actor, plays him perfectly. His friend William is a dirty rat who turns on him. J. Edgar Hoover is the worst scum as well. You definitely love to hate them. The only thing that might annoy you is the music note in this movie might irritate your ear. Geez, why have to make it so annoying!Other than that it was a good movie to watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 March 2021,7/10,"I knew embarrassingly little about about the real story going into this. The story itself is shocking and tragic. The 2 central roles are played spectacularly; I felt real sympathy with a character who could have been easily vilified: a young man, out of his depth and caught up in events over which he has almost no control. There are some very slow moving moments, particularly at the beginning and the supporting characters have very little exploration but the core story and performances are strong enough to carry the film. There was also a great jazz soundtrack that added a nice atmosphere and a strong attention to historic details that made it a very immersive watch. Ultimately this is a powerful film about a real life part of US history which has some unnerving parallels with the present day; and for that reason alone would merit a viewing."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 November 2021,8/10,"Instead it focuses on the governments influence and corruption of destroying and eliminating leaders and emerging leaders for civil rights. The film plays more on the idea of ""The People vs The Government's Agenda"" with police being seen more as pawns and executioners. If you watched this movie thinking you were going to get Malcolm X pt. 2 think again.This film surprisingly given what organization its content is about doesn't drop any pro black - black panther style messages in it. It also doesn't glorify the idea of violence but rather the repercussions of raising arms against authority.True to the movie's title the film is about William O'Neal and his role as an FBI informant assisting the U. S. Government to assassinate civil rights leader Fred Hampton.It's an interesting movie based on real life events. In the modern day the battle for civil rights is still going on so the movie isn't exactly like taking a page from a forgotten history where so much has changed."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 March 2021,8/10,"Shaka King's Judas and the Black Messiah is everything done right. Especially from a purely storytelling perspective, it manages to keep you invested in the ongoing drama with each progressing beat. And doing justice to what can only be described as a masterfully written screenplay, are the performances of both Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield who bring the raw emotions that give life to words written on paper.A movie that I feel compelled to compare this to is Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman released only a couple years ago. Dealing with a different sort of infiltration, coupled with sentiments that resonate and speak to today's political climate, I feel JATBM capitalized on every aspect that BlacKkKlansman couldn't quite perfect, to communicate a strong sense of emotion and heart; by having a story told without any stylistic distractions, and at the same time, respecting its audience's intelligence.Even from a technical aspect, everything was perfect. From its high energy music, to luscious and somewhat quasi-noir cinematography, to atmospheric but stylized lighting, to immersive production designs, this movie perfectly repaints history visually on screen.A definite recommendation to anyone willing to watch some heavy historical drama."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 June 2021,7/10,"I gotta admit that this movie is a bit overrated as its screenplay lacks intrigue and mystery; however, the performances delivered by Kaluuya and Stanfield were so brilliant that giving a lower rating would be unforgivable."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,30 July 2021,1/10,"What was this? A movie and that too a biography. Not interested this movie made the poor guy's life seem so boring and irrelevant. Avoid it it's dull, slow, boring."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,31 May 2021,2/10,"The story that this is about is interesting, but it was not well executed in the film. I found myself constantly bored watching this movie. A lot of it was just people talking and at times it was difficult to understand what some of the characters were saying. I thought it was maybe my tv speakers that were the problem, but from reading some other reviews, it's the movie. The acting was good though, especially Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield. The film was too slow-paced and dull for me. It was actually hard to finish. I wouldn't watch it again."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 March 2021,8/10,"What amazing acting! *slow claps*
For an international living in the US, with limited knowledge about the Black Panther Party, this was an interesting movie to watch. Funny how some of the scenes from the movie make you think ""Yeah, that's relevant even today, innit?""
The movie is just a snapshot of a larger story and is very thought-provoking. There're lies, deception, injustice in the name of justice, etc. The movie throws a light on Chicago PD/FBI's view of the people from the people's perspective. You finish watching the movie, the end credits roll and you're like ""Whoa, that must have taken a lot of toll.""
The acting was PHENOMENAL. I'm mad Daniel Kaluuya hasn't been considered to be the ""Lead Actor"" this man deserves an Oscar for this movie, which he's likely going to get for a Supporting Role. LaKeith Stanfield and Dominique Fishback easily pull off their roles as well. LaKeith's expressions were amazing!
This is a gripping history drama, watch it for sure, and watch it especially if you're an international in the US. Easily one of the best films of the year."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 October 2021,8/10,"Amidst the cultural revolution that America is going through today, this film tells the story of the infamous Black Panther Group who took a hard stance against Police Brutality and one of its most charismatic leader Fred Compton who was brutally killed in a state sponsored assassination. The story draws parallels with the story of Judas & Christ, as FBI planted an informer Bill O' Neal who became Fred's Bodyguard and was instrumental in his murder. Two very different but Electric performances from Daniel Kaluuya & LaKeith Stanfield steal the show, the writing is fantastic as well. Director Shaka King helms the film very well with great scenes and well complemented music."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 April 2021,8/10,"The story of the struggle of black Panthers in the America of the 1960s. Daniel Kaluuya is Fred Hampton, the energetic and charismatic revolutionary leader , the Chairman who is at the center stage of this revolution on human rights. His speeches are full of rousing rhetorics asking the blacks to rise in rebellion. He is the Black Messiah.On the other hand Lakeith Stanfield plays Bill O' Neal , the Judas or the FBI informant who infiltrates the network of the Black Panthers. (He has been blackmailed by the law to become their spy, since he had impersonated an FBI officer and is facing a 5 year jail term.)
Director Shaka King makes a good film and extracts memorable performances from both Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield and both may land up with awards. The dialogue is powerful and makes the film dramatic. The climax is spine chilling. The film is realistic and moving. The speeches of Daniel have an authentic feel as the revolution catches on. There are many emotional scenes. The violence is in your face and gritty. For many the film will be reminiscent of
"" The departed"" since it has the ""Scorsese "" feel to it. There is an interesting cameo by Martin Sheen as FBI director Edgar Hoover."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 May 2021,5/10,"The movie is decent and has some well acted powerful parts, but it focuses a lot on side stories and is kind of choppy. It doesn't really know what it wants to be in my opinion. I feel they could have gone deeper into the characters. Especially the character (Daniel) plays. I think his portrayal could have been better.The movie goes off on tangents without really building the core story. Then we get a quick mass shooting and it's over. For a movie nominated for an Oscar I would think it would have been way better. But that goes to show you about the types of movies nominated for Awards these days."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 April 2021,2/10,"Social commentary is one thing but having your message all over the place is another. Nonsense.I don't understand how it managed to win so many awards. Other than to bow down to the virtue signalling.In particular the ""Original Song"", since having an end credits song should not count. The song was not used at any point during the whole film. It has nothing to do with the storyline and didn't move the plot in anyway.However, the immaculate acting by Daniel Kaluuya literally carried the whole cast. The brilliant young Brit shows how far he's come from his humble days such as his work in Psychoville."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,Ive been looking forward to this film for quite a long time. Having met Freds mom and his brother Bill before he passed... I was direly anticipating this release... The only gripe I have is the ending shooting which was of course dramatized... Otherwise this movie is excellent... Lakeith Stansfeld deserves an award for his role. An insiders view of an informant who begins to care at the end.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,6/10,Not a bad movie but the story is a bit disjointed with random scenes occurring with no explanation or back story. And it drags on with small talk and getting nowhere.But it is somewhat interesting as a true story.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,7/10,"Strong characters , good acting from the main roles , scenes full of tension... Surely a nice movie to seat comfortably and watch..."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 February 2021,9/10,"An excellent film, brilliantly interpreted and directed by Shaka King telling the true story of a young leader of the black panthers murdered by the FBI. The film is told from the perspective of an FBI infiltrator within the movement.
This true story is a violent slap in the face, as things have not changed since then and reminds us of the extent to which injustice, political bashings and an oppressive police force are still on the rise. Numerous archive images slipped throughout the film illustrate this drama and its issues which unfortunately have not aged 50 years. Any attempt to emancipate the people from the system is systematically drowned out by a minority of powerful wishing to preserve their way of life by using endless methods of division, stigmatization, and mounted blows, including assassinations. A great biopic."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 April 2021,7/10,"Let me starts off my saying Daniel Kaluuya is gonna win the oscars this year for best supporting actors in a few more days..Ok let's get back to the movie here there are things that I love and the things that I found boring and plain stupid.Firstly the FBI informer which is Bill predicament throughout the movie was just not intense to be believable due to the fact that we knew he survived through the film in the beginning.. the way he describe to his handler he is afraid being found out and even having dreams that the panther kills him etcSecondly the relationship of the informer and the handler meets up was way too casual meeting up at public restaurant as if the Roy Mitchell and Bill o Neal was so sure there is no one around to watch them another flaws tooThirdly regarding the confrontation of Jimmy Palmer it was just plain stupid going in with no plans whatsoever and staring to shoots those cops and what do you expect the cops will react.. you can't blame them to have a rage.. it is just poorly executed.Fourthly. Regarding the this I love was the black panther meeting and Fred Hampton speech the whole meeting just sparks out, the meeting with the crown was actually goodFifthly a shout out to Deborah portrayal was just right on with the poetry and love he shown to FredFinally after I finished watching indeed I do a bit of researching and found out the movie adaptation stays quite faithful to what happens so I'm gonna rate it 6.8."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 March 2021,7/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a film that starts with a strong presentation. The film flows with good and powerful elements for two hours straight. Daniel Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield and all the other actors poured their best into the film. The pacing is as good as needed for this film. In the middle the film gets a little slow but it catches your attention when it starts hitting the third arc. Screenplay is good but some more tweaks could have been done. The ending of the film is nice but with the elements and direction it could have been more impactful but even though that director Shaka King still pulled a good job. Overall it's a film that belongs to both the clubs in terms of watching, one time watch and also watching as many times as the audience wants."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,Biopics are usually a hard sell for me but this one was well made. I wish there was more on Fred Hampton's actions and speeches but I'm glad the movie was made. I'm tired of people's feelings being hurt when they hear of black history. Not wanting to hear the truth is what causes things not to change. Black people are a people who are oppressed. Period! If you don't want to hear that then you should leave it alone and let black people deal with it.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,29 March 2021,8/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah, is yet another example of how dysfunctional a society can really be, to the point of something that happened 40 years ago being almost indistinguishable from today's reality.This movie tells the real life story of Fred Hampton, a leader of the revolutionary group Black Panthers, and a criminal turned FBI informant Bill O'Neil that is tasked with the mission of infiltrating the group. I am not sure if this is indeed an accurate depiction of the events, regardless the outcome is real as well as the implications it has, not only we continue to see the depth of evil that the so called national security agencies really propagate, and how they continue to disguise themselves as the saviors of the country, destroying it from the inside.Of course this is a simplified view of an foreigner who has had is fair share of dark and real stories coming from the US, still, and independently of your political color and opinion on the matter, I strongly advise that everyone sees this movie and sees how scary it is that still today similar atrocities are committed, in the name of once of most ancient pandemics of the last years, racism.Sure there is a moral grey area on some of the Black Panther actions, throughout the years, but placed into the context of the reality, if you pressure something with enough force, there will always be an explosion eventually.The movie takes a safe approach and in a way doesn't seem to ""chose sides"" if you can call it like that, but regardless, the events that transpire show how deeply rooted the bias still endures to this day and how US society continues to be divided on the most fundamental topics of humanity.Fantastic performances specially from Daniel Kaluuya, one of the best ones this year!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 March 2021,7/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a drama film about the betrayal of Fred Hampton chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party in late-1960s Chicago, at the hands of William O'Neal, an FBI informant. The movie boasts of Lakeith Stanfield's insanely good performance and Daniel Kaluuya's electrifying one. It is an interesting drama and a powerful retelling of a violent chapter of US history with a gorgeous direction. But the film isn't always gripping and sometimes is too slow.Rating: 7,1."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 February 2021,8/10,This is based on a true story. The government is shady and have done evil like that things all the time. I get Daniel is a british actor and seems like he is struggling with the american accent but lakieth played his character so good that I hated him the entire movie. Everyone should see this movie.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 March 2021,9/10,"The tragic story of former Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton has found a worthy recipient in director Shaka King. In his second feature film, Shaka tells the story of the rise of the young Hampton in Chicago in the late 1960s. The latter is unaware that a member of his own ranks is cooperating with the FBI to put a stop to him and the party.Judas and the Black Messiah is marked by outstanding performances. Lakeith Stanfield acts as the ""Judas"" in the film, i.e. traitor William O'Neal, who is infiltrated into the Black Panther group as a mole by FBI employee Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) after attempted car theft. The two share a very believable and atypical chemistry that almost makes you suspect a friendship of sorts. The real person behind William O'Neal even said years later that he admired Mitchell. Stanfield is the real protagonist of the film. Large parts are taken up by Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton, the ""Black Messiah"" beloved by many but just as much opposed by many. Kaluuya is tailor-made for this role. He is electrifying, powerful and does not hold back in illustrating his emotions. It is above all Kaluuya's eyes that say a great deal about his character and illustrate the determination Fred Hampton displayed to assert his values. Especially during speeches he lets it all out and combines all kinds of emotional states: suffering, passion and anger towards the ""Pigs"" (racists). Dominique Fishback, as Hampton's partner and mother-to-be Deborah, takes up quite a bit of screen time and displays enormous poetry and passion in her few dialogues. She and Kaluuya also have terrific chemistry.Judas and the Black Messiah is ultimately just a semi-biopic about one of the most significant black freedom fighters in American history. The focus is on O'Neal's betrayal and Hampton's relentless fight against racism and for equality. Besides the superb acting performances, the cinematography and King's atmospheric direction stand out as major strengths. If the film can be criticised for anything, it is that due to its lengthy structure it often fails to find a red thread and gets lost in arbitrary subplots a few times. These have relevance to the main plot, but take up several minutes of the running time. Without Stanfield's authentic acting, his character would lack a lot of humanity, because it is difficult to empathise with him despite him being the protagonist. The exact opposite is the case with Kaluuya, who absolutely dominates and captivates the film. From start to finish, he fills Hampton's big shoes brilliantly, honouring a historical figure who unfortunately flies far too much under the radar. Judas and the Black Messiah is an excellently realised film and communicates important and educational incidents."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 March 2021,8/10,"I'd heard of the Black Panthers but I'd never seen a feature length film about one of them until this one. A clever and devastating approach to the biopic, learning about Hampton through O' Neal who is trying to figure it all out himself, alluding to the tragic perspective of Judas. Although I don't agree with everything Hampton and the Panthers stood for, there is a unique resonance of someone who (even at the age of 21!) was able to build alliances and draw together a coalition of the urban poor across color lines."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 February 2021,10/10,"Where is the American Justice? I watched The Trial of Chicago 7, One Night in Miami, Time and many others and I am struggling to understand how the White American population can be so blind, unfair and put their heads on the pillow every night when so many black brothers are being violated of their rights every second of their lives?
How can we call justice when the white FBI agents were not responsible for the murder of so many members of the black panther in the 60s/70s?
Americans should be ashamed to have the word JUSTICE in their dictionary."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,31 May 2021,8/10,"This was a great film with the power to illustrate how many issues that have happened throughout history continue to happen today . The story within the movie itself was very powerful and heartbreaking- this is an important piece of history to be put into film to be remembered .Film is an incredibly powerful medium to help motivate us to be part of the problem or part of the solution and this is what this movie did for me .Well acted , incredible history , great cinematography- would recommend to everyone."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,"When I first saw the Lucas Brothers in 22 Jump Street I told myself these guys would be perfect for a Fred Hampton biopic.Jokes aside this movie is fantastic. The performances are amazing especially from Daniel Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield, and the rest of the cast. Shaka King's direction also showcases himself as a formidable force.The only nitpick I have is the film doesn't take a firm stance whether it's mainly about Fred Hampton or Bill O' Neal. Obviously, the film discusses both of them in depth, but it's hard to decide who is the main protagonist.Regardless, the combination of eclectic performances and captivating direction delivers one of the best films in the last few years."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,6/10,This movie should have been shot traditionally as becomes to a historical drama. But it only reaches that level at the very end with the tragedy. Most of two quite boring hours it looks like it was produced by people who only yesterday made teenage vampire tv shows.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 April 2021,8/10,"Great movie about a horrible part of the USA history, where ideas become ideology, and lead to extremism (now days we call this terrorism) from both sides (pigs, and panthers), of course when you represent law you are more guilty! And this movie show us perfectly the ugly side of this Era!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 April 2021,8/10,"Movie is good. Well directed. Great actors all around. Perfect score (awesome music). But let's be clear, panthers killed cops and killed their own. No heros there. No MLK unity or equality message, just plain old marxist indoctrinated barbarians. I know it's controversial but, by no means that criminal behavior is ok. This movie is as amoral as Malcom X. The ""hero"" is urging for assassination guerrilla style. Judas is not existent in this movie cause Jesus is not found. This is a movie about criminals, the FBI acted like criminals, the BPs acted like criminals and the so called judas was a snitch. I enjoyed the movie, even with it's clear pro-socialist message."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,6/10,"It's a fantastic true story that needs to be known, and shared. The movie is good, and well done, but it does get kind of bogged down and drawn out. The movie could use a little better pacing, but it's a powerful true story!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 February 2021,5/10,"Maybe I had too many expectations about this one, and I felt let down by the linear and unsurprising story-telling.I honestly don't think it deserves the high praise I read in the comments.
On the exact same subject, the recent Trial of the Chicago 7 set the bar so much higher in terms of plot and story unfolding.Despite some great acting performances, I find Judas and the black Messiah kind of flat and empty. Not to sound like a broken record, but watch the Chicago 7 instead."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 July 2021,6/10,"Fred Hampton and the black panther movement of the late 1960s certainly make an interesting subject, and although this is well performed and executed I didn't end up liking it that much. The treatment is somewhat detached and subject isn't really explained well. I'm afraid it left me a bit cold."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,8/10,"Big movie attitude, telling a story that wants to be heard. Not enough focus on character development leaves you wanting but the story itself is interesting enough to carry you til the end. Doesnt fill the shoes it acts like it will as the story wanders a bit and doesnt cover things that are more interesting to viewers. I would say its worth a watch and the acting is great."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 March 2021,10/10,"Given the subject matter, this movie is an unflinching, unvarnished, uncompromising look into the life and revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton.For those who are unfamiliar with Fred Hampton, during the time of the Chicago 7, in the late Sixties, Fred Hampton was the leader of the Black Panthers (not of course to be confused with the recent movie, Black Panther) of Chicago. Long before the term was fashionable, Hampton was able to forge what he called a rainbow coalition with other brown and white revolutionary groups, which no doubt hastened his death. In December 1969 he was shot dead while he sleeping by members of the Chicago Police and FBI. There is no historical disagreement that J. Edgar Hoover personally directed the assassination of Fred Hampton. None of the participants were prosecuted nor even questioned following his assassination.The story is told through the eyes of the Judas, the traitor in the organization, Bill O'Neil, and his FBI handler. In life, O'Niel was Fred Hampton's closest associate, so you can see how deep the FBI was able to penetrate the organization. While there are moments when the movie digresses into Hollywood hokum, on the whole this movie is a sympathetic and accurate portrayal of the revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton. The focus of the film is Hampton's thoughts and dreams. By watching this film you will see the care with which that revolutionary thought was presented on the screen. It is both surprising and gratifying at the same time to see a major studio embark on this project and preserve Hampton's life, memory, and thoughts for a new generation."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 March 2021,8/10,"This movie was quite well made. I have read about Fred Hampton before, but the absolute terror of the FBI upon his life was really made clear by this film. Daniel Kaluuya emulated the necessary leadership and charisma to portray Hampton. My only issue with his casting is that he is in his thirties, while Fred Hampton died at age 21. I think this is really crucial to the story- his assassination at such a young age is not a minor detail. I do appreciate that Akua Njeri (known at the time of the film as Deborah Johnson) and Fred Hampton Jr. were consulted for this film, and I think that is clear. While Bill O'Neal takes the forefront as a double agent, Fred Hampton's character is still highlighted and preserved. The ending was absolutely devastating, particularly the choice to include footage of the real Bill O'Neal. I think this film launches an important conversation about being complicit vs. actively harming someone, especially in the context of the Black Power movement. I also think it's important for people to learn about the FBI's assassination of Black Panthers, something which isn't typically taught in history classes."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,8/10,"This is for SDawson_1 who obviously has a very strange obsession with people that don't have the same political view as himself, you can look at his review a few below mine! He states ""Trump fans will hate this"" blah blah blah he also says ""look at Trump fans other reviews"" funny kid be I looked at all yours and every single review you have left is bashing Trump fans! Looks like Mr Trump is living rent free your head little one ha ha"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,9/10,This film should win an Oscar based on that one scene alone
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,"My only complaint was for whatever reason the dialogue was super low on HBO Max. Kaluuya deserves an Oscar for his performance. Up until I saw this, I was sure Riz Ahmed for Sound of Metal would win, Kaluuya topped that performance. If this doesnt make you think about how far the US has yet to come w.r.t. race relations, then I cant help you."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 July 2021,7/10,"The cinematography is compelling and the film is about an important era in history. I knew about Fred Hampton but not about the FBI informant. The film does a good job showing what J. Edgar Hoover's FBI was about, namely, breaking the law and vendettas. But I felt like I was watching a foreign film without subtitles because the ghetto patois is so thick I couldn't understand more than half the dialogue. I was only born in the 60s but even in the brief newsreels that the film shows, people speak more intelligibly than the actors do. It was kind of like, mumble mumble shee-it! Over and over again. I suggest re-releasing with subtitles."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 March 2021,1/10,This would have been a better documentary as the only interesting parts were the historical clips. But everyone was a great actor in this!
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"This is a grand adaptation of a story with a well known ending. Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of the betrayed Fred Hampton and the on-target Judas of LaKeith Stanfield worked well under the direction of Shaka King and the words of writer Will Berson among others. Sean Bobbitt's digital photography was spot on with realistic editing by Kristan Sprague. They all needed to be named here because of the clearly collaborative effort that brought this to the big and small screen for all to see. It's a ""must-see"" film that will not bore you and for those who don't know the story, it contains all of the elements of great filmmaking. And by the way; How about that Martin Sheen as J. Edgar Hoover? A surprise in casting but the characterization was not over the top. One more thing: this movie will not improve police/community relations."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 July 2021,2/10,"I watched this intently the first time - paying close attention to the story. I just had a major major problem following the story (actually didn't). So, when it became available on HBOmax, I thought I'd give it another shot. Still just as mind numbing as the first time. Granted, the two leads are exceptional in their performances, but what a bunch of words to go thru to get to the end........ This is just another picture that benefited from the pandemic - it would have performed poorly in theatres (like a number of other films this past year including that Best Picture NOMADLAND). People who plunk down $10-$12 to see a movie in theatres expect to be entertained formost (if you can educate too - that's a plus). This film educates - but it doesn't entertain."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 May 2021,5/10,"Profanity galore. Normal language slipped in between foul language. Though black life matters, profanity doesn't; may be it is reality. I shut off."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,29 March 2021,9/10,"HBO Max's quality drama ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" is the story of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, and his fateful betrayal by FBI informant William O'Neal. This film avoids all the traps of traditional biopics. Its tight timeline, pacing, and careers best performances by Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield distinguish it from similar stories. The real star is writer/director Shaka King, who speaks with his camera and heart and with Fred's oratorical scenes. It is a powerful film that has political fervor embedded in almost every minute. The message of the film is extremely poignant in today's US climate without feeling like it was trying to recruit the audience. The best lesson from this movie is that - ""Badge is scarier than a gun""."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,6/10,"I thought the stars Daniel Kaluuya who played radical leader Fred Hampton and Lakeith Stanfield as FBI informant William O'Neal were excellent in their roles although obviously too old for the parts.For a drama the film was low on energy. At times I was unclear who was doing what to whom. A lot of things were unclear as to what was happening and why it was happening.I would never watch it again so for that reason it is not Oscar worthy, although the lead actors deserve nominations."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 April 2021,8/10,"If you liked:
The Departed
The Trial of the Chicago 7
BlacKkKlansmanThis is a 2021 based-on-a-true-story film about Fred Hampton, the deputy chairman of an Illinois Black Panther Party, a political organization motivated by a desire for safety and self-sufficiency that was not available inside redlined African American neighborhoods. A car thief named Bill O'Neil is then recruited by the FBI to infiltrate the Party and keep Hampton ""in check"", supposedly because of his revolutionary ideas. The film is focused not so much on the politics of it all, but on the personal struggle of a 21(!) year old Hampton and 17(!) year old O'Neil, as O'Neil is quite literally selling his soul to the devil; going through a psychological fragmentation as he betrays his whole community by spying on Hampton.To be honest, I don't like to review these kinds of movies because I never know enough historical background to do them proper justice. Topics like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X or Black Panthers just aren't a part of Russian history lessons, so most of the knowledge that I have on them come from portrayals in such movies, interviews about the films and Wikipedia articles. What I thought would be really useful in the beginning of the film is to maybe give a little historical introduction of specific events that kept happening in America over and over again and that eventually lead to the creation of the party. Make a film sort of ""outsider-friendly"" at least to a small degree. Also, Hampton was an open Marxist and I don't know how to feel about that taking my country's history with this ideology into account. But judging by his interviews that I could find he was a very ""selective"" type of Marxist, putting forth ideas that you should primarily educate and enlighten the masses rather than to wreak havoc with a violent revolution. He realized that people are the most valuable assed there is, and it would be foolish to put their lives at risk. I just feel like he was doing all the right things for the wrong reasons.But this is a movie review and not a political statement, so I must mention that despite the perhaps intimidating seriousness of the film, it is still very interesting to watch, especially if you don't know where it's all going. Both main actors did a great job and went through incredible preparation process; Daniel Kaluuya's portrayal of Fred Hampton is so on point that it's just eerie: the movements, the accent, the manner of speech; everything was basically identical. And Lakeith Stanfield, who played the rat, apparently had to go through therapy in order to deal with the burden of playing someone who betrays his own people. Both actors were reunited after the 2017 ""Get Out"" and I was happy to see them back together on the screen because I loved that film with passion.Daniel Kaluuya is my pick for this year's Supporting Role Oscar, although I think that other 5 nominations will stay being merely nominations."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 August 2021,7/10,"Judas and Black Messiah is a strong left political drama which is based on real life events. The film is extremely realistic in nature and succeeds in almost recreating the events quite perfectly. When it comes to performance Lakeith Stanfield stands out above all with his spy performance and wins in portraying the character's moral conflicts perfectly. It is a refreshing take due to a lot of aspects including BGM, cinematography and much more. Most praiseworthy part of the movie is its realistic shootout sequences and the dark unexpected ending which elevates the movie.The major thing that degraded my viewing experience was the extreme political dialogues which were too much in the first half that it made that part of the movie dull and shallow for me.In the end, Judas and Black Messiah is a versatile successful recreation of a treacherous historic conspiracy with big shocks waiting for the viewer at the end.Rating:68%"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,7/10,"You'll know all about Judas and the Messiah. Good acting, and all around heart breaking. It was a good watch though. I think it could've been better, but overall I would recommend it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 October 2021,8/10,"You know between Get Out, Black Panther, and now Judas and The Black Messiah Daniel Kaluuya is shaping up to be a great actor. This is a powerful movie about betrayal, political corruption, and black liberation. Daniel Kaluuya plays Fred Hampton, a black revolutionary who mobilizes people not by violence but by persuasive rhetoric. You get the sense that if it were not for the insidious machinations of the FBI and the police department, Hampton would have created a rainbow coalition of all races to combat social injustice. Alas, that rainbow coalition was not meant to be. Anyway I digress, as performances go, Kaluuya knocks it out of the park. He has a tremendous screen presence and he delivers the rousing speeches with gusto.As great as Kaluuya is, I would argue Lakeith Stanfield has the trickier role, playing William O' Neal. He has to play the betrayer sure, but he also has to play a character that is in awe of Fred Hampton, but not at the expense of his own self preservation. When you boil him down to his bare essentials, O' Neal is a cudgel for the FBI to dismantle the Black Panther movement. But I will say this: Stanfield brings a lot of humanity to a character that is not very likable which is the point. I don't have many grievances against the film, aside from some minor technical issues. I had an issue with Martin Sheen's make-up not his performance.Sheen plays a racist prick to a tilt, but that prosthetic make-up was so distracting to me. He looked more like a Dick Tracy villain not J Edgar Hoover. The filmmakers should have let Martin Sheen play the role without make up. That's just my opinion. This movie features a great ensemble of acting talent and there's not a weak performance in the bunch. This film is about Fred Hampton and William O' Neal, and how they compare and contrast with each other. This movie is not an easy watch given the subject matter. But, it's worth watching for the performances alone, and it gives you a look at the darker parts of American History."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 August 2021,9/10,"Was not my genre.Was not my actors
Nor was my enthusiasm at all.Yet, glued me to end, if not from the start.It was a delight to watch a history in well made masterpiece.Stays with you after a long time."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,The movie was well written and very informative. Very powerful acting. I was not disappointed
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,1/10,"Seriously? I think we know why thats for sure.
Interesting but by no means Great movie. Fell asleep towards end.
By no measure is this an all time Great movie. By no means. More of a documentary of the black cougars"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,23 June 2021,8/10,"There is a vibrant dichotomy at play here. Conviction and doubt. Brotherhood and betrayal. Fear and decisiveness. And it's all in the skillful acting of its two main characters. The plot is a tad choppy, but I would like to believe that was the intention. It's more of a story where I am following the relationship of two characters over the course of the film's runtime. I am of the persuasion that a film like this places a lot of weight on the shoulders of the two characters. However, Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield both showed that they can easily carry the whole film. I am especially fond of how much acting there is in Stanfield's facial expressions alone, but seriously, the sheer quality of acting by the two leads is such a smooth entry into the entire community and movement that this film is presenting. I was just invested from the beginning. And now I know I want to see more of Stanfield, because my goodness that guy can act."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is,in my opinion,The Best Film of The Year.
Shaka King's movie has achieved every task in order to become an Academy Award Film,King talks in Judas and the Black Messiah about:racism,the human nature,the human rights as well as showing us that being diferent,in America,is a crime.
I have to say that the cast is beyond amazing,especially the duo between Daniel Kaluuya(Fred Hampton/The Black Messiah) and Keith Stanfield(Wiliam O'Neal/Judas).
By the way,the soundtrack is something that I'd never heard in a long time.Every sound/song is electrifying and great.
As for the plot/story arc of the film,the 1st and the last act are beautiful but the 2nd act is a bit confusing but nonetheless is still great.
Watching Judas and The Black Messiah,for a second,it made me feel like I was watching either a Spike Lee film or a Martin Scorsese movie.That's how great Shaka King's motion picture is,even better than some of the films produced by Lee or Scorsese.
I just hope that either Kaluuya or Stanfield,if not both,will win an Academy Award for their magnificient performances.
Overall,Judas and The Black Messiah is definitely the best film of the year and try and see it as soon as you can because you won't know what you miss."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,29 April 2021,9/10,"If it wasn't for Daniel Kaluuya, I don't think this film would have been successful. He carried so much power and energy to the film, especially in the ""I am a revolutionary"" scene. You'd think it was just a protest that someone recorded and not acting. I didn't care if the sorry wasn't historically actuate, I was still engaged and interested what would happen next as scenes progressed."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 October 2021,2/10,I'm guessing people are scared to mark this down. The acting is TERRIBLE. The direction is TERRIBLE. Casting is TERRIBLE. Really really bad. Hollywood needs to start making entertainment again.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 August 2021,10/10,"Wow, this is probably the best movie I saw this year so far (and I saw a lot). Well written screenplay, superb direction and camera, outstanding performance by the cast. This is especially true for LaKeith Stanfield and I cant understand why he wasn't nominated as best actor in a leading role and won. Man, the academy is such a bunch of blind people...Also Jesse Plemons is one not to forget. His role of Roy Mitchel is one of the most nasty villains on screen. He absolutely nails it with so little gestures and looks."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 August 2021,1/10,"Let me preface this review by stating I like black people. I wear a lot of black-colored clothing. My car is black. My labrador is black. I color my hair black. My first gf was black...and I never went back. Except once. Which, btw, was a huge mistake. Anyhoo, this film was a mess on many levels. You couldn't decipher what the characters were saying. The story itself was sloppy and incoherent. The director pitched this film to HBO as a black version of ""The Departed."" Talk about delusional. This film could best be described as a cross between ""Sounder"" and ""Willie Dynamite"" spoken in gibberish. The only people I can imagine enjoying this film would be the deaf. Because even black folk are gonna find this jive wack."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,5/10,"Powerful, compelling story mostly well told, irredeemably marred by the performance of Daniel Kaluuya. Could barely understand a thing he said throughout the entire film. Finally had to turn on closed captioning. Daniel Kaluuya is a fine actor. Ultimately it is a matter of poor direction."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 May 2021,9/10,"If a film was so aptly named this would have to be it. If a book was written today the story would be the same. This is a cracker of a film and deserved all accolades that cometh its way. Set in the 60s we are transported to the struggles and triumphs of The Black Panther family.The story is around the time ""The Messaih"" Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) is the revolutionary leader of the Black Panther party. The white powers that be are threatened and the police are determined to bring it down. Enter William O'Neill (LaKeith Stanfield) Hampton's best buddy who goes around pretending to be cops to steal cars. To escape prison time he's forced to be a snitch on the inside and betray the leader, thus the ""Judas"".The story line dramatised from the reality is still captivating and that because of the acting. Daniel deserved his Oscar no question. Its not necessarily a biography of Hampton but a story that draws you in to the very end."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 April 2021,9/10,"Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party is working for a proletarian revolution.Another member of the party, William O'Neal sold him out!This film is a masterpiece kinda work. Every single frame is so damn amazing. The director is so visionary, several camera angles are intentionally chosen with the vision to glue the viewer's eyes to the screen. The cinematography is simply amazing in many aspects. The pacing, composition, framing, everything is so good. The overall pace of the film is also well-balanced. Color grading is top-notch. When it comes to acting, everybody showcased exceptionally outstanding performance!A minor problem, slight romance and melodrama which comes in the film makes the viewer feel a lag. Anyway, it's so minute that it could be neglected and it should not be taken as a factor for criticism.This movie is a must watch!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 June 2021,9/10,"Judas is a hard hitting, visceral drama that fully deserves its best picture nomination. I thought the original soundtrack as well as obviously Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield's performances were excellent. Kaluuya was utterly electrifying in one scene in particular, and Stanfield should win an award for best intense, teary eyed stare. It's a shame only one of them could win the supporting actor Oscar. An excellent film on all counts, looking forward to seeing more releases soon."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 April 2021,,This movie is about 30 minutes too long and boring.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 March 2021,9/10,"Fantastic film. Very engaging and moving. Truly commendable costume design. The Biblical allusion in the title is apt.
Although the plotline with the FBI seem a little contrived, the scenes with the Black Panthers are nothing less than fantastic. I wish the characters of the FBI agents were a little more fleshed out. Nevertheless, it's a brilliant effort to bring clarity to the complexities of the times."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,8/10,"Electrifying acting by Kaluuya. Not knowing anything about the Black Panthers, it was an extremely interesting and insightful film. That being said I agree the flow of the film was very lazy. There were many moments I felt bored. The dialogue was ok. The cinematography and especially the lighting in the film was very nice."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,10 March 2021,7/10,I love movies based on true stories and it was really fascinating to see this and get just glimpse into a part of society from a long time ago.Acting was fantastic and the setting in general was very well done
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,5/10,"As an African American who have seen and read documentaries and biopics on Fred Hampton, this movie I cannot recommend. Don't get me wrong, after all I've read and seen over the decades, I STILL can't say that I know the full Fred Hampton story. But I know THIS film isn't anywhere NEAR a true depiction. This movie here is just trying to get some empathy awards during/before Oscar time based on race and the BLM movement. All that ""Judas and the Black Messiah"" really is is a slow emotional buildup to a black mans assassination. The SAD part is that this film could have easily been about ANY black man, because it never once depicted the true Fred Hampton. The title "" Judas and the Black Messiah"" doesn't even focus on who Bill O'Neal (Judas) was and what his motivations REALLY were. All we know from the ""filmmaker"" is that she views O'Neal as a traitor. Why not tell us why? Because emotion kills logic, so there doesn't have to be any truth OR logic right? If there are any people who are interested in more truth about Hampton or BBP? Try any and every documentary on the subject before you use this film as the truth.This movie is just more lazy filmmaking."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,8/10,"✅Both Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield were absolutely brilliant, some of the best performances of their lives, worthy of awards. Everyone was good but these were the two main characters and stood out.✅The storytelling is superb, it constantly keeps you engaged. It really had an impact on me as a viewer.
✅It is executed well in all the departments, the look, the tone, the pacing and overall how it was directed.
✅Daniel Kaluuya's character Fred Hampton leads many many inspiring speeches and monologues.
✅Many movies in this past year have been movies which were mostly eyeing to be on a streaming service, and a lot of the time those movies aren't as good in quality as ones which would be theatrically released. It really gave me this feeling of watching a new release which I haven't had in a very long time. I was fully invested.
✅This movie overall has potential to take home many awards."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,"The direction of the film was tight and kept the narrative moving forward, it never felt slow or forced.The acting was superb from top to bottom. Fred's oratorical scene after being released from prison was some of the most powerful on screen rhetoric since Mel Gibson's ""freedom"" speech in Braveheart.The message of the film was extremely poignant in today's climate without feeling like it was over proselytizing. It was a historical dramatization, nothing more and nothing less.The ending, while it should have been predictable, was nevertheless shocking and disturbing.Really well done overall, a must watch in my opinion."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,"Oscar worthy performances by the entire cast, production value, cinematography and script. Although this was based on true accounts and very serious, unfunny subject matter, the scene with Chicago comedian Lil Rel had me dying laughing! You'll see why...Bravo to this film!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 April 2021,6/10,"Too much unnecessary info and scenes ,
Potrayal of reality was a little over the edge,
Boring at times - this should have been a documentary ."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,9/10,"A truly fascinating movie about the life of Fred Hampton and the betrayal of William O'Neal. I had some clue on who Fred Hampton was and what he stood for, but this movie shows just how careful he needed to be as a person and how much he needed to fight for his beliefs. The story is so fantastically build up to the point where I knew how it was going to end, and it still left me in shock and disbelieve. Even though I think the movie pictures the Black Panther a bit too much as the heroes, I still think it showed very well just how badly the Black community who stood up for themselves were treated. The acting is truly insane to the point where I don't think there could have been a better casting. Daniel Kaluuya is just incredible as Fred Hampton. I believed every word that came out of that man's mouth. But the rest of the cast also get the praise that they deserve. Even the score is so original and fits perfect to the vibe of the movie. It's a true masterclass of a film and if it was just a bit more open-minded I definitely would have given it a ten out of ten. But still truly incredible."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 April 2021,8/10,"Socialism on the big screen in a major film! So amazing to see how solidarity positively impacts people's lives and how hard the intelligence community worked to destroy that. It was so inspiring to see real left/black power in a film this year after we've been disenfranchised once again. People of the world stand up. Bring power back to the people. Beautiful, touching, moving."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 May 2021,1/10,"Calling COMRAD Fred Hampton a ""Messiah"" is monomaniacal. It smacks of demagoguery.Out with the old boss, in with the new boss (""Won't Get Fooled Again"").If COMRAD Fred Hampton, the self-styled ""revolutionary,"" ever gained control of the US, you would lose all your civil rights, esp. If you are white.He would confiscate your private property and enrich himself at your expense.He would speak for ""the people"" without ever letting them speak for themselves.You would live with a rifle in your back. Society would be militarized. His secret police would monitor your every thought and action.His cadre of COMRADS would be no better than the ""pigs"" they overthrew. They would feel just as entitled to achieve their ends ""by any means necessary.""He would control every aspect of your life. You would no longer be free to pursue peace, prosperity, happiness, freedom and your destiny.His government would indoctrinate and control your mind, spirit and soul, forcing you to conform to its ""revolution"" 24/7.Everything would be censored: newspapers, magazines, books, TV, movies, music, scholastic curricula, political debate, the internet, ad nauseam.In other words, his hell would be exactly like that of COMRAD Stalin, COMRAD Mao, COMRAD Fidel Castro, COMRAD Che Guevara, COMRAD Hugo Chavez, COMRAD Nicolas Maduro, FUROR Hitler, COMRAD Kim Jong- un, COMRAD Xi Jinping, and every other murderous, low-life dictator who ever vilified this planet. Heil!He who ignores history is bound to repeat it.Please read Animal Farm by George Orwell, in which all animals are equal, except some are more equal than others.Please read Dostoevsky's Devils.Even as a movie, it is 3rd rate. Exposition is sloppy. Attitude is self-indulgent. Loose ends abound. Dialogue drags and is imprecise. The dramatic momentum practically stops at regular intervals. It is all cliché and shallow hero worship from end to end. Characters are stereotypes. Hamming takes the place of acting. Speechifying never stops. The whole movie is bound by a straight-jacket of shrill ideology, just as you would be, if living under COMRAD Hampton's thumb.And, btw, the movie lies and lies about the Black Panthers, who, behind social-outreach storefronts, dealt meth. They were thugs who dressed themselves up as soldiers of ""justice.""Always, ALWAYS be wary of those who use violence and force in the name of ""justice."" The earth is filled with the corpses they have left behind."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,5/10,"I'm seeing a lot of black berets in this movie. The problem is, they're not accurate. Clearly the makers of this movie purchased a lot of modern military berets for the film. Unfortunately, these berets are nothing like the berets the black Panthers wore back in the day. Today's military berets have a smaller crown and they're much stiffer, so they need a lot of work to get them to sit right on a person's head. The berets the Black Panthers wore were bigger, softer, and with a bigger crown.Also, Fred Hampton wore hats, but I've never seen any photo of him wearing a black beret. He may have worn one on occasion, but it was clearly not a hat he liked to wear.If the movie makers can't get details like this right, I worry that they'll get other details wrong too. At some point, I hope Fred Hampton gets the movie bio he deserves, but I have doubts that this is it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,3/10,"...but it was just violence and inaudible dialog. There was a poignant story to be told here, but you couldn't find it amid the violence."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 April 2021,9/10,There should be an Academy Award for most important movie of the year.My vote for 2020 would be Judas and the Black Messiah.Why were two men nominated for best supporting actor and none were nominated for best actor?
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"I have not seen a movie in recent memory that evokes such a strong emotional reaction! All actors in this movie play their part superbly. Shouts out to the whole cast, crew, director and producers! This is an amazing piece of historical Cinema that does not pull any punches! It is not for the faint of heart and will definitely evoke strong emotions and anybody who is a human being so I would go into this with caution! **spoiler** it is quite sad that it took a 21 year old young man named Fred Hampton sacrificed his life in the quest for unity and equality, and we are nowhere closer to that dream. All of our leaders, we the people, are either dead and gone or weak, cowardly and afraid to make a move. The FBI and all of these government and federal/private organizations that do dirt are the problem. What they did to that young man and the whole Black Panther Party organization that was trying to better communities is absolutely horrible and they should not still be around! William O'Neal died knowing that he made the biggest mistake one could ever make and that is betraying not only his people but a great young leader who could have potentially United the world, all for a piece of change and to save his own ass from 5 years behind a prison cell. Was it worth it!? WHERE OH WHERE ARE OUR LEADERS! WHERE IS THE UNITY NOW!? WATCH THIS FILM! I'M FEELING LIKE A REVOLUTIONARY! THIS FILM WILL KEEP THE SPARK LIT! 11/10 stars! Best film of 2021 thus far and one of the best of the early 21st century! PEACE! ☮"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"This movie is superbly made with outstanding performances all around. Danial and Lakeith Stanfield give performances of lifetime.This film feels more of a thriller than a biopic, and you get accounts of all point of views. Utterly devastating from start to finish."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 April 2021,3/10,"Looky here, some history not being erased. What do ya know, an acceptable form of incitement. Has anybody rating this movie highly ever seen old video documentation of the inside of these types of organizations?I was raised that two wrongs do not make a right."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 March 2021,9/10,"LaKeith Stanfield. Yes.I suppose you could say the film makes a political statement but for me, that's not the point. The point is: Truth will out - Art will out - Talent will out.This is just a really good movie, good work of art, a good, solid story. The actors, across the board are really good. Tension. Drama. Emotions. Some light relief moments. You can inhabit the charters who inhabit their characters. You believe the story. You FEEL the story.When we watch a movie you see ""movie people"" doing things only movie people would do. Not always smart or safe but interesting. That's why they're in the movie. The Panthers lived like movie people. Real people standing in front of crowds threatening to kill ALL the police for total satisfaction. Then participating in shoot outs with armed, trained and motivated police.Anyway.Do I support the Panthers? Not necessary, one way or another. Do I support good art? I hope so. This movie should be seen because it's a great movie. End of story."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 April 2021,8/10,Daniel Kaluuya is on my top 5 actors list and thats confirmed by this movie.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 April 2021,9/10,"It was very very good. I´ve had bad experiences with black films lately because they have the same plot, final, story and message. IT BECOMES REPETITVE. JATBM is different keeps your attention the whole two hours it can become a little boring at times but then again intense moments come again. I understand is a very complex story with dilemmas with each character but what they wanted to portray was very fullfilled and explained.And the oscar for best actor in a supporting role goes for ...
DANIEL KALUUYA. HEAR MY WORDS."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 July 2021,10/10,"Daniel and LaKeith, their acting skills is what Hollywood needed for a while now. Back to true talent in embodying their character. Acting without needing all this CGI, excessive amounts of explosions, shoot outs, fights and such. This movie keeps you engaged throughout. It was also good getting a piece of that history. 10 stars!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,That situation was by far one of the worst travesties in american history...why do we demonize adolf hitler and not j edjar hoover who was ordering hits on his own countrymen black and white if we are going to take down confederate statues down we need to rename anything that was named after that devil...and i wished George Bush Sr. should have went to kill him when he threathen him with relieving him as president kennedy's killer..in short a powerful movie....check it out
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,8/10,"Good human drama set against the Black Panther movement in late 60's Chicago. The story pivots into Stansfield's character's betrayal of Fred Hampton. Daniel Kaluuya was also very good as Hampton. Stansfield's performance; however, anchors this film. The dichotomy of sentiment regarding ""Wild Bill"" is what gives this drama its strength."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"This movie told the truth about the execution of Fred Hampton. The two 1 star reviews you are racist and mad about the fact this movie showed the truth about these terrible white people.
But seriously this movie was great the acting was great."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,6/10,"So let's start with the good. The cinematography and period setting is top notch and really puts you in the era. The acting is very good and helps with holding together a porous story.Now for the bad. I really really wanted to love this movie. But...If you're looking for a biopic of Fred Hampton, this ain't it. Plain and simple. If you're looking for a movie that tells you more than you already knew about an understated important figure in black history, again this ain't it.What you will get is a movie about an FBI informant who's motives are questionable at best, that happens to have Fred Hampton featured in it. If you're not versed in the names of people in Hampton's inner circle, you will be confused and have a hard time remembering who's who, as characters come and go constantly, with virtually no character development.The movie is entertaining for the most part as the acting is quite good. But the story itself is all over the place and some scenes are longer than they need to be. You won't know much more about the great Fred Hampton, than you did before you watched this movie. It's too bad because I was waiting for this one.People will trip over themselves to give this positive marks, but as a student of history and someone who loves a good drama in a period piece, this movie missed a great opportunity for sure."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 April 2021,8/10,"Between Daniel Kaluuya's and Lakeith Stanfield's performances, I don't know who's more Oscar-worthy, they are both great and both should win. I just prefer slightly more Kaluuya's role as Fred Hampton. Kaluuya incorporated the importance of the moment, the charisma of Hampton, the voice, the impact in every movement. What a career-making performance.As for the movie itself, it moves through various lenses in the story of the Black Panther Party. The movie doesn't shy away from the violent roots of the BPP, but it also justifies them and puts them into context - that context being the brutal discrimination of Black people in America, a focal point for so many movies in the last year.""Judas & The Black Messiah"" is powerful, it's a gripping journey of a man trying to embody a revolution and it's a very important watch in 2020-2021.And Stanfield's acting is so genuine as the insecure traitor who doubts himself constantly, that you end up feeling sorry for him, despite him betraying on the most important black freedom fighters of the US."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,9/10,This is a great film which teaches you about history and power; how it grinds people up.It's also really enjoyable in the way it portrays the characters and their struggles.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,10/10,"I was completely and absolutely captivated by Judas and The Black Messiah. Unable to think about my bills, my stresses- this film is relentlessly powerful. Expertly crafted with a booming soundtrack, precise and meaningful cinematography and outstanding compelling performances from Daniel Kaluuya, LaKeith Stanfield, Jesse Plemons and Dominique Fishback.After the previous year of not seeing (m)any new movies it's easy to feel like nothing is on the horizon besides superheroes, director/producer/co-writer Shaka King slaps us in the mouth with a new film that is reinvigorating and bold.Movies like this remind me why I love movies so much. Why I need movies, and why stories like this are incredibly important on many different levels. And why it's important to see new films from young filmmakers.See it anyway you possibly can, right now. My local arthouse theater in Portland invited me to a virtual screening, I believe it's also coming to HBO Max,Support art.
Support film.
Support black art.
Support black film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 May 2021,10/10,Great acting from Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya. I didn't know anything about Fred Hampton so this was a learning experience for me. Really tragic story but an important one to have bought to life.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 June 2021,10/10,"As a European, I must say I'm not as informed as I shoud be about the civil rights movement and, in general, about black people's efforts to be treated as descent human beings in the USA during the 20th century.After watching this movie I felt like I needed to do more research and to educate myself. In my huble opinion, that's what great movies do to you.There's no doubt that both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya did an exceptional job and that the movie was remarkable."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 July 2021,3/10,"Fred Hampton is one of the most fascinating people from the 60s although not as well known as he should be.I was looking forward to watching this film biography of Hampton but this was a tremendous disappointment.There's are some documentaries on Hampton that will educate anyone on his life which this movie failed to do.If you have critical thinking skills about movies then you'll recognize all of the typical mistakes so many directors make.The worst aspect was it was slow and boring with inserted scenes of intensity that is a trick drive-in movies used to use.When I saw it was produced by that idiot Bron who is semi-literate and who has shown his ignorance many times, I should have known it would be junk.Ever wonder why LeBron is always photographed reading the first few pages of a book? And when asked about X's autobiography he was reading, he said nothing of substance...hmmmm.Great soundtrack, with a few great actors despite a horrible script, but it has an agenda that's shallow and will be forgotten.Compare this to Malcolm X and it's why it'll be forgotten."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 February 2021,8/10,"If it wasn't for those people who fought today's equality and justice system wouldn't be this good. Yes there are a lot can be improved but we came a long way.
Good movie about good true story. it worth watching"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,,"Judas and the Black Messiah stands as a memorable, powerful movie that leaves you wondering how Hampton might have evolved had he not been killed. Kaluuya, Stanfield, and the supporting cast all bring their A game to a movie that shows the Black Panther movement in a different light as well as the forces opposing it. Stanfield nails the role of the betrayer whose actions are tinged with greed, fear and, yes, love."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver are familiar names in Black Panther historical lore. Fred Hampton's story, however, is not well-known by the general public. This movie rights that travesty. The movie is simply fantastic, well-acted, produced and engrossing from the first frame. Daniel Kaluuya wears this role like a second skin. Whoever says a Brit cannot play an American revolutionary convincingly, can go pound sand. LaKeith Stanfield plays Bill O' Neal, a Judas, with such conviction, it was difficult not to hate his character the entire movie. However, he does manage to muster some sympathy as you see he begins to believe in the Black Panther's cause and is torn between the cause and his deception. Dominque Fishback does a nice job playing Hampton's love interest. Jesse Plemons, as the crooked FBI agent, was appropriately sleazy. Overall, one of best movies so far this year. I hope it picks up some nominations."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 April 2021,8/10,"A-grade drama, top-notch thriller. Actor's Lakeith Standfield and Daniel Kaluuya are on pitch-perfect form.The filmmaking also handles the story of these true life figures (along with the narrative's heavy subject matter) with open ambiguity (in my opinion, the only successful way to make a 'based on a true story' flick).Good guys come with questionable motives, bad guys come with layered motivations (except the cops... and nasty old J. Edgar), which leans to a more open ended, morally grey experience. Most deliciously of which, neither the movie, the actors nor director Shaka King have any interest in helping you out with. They are far, far too assured to offer those kind of answers.As a character late in the movie declares 'I think I'll let history speak for me.'"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,7/10,"I watched JATBM wanting to like it and I did to a point. The main cast were all good in their roles but were let down by a lame script, poor directing and bewildering editing. What should've been an exciting story was bogged down into what was at times a confusing and boring movie."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 May 2021,2/10,The movie keeps going on and on without a solid purpose. I expected the movie to enlighten people about what happened while giving reasonable reasons. But it just kept on going off tracks. No doubt daniel is an excellent actor but he didn't seem to give the character he portrayed the soul. It was as if he and other actors were mostly keen on showing off their acting skills instead of getting into the core of their characters. Poor depiction of a rich history. . . And the people.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 March 2021,10/10,"I know it sounds incredulous but this may be the definitive movie about the Black Panthers for many years to come. Not to be missed. Small Axe comes close, for movies about race in Western culture."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 March 2021,1/10,"I was thinking to myself ""Wow, at last. A new movie that might actually be good."" Boy, was I mistaken, and disappointed. This is pure garbage. What's the point in having actors read lines if barely a word they are saying can be understood?The actors are just mumbling away incoherently. Is there really any point in having dialogue in a script if hardly any of it can be understood? No, there isn't. Why did Hollywood put this garbage out? They do check for this type of thing beforehand, so it's deliberate. Maybe they don't want us knowing what the actors said.Regardless, this movie was only made because of the lunatic woke agenda, and we all know it. If the woke Left hadn't cried ""racism"" so many times, this would not have been made. Or would it? Maybe it would have, but it would have been made by a better director - a competent director. And maybe it would have been made using actors that can read lines that can be understood by the audience.This garbage was nominated for an Oscar? Give me a break. The Oscars have gone the same route the Nobel prizes took: straight down the worthless road to lack of credibility. There's no talent in this movie. Its Oscar nomination was purely politically motivated. This garbage deserves zero praise."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 June 2021,9/10,"Daniel Kaluula's performance is phenomenal as Fred Hampton. His performance was so transformative that I was mesmerised by it, and literally sat at the edge of my seat throughout the whole film. I've been a fan of his since I was a teen, and this was definitely the performance of his career - all of the accolades are well deserved. If you thought he was good in Get Out, he is on another level in this film. I felt like I got to meet Fred Hampton, and wow, what a man. I've always been in awe of DK's American accent too- so seamless, you would never know he's British like me. I knew a little about Fred Hampton, but I will go away to learn more about him and the Black Panther movement because of this film.This is an amazing and key story for civil and equal rights. I don't want to give any spoilers, but you will hate Lakeith Stanfield's character in this film. What a wicked and weak person. However, Lakeith plays this character well.One final bit, this film is so timely, when you consider that people who put on a police suit still think that they can kill black men and women, and get away with their crime without punishment. It does an excellent job at showing the police system (right up to the FBI) as using propaganda and absolute racism to justify killing black people in a ""legal way"". When we all know that the practices they have is amoral, and absolutely should not be legal or legitamised by the system in any way. But, we all know the painful truth: this is still happening and has been happening for a long time. I would research what was put in the police report after Fred Hampton's murder- "" i.e. They tried to portray that the black panthers in the flat had been combative with them, when in fact they were asleep, and the majority of the bullets (99) were shot by the police, and only 1 was shot by black Panthers, who lost 2 of their own or were seriously injured during this raid. It made me think of nazi Germany, or any country where genocides have happened, and how they use propaganda to justify unspeakable evil against their own citizens. In this way, the police are legitamised criminals: one might even say that they are legal executioners of those they fear. Some people will cry when they watch this film, as my friend did. I was inspired and motivated: we cannot turn a blind eye to the wickedness in the world, and I will do my part to use my voice to call out any injustices I see. This film did an excellent job in showing how police have been terrorising black people, by describing them as terrorists or criminals, and using this justification as an excuse for unleashing pure evil and brutality on black people. If the Black Panthers and other black militant groups were armed, could we really blame them when the police/fbi can walk into their homes at night whilst their sleeping and kill them?! This is still happening today. The death of George Floyd last year showed that. The death of Breonna Taylor showed that. This brutality must stop. I will be telling all of my family and friends to watch this. And I will definitely watch it again to see the amazing performance by Daniel Kaluula. As someone who is around the same age as him, and has been a fan since his days in Skins :I was wonderfully proud of this inspired performance! A must watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,9/10,Bill O'Neal becomes an informant for the FBI and infiltrates the Illinois Black Panther Party and Chairman Fred Hampton in 60s Chicago. Stanfield and Kaluuya are strong leads.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,10/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a richly told story of the leadership, revolutionary activism, and eventual assassination of Black Panther Fred Hampton, and powerful addition to the social revolution films of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Seeing history brought to life in a viscerally real and emphatic manner, made the work very compelling to me.Fred Hampton was killed at the age of 21 on December 4th, 1969. The aggrieved parties would wait well over a decade for justice with a civil suit settlement of $1.85 million in 1982 after an initial coroner's jury inquest in January of 1970 found Fred Hampton's death justifiable homicide.The writing pulls heavily from historical texts with Black Panther phrases such as ""War is politics with blood. Politics is war without blood."" King also manages to pose questions about how to make progress as his characters address the concepts of reform and revolution. While the film is set in 1968-69, these issues are still prevalent today. On HBO Max. Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,10/10,Powerful! Historically accurate and mesmerizing! Shaka King directed a Masterpiece
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,8/10,"This is one of the best movies of the year so far in my opinion. It has great acting, good pacing, and an amazing and engaging story that is based on a true story. Impossible to watch the movie and not be angry at the injustices that occurred, definitely a must watch."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 March 2021,6/10,"To be honest, the film was not bad and it met Harrow's standard. I think more documentary images in the film could have made the film more exciting and impressive. The decoupage of the film was beautiful and flawless, but I want to talk about the roles.
Daniel Kaluuya He failed to act and was very weak but I have to say about Kate Stanfield that I consider him worthy of receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 August 2021,2/10,"Intrusive, one-sided, ostentatiously predictable. What more could be said?"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,9/10,"I am a black women born after the height of the era, so settled in for a worthy history lesson. Well worth it. As others have reviewed, the lead actors give a good performance. The film's beauty is the synergies between the biblical, and political."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 March 2021,8/10,"The performances in this film are top notch, and the overall story is not only wonderful, but also important to tell. However, the film kids drags at time due to pacing problems. However, I would still recommend watching this movie for the entertainment of the story, the actors and the important history."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,8/10,"Judas and the Black Messiah is a look into the lives of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panthers, and Bill O'Neal, the man who betrays him to the FBI. Judas shows us the charisma of Hampton, leading both through inspiration and politics, to become the symbol of power and strength suddenly feared by white government. As his star rises, the fortunes of Bill O'Neal fall, and he becomes entrenched in the schemes against the Black Panther movement and a plot to silence the growing influence of Hampton. Judas illustrates the rise and fall of Gods and Monsters, in an era where normal men were both, largely by circumstance."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 February 2021,10/10,"Let me start by saying I was so tired of seeing black movies and boohooing my eyes out. I was worried while I did tear up I didn't feel broken or depressed afterwards. I was hung on every word and scene. I even paused to have a discussion with my husband about the movie. It's powerful, thrilling, heartbreaking, and a really good movie."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,4/10,"I wanted to LOVE this movie. The story of Fred Hampton, like Huey Newton and the Black Panthers, needs to be told. It is so relevant and important, particularly the emphasis on socialism and the rainbow coalition. Could not be more timely.But the execution of this movie is awful. It is boring, the character of Fred Hampton is poorly developed, too much emphasis on the Judas character, and worst of all the dialogue is very hard to understand. Seriously, for all those people giving 10 stars, please go back and watch Malcolm X. If this movie deserves 10 stars, then Spike Lee's movie deserves 10,000 stars.Watch One Night In Miami instead - absolute masterpiece. I wish they had got King to direct this movie as well."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 August 2021,8/10,"But this movie was better structured, the characters were likeable and the story was way more interesting."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 March 2021,9/10,"Daniel Kaluuya an utterly amazing performance! This brotha showed some acting chops here. A must see for Daniel alone, but the director deserves a nod too. The director and screenwriter deserve Oscars for that matter. The director took what could have been a PBS documentary and turned it into movie magic. Now let's tell the story of the Oakland chapter. Same director! The shootout on Magnolia. I was a child 1/2 a block down the street when the shots started flying everywhere and Bobby Hutton was killed."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,To start with America's false equivalence black people holding guns is equivalent to White supremists lynching black people primarily. Second Fred Hampton the black Messiah worked for people like me thank you 👍🏿 very much. It's a good thing to fight for people even if it makes you more poor and kills you.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,7/10,Interesting story on the black panthers very well made decent acting and very true to the story of the movement.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 March 2021,10/10,"I only ever write reviews for the movie I actually really enjoy, this is definitely up there with some of the best I've seen. Very well made, the actors are all outstanding.
Quite ashamed I didnt know who Fred Hampton was, he was who I'd like to have read about in my schools history books but didn't, what a shame that is."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 May 2021,8/10,"Personal/Plot (two stars): I would give this a 1/2 stars. This category focuses on what the film focused on and if I found experience enjoyable. I would say I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as others. Plot was good, based off of true story. Aesthetic/Cinematography (two stars): I would give this film a 2/2 stars for this category. This category focuses on how the film was made, does it show high level of craftsmanship and artistic merit? I believe this film did show a relatively high amount of merit. Spiritual/Ending (two stars): this category focuses on whether or not the film touched upon moral and spiritual themes and ideas for the spiritual category. And the ending category had to do with whether or not, at the end of the movie, am I compelled towards the transcendent. In other words, does this movie inspire me to do something after watching it? I wholeheartedly believe this movie did, it talked about injustice and the fight during the civil rights movement. Easy 2/2, no contention. Acting (one star): Did the actor emphasize proper face expressions or dialogue to convey certain emotions? One time a character on screen for 20 seconds had bad acting. But the rest of the cast was phenomenal. 1/1 Score and music (1 star): nope, score and music could have complimented better. 0/1. Recommend/rewatch (1 star): would recommend but not rewatch. 0.5/1. Pacing (1 star): a little slow, but methodical. The film was great, and the pacing didn't effect it, so I'll give it 1/1z.Total: 7.5/10."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 March 2021,8/10,"As someone who did not know the real events or people this movie was based on, it was an eye-opening experience into what life was like back then. The camera work is rock solid, with genuine tense moments and powerful performances from the main characters.Watching the events unfold back then brings an interesting juxtaposition to recent events in America. Police brutality rooted in racism is still a reality. People in power with discriminatory beliefs still exists. It made me think about several realities that are still going on today. It made me think about how people in power can easily abuse their position. We like to think regulation is important to keep these people in check, but who's regulating the regulators? People in power can easily hire regulators to maintain the status quo.And what about crime rates? It disproportionately involves people of color because of centuries of racism that become rooted in the very culture of children born in lower socioeconomic groups. Violence begets violence, and crime begets more crime. We're definitely living in a better time now than what it was like 50 years ago. But we can do better. And nothing is more powerful than educating the next generation about the truth, about critical thinking, and about actively doing what they believe is right.I have barely talked about this film, but I appreciate that a film like this exists. It allows the viewer into a glimpse of the past, informing the audience about an issue that perhaps they may not understand. It puts us directly into the shoes of a group of people doing what they think is right for their future generation. It is creative works like these that may challenge your world view, and it may help you understand about the struggles and plight of people that are different than you. To that, I applaud the film.For those who have no idea about the real events like I was, this is a great film to increase your awareness on a subject you might not know much about."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,8/10,"Excellent movie from beginning to end, excellent script and casting, the DP did a great job too. Repeat with me: I am, a revolutionary !!!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 July 2021,10/10,"This film is raw, beautiful, realistic, emotional, aggressive, blunt, and it will leave you. Jaw dropped at the end. It is a necessary film, that probably was the strongest contender in quality (and after the whole black lives matter year we had, a more important one in my opinion) to win best picture. Most of the performances are top notch, the script feels more like real life than a fictional movie, which makes you feel everything in your skin. Please watch it right now."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,"LaKeith and Daniel absolutely owned this film! Powerful, deep and meaningful. What a film!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 March 2021,10/10,"In this film is the best one of Disney up to the date . No words to say , mind blown..."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 October 2021,10/10,A great film that not also educates the viewers on the man that Fred Hampton was and what he stood for but also on what he was up against. A must watch for all.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,7/10,"I saw this in theaters tonight, i like true stories and this was quite informative as i knew nothing about the story it is based on. Top notch acting, quite tense at parts. I didn't enjoy the 2nd half as much as the 1st, some very slow parts then quickly speeds up to it's conclusion. I've seen this director's 1st movie, and this is a huge step up from 'Newlyweeds'. It was closer to Spike Lee quality. I recommend it, but seeing it once was plenty for me."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 March 2021,10/10,"I liked it very much. Some questions remained in my mind: what is the difference between people like Fred Hampton and the common ones he tried to lead ? Is it worthwhile to die for what one may think is the greater good ? It is true that Hampton´s ideas may remain and be spread among the young ones, but isn´t it much better to keep yourself alive and live your own ideas like Guevara (at least for some time) or Lenin, Mao, etc. those who led their successful revolutions ? I mean, we don´t need messiahs, but traitors or Judas cannot stay alive !"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 April 2021,7/10,"This film is based on real events.Yet another in a series of films inspired by the events of the Black Panthers and the struggle for the rights of the African American population.Despite being a good film, beautiful cinematography, great screenplay and excellent performances by the two protagonists, it leaves you with that ""already seen"" feeling.Maybe too long, just over 2 hours!It runs with 6 Oscar nominations, among which my bets are for Best Supporting Actor Daniel Kaluuya, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography.Vote 7,5."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,9/10,As a stand alone film then this is straight off of the top drawer.Kaluuya kills the part stone dead and all in all this will and should go down as a modern classic that is worthy of an Oscar nod in the best 'actor / script / director / film' categories.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,4/10,"I really wanted to see this film, and was disappointed with the main characters language.
Could have done with subtitles as it was quite difficult to understand what they were saying most of the time."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,1/10,Utter rubbish. Tired of people getting recognition for terrible acting and poor story construct.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,9/10,"I loved this movie. Fantastic story line, character development and the high tension points. Most importantly, it helps tell a more complete story of Fred Hampton and the Black Panthers. We need more movies like this one!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 May 2021,7/10,"Well deserved Oscar for Kaluuya. He delivered an emotional and powerful display of talent.While it isn't the 60s anymore. The world is still experiencing the racial inequality displayed in the film. That has been further exposed in 2020 and 2021 in the United States through the BLM movement so this film could not be more important.Lackluster story telling in the beginning that is made up by the much stronger middle and ending.You should feel enraged, angry, and infuriated after watching this film. If you didn't, it's time to take a look at your morals."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"I dont know what to say... This film is something I haven't experienced in a while. Extremely powerful. Extremely real. Extremely relevant. Here we are, near 50 years later, and you could pass this story off as a recent event. This is a must watch by anyone and everyone. Educate yourselves, feel, and understand."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,"Yup.Fantastic film. We need to usurp the power from the killers, and equalize politics."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,29 May 2021,5/10,"Daniel Kaluuya delivers an appropriately rousing performance as the slain leader of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party, whose fervent speeches give life to the civil rights movement. At the forefront, however, is William O'Neal. LaKeith Stanfield, too, elevates the material as the car thief turned criminal informant. Shaka King's film chronicles O'Neal's infiltration of the Black Panthers and subsequent betrayal of its electrifying leader.One of the first things one notices is that the politics are markedly skewed. The character depictions here are shockingly (Shaka-ingly?) black-and-white. Hampton is presented with little nuance or shade; his only flaw is his trusting nature and unwavering devotion to the Black Panthers. This is his hamartia. The Panthers seek to achieve their goals through the use of force, but those means are justified again and again. The film suggests that the police is an inherently flawed and malicious institution that perpetuates systemic racism, but even the individual cops twirl their mustaches at every chance they get. (At one point, one catcalls a Black woman, hollering, ""Hey, Aunt Jemima!"") Instead of being a force in the background silently pulling the strings, J. Edgar Hoover appears as the embodiment of pure evil. The movie chooses to present the Panthers as Mary Sues, more or less, and maintains the reductive mentality that all police officers are vehement racists. But viewing the movie purely as a standard criminal informant movie, the beats are remarkably familiar.In one sequence, a Panther questions O'Neal's identity, and forces the informant to hot-wire a car. The lack of self-awareness or subversion in the utilization of this trope proves especially laughable when one recalls 2016's Keanu's satirical take on it. In that movie, it works; it's played for comedy. King plays it completely straight, however, and the scene lacks any real tension. The outcome is nothing short of predictable, and demonstrates a reliance on the sociopolitical commentary to hold the real weight.By having a public speaker at the center of your movie, you effectively have a mouthpiece to explain the themes to the audience. And that's all Hampton feels like: a device. O'Neal is nothing more than a device used to explore Hampton, who, in turn, is a device used to explore the ill-fated leader's ideologies. There's a complexity on display in the clip of the criminal informant featured at the end of the movie that is nowhere to be found in the actual narrative. The O'Neal character is integral when the characters are largely limited to depictions of saint Black Panthers and downright evil cops. Yet, he is underwritten. He never feels like a real person, let alone a multifaceted figure. Perhaps a protracted mini-series could properly develop these characters and make their struggles feel real, but the two-hour runtime simply doesn't cut it.Hampton is precocious, but he is also incredibly naive. He urges his brethren to fully embrace and espouse communism. Capitalism is heavily flawed, but communism is as well (that social and economic freedom comes at the expense of social order; living conditions in China or Cuba, for example, are far from ideal). The movie dramatically undermines the naïveté of Hampton and O'Neal by casting actors in their thirties. What could be a complex portrait of this twenty-one-year-old virtuoso ends up as a matter-of-fact recreation of the events that unfolded during the time period devoid of any real depth or careful consideration.Sean Bobbitt has made a name for himself working with Steve McQueen, but the cinematography here is a far cry from that seventeen-and-a-half-minute long shot in Hunger. The fact that this is King's second feature is made evident by the over-reliance on close-ups and lack of things to look at in every shot. The body language and nuances of the performances are imperceptible. The sophomoric use of close-ups creates another problem. In addition to the grandiose speeches and monologues that tell the viewer exactly what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given moment, the lack of space between the characters and camera forces the viscera. It's an easy tactic that reflects poorly on the director, but it puts the emotion right on the surface and disallows the audience from gaining anything more from looking deeper. The direction tells the viewer exactly what to think with a guiding hand.In recent years, Hollywood has received an influx of mere recreations of historical events lacking any real personal insight. Judas is no exception. The movie presents Fred Hampton's ideologies as its own themes, and treats both Hampton and O'Neal with a shocking lack of deference by painting them as mere devices to advance the plot and verbalize the themes. Other reviews have praised it for serving as a history lesson on an event schools seldom and not very thoroughly delve into, but Judas hardly transcends simple edutainment."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 April 2021,2/10,"Two hours of my life and all I learned is that little has changed in 50 years, at least for those on the extremes of society. Many in the black community have managed to move ahead but the spiritual grandkids and great-grandkids of the characters in this film spent last summer protesting and burning down cities. Perhaps the film's value lies in the lesson that violence does not bring lasting change and that most Americans do not relate to either the Black Panthers or J. Edgar Hoover. They're just ordinary people who want to get along."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,5/10,"I expected so much more. The film did not dive into Fred Hampton's words and politics nearly enough. If you knew nothing about Fred Hampton and the BPP coming into this film you would leave thinking they were some violent cop-killers. This film missed the mark. Is it a good watch? Eh, I guess when you are bored. Is it an accurate enough depiction of Fred Hampton's life? I do not believe so."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,8/10,"Now I like to watch movies as movies and try to throw politics out of it. I don't care if a movie is ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" propaganda. I just want to sit down and watch a movie for once.Now with that out of the way, I was quite surprised by this movie. I was looking forward to watching this movie for a while and it met my expectations for sure, didn't necessarily exceed them but the performances, particularly from Daniel Kaluuya and even Martin Sheen Who I believe have an underrated performance. Well done and I hope it gets some Oscar recognition."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 June 2021,6/10,Both the acting and the cinematography are superb. However the plot is jumbled and several scenes are longer than they need to be.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 March 2021,5/10,"Doesn't show enough of the evil done against the Black community. White are evil and they show too much of the evil side of the Panther party... More needs to be done in this climate, reparations must be sowed."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 April 2021,7/10,"As a movie it is quite good, but the tone of the film is clearly in favor of some panthers who are shown as liberators and not as the criminals that they were.A socialist pamphlet at times with very good performances and acceptable rhythm."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 May 2021,6/10,"Much like the movie 42, I feel that, either there's plenty left out and/or much of value and resonance not dealt with.I feel like the movie itself ironically, lacks the drama that the real story would have had. We could have dealt with the 12 yrs trial and the suicide, while doing flashbacks to discover what happened. We could have peeled at the confliction that drove this character to commit suicide. We could have also pealed at the main character raise to his position the how's and why's. Even the where's and when's could've illustrated a more compelling story. Instead it feels shallow and incomplete."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 July 2021,3/10,"This is honestly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen...
It has a great premise, and I really wanted to like it... but if a movie fails to do it's main purpose (entertain), then it's not worth watching."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 February 2021,7/10,"This had all the ingredients of a masterful historical retelling of the betrayal of a leader of the Black Panthers, Rainbow Coalition & teacher of political power to Chicago's black activists population. But, & Blame the director Shaka King, for lost dialogue thanks to horrid sound production, CC couldnt help decifer a word of dialog ! Sad as some of performances were riveting- especially
Lakeith Stanfield as Bill O Neal. Daniel Kaluuyas words were mumbled & lost. Sound disaster was total Director fail there!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,10/10,"This was one of the most moving and well put-together films I've seen. Every moment was expertly paced, Daniel Kaluuyah was absolutely tantalizing, and the score was a perfect mix of fresh and old sounds of blues and jazz- new and old. The wardrobes are immaculate and the color schemes stay in brand in their entirety. At this point Jesse Plemons has played every reproachable human being beyond salvation and his performance here is no difference. His performance is profoundly disturbing.The dialogue is endlessly quotable but what it does as a whole is take the viewer with the Black Panthers into their mission and introduces them to the brotherhood and the community that surrounds the revolution. Many scenes make it easy to humanize and love the Messiah, showing Fred in his everyday life, steadfast and incorruptible. The love and spirit extending through the Panthers makes it even more reprehensible that someone like Bill (Lakeith Stanfield acting his face off) could remain a rat for so long. Themes touch upon racism, systematic oppression, and the duality of individual survival versus community good.This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting was amazing from all angles and there was not a single moment that felt lacking in suspense or sentiment. I left feeling sad and angry at America's recent and shameful history but also inspired to learn more about the history of the Black Panthers and the immense sacrifices they made as a group and as individuals.An example of the comedic timing punctuating the film: during opening minutes
""WHO IS THIS?""
Crowd: ""HUEY P. Newton""
""AND WHERE IS HUEY??""
Crowd: ""IN JAIL""SOUNDTRACK:With H.E.R., A$AP Rocky, Jay-Z, Nipsey Hussle, Nas, and Bj the Chicago kid, this soundtrack is packed with black music royalty.Favorite Song- Deep Gully by the Outlaw Blues Band and by Letter 2 U by Bj the Chicago KidColor Schemes: maroons and browns and beige yellows and army greens"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 March 2021,10/10,"LaKeith Stanfield is easily the biggest star of this film, playing an extremely complex roll that walks the line of being available to the audience while portraying one of the most difficult roles of betrayal imaginable. He at once presents a cracked facade of bravado and confidence while communicating the nuance of inner turmoil brought on by his actions. This is a film which needs to be in Oscar conversations, and Stanfield needs to be in those discussions as well."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 February 2021,2/10,"Sorry. I know you're not supposed to point out the obvious about ethnic dramas.Nicely shot, directed and performed. But tedious. It's important to document history. This is as interesting as reading a text book."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 July 2021,9/10,"This movie can be uncomfortable to watch. The dishonesty of an informant, especially in an organization like the Black Panthers, turned my stomach throughout this film. O'Neill keeps getting more pathetic as you empathize with Hampton. The FBI are portrayed very well in this film. A worthy watch and a good history lesson. As a high school film teacher I will show it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 March 2021,9/10,"When I started watching the movie, I thought it was just a regular movie. As seconds passed by, I felt myself right inside the scenes. Everyone played their roles just so perfectly. Don't think twice. Just watch it."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 March 2021,9/10,This film was everything I thought it would be and then more! All the actors and actresses in this film did a fantastic job!
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 July 2021,10/10,"I'd been wanting to see this for a long time. Finally got the chance and it absolutely didn't disappoint.The plot is very well, because it's real events, and where some people thought it wasn't enough about Fred Hampton, I really liked how they portrayed the bond between O'Neal and Hampton, and the way the whole Black Panther movement worked a bit. I think the setting and the story were top notch.Still, the best thing about this picture is the acting. Kaluuya is one of the best actors these days, and he shows some amazing range with this picture under his belt. He expressed Hampton amazingly, although Hampton was 10 years younger irl. Stanfield also did a terrific job, he knew how to portray the highs and lows in O'Neals life. He managed to receive pity and anger after watching the whole picture. Amazing performances.The cinematography captured the scene and the time in which the story is set perfectly. I never had the feeling something was wrong. It felt like I was there, in the office, with the Black Panthers, helping in the discussions.The soundtrack has some more standard music on it, but one track really got to me. It was one where there were a baritone, tenor and alto playing really tight and with tension. That was such a majestic sound and I still hear that when it's quiet.Next to the picture soundtrack, there's an album made by modern day artists who were inspired by the picture. Whilst listening to that album after the viewing was also a very powerful and mesmerising feeling. A very good way to end this whole experience.All 'n all I really liked it, and it hit me right where I wanted it too."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,Powerful performances and an even more powerful story told. Its unforgiving realness is going to keep the revolution alive. I will never regret watching this and recommend it to anyone.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,7/10,"Good film, good actors, interesting plot, but the film is not for a higher grade than 7.
Any rating above that, especially all these dozens that people give is a reflection of politics and ideology and not the quality of the film.
People tend to give too high marks to promote a film or send a political message."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,"GREAT MOVIE, extremely well made. The performance by the cast was great. Lakeith did great, the wife character Dominique Fishback was great and Daniel absolutely killed It. Shots and directing was great and score is amazing. Hopefully people see the black panthers in a different way and learn some things."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"Spectacular, movie was a masterpiece. Daniel & Lakeith gave us academy award winning performances. The entire cast was great . Good job"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 July 2021,2/10,"Seriously, come on this was a snooze fest at best! Some of these reviews are hilarious 10 of 10? Clearly you folks have no taste, or didn't watch the same film that I saw!!!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,10/10,"This Movie Is Full Of Great Acting! I cried my dam eyes out! Full Of All Types Of Emotions! Confused, Cringed, Shocked, Angry and Sad! This is another important part of history that is left out of our school books. Black History is very IMPORTANT! Schools lied about the Black Panther Party and their contribution to society."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,7/10,"I was really looking forward to this movie because of it's promising plot and it's two co-stars: LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya. However, this movie just isn't as good as some say it to be. Mainly because the character development is painfully under baked and rather shallow approach to it's several interesting messages. People say the two actor's performances are amazing...... are they? Kaluuya seems very dedicated yes, but the writing is not. Stanfield was just given horrible character development and writing. And the FBI guy is kinda useless. They introduce ideas but never go as far to show them. It's sad to say this, but it's the truth in my mind at least."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 July 2021,3/10,"This movie is a poorly constructed, shallow, incoherent mess. Everything from the dialogue, to the motivations of the character are just subpar. This is a shame because the setting/story is very intriguing, which is why I'll be a little generous and give it 3 stars. Moreover, given the context of the film during our political atmosphere, it had a chance to be more intelligent than it was, and it failed."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 April 2021,7/10,Really nice dramatised biopic. A colourful and ambivalent palette of characters with a beginning and end that give context and exposition in a synthetic and effective manner. It does remind me of The Departed; the only issue I have with this movie is the lack of humour that characterizes reality.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 March 2021,9/10,"I watched this yesterday so many of the things I'm going to say are coming just from the top of my head.
Okay, so the top of my head is: WOW. Kudos to Shaka King for this truly great movie.
The movie takes us rapidly through the start, development and downfall of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) and, by that, the whole Black Panther party, and how the FBI focused on Hampton form the very beginning.
I say rapidly because when Spike Lee made one of his masterpieces, Malcolm X (1992), he took 3h and 20 min. to tell us. Now, even considering Hampton's life was way shorter, the astounding runtime of 2h and 5 min to mix FBI chasing Hampton and the Panthers, O'Neal and FBI relations and even Hampton's history itself.
The side story is the romance between Hampton and his fiancée Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback).
The title couldn't have been more accurate, given the movie is about the betrayal of Fred Hampton by Bill O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), a man who ended up admiring the activist, who was exactly the opposite of what the US government was in the 60s.
Great screenplay from Shaka King and Will Berson, with efficient techniques and interesting themes (I really think this was a topic that should have been made way before).
Good cinematography (not the best of all time, it's not a Deakins or a Lubezki, but it's certainly an 8/10), that allows you to get even more in the revolutionary movements, the betrayal of Bill O'Neal and even the importance of Fred Hampton).
A 10 in acting: there are very few films with such an incredible acting ('Whatever Happened to Baby Jane', 'The Master' or 'The Godfather' are other examples). I love how Lakeith is glowing, because he's amazing, and he's going to have a great future. Even though, Kaluuya and Fishback take the stand here as the stars.
There's a scene between Kaluuya and Lakeith that gave me goosebumps, and Fishback gives a masterclass of acting on the penultimate scene of the movie.
I just have to say everyone involved in this movie, and the movie itself, have a great future.
You can't talk about this movie without at least mentioning the next two characters in importance in the movie: Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) and J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen). They both give a good performance in very little time, and show they're really versatile actors (Martin Sheen can be pointed out, given the fact that he has to take the torch from the breathtaking Leonardo DiCaprio in J. Edgar, 2011, and he does it extremely well).
Really enjoyable and one of the best movies of the year for me, and I recommend it to everybody."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,17 February 2021,10/10,"I cannot recommend this film enough. It is shockingly good. Incredibly scored, paced so engagingly. I was worried going into it I'd be experiencing another film showing the horrible abuse on my people, black people. Instead, this film focuses on the black people at the forefront of the war. And their dynamics. It focuses on black men and how much of an impact black men have on society and why they are constantly torn down or taken away. It's simply amazing."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,4 April 2021,4/10,Found the movie boring and the acting was pretty poor. I never really felt invested in the movie.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 March 2021,8/10,"I haven't written a review in awhile, but felt compelled to do so because numerous reviews complaining about the movie as some sort of failed Fred Hampton biopic...
The movie is titled JUDAS and the Black Messiah, in which we should all be able to discern who's whom, and understand why the movie isn't just about Fred Hampton, so all of you with your fake woke-ness can stop talking about how shallow this movie is or how they didn't do enough, and then counterintuitively discredit this accomplishment of a film about an important part of the U.S. history!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,18 March 2021,10/10,"All these reviewers saying Could/Should/Would have, seriously!?
The movie is on a short timeline basis and relates the infiltration, betrayal, and involvement of Bill O'Neal manipulated by the FBI in the events that lead to the assassination of Fred Hampton. The title will single-handedly disproof most bad reviews.
J & BM delivers on many levels, and yes nothing is perfect and doesn't look like they are trying to be ether.
Congratulations to all involved, I enjoyed it very much.Acting *****
Score *****
Cinematography *****

Editing ****After this they can do a sequel, that can go more in-depth on Fred Hampton's history ""The Rise of The Black Messiah"".
Also, the cover-up the Police and FBI made after his assassination, HOW AMAZING that would be!!!?"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,9 April 2021,1/10,"""Man, everybody is always talking about going back in time and killing Hitler but I'm like what if I meet him and freaking get lost in the magic of his eyes? "" - Norm MacDonald.This movie is that joke stretched to a meaningless extent. Almost parodic."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,5 April 2021,8/10,"As a non African American viewer, but a South African viewer, with no prior knowledge at all of Fred Hampton or any of the assassinations conducted by the FBI during the fight for civil rights, I did walk into watching this film with the mindset of it being a freedom fighter being betrayed story. Purely based on that it definitely delivered for me!Away from the subject matter what is really done well is authenticity of the setting and characters. Everyone and everything felt real and removed from the glitz and glamour of romanticising revolutionaries and the struggle for freedom. It's ofcourse easy to compare this to the Trail of the Chicago 7 which is great but the tone they went for in that movie does come across as artificial which worked for it but this film tried much harder to genuinely protray what these people must have been like and how they acted.Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton is a massive highlight! So likeable and moving that even though you know his end it still kills you inside when happens. He ignited the little freedom fighter in me every time he spoke.Felt a stronger connection to Lakeith's Wild Bill however because again that's a genuine person alot of us could all have been in a second. I see there is a lot of people commenting that his motivation is thin and weak. If you want a biopic about an FBI informant who betrays his comrades what are you expecting? Some overally dramatised nonsense of his family being killed in a black panther shoot out? No, our boy Bill had no interest in being a freedom fighter, did something wrong and got wrapped up in the wonderfully corrupted system we are all in and did what he had to to keep being alive and out of jail. How is that motivation hard to believe? Next time there's a protest in your area and you choose not to go because that's not your scene, think then if you would not be like Bill. He is the true victim of the system here and that's only made stronger when you learn of how his story ends in the final credit roll.And again I personally think it was great to structure the story from his perspective because it is far more universal. I like movies where the protagonist is our vessel into a complicated world and Bill is perfect at doing this here. A story from Fred's perspective would have been far too one sided and preachy. As least through Bill's eyes it makes you question what you would have done in that situation. I know a lot of my peers and the younger generations are fighting for rights and that's incredible and more power to you, but for someone who has not been in positions to do that it really makes you introspect and question why you aren't doing more to fight back against oppression. I know that's what I am walking away with from this movie and I'm sure this will be how a lot of the audience will also feel.Overall fantastic, always great to hear stories of people with the courage to fight back against the machine. More films like these need to be made (here's looking at you South African Filmmakers)"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 February 2021,,"REVOLUTIONARYYYY!!!!!
YOU ARE A REVOLUTIONARYYYY!!!!!!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,Wonderful movie. Will take me family to view it as well. Daniel and Lakeith AGAIN with the amazing acting. Any bad reviews you see are mainly coming from YT people.. nothing new there lol
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,3 April 2021,7/10,"FINALLY, a historical drama with some real personality in the script. JBM is a 2020 film about the murder of Chicago Black Panther Chairman Fred Hampton and the black FBI informant that aided in it. Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield both brought so much vigor and vulnerability to these roles. The script honestly demanded it of them through all of the jumps and twists it takes as the story progresses. I love the string-filled, off-kilter, Get Out style score as well. Really enjoyed this one."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 February 2021,6/10,"Enjoyed the film and not knowing much about the subject it was quite informative and made me delve deeper into the history of the subject.
However, I have a major problem with it. A lot of the dialogue is unintelligible. I know this is authentic but it spoiled it for me as I missed lots of what they are talking about.
It reminded me of the 'jive talking' court scene in Airplane."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,9/10,"This movie is definitely going on the re-watch list
The title accurately describes the relationship between ""William O'Neal"" and ""Fred Hampton"" for a brief period in the 60's before O'Neal assisted the FBI in killing Hampton.It begs the question ""does the time/moment make the man or is it vice versa""? The probability at the time based on the events happening in the United States with race relations and Edgard Hover (then FBI director) doing everything in his power to orchestrate the deaths of black activist, naturally gave rise to a Messiah ""Hampton"" and a Judas ""O'Neal"" who would betray him.Both Daniel Kaluuya (playing Hampton) and Lakeith Stanfield (playing O'Neal) do a fantastic work embodying their characters and re-enacting them to life. Very much like the carpenter from 2000 years ago 1/3 the world still worships, Fred Hampton was indeed a Messiah that pointed out the hypocrisy in the American system and preached sermons that empowered and brought unlikely factions of people together. He frequently said ""power anywhere there's people"", a wise timeless insight."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,9/10,"One of the best movie in recent times, based on the dark chapter of FBI and pointed out many controversial side of Black Panther too. I wouldn't go into the specificities, you should be the judge of what you see.Captivating acting from both of the lead actors Lakeith and Daniel has woven the film eloquently and the depth of the story will give a holistic history lesson.One of the best movie premised on black history till to this date. It deserves accolades, popularity no matter how would you view the original story."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,8/10,"Nice work Daniel. Good movie. I feel some ideas are misleading; enlightenment could be achieved without pointing fingers. Nevertheless, it is something to watch. Ok acting across the cast."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 February 2021,5/10,"Disappointed in this film. Too slow and therefore, boring. Don't understand all the hoopla. I guess it's the times."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,,"I had no idea any of this actually happened, so it's great that a film was made about this. This is a powerful film that I would highly recommend."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 March 2021,10/10,Daniel Kaluuya is just phenomenal. Such a powerful performance. Was really looking forward to this and it did not disappoint. All the acting was brilliant. I hope this film gets all the recognition it deserves.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,A MUST SEE movie!! An incredible account of Fred Hampton and the events surrounding his life and the horrid betrayal he suffered.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,6/10,"Acting prowess aside, this IS a historical movie. Fred Hampton did not speak with an African accent. It's is just wayyyy too noticeable and a bit annoying."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,9/10,"Ive been waiting for this film for a while and man, I have to say I was not disappointed at all. The performances are phenomenal, especially from Daniel Kaluuya. I challenge you to look up a clip of Fred Hampton, watch the film, and then spot out a moment where Kaluuya's demeanor, mannerisms and voice weren't akin to Hamptons. Lakeith Stanfield is also really great. While I understand Daniel Kaluuya's Fred Hampton is the central character of the film, Stansfield's performance and character William O'Neal, helps drive the movie. He convincingly plays a man who's drowned in the cynicism of being black during the 1960's. In addition to the performances, the entire film is crafted extremely well from the costume design and music to the cinematography. Especially as the film concludes, there are scenes directed and shot so well, they will stick with viewers long after watching.I really had to force myself to think of something negative here. One thing I wish however, is that certain female characters were written with a little more depth. For example, Dominique Fishback is stellar as Hamptons significant other, but I feel like she could have been utilized a bit more. Some may also have a problem with the story focusing on O'Neal just as much as Hampton. I also felt some of the prosthetics, particularly in the case of J Edgar Hoover were a little distracting as well.Overall, its rare in which almost every aspect of a film is remarkable, and this is exactly that. I see many Oscar nominations in its future with Stanfield getting a best supporting actor nod. As for Kaluuya, there is no doubt in my mind he will win Best Actor. Aside from what the film achieves technically, it offers an inside look into one of the most misconstrued political movements of our time. It's as informative as it is emotional. Regardless how hard aspects of it may be to watch, I encourage you to do so."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 April 2021,6/10,"LaKeith Stanfield knocked his roll out of the park. Phenomenal job, but I honestly have yet to see him act in anything that he didn't bring 100 percent. Massive kudos to him. There was some good acting in this movie, but I have to say, this wasn't Daniel Kuuya's best work. He really struggled with the accent and it was obvious throughout. Because the director decided to make Fred's accent a focal point of this movie, it had to be spot on...and it was far from that. Because Daniel struggled so to maintain Fred's distinct accent, it became a massive distraction. At times I struggled to understand him. The subject matter is so important. The story itself was good, but could have been better if there had been a bit more condensing of certain scenes. It tended to drag on a bit. It really did have the makings of being an amazing film, but it just fell flat a bit. Still worth a watch for sure though."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,10/10,"This is not a Fred Hampton biopic. I don't know what gave y'all that impression. This is a movie (not a documentary) about a moment or cross-section of two peoples lives and the unfortunate outcome. Nothing more. If you came into this flick looking for or expecting more beyond that, then that's your mistake not the filmmaker's. This is a good movie. Period."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 May 2021,9/10,"For someone from the UK the background of this story was off our radar.As a film it was superbly acted, a script that was engaging and a well matched soundtrack.I was not expecting a Fred Hampton bio but felt I was given enough of an insight to learn more. For me the basis of the film was the mixed allegiances of William O'Neal, his relationship with Frampton and the FBI.Having now watched the full length actual TV interview with O'Neal it makes me truly appreciate the acting of LaKeith Stanfield who captures this character brilliantly.Any film that I can enjoy, makes me think and ultimately gets me to find out more will always get a thumbs up."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,10/10,This is a very well made film. Well written and phenomenal acting. This depicts a part of history that isn't talked about in schools and people should really know what happened with Fred Hampton. It inspired me to do some more research so I can be more informed.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,10/10,This heartbreaking story blew me away.Watch this if you can.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,19 May 2021,9/10,"This is that film where we say: ""wow, everything here is good"", the smallest details of Stanfield's performance in the final minutes is a show, Kaluuya doesn't even speak, he incorporated a real leader, these are the performances I want , that you don't remember who are actors at that timeApart from the technical perfection of the work, the ending showing real scenes, it has a documentary air that disfigures the work, the film had already passed its message in an excellent way, it didn't need thatI don't want to advance in spoilers, draw your conclusions watching the movie, but the experience was great, I really got into the story!Clasp Judas and the black messiah with note 9."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 May 2021,10/10,"A 98% true account of historical events, with perfect plot, performance, and music. Best viewed after Chicago Trial of Seven, to appreciate the political and social background of this heroic story. Salute to Fred Hampton, Bobby Seale and the other heroes in the great struggle for racial justice."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 June 2021,9/10,Really compelling story that speaks to broader social issues. I definitely recommend to everyone!
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,19 February 2021,8/10,"Nicely done!
This movie got me watching old speeches on YouTube."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 March 2021,9/10,This movie gives a glimpse into how law enforcement would openly operate with impunity. Fantastic acting all round.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,25 February 2021,9/10,The film is a good insight to understanding and knowing about why black people have had it hard without this film I would of never knew about this has am from the UK and a white male but my new found love for god has brought me to this film and to see what hurt colour of different races has been subjected to the only one Criticism i have is the 🎤 needed to be a lot closer to main actor Daniel my volume was on double to normal just found it hard to hear n understand him has reason not for a full 10 stars
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,28 May 2021,10/10,"Daniel Kaluuya put on a great performance as usual, the cinematography in this movie is amazing, the educating aspect of displaying the past is amazing, and this should definitely be a ""Top 10 Black Movie"" it displays the struggle the battles and the depressing outcomes of the characters. This movie only received low reviews by people who are uneducated, politically biased, emotionally charged, full of hatred, and people who sadly, use racial slurs quite often. If you love history, have an open mind, and don't have a biased. Twisted, delusional, version of reality and how things happened, then I 100% recommend this movie."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,10/10,"The Acting is perfect and the cast makes the movie more powerful, i have nothing bad to say about this film i really enjoyed it!!!"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 February 2021,9/10,"Excellent acting, along with a compelling story makes for a great film. Worth a watch"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,"Superb acting. Entertaining, yet sobering. Traumatic, yet motivational.It tells the *truth*."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,10/10,"This movie left me in tears. With its powerful storytelling and synchronicity with the actual events that took place, Judas and the Black Messiah was informative and beautifully captured the raw emotion of these people. This is my first time learning about this event in history, and I am completely moved and yearning to learn more."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,6/10,"It was a good movie but it did come off like the Black Panthers were all about cop killing which is a huge disservice to them. Also, I needed subtitles to understand Daniel Kaluuya. Wish Judy Harmon got more props for being such a badass and the only one who ever suspected Bill at all. It was an okay film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 March 2021,1/10,"I was so excited to watch this film. Cast looked good, soundtrack was amazing.Civil rights in America has been a big interest of mine for a long time.This is the most most boring film of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!There is no story at all!! Not even any idea about the events that are meant to be taking place.The whole film was just a absolute mess from start to finish!!!Would give it 0 stars but for the soundtrack."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 April 2021,7/10,"This was a good movie, best I seen in ever a long time. I could BARELY understand anything the actors said but I'm still gonna kick this beast down a 7 because I suspect they truly meant whatever they said. Actually now that I think about it, Grace slick, who could actually really sing, once said that she doesn't think she can sing but she means what she said. So yeah, this movie is like that, yeah.I loved all the ice cream flavors and candy and everything. It was awesome. This movie is not to be missed unless you're on a desert island and you have a choice between this movie and, say, the Poseidon adventure. In which case, you're probably going to relate more to the Poseidon adventure. Because in the end, nothing really matters."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 May 2021,9/10,"The Judas and the Black Messiah is a powerful, right hook to the brain of a drama. During a backdrop of 1960s America, reminding the viewer that little progress has been made regarding equality.Directed by Shaka King, in his first major film it retells the story of Bill O'Neal who after being caught in a stolen car became an informant for J Edgar Hoovers FBI, tasked with infiltrating Chicago's Blank Panther Chapter. O'Neal soons rises through the ranks whilst getting close with the Chairman of the Chapter Fred Hampton. The film follows Bill's journey from being stopped by the police to the dramatic, and climatic conclusion of his time spent informing. During Freds life, he formed the Rainbow Coalition in which his Black Panthers were joined by other groups such as the Young Lords (Hispanic), Young Patriots (Whites) and brought an alliance between street gangs to work toward social change.Daniel Kaluuya as Fred ofcourse steals the show with his engaging and gripping performance as Fred Hampton well deserving of his critical acclaim (& Oscar). I really got the feeling Daniel believed in what Fred stood for which reflected in his acting. LaKeith Stanfield as ""Wild"" Bill O'Neal is good, but perhaps overshadowed by Daniels Fred. Jesse Plemons as Roy, in another supporting role, is fairly wooden, aside from a scene opposite an unrecognisable Martin Sheen as J Edgar Hoover. Dominque Fishbacks performance as Deborah is a hidden gem, as she plays the role with such conviction and emotion.At the time, Fred and the Black Panthers were viewed as radical threats that could be the start of a revolution which could cause radical change in the US (Is Equality really radical??) The issues around racial equality and social mobility are clear, which the director I feel captures best during the scenes where Bill is being wined and dined by the FBI then he cuts back to the dimly lit, dank Black Panthers headquarters.The film is unique in the sense it takes the tried and tested undercover informant doing good for Uncle Sam and turns it on its head. In this Uncle Sam is the Uncle you don't want over for Christmas, exploiting the vulnerability and greediness of Bill to do its evil bidding by becoming an informant. The stark differences between Fred and Bill really come forefront towards the end of the film, one selfless with the cause first and foremost, the other selfish with the cause being a way to make a quick FBI dollar. Fred is dynamic, popular and articulate, Bill is awkward, slimy and generally scummy. Throughout, little is made about Bill's history before his arrest, his family or friends which paints him as a loner, with his actions during the film firming his position. When he has to make a decision, it's always the one to line his pocket rather than to benefit those around him.What I really enjoyed about this film is that it could have been told from at least three different perspectives. ""Wild"" Bill's story was selected, however I'd have been happy to sit and watch three hours of Fred, the exploration of the wonderfully played Deborah (Dominque Fishback). These three as well as Jesse Plemons ""Roy"" are brought together in a room during one of Fred's engaging speeches, with the excellent camera work collecting all of their different and contrasting emotions. The climatic ending to the film is really helped by the choice of not including any music - only the echoey boots on wooden floorboards and the blast of gun fire.If the authorities did not fear equality, I do wonder how many more great things Fred Hampton would have contributed. It begs the moral question of where is the line between an informant and being exploited? Unfortunately many of the themes this film explores are still prevalent today which indicates reform is not sufficient, revolution anyone?"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,24 April 2021,4/10,Trying to keep up with what the characters (especially Daniel Kaluuya) were saying ruined this film for me.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 July 2021,10/10,"( Contains spoilers). An ethical dilemma is a conflict between two wrongs, or in this case two rights. Bill O'Neal, a young Man already out of good options, resorting to stealing to survive, comes in contact with the White Supremist FBI of the time. He is forced to chose between his own survival and betraying the Black Panthers. The question is framed as the choice between jail for crimes committed or spying, but make no mistake, his life hung in the balance. The FBI could not afford to have people spreading the story they had been asked to infiltrate the Panthers by the FBI and said no. As a matter of fact, have you ever heard of someone who said no to spying for the government and lived to tell the story. Bill chose his own life but was forever haunted until he committed suicide. This film does a masterful job of showing that O'Neal's fate was sealed when the FBI got the idea they could use him as a weapon against the rise of self-efficacy in Black communities."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 March 2021,10/10,"From, especially, Daniel Kaluuya. So much devotion, work and energy in creating and acting the character that i had goose bumps every scene he was in. Hope he will get some great awards for his work."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,5/10,"This film could have been much better. Instead of focusing on what made Fred Hampton such a powerful person - his politics, his words, his analysis - we are forced to sit through a bunch of cop-shoutouts and a fairly shallow version of an informant - FBI relationship story that we've seen done better in plenty of other movies.As for the character of Bill Oneil, who unfortunately becomes the main character of the film, we have no insight into his ideology or his motivations, only that he wants money. The most interesting thing we learn about him is the real footage of the documentary that features at the end - which makes me wonder why I'm not watching a documentary instead. Throughout the film there's nothing about him that makes it believable that he'd be liked, trusted and even integrated as an important person in the Panthers and as a close friend of Fred Hampton's.Overall, pretty lame"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 June 2021,8/10,"Judas and Black Messiah is the story of two men. One is a revolutionary seeking to create a movement to challenge racism and injustice, the other is an informant who infiltrates the movement of behalf of the FBI.Daniel Kaluuya plays Fred Hampton, the Chairman of the Black Panthers in Illinois. He wants to lead a revolution. Kaluuya is on blistering form, his speeches burn with righteous fervour. Kaluuya proves that Get Out was no fluke, he is a magnetic screen presence as Hampton especially when he is at the podium. His Best Supporting Oscar is richly deserved.LaKeith Stanfield has more the subtler role. He is William O'Neal, a petty criminal who is turned into an informant. He is a man tormented by what he has to do, but is conscious of the fact that his own liberty is at stake. You can see the mental anguish of a man who being asked to betray a man he clearly admires and whose cause he is sympathetic too. The closer he gets to Hampton, and sees the work that he is doing with breakfast for children and free clinics, his conscience must have taken a battering.Special mention to Dominique Fishback as Hampton's girlfriend Deborah Johnson. She sees the softer side of Hampton as he reveals the man behind the public persona.We get a few glimpses of the machinations within the FBI. Jesse Plemons as O'Neal's FBI handler Roy Mitchell, is all smiles and friendliness, but just under the surface lurks a ruthless persona that will exploit O'Neal to suit his mission. Martin Sheen is evil personified as FBI director J Edgar Hoover. He will stop at nothing to destroy the civil rights movement and Hampton in particular. In a telling scene, Hoover asks Mitchell what he would do if his daughter came home with a black man. He knows just how easy it is to appeal to Mitchell's bigotry. Society will collapse unless the Black Panthers are stopped. Hoover paints a chilling picture for Mitchell to ensure that he is on the same page.The FBI had an extensive counter intelligence programme designed to sow division within the Black Panthers even while they sought to repress it from the outside.This is a film well worth watching if you are fascinated by the civil rights struggle especially in the 1970s."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,16 March 2021,10/10,"As someone who has a degree in history and a specific interest in the Black Panther Party, this movie is outstanding and very historically accurate. The actors, directors, writers, and everyone who worked on it brought us a gift. Those who gave this movie a low rating fail to understand what is being discussed in this movie and fail to realize how beautiful it is."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,"Chairman Fred Hampton's story will be globally known from this biopic. This is the energy we need in the world right now across every racial line. This creative and artistic Tori de force sets the standard for what we needed in the past, present and future for joint humanistic empowerment. Power to the people ✊🏾Thank you to all involved in every level of this film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 February 2021,1/10,This film might be excellent. I wouldn't know because I can't watch it without audio description and HBO and the filmmakers are too lazy and/or cheap to include description.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,5/10,"Great acting, but not enough happened considering it's on for over two hours."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 March 2021,9/10,"I really enjoyed this movie! It was really well done and pretty well researched. I chose to read up more on the subject after finishing the movie and read about how Will O'Neal was 17 years old at the time of the events in the film. It truly changed my opinion on O'Neal as an antagonist realizing he wasn't 30, as the actor appears. I really enjoyed the cast but my only wish for this movie is that it was cast age appropriately."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,7/10,The acting was good everything else was good in this movie i enjoyed watching it and i would strongly recommend it
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 February 2021,5/10,Deeply disappointed in this movie which did little more than present the BPP as armed thugs. Where was the politics that underpins the BPP? You can learn more about Fred Hampton and the BPP on YouTube. #BLM
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,6/10,"Excellent acting but pretty boring story at times.
A couple of unnecessary scenes and a few cringeworthy moments. But great soundtrack definitely recommend checking it out on Spotify with songs from artists like A$AP Rocky , Saba and Jay Z to name a few. Wouldn't really recommend the movie if you're looking for an exciting story"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,7/10,This movies only drawback is its vanilla cinematography
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,One Of The Best Movies Out There That You Can See In 2021 For Sure 10/10.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 February 2021,10/10,"Such and amazing movie , our greatness is truly hated.."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 February 2021,10/10,Great movie!! Love the whole guideline and how powerful it show the Black Panther Revolutionary.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,I loved this movie. It shows how important it is to educate people that racism is a serious topic. I would recommend this to anyone. Really good casting and the music was great
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,"Giving this a 10 to balance out the ignorant who gave this movie a low review... this isnt, cough, the type of movie for some people, if this movie doesnt personally resonate within you, then that probably you...I AM A REVOLUTIONARY !"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,8 March 2021,10/10,When I first saw the title of the movie I thought I wasn't gonna like it. Then I watched it and I was like this movie is so good and it's all about history and the panthers all the people did a wonderful job playing their roles.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 March 2021,9/10,"Enlightening story and empowering. Most of all, Daniel Kaluuya portrayed the role of Fred Hampton so beautifully."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,27 February 2021,6/10,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. From a cinematic standpoint, it was everything you'd expect it to be. Emotionally moving, beautifully shot, enticing, dramatic, etc. However, from a historical standpoint and point-of-view, it was a bit disappointing to see the way this movie went. Instead of learning about the history of Fred Hampton and who he was, I feel like we're experiencing more of the dramatized perspective of William O'Neal. The movie being shown from his perspective almost feels like it's victimizing him. Based on his actions and who he was, it's almost insulting to make a movie through his story rather than through Fred's. After recently learning more and more about the stories of the Black Panther Party and of Chairman Fred, I feel like this movie doesn't truly capture who both of them were and the impact that they both had. Nonetheless, it was a good movie. I enjoyed it, however, I just wished it cared more about the truth than what may sell."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,20 July 2021,1/10,"We all know it but are afraid to say it, the film is only given all the attention because of the color of the actors and the recent events such as the blm movement. In reality the films is pure garbage, don't waste your time."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,11 April 2021,10/10,A piece of political history. The entertainment is secondary to the content. Whenever the poor challenge the status quo murder is always a sanction of choice for the powerful.Democracy is s sham they kill our hero's but they can never kill the message. One day their will be a global rainbow coalition Fred will be vindicated.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 May 2021,4/10,"Maybe it was our cinema, but the dialogue was often hard to hear and follow. Made for a frustrating experience."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,10 May 2021,5/10,Saddened by the cast. What does a britisher know about the black man's struggle in America. The movie is average. Nothing new. I guess all the hype is because the black movement is currently hot.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,13 July 2021,,"It's one of the best movies this year, it's an eye opener and the actor that played the black messiah needs an Oscar."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,26 July 2021,8/10,"If you are looking for a documentary, or biopic on Fred Hampton, you may be disappointed. HOWEVER if you are searching for an insightful, historical drama. A well-written one at that, filled with gripping, dynamic performances. This film is worth two hours of your time.It's no surprise that Kaluuya took home the Academy Award for ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role"" - He was utterly brilliant.. the intensity he brought to the screen was captivating and moving, especially during his ""speech"" scenes. On the other hand, it's easy to see why LaKeith Stanfield was also nominated for the same award.Beautiful script. Engaging screenplay. But if you love superb acting, I highly recommend this film."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,2 December 2021,8/10,"Forces of revolution and oppression collide and entangle in Shaka King's blistering ""Judas and the Black Messiah,"" a potent and vividly acted drama about the FBI's subversion and assassination of Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton.King's film, which he wrote with Will Berson, plunges into the dark chapter in American history when J. Edgar Hoover's FBI used surveillance, infiltration and worse to check the ascent of Black movements both peaceful (as in the case of Martin Luther King Jr., chronicled recently in Sam Pollard's ""MLK/FBI"" documentary) and more militant."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,21 February 2021,5/10,"Good acting, good design, good costume. Sadly all of this was let down with the lack of story of lack of. Found this very boring and slow. Struggled not to turn it off"
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,7 May 2021,10/10,"-Loved the message and themes, and writer; but there was a writer-director disconnect first off
-Pacing not good right off the bat with the slow car scene on lakeith and poor paving throughout
-No clear motivations (embodied or internalized in the psyche of the acting) behind the characters
-Best performances were the black messiah's wife and the woman in the kitchen dinner table whos son died
-Lakeith garnered sympathy and pathos but his motivations and the outcomes werent clear much of the time, often actually shocking (and not in a good way), shocking as in his acting didnt make sense like the c4 in the trunk scene and then the motivation revealed that followed - its like uh the acting was inconsistent.film felt choppy and porous; sequences had narrative gaps and character development gapsFred came off as forced and contrived; his convictions in the actor didn't run deep enough and he was barely audible to listen to - reminds me of the way he is in interviews. Two key characters on the shootdown between the cops and panthers (woman and man) were taken into custody and never seen again; lots of loose ends overall in character development. Didn't get a good understanding of a collective vision or empowerment holistically internalized in all members of the bp; lot of weak points in the interpersonal building between characters. Good messages and moments, overall good writing. Some cringey directing/acting such as the actor who said ""looks like hes still alive"" the delivery and execution didnt fit the tone of the movie. Speaking of tone, the movie didnt have a consistent tone nor a natural organic multitude of tones shifting. Great costumes, art direction, and cinematography. Much of this film lacked nuance, the depth of vulnerability in the collective struggle/the energy and depth of conviction throughout to pull the weight of what was being told - the writer (which i know they were several, but I have an inkling the dissonance between the multiple writers and directors became problematic) definitely should have directed this one or the other way around; whoever has the clearest most uniform vision."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,15 March 2021,2/10,It had to be the most boring movie I have seen in the last 5 years.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,12 February 2021,10/10,"That's it. that's the review.
This film has riveting imagery and gives the facts as told by Fred Hampton's own son. The acting is phenomenal. A paintbrush on the canvas of shedding light to true black history."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,8/10,Raise a fist for all victims of oppression.Riveting performances all across the board. A story that sits with you long after you're done experiencing it onscreen.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,14 February 2021,10/10,"Very very educational and in-depth the true co-intel program, and shows how most people have the same thing in common regardless of color and can be completely understandable and unite."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,6 March 2021,6/10,"Daniel's accent in the movie sounded like a bad deep south imitation of Martin Luther King. It didn't appear that he really got into the character, but wanted a paycheck and extra recognition. The characterizations were shallow at best. I don't expect a blockbuster just because the movie portrays important events or lives in black American culture. This one is okay, but not well developed in storyline or character portrayal. A little more time spent getting into the characters would have produced more engaging and compelling performances."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,3 March 2021,2/10,Same old nonsense biography. This is so wrong. Can't they make more fresh movies.
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,22 February 2021,10/10,"The best bit of the film is the part where modern mainstream America pretends that at some point between Fred Hampton's assassination and today the FBI just stopped doing evil things. Why is it the mainstream consensus is that secretive government agencies have only ever done evil things in the past, no matter what point in time we happen to be in? In a few years there will be revelations about profoundly evil things that were done now by the CIA, FBI and Pentagon. People will express shock and outrage and yet still believe on no basis whatsoever that those agencies have since stopped doing such evil things. If you want change get angry at what is happening now. Punch up not down."
JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH,1 March 2021,9/10,"Moving drama about the struggles faced by the black communities in the 1970s, really gives you perspective of what it was like then, inspired by true events brings an element of connection to reality"
